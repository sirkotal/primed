                    "//What is it?//Headache and migraine are different entities. Migraine is one of the most common and well characterized, but there are 14 broad categories that can be subdivided into more than 200 different forms. Migraine itself has about 20 different genres. In general, headaches are divided into two large groups: primary and secondary. Primary illnesses correspond to a disease, not reflecting other health problems and represent around 90% of the total. Secondary symptoms are symptoms of diseases of the nervous system or other organs of the human body. They can occur in cases of flu, alcohol poisoning or withdrawal, minor head trauma, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels) or a high blood pressure crisis. Migraine is a primary headache in which very intense episodes of pain occur interspersed with periods without symptoms. In general, it begins between the ages of 15 and 40, but it can appear in childhood or shortly after the first menstruation. If it appears for the first time after the age of 45, other causes must be excluded. Some of its characteristics are closely associated with the female reproductive cycle: higher prevalence after the first menstruation or during the menstrual period; occasional worsening due to taking birth control pills or hormone therapy; attenuation or disappearance during pregnancy or menopause. Before adolescence, migraines affect boys and girls equally. From then on, it is two to three times more common in females. It is estimated that 8% to 15% of individuals living in Western countries (including Portugal) suffer from this problem. The fact of reaching people in the productive phase implies large economic, social and family costs.//Symptoms//It appears recurrently, several times throughout life, but always with completely free intervals. If it occurs every day, it is probably overuse of painkillers or other medications. Drug abuse can convert a migraine into a chronic daily headache. There are people who preferably appear on the weekend. These crises can be precipitated by changes in sleep schedule, failure to eat breakfast, reduced stress or alcohol abuse. In these cases, it is important to consider a lifestyle change over the weekend. The symptoms are intense and often prevent work or study. The pain tends to be throbbing, worsening with physical exertion or head movements. In general, it affects only one side of the head, and is accompanied by nausea, vomiting, intolerance to light, noise and some smells. It is not mandatory that all of these elements are present simultaneously. And they can occur twice a week or just a few throughout a lifetime. During attacks, people seek a dark, quiet place to rest or fall asleep. An episode can last from a few hours to three days. Between attacks, there are usually no complaints. Some types of migraines may have more complex symptoms (with aura). These forms are less common, affecting around 15% of people with this problem, and include transient neurological symptoms, originating attributable to certain areas of the brain. The other signs are identical to those of migraine without aura. The most common auras are temporary vision disorders, in the form of loss of vision on one side of the visual field, blurred images, perception of bright points, geometric figures or bright zigzags. Other auras can be translated as tingling or numbness on one side of the face or one of the hands. There are people who have difficulty speaking or even temporary paralysis of their limbs, usually only on one side of the body. These changes last about 10 to 30 minutes and precede the pain. In children, migraines tend to be bilateral, less intense and of shorter duration. Vomiting and dark circles can be exuberant. Disturbances in sleep and meal schedules are common precipitating factors. Treating these crises is easier than in adults. Sleep usually gives good results. At these ages, the occipital location is not normal and, when present, requires a medical consultation. Likewise, the presence of headaches with morning vomiting or other unusual symptoms in very young children should be seen by a healthcare professional.//Causes//It is caused by a combination of brain processes: excitation/depression of cells, dilation of arteries and release of chemicals. People with migraine are more sensitive to certain stimuli, environmental or from their own body, that can trigger these brain processes. It is also thought that there is some genetic susceptibility. Some individuals can identify the signs of their attacks. The most common are cheese, chocolate, strawberries, seafood, wine, artificial sauces, changes in sleep patterns, stress, menstruation, fasting, physical exercise, and minor trauma. Others cannot identify them at all. People who drink coffee regularly may experience headaches when they stop this habit.//Diagnosis//The key to diagnosis lies in the clinical history, physical and neurological examination. Observation of the fundus is a very important part of these procedures. In some cases, it may be necessary to resort to computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to exclude other diseases.//Treatment//Migraines have no cure but can be controlled. There are medications and behaviors that can reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks. Symptomatic treatment, during acute periods, involves resting in a quiet, dark place. Pressure or cold can be applied to the area of \u200b\u200bpain. At this stage, analgesics, anti-inflammatories, antiemetics and triptans are very useful.//Prevention//People with migraines should create calendars that allow them to identify their symptoms and assess their impact on their quality of life. The first step in prevention is to identify and eliminate precipitating factors, whenever possible. In some cases, it is necessary to use daily medication to reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks, but there are no drugs specifically developed for their prevention. However, there are some drugs used in other contexts that have proven to be effective, such as beta-blockers, antidepressants or antiepileptics, and these should always be prescribed by a doctor.

                    "I have been on this medication almost two weeks, started out on 25mg and working my way up to 100mg, currently at 50mg. No headaches at all so far and I was having 2-3 crippling migraines a week. I have lost 5.2lbs so far but note I am really paying close attention to what I am eating, I have a lot of weight to lose and if weight loss is a side effect I want to help it along as much as I can. Now, other side effects, they are there the word recall issues exist, the memory issues, the worst of it seems to be the vision disturbances, there have been times I have just not driven because I'm sure it would not have been safe. The good news is it seems to be wearing off...I have tons of energy and I am in a great mood.",
                    "I didn't like Topamax. I became very paranoid, anxious and since I have been off of it I still have mild side effects from it. Not a good experience. Glad it works for some.",
                    "I have been taking 75mg topamax one a day for about 10 years now. I have gone as far as taking 100mg until I started not being able to get the words out that I was thinking of. That side effect has not completely gone away but is better. When I first started I did have the tingling in my hands and feet but it was no more than like having carpal tunnel, I also have the weird taste where soda tasted flat and tomatos tastes weird. I did loose a little weight. The tingeling went away, I adjusted to just not drinking soda. And tomatos started to taste fine. I also take Sumatriptan for when I still do get a headache. However the headaches are much fewer and further beteeen. I will get a cluster of them about every six mths but still better.",
                    "Topamax is amazing. I originally took it 6 years ago to prevent migraines and lost 80 lbs as a bonus. At that time my doctor and I speculated that it would some day be approved for weight loss because I was not his only patient to report changes in the taste of carbonated beverages and chocolate while taking the medication. I also noticed that I did not dream about food while taking the medication, but within 3 months of changing medications food reentered my dream content. I am now back on the medication to address chronic pain issues and have already found the same results in weight loss, taste changes, and dream content.",
                    "Definitely takes away my hunger.",
                    "I like this medicine. I don't have many of the other problems that others have had. I was on Dilantin for years and was up to 1000MG per day until my body had gotten used to it and was still giving me grand maul seizures. My Neurologist after trying many other medicines (a certain combination he gave just made me stumble around like I was a drunk and made the police in my area look like a bunch of monkeys after I had a blood alcohol level of 0.0. Anyway I still have bright flashes and small dark spots and little halo's but not full blown grand mals. Just remember to drink lots of Water.",
                    "I am currently taking it for intense migranes. It is the only thing that I have found that has helped. I do have breakthrough migraines but the medication does keep the majority of them at bay. I do get many of the side effects. I get the tingling in the hands and feet. I occasionally get tingling on my tongue and a weird burning/taste when I drink soda. I get a slight dizziness when I first take it. I am more sensitive to cold and I get diarrhea. All of these side effects I can either live with or treat and are worth the freedom of the migraines. If you live with migraines everyday your willing to put up with a lot of side effects just to be pain free for a while. This medication is totally worth it.",
                    "Been on Topamax for 3 months I have recently gone up on the dose to 75 mg at bedtime. I've been all right dealing with the tingling. I have quit smoking and drinking which is great. I started working out alot since I've been so anxious. Possible side effect? The worst for me is the sleep issues and the mood swings. Since the dose went up I am having terrible night sweats and am waking up all night long. I'm exhausted all day with little to no motivation. My mood swings quickly and dramatically from happy to annoyed. Just trying to wait it out. I'm still having headaches everyday. Just not migraines.",
                    "I've been taking this drug since the end of Sept 2014. On 100mg per day, taken 25mg 4 times a day as I find them so strong. They've been working really well up until about a month ago, but the migraines have returned, so wondering whether I need to increase the dose or to request to try botox - anyone tried this for migraine treatment? Side effects-these have been tough and ongoing. Pins and needles in hands&feet, severe nausea, dizziness, memory loss, lack of concentration, reduced heart rate (normal 70 bpm to 48 - I'm a 35 year old female), find it hard to sleep. Have lost 2.5 stone so far, have real trouble eating as feel so sick-dietician scored me with a high risk of malnutrition. Concerned about the damage this drug is doing.",
                    "I have been migraine free for 6 months (previously I had 3-4 migraines per month). I also lost 25lbs and look great.",

It did stop the cluster headaches, but Extreme confusion, serious loss of hearing, forgetfulness, couldn't remember my phone number! My wife wouldn't let me drive at 400mg, I was dangerous, parking became very difficult, once I had to get out of the car and let her park. Frustrating and humiliating. In the end, I was down to 50mg a day, Doc said that wasn't causing any side effects at that low dose. WRONG! When I finally stopped, it took a couple of weeks to become me again. I was shocked at the difference it made being off of it. Some of my hearing came back thankfully. I did lose 30 pounds that did not come back.",

I have not lost any weight as of yet. I hope that comes soon. I do notice that I am more thirsty and not as hungry. I try to eat at least three times a day so that I don't \"binge\". I have noticed that I am more constipated than normal even with drinking more water. I hope to see weight loss soon. I have been \"obese\" for some time and very unhappy with myself. This puts a huge wedge into my married life. I also would love to loose weight to take the pressure off my knee, my back, and to reduce my asthma some. I hope this medicine is the key to a new life for me.",
                    "I started out slowly at 25mg. on Topiramate for migraine prevention since I was getting 2-4 a week. The morning after I took my first dose my diet coke tasted flat, and I opened 3 other cans thinking there must be something wrong with the case of soda I bought, refusing to believe that the side effect of making carbonated drinks taste flat could start after just one dose, but it did. Within 72 hours I began having eye pressure and weird eye pain, I was concerned and saw an ophthalmologist, one of the adverse effects of the med. is glaucoma, but everything was fine. When I increased to 50 mg./day I was so THIRSTY all the time. At 150mg. Migraines were decreased, but I was cognitively impaired with hair loss. Lost 8 lbs. after starting 150 mg",
                    "This medication worked for me for a while, however, my body became accustomed to it, and it stopped working. I also experienced the majority of side effects. Mainly weight loss, but also decreased cognition and spelling abilities. I discontinued this medication specifically because losing my ability to think and communicate was horrible. Before I started this medication, my migraines were never affected by food (caffeine, sugar, etc), however, since discontinuing the medication I can no longer drink coffee/soda and have sugary desserts and foods. I also feel like my speech and communication skills (verbal) have been affected. ",

The itch was severe by time dose increased to 200mg am and nocte but no,other side effects except possible responsible for my delayed circadian Rythm disorder. Waking constantly before 4am sleeping 4-11am so very inconvenient, but others side effect free and a good pain killer.

Then I started to have a visual aura which I never previously experienced and had a 3-day intense migraine. My usual vertigo and severe travel sickness completely disappeared. After that, I stayed headache free mostly for a couple of months, apart from my time of month and ovulation. I continue to get the visual auras almost daily. They're not painful so don't bother me. Last month, the headaches came back almost daily with the auras. My doctor increased dose, going to 200mg and headaches are gone already. I'm hoping this will also help with back pain from disk degeneration. Lost 33lbs",

I noticed right away that my diet Dr pepper tasted flat and just thought that I had a bad batch till the next case tasted worse. I also noticed that food tasted \"off\" too, now my appetite is down and I took a deeper look at the info on topamax and know this is the drug I have been needing the last 10 years!",

                    "The drug would get a 10 as it worked miraculously for me.  In my case -- and this probably won't happen to you -- the medication caused me kidney stones, the first of which was agonizing and led me to stop using the medication. Then the headaches resumed. I was willing to take an occasional Kidney Stone attack as a tradeoff for frequent migraine so I went back on the drug knowing the risks. Unfortunately, I peed gravel constantly, oddly without pain, but it was a warning. I'm now off the drug. If it did not cause me that side effect, I would have remained on the medication as it was, again, close to 100 percent effective.

Within the first few days I knew something was different. My anxiety was erased for the first time in 15 years. I was happy again, and was looking forward to spending time with people. This medication completely turned my life around. If you are stuck in a anxiety/depression hole with very little hope, please be patient. There is something out there for you.

It has even taken away chronic fibromyalgia and arthritis pain, given me back my ability to sleep soundly for hours at a time, and has gotten me out of a daily triptan habit that almost caused a stroke a few weeks ago. The side effects (brain fog, drowsiness, etc) are nothing new for me given I have fibromyalgia. A life without pain is worth it to me! What a miracle!!",

Only side effects have been weight loss (about 10-15 lb, and it seems to have levelled out there, which is fine; I'm a relatively small person) and paresthesia/tingles in my hands & face. Tingling is more frequent in cold weather, but it's not bad enough to make me quit, especially not with the benefits I'm experiencing. There's been a bit of research into its use for mood disorders, which I have. I'm on other meds for that, but I wonder if the topiramate is having any extra little benefit there.",

I sleep better than before, I drink more water than before (as much as I should drink, before I didn't drink at all and had problems with my kidneys). When I first started topiramate, I got double vision. I read that this was a common side effect and saw my eye doctor about it. She said that it was because my vision improved a great deal.

Because of my insomnia, my doc switched me to Qudexy, which is topiramate in a time release capsule. When I was taking regular Topiramate I did lose weight, approx 60lbs in 2 yrs & then the weight loss stopped. I went from 200 lbs-140 lbs. & I very happy with that.

In late 2016 while I was asleep, I experienced the most awful leg pain (as if my thigh muscle did a flip flop or wanted to rip out of my leg). After various conversative methods which included Vitamin D 5000mg, it was suggested that I cease the Topiramate as a process of eliminating things. It has been 5 days since being off of the medication and the numbness/tingling in that single quadrant of my thigh went away.  Now, I have migraine headaches that are coming back.",

I have changed a lot about my lifestyle since taking topamax so I don't know how much of my weight loss can be attributed to the drug itself but I definitely have lost weight 12 lbs & don't crave sugar.

Carbonated beverages taste terrible, I have to force myself to eat, I stutter constantly, I can never find the right words and often switch up words in a sentence.

Negative is the nausea that occurs after I take the pill and it is horrible but I counter it with a suppository of phenegrin(sp). Of course that knocks me out for hours.

I began taking biotin and vitamins, but hair still kept coming out and scalp was starting to show more. I stopped completely and only lasted 4 days before a migraine wanted to come on.

                    "First started topamax in 2013 lost 30 lbs on 75mg in 3 mos topamax 25 mg 3 x a day w/30 mg prozac once a da. Weight went from 278 to 248. I am 65 year old female obese all my life. Had experimental Lap band surgery in 1979. Gained all weight back. Tried everything and gained back all weight every time. Can't take diet pills make me too jittery. After three years stopped topamax because of minor memory loss which I thought was embarrassing. Stayed on Prozac 30mg and gained all weight back and more up to 291. Now I am really depressed. Came off Prozac and am back on topamax 25 mg in morning and 25 mg at night only. Have lost 3 lbs in one week. So happy. Would rather walk and feel better physically than remember someones name,",
                    "I started out on 50 mg x2 a day, after a few hours burning in between fingers, pins and needles in hands, double vision, vertigo, memory fog...suddenly realized I was home with my kids, but how did we get here? Oh, I drove? Wow. I don't remember. Ever rode on the gravitron? That's how bad my vertigo was, I could not lift my head up off my pillow. I actually ate more on this medicine because I felt shaky, like you would get if you hadn't eaten all day, for me the only thing that kinda tastes close to normal was sugary foods. Heartburn. Nausea. Dry heaving. Motion sickness from waking, standing, sitting, and existing. Light sensitivity. Tremors. I'm sure I'm forgetting things but the memory fog is too real. I felt drunk over all.",
                    "I was getting 10-12 migraines a month when I was prescribed Topamax. I took it for a little over a month but had to quit because it made me extremely depressed and suicidal. After I stopped taking it, I felt fine again.",
                    "At first I did not like it at all - I started off on 50mg (recommended) and found it wasn't working. I also was super spaced out, unfocused and constantly feeling like my brain was going but my body wasn't (It was WEIRD). This went on for about a week, then it worked perfectly and I was completely normal. However the migraines started coming back so I am now on 100mg a day and the same thing happened when I upped the dosage. It's working now though! I didn't notice any difference in tasting things but I did get tingles in my fingers and toes! Otherwise all round amazing medicine!!",
                    "I was on this medication for five months with initial astounding results. My dosage was 125 grams. My daily headaches ceased as did my migraines. However, at around the four month mark, both came back to haunt me with a vengeance, seemingly doubling pain and severity. I also began experiencing tingling in my hands and numbness in my face, a totally unpleasant and unforeseen side effect that I only discovered by exploring online forums reviewing the medication. Additionally, this medication severely affected my anxiety and also led me to have extreme suicidal ideation, so much so that I had to stop altogether. I lost 15% of my total body weight whilst on this medication. If possible, avoid if you have a history of anxiety or depression.",
                    "This medicine was great in taking care of seizures but I honestly felt like I was crazy most of the time. I lost weight which I was happy with but when it comes to the final review, I was a crazy, small person. I couldn't even call an order in on the phone because I couldn't think fast enough, I went back to my doctor and ask him to take me off this.",
                    "Also taking it for seizures & migranes from concussions. Obesity wasn't an issue until 2 years ago when the trauma hit. That's when things got bad. I've gained about 80+ 2 years ago. Just got myself out of a wheelchair last fall but still suffer from chronic pelvic pain from abuse as a child.  So that tingling that many have an issue with, my Brain Rehabilitation Specialist said bananas. You need potassium if you are experiencing that.  You have to also take 500mg - 1000mg of Magnesium with this for proper nerve function and especially if you get migraines during your menstrual cycle. I crave loads of water since starting. Bathroom visits plenty ",
                    "Took this medication for about 6 months. Quit smoking. Taste buds changed. No more migraines. I stopped taking it because I started having severe muscle twitching. I did not loose any weight for which I was disapointed. I have decided to try again starting at a lower dose and not to increase as quickly as before. I really did enjoy being headache free and it also improved my mood.",
                    "I am 31 yrs old and have fought migraines for 9 years. I took Topamax several years ago and decided I did not like side effects and wanted to try other medications. After trying MANY different medications and being sent from one doctor to another for daily chronic migraines that took over my life nothing was working. Recently I decided to give Topamax one more try. Within 2 weeks I have felt better than I have in two years. I still have small but manageable headaches and expect them to get better because I am slowly upping dose to 4/day. Good luck to all of you with migraines, if you haven't tried Topamax you should give it a try.",
                    "I started taking Topamax 12 years ago after one of my migraines sent me out of my classroom & into the ER. After the initial few weeks of disorientation, halo vision, & tingling/numbness, my body adjusted to the meds & I had almost 10 years of maybe two headaches per year. A miracle! When menopause hit, my migraines came roaring back with a vengeance. But I stayed on Topamax & my neurologist added other meds to supplement. Things are better now; Topamax has been a lifesaver for me. But it takes some time to let the side effects settle out & for your doctor to tweak the dosages.",
                    "I been on this for med approximately half a month. I actually suffer from Bipolar and Depression also PTSD. Recently after I retired from fighting mixed martial arts and had knee surgery I was more depressed I gained weight. I am a big guy anyway. Normal for me is 6 ft 6 260 lbs. I got up to 340 and was like ok this is enough. I started my vegan diet I did back when I fought mma went to the doctor I was down 10 lbs. I needed new med so she put me on the topomax. From day 1 zero appetite none whatsoever. Like I have to make an effort to eat. When I do eat it is just cut up raw veggies in a bowl of vinegar that is it for the day. Now I am on top of my supplements so my body has what it needs. I'm shredding lbs like mad",
                    "I am 56 years old and weighed 249 pounds. Finally decided to deal with this weight issue once and for all. My knees prevented me from working out and my weight caused my knee issue. I sat down with my primary care physician and she ultimately suggested the use of topamax. In July 2015 i started with 25 milligrams and evolved to 125 miligrams. It is now December 8 and I weigh 221 pounds. Here is how I would describe the experience. It stops the need to impulse eat, so you don't feel deprived, so...your not crying when the scale isn't moving quickly. Its not quick, because I am post menopausal...but its not painful. Appetite is down, I can now walk 45 minutes...and for the first time in my life..I know I will reach a goal weight.",
                    "I took this medication starting in August. I stopped because my hair was falling out. I'm 20 years old and I've lost most of my hair now. I had to go get it cut to my shoulders in hopes it would look better but if doesn't. I began taking topamax to help with my migraines and I dropped a lot of weight. I lost 20 lbs over the course of 8 months. I now weigh 136lbs and sort of want to continue because I love the fact that I'm losing all this weight but I know it's bad for me as I am now getting addicted. I've been off the medication for about 2 months and my migraines are returning. I don't want to continue taking it because of my hair loss but I am not sure what to do. I tried taking medicine for hair, skin & nails to help but it didn't work.",
                    "I started Topiramate on March 30 th also alone with Phentermine 15 mg I was not convinced even though all the results I had read were good. I'm 27 days into the diet an I've lost 14 lbs. I weighed 169 anx now down to 155lb I need to lose at least 25 more. I have deteriorated disk and extra weight really makes a difference in your back. I use to weigh 125lb over the years I've gotten to were I can't do very much walking or exercise I'm so thankful my Dr put me on this I can't believe it the Topiramate at nite what really made the difference I was up and down during the nite eating now I eat jello and a little whipping cream that's it. I don't get hungry during day but I do eat. I did have some side effects but after about 5 to 7 days they went away. It Works Thanks",
                    "I've taken Topamax (topiramate) for several years to help prevent migraines (side effect of fibromyalgia) and it seems more effective than anything else I've ever used. I also like it because I don't suffer any side effects from it.",
                    "The medicine is the only thing that has kept me from ending up at the ER. The stuff has completely diminished my migraines, I don't even get them anymore and I started taking the medication mid August. However I am intolerate to temperatures above 68 degrees and I am a healthy 23 year old female who did not have this problem prior to this medication. Even with ice pressed to my neck I will overheat in a house set on 70 & I puke and get a migraine instantly. Apparently that's one of the side affects of the medication. Two other side effects are I am rarely hungry and caffeinated beverages taste terrible but that price is a small price to pay to be migraine free. And take in morning!! Will keep you awake at night!!!",
                    "I've been taking Topamax for about a year and a half now and it has drastically cut down the frequency of my migraines and that is so worth the side effects I've noticed. Yes, I've had the tingles and some facial twitches, I've lost about 20 lbs. and have trouble with word retrieval & memory... but is it worth it? Absolutely! I currently take 250 mg/day -- all at night to help minimize the noticeability of the side effects. A good option, IMO.",
                    "I'm a 24 y/o male and have been on Topiramate for almost a month.. Started with 25mg daily increment and increased dosage by 25mg every week. I was suppose to make it up to 100mg daily, but that hasn't happened. . The first week was good. Second week I did notice the pins and needles sensations all over. When I got up to 75mg per day my brain fog was BAD, my anxiety sky rocketed, and I seemed to have more headaches. I've started to have panic attacks and have been scared to drive lately or even go to the store which is so unusual for me. I am also sleeping hours upon hours at a time and I am also getting tingling sensation in face and arm which is scaring the heck out of me. Going to stop taking without consulting doctor.",
                    "Prescribed a half 50 mg tab at bedtime for a week. It's been two days and I have no more headaches! Finally! I have a strange side effect of pain in my private area though. Does anyone else have this issue? It's just annoying. I hope it doesn't get any worse. I've been looking for a migraine med that actually helps without too many side effects.",
                    "I started taking Topiramate several years ago for pain/neuropathy, as I read these posts I found out it could also be helping my obesity, fibromyalgia, Crohns and my smoking. I stopped taking it about two months ago because I was having kidney stone problems and thinking this medicine could be the reason why. In the two months I have gained 25lbs, I'm in so much pain I can't wrap my head around it, and my smoking is got in out of control. I had no idea this medicine could or was helping all my other issues so I'm going back on it to see if I loose the weigh, control my pain, stop smoking, Although kidney stones can be the most excruciating pain ever! I'd rather have that pain once a year than suffer every day in my other pain.",
                    "I tried it for 1 month. I drank tons of water.  I was extremely tired all day, but could not sleep through the night. Kidneys constantly felt like I was getting stones. I felt bruised for weeks after cessation. I would rather have a migraine!",
                    "I was prescribed Topamax as a Migraine preventative and experienced just about every side effect. I started 25mg/day at night for 7 days, moved up to 75mg after 3 weeks and remained there. Within 48 hours I was didn't have a headache at all, but was experiencing side effects of tingling fingers, no appetite and change in taste of foods/carbonated beverages. I did have a hard time concentrating, I'd get confused and would randomly slur words. I weighted 120-ish when I started and within a few months, was 110 or less. I did work out and noticed no matter how hard I pushed, I didn't sweat and randomly got dizzy. Side effects are no joke, but you adjust after a few weeks.",
                    "I was taking 50 mg a day and it really reduced my migraines. I had no side effects except that I lost about 10 pounds, so that was a plus though my weight was normal. My neurologist bumped me up to 75 mg to try to get rid of the last of my migraines, and then a few months later I noticed my hair was falling out just like it did each time when I was postpartum. I'll have to go back down on my dosage to see if that will make my hair come back or if I need to go off it altogether, but it will take years to grow my long hair out again. ;(",
                    "I'm 18 years old and was put on Topamax for headaches at 16. In the beginning, I was put on 2 x 25mg per day, then increased to 2 x 25mg in the morning, and 2 x 25 mgs at night. After reading everyone's reviews I think I was put on way too much. I weighed about 125 and I got down to 108! I thought I looked great although many people said I looked too skinny. The con is that it made me feel very slow and I couldn't concentrate well. As I started to ween myself off of it, the headaches went away. I now weigh 135 and gained about 30 lbs since being off of it. I am considering going back on to lose weight.",
                    "I actually requested to be put on topiramate to help lose weight knowing it was a side effect and to prevent my horrible migraines. I can say it has worked for both. I started out on 50mg a night on Dec.21, 2014 and at that time I weighed in at 227 lbs per Doc scales. At my last check up on March 31st I weighed 203. And my migraines were reduced greatly. The thing was my body was starting to get use to the medication so they did have to up the dosage to help my migraines; I'm now on 100mg a night. The side effects subsided after about two months of taking the medication (slightly tingling in the fingers and feet from time to time, little foggy/forgetful). I can not taste and have not had one carbonated beverage since the 21st of December.",
                    "I lost every piece of my beautiful long black hair in just over 3 months! Md's asured me it would pass. Never did.",
                    "I have been taking Topamax for 2 years now after trying many different medications. Yes I got some of the side effect mainly thought process was slow and word confusion that was real frustrating it is worse under stress. The all over tingling is not as bad anymore but not have headaches every day, you have to weigh you options.",
                    "Topamax for me worked at preventing headaches but the side effects were unbearable. This medicine worked in the beginning but slowly BAD side effects appeared, I became so depressed, I was angry and sexually numb. I lost my sense of taste all sodas starting tasting flat. I also lost 15 pounds very quickly and I am now underweight do to this medication. I would never recommend it but only as a last resort. There are far better options out there. After failed topamax I then was prescribed the extended release version of it \"Trokendi XR\" and it was a little better but again over time side effects started appearing. Beware because it seems good in the beggining then side effects! Withdrawals from this med are terrible! Migraines x10!",
                    "My experience with topiramate was quite positive in terms of migraine frequency. I did have trouble with anomia: the inability to find words, especially nouns. We in the healthcare field call it \"Dopamax\" due to the side effects of forgetting things and making you dopey . I lost my insurance and had to stop it abruptly, which is oh-so-wrong. It should be tapered. The enormous downside to this drug--even generic--it its outrageous cost. Needless to say, I am suffering as much as I was before having taken it. I was titrated up to 400 mg/day, which is the maximum does recommended. On the other hand, my memory has returned.",
                    "This medication has been a miracle. My migraines have been disabling to the point where I could not turn my neck and I could not stand up. With this medication, I can live my life. I am on 150 mg a day. Thank you topamax!",
                    "I took Topamax for a month. It helped with my headaches very little and the side effects were terrible. My feet and hands would go numb several times a day. My short term memory was completely gone. I had a hard time finding the words to speak especially in the evenings. And the very worse was the depression and anger.",
                    "After having developed neuropathy post surgery I was suffering daily. I had tried Neurontin with little relief and was prescribed Topamax initially at 25mg. Over the last 6 years I've been titrated up to 300 mg and can tell you that this drug has helped tremendously. Initially I had common side effects, difficulty finding words, I lost weight about 20 pounds, and found that I had some tingling in my hands and feet. These issues generally resolved in time or I have just grown accustomed to them. For anyone who initially has issues with the side effects try and stick with the medicine for a little bit unless totally intolerable, it gets better.",
                    "I have been on 200mg/day of Topamax for about 6 years along with a bunch of other things and it seemed as though my headaches were worse. I kept begging to increase the Topamax as I had stopped having any side effects. Finally I fired my pain doctor after he told me just to go \"cold turkey\" off of morphine (I wanted to stop taking it, but not exactly that way!). Life is so much better without daily pain medicines and I found a neurologist who took me all the way up to 400mg/day on Topamax. I did start to have some more weight loss and taste issues and sleepiness, but my migraines became much more manageable with Imitrex and much less frequent. That is down to maybe once a week from near daily.",
                    "Now in my late 50's, I have been a lifelong migraine sufferer. My new neurologist recommended Topamax (FDA approved for migraine therapy). I am going on week 3 with promising results...for the first time in years I am waking up to no headaches and am not getting headaches as the day wears on. I'm sleeping better. I am experiencing a slight problem with focus/concentration but am told that this side effect should subside over time. Providing the side effects are minimal and non-intrusive, I can see staying on this medication-I'm hopeful.",

It's changed my life and made me able to function again where other medications for bipolar disorder has not! The only reason I did not give it a ten is because sometimes it still makes my face and lips go numb and I get a twitch on the left side of my face, but honestly, I'll take it compared to how horrible my life was before.",
                    "I do not recommend Topamax as a solution to migranes. Although it did help keep the frequency of the headaches down at first, in the long run, I had just as many migranes as usual and there were too many side effects to make it worthwhile. My short term memory was practically shot, my hands would tremor and go numb as some points, and i experienced irregular heartbeat, trouble focusing, and sleep issues.",

I was put on Topamax after being taken to the Hospital for a TIA(mini stroke)due to complicated migraines. I don't really know how I feel about Topamax. I still get migraines a lot, and most of the side effects. I've lost 70 pounds. I am weak. But the banana tip is very helpful. My math is shot. And I stumble on my words. Short term memory is a loss. But I will give the medicine more time and try the banana's to help with the side effects. I take 150mg 2x's daily. I started at 25mg's. But I have other illness's that factor in. No one has mentioned TIA's. No one has this from their migraine's? Thanks for the info. It's all helpful.",

In July 2009, I had to quit Topamax due to a little published side effect, kidney stones. I was on a pretty large dose (600 mg). I had a 9mm Kidney stone and many many small stones. I take Keppra XR now. It prevents the seizures, but I have gained all the weight plus some that I had lost on Topamax, but no seizures or kidney stones.",

It might make concentrating a little more difficult, but no harder than trying to concentrate with a migraine! The only side effect I can complain about is the tingling in my hands and feet, but that usually only lasts about 15 min. I haven't experienced any hair loss (thank god)and I also can't complain about the appetite loss.",
                    "I was in a car accident with a head injury. I had intractable migraine and other headaches that came and went daily on top of that and three months after the accident my neurologist offered Topamax. It's been 9 months. I lost a lot of hair; I have the soda is flat thing; the pins and needles; and I have lost weight. I think the brain fog was not noticable because of the brain injury. It took care of my headaches immediately. I didn't mind the side effects. I ran out of it once and on day two had a seizure. I tried to titrate off recently and the migraine returned with a vengeance so I am still going to be taking it. I don't mind the side effects in comparison to the headache. Also-I use hypnosis for some of the side effects.",

The following night I decided to take my vitamins (which I didn't do the night before) and I didn't experience the same side effects. Not sure if it helped, but I make sure I take them every single day!! The only side effect that I get is slight tingling in my hands occasionally.",

I experienced some diarrhea which subsided after breaking dosage up throughout the day (200mg daily). Additionally, I have experienced weight loss (a significant amount 50lbs) I could not afford to lose. However, the weight loss has subsided as well. Upon beginning the medication I had trouble with recalling words and memory loss. At this juncture the side effects have since passed and so have the migraines. I experience 1-2 migraines quarterly. Topamax has been a life-saver for me. I had tried many other migraine preventatives to no avail.",

The migraines went away, and I have lost about 40 pounds since taking Topamax! The only downfall is hair loss. I highly warn anybody taking this drug not to miss a dose or try weaning yourself off, because I have done both and ended up with very bad mood swings and will be crying on the floor one minute, then raging and angry, then it will be as if nothing happened.",

I have suffered from almost daily migraines since I was 6 years old and have always resorted to OTC medicines to \"attempt\" to ease the pain. I have taken Imitrex to combat the pain and even resorted to Valium to knock myself out and sleep through it. When I heard about Topamax I was elated and it really does work at preventing migraines. However, within a few days I developed some side effects ranging from annoying to considering whether I should go to the ER: burning/stinging sensation when drinking soda, tingling feet, nausea, weight loss, memory loss, irregular heartbeat and passing out. I can't function like that. ",

That worked great for awhile until it didn't and I weened myself off everything. DON'T DO THAT!! I had a horrible hypomanic episode followed by a 4 month depressive crash. I'm now on Latuda, Celexa, Klonopin, and my good buddy Topamax. I have had no serious side effects from Topamax. A little hair loss (more like extra hair in the brush) but it's only noticeable to me. Not bad. No word loss, no memory problems. I'm in grad school with a near 4.0 GPA. It helps me maintain my weight so the other meds don't affect me.",
                    "I have been taking Topamax now for ten years. I love it. It has controlled my seizures and the side effects are minimal. I still get tired but not as bad as the other drugs I have been on.",
                    "I'm giving it a 10 for the decrease of nerve pain and it saved my life truly. However, the weight loss? The only weight I lost was 17lbs walking my dog and Nutra System 2 years ago and gained back 5lbs of that when he got injured 3 months ago. This didn't help me lose one pound. I'm on 75mgs a day, started at 50. It did change my taste, I no longer like orange but does zero for weight loss which I was looking forward to since I have a good 30lbs to lose :) So big ups for the nerve pain and I had no idea it worked on migraines no wonder I hadn't had to have my migraine prescription filled in 2 years! So it has great benefits and I would highly recommend it for other issues but not weight loss. Good luck and happy new year all!",
                    "I started Topamax on August 18th and my life has changed! Today is September 2nd, two weeks without a migraine is a miracle. I'm on 50mg. At first I was having a hard time at work. Brain fog is an understatement. But I would say it's gone now. Within the first week my sensitivity to light disappeared. I actually started crying tears of joy while driving because I could finally see in the day time without migraine. And same thing at night. I don't have to turn the mirror up anymore. I can see! I occasionally get some tingling in my hands and feet but not bad at all. I will update again on my progress/side effect in a month or two. Good luck to everyone. This has been such a blessing for me.",
                    "My doctor prescribed me Topamax as a preventative measure for my common migraines. It helped with my headaches really well. I used to get migraines at least a dozen times a month and this medicine allowed me to only have 2 headaches in the month that I took it.  I stopped taking it, however, because I felt so out of it. I felt like a space cadet. It also made me very moody. Everything irritated and bothered me. I didn't think those feelings were worth continuing with the prescription.  I would suggest trying it, as those effects, from what I understand, are rare. And, I have to say that I didn't get migraines for a few months after I stopped taking it. So that was a bonus.  As a side note, it does make soft drinks taste 'flat'.",
                    "To be honest, I can't tell you if it helped with the prevention of migraines or not. I have had chronic migraines for 15 years now. They are accompanied by loss of feeling in my hands, aura, and sometimes my words come out as gibberish. I have tried just about everything from medications to natural remedies for my migraines. When my new neurologist suggested I take Topamax I thought that I would finally be rid of my migraines. I didn't even last a week on this medication though. I couldn't stand for more than thirty seconds without being dizzy and having shortness of breath. My stomach ached and I had a tingling sensation in my hands. I also had a slight fever. My doctor wanted to attribute all of these things to the start of a cold.",
                    "I've been on Topamax for 7 days now.. I started it last Tuesday and didn't notice the loss of appetite until Friday... My doctor started me on 25mg for the first week, Friday I ate breakfast at 8:30am and didn't eat again until 6:30pm! Even then I couldn't finish my meal. My soda tasted like dirt! No joke! Saturday I made peach cobbler I love cobbler! I ate four bites and threw the plate it tasted like dirt! I notice if I force myself to over eat I need a bathroom very fast! I did a one week weigh in this morning I started at 229.9 and today I weight 223.3! Total of 6.6 pounds! I take mine for headaches and migraines.. Today I start 25mg twice a day! Then move to 50mg twice a day next week! I'm excited about losing weight!!!!",
                    "I highly recommend over many of the other medicines that are supposed to do the same thing. Does not cause weight gain either.",
                    "I am a African American woman with my natural hair. I have not experience any hair loss. I have been on topiramate for 10 days. I am taking 50 mg 1 pill only at night and I have lost 8 pounds so far. My doctor recommend I take 1 pill for 2 weeks before moving to 2 pills a day. I will probably stick with the one pill because I am losing the weight. I do exercise 5 days a week also so this helps. This pill alone is not going to work you need to get moving just a little. Treadmill 20 minutes is all I do. You can do it!!!! Good luck...",
                    "Started ten days ago. First night, I passed out.. very tired... next few days in a deep fog and a bit disconnected. I no longer have those side effects. Dr has me at 50 mg once daily and I take it in the evening. I literally eat half of what I previously did. I lost about three pounds over the course of a week..no excercise involved. Im not counting calories; just not interested in junk food. I read a poster on another forum to take extra B complex and Biotin to avoid any hair loss as the drug seems to deplete that nutrient in the body. Will post again in another few weeks with more information. I was at the point where I was considering surgery because I had tried everything.",
                    "I've been on topimax for about 3 months. 25mg 2x a day. It's definitely effective in controlling my appetite. It took a little time by became more effective with time. I am able to eat very small portions and have full control over myself. I have changed to healthy eating. Less bread and pasta. More brown rice, veggies, sweet potatoes. I still fry veggies in olive oil. Still eat a baked potato sometimes. But cut way back on portions and added snacks between meals. Then every 3 days I be sure to eat something a little more fattening and it makes me lose weight. For salad dressing, oil and vinegar with seasoning packet. No sweet tea etc. Lots of water. I walk daily too! started weighing 267, now down to 225. I'm confident I'll lose 85 lbs",
                    "I've been on this medication for 3 years now for my seizures (50mg/2 daily) and have not had any episodes since. At first I would get a tingling feeling in my fingers and toes (like soda fizz), but it went away once my body was used to the drug. Recently, my pharmacy switched me to the generic version and I hated it. Immediately that first day, I would get crazy headaches, feel dizzy, sick to my stomach and I couldn't concentrate on anything. I went back to my neurologist and got a new prescription for brand name only and have not had any problems since. I was also still using the drug during my recent pregnancy and am happy to report no problems or side effects what-so-ever.",
                    "No migraine, but really bad reaction to just 3 nightly doses of 25mg (the symptoms got worse each day before I stopped). Same thing happened to a friend. Struggled to breathe (had to breathe deeply with each breath and even took an inhaler to see if that would help). I felt disoriented, dizzy, and like I was walking under water with blurry vision. I was extremely lethargic and had trouble climbing a flight of stairs without getting winded. I was having sharp pains throughout my body (breasts, stomach & back). My heart felt like it was beating really hard (not fast, just through my chest). My face and arms were tingling. I had a really bad taste at the back of my mouth and everything I ate/drank tasted weird. I'd prefer the migraine.",
                    "I take this medication for migraines. I was having having migraines 3 to 5 times a week. Now I have a headache maybe 5-10 times a month which is a relief for me. I have notice weight loss also. Which I am proud of and was not expecting.",
                    "After 31 years of misery, countless amounts of medications and bad side effects, feeling completely hopeless, & like I would never be happy Topamax has already started to change my life. I suffer from PTSD, Anxiety/Panic, & Mood Disorder. Although it doesn't do a thing for my anxiety or panic the difference in my mood is like night and day. I can not believe how calm and patient I have become already taking this medication. It has saved my life & the people around me!!",
                    "I have experienced explosive behavior most of my life, even though I am generally a passive person. I also have generalized anxiety with panic attacks for which I take Lexapro for over 10 years. My psychiatrist suggested that I may have something similar to \"The Kindling Effect\" rather than explosive disorder. He asked me if I'd like to give Topamax a try. I said sure why not! He started me on 25 mg twice a day. Within five days I noticed a difference for the better. I can handle my mood much better, I can handle situations much better, and I have not had any explosive episodes at all in five months! To me this drug is a miracle. To finally find something that keeps me balanced and able to regulate my emotions without going to extremes is an absolute miracle! I love it!",
                    "I just started back on Topamax after being off the medication for 4 years. I suffer from cluster headaches, when a cluster starts the debilitating headaches come everyday. The last time I took Topamax it stopped the cluster within a week. I continued working up to the full dose and the side effects gradually decreased (confusion, hard to concentrate, difficulty with finding the words to express my thoughts). I found that a lower dose kept the headaches away so I dropped down for a few months then came off the drug completely. Last week a new cluster started so I am back on the Topamax and have had a couple of headache free days already. This medication works well for me at a lower dose and limits the side effects.",
                    "Over the edge..best thing ever!",
                    "Horrible drug. It did not prevent my migraines at all, and I had aweful side effects. Nausea, fuzzy thinking, tingly hands, and feeling overall sick the whole 4 weeks easing on and two weeks easing off. Not worth it. I'm back to Amitriptyline .",
                    "Developed Aurora symptoms of migraine as part of diagnosis of fibromyalgia & chronic fatigue diagnosis as result of a car accident. Debilitating vertigo, light and noise sensitivity. Extreme cognitive disfunction and fatigue which were constant but the migraine came and went but would last for weeks. Eventually it just stayed and I felt like I was walking about drunk!! I was told there was nothing that could be done for me and this was part of my condition. I found topamax myself when I had reached the point where I had decided to end it all if this was it. Sad but true. Fortunately and happily I am a new women. My brain has been unscrambled! I can function again!No more hiding from the light or trying to remember why I started a sentence",
                    "I weighed 268 pounds when I started out on Topamax about 12 years ago. I was put on them due to Cluster Migraines A/K/A Suicide Headaches. The level of pain I suffered daily was unbearable. Topamax was fabulous. In small doses, which have been increased to 200mg, 2Xdaily, they (along with other meds) saved my life. My weightloss?? Hold your hats, people! I've lost a person!! I weigh exactly 120lbs, am 5'8\" & very active when I can be. I've lost 148lbs total. MORE THAN ENOUGH! So, how do I stop losing? THAT is the question.",

Head pain from hell , ear pressure , nausea ect 24 /7 my life was stopping Had cat scan showed I had empty sella syndrome, Migraines lasted daily for 5 months so neurologist paced me on Topiramate and so far wow I slept for 3 days , head pain and symptoms started to go and now I am starting to feel like me again What works for one person , may not work for next but for me so far pain and symptoms have gone ,",
                    "This medication should be taken off the market. It has too many FDA warnings on it for it ever to be taken lightly, and frankly I don't think it should be prescribed as a migraine preventative or for the vast majority of conditions above.  I was only on it for 3 weeks, 1 week at 50 mg the other two at 25 mg. This is what happened to me: -Early signs of glaucoma (eye swelling and bloodshot eyes) -Hearing loss that has yet to be reversed -Fibromyalgia like symptoms -Extreme tightness and muscle pain in my face and along my TMJ, which caused dysphagia, other problems -Shortness of breath and heart issues -Tremors, very bad tingling, and light flashes in my eyes which were not a product of my migraine My advice? Avoid!!!",
                    "I had fewer migraines while on Topamax, but the side effects were HORRIBLE for me. I had tingly/numb fingers, brain fog and problems with word retrieval (not good for a teacher), plus it triggered depression-like side effects. The side effects were just not worth it.",
                    "Been on/off topamax since I was 15, I'm now 21. First time I took topamax at 15, I went frm 235lbs to 114lbs. Over time I got used to it & couldn't find something to help w/my binge eating disorder. I gained all the weight I lost & more over a 5yr period of trying to lose it/find the right meds to help. 2012 17 y/o tried topamax & had bad anxiety so that didn't last long. 2015 20 y/o I weighed 248lbs, the biggest I've been. Was on phentermine (diet pill, 37.5mg) for a few months but was starting to get used to it. Decided to try topamax again (50mg 2x a day) along w/vyvanse (ADHD/binge eating, 70mg) & lexapro (depression, 20mg). Currently 160lbs. Always adjusting my meds though, I seem to get used to them quickly.",
                    "Helped a lot with chronic migraines. I lost a lot of weight (I weighed 146 and I dropped down to 123 in two months). I ate less but I was still eating close to what I ate before being on the medicine. I think it must speed up your metobolism. I had some mood changes and I did have a little memory loss. I would forget words and things like that. I work with people so I noticed it more because people would point it out. My hands/feet tingled. I noticed less side effects when I took the medicine at night. I only take 50mg at night, that's all I ever have taken and it works for me. It does wonders for my migraines and it's worth the minor side effects. If you are a pop or beer drinker you will HATE it because it ruins carbonated beverages.",
                    "It took me a year to be diagnosed with Trigeminal Neuralgia - and I had to go to a doctor in Vienna for this, because the doctors in Romania misdiagnosed me - but Topamax is the medicine that really saved my life. Literally! Because I was contemplating suicide, the pain was that bad and nothing else was working for me. I have lost a little weight in the first couple of months and I also have some trouble finding common words while speaking, but otherwise I did not experience any other side effects so far. My cholesterol level is now increasing - I am wondering if anyone is experiencing that as a possible side effect.",
                    "It helps. For me it wasn't so much the appetite suppression that worked, but the way it makes me more conscious of the situation before I binge. Its makes me stop in the middle of the binge or just before completely, and ask myself whats up with the need to hit the self destruct button.  In case that I do binge on Topamax, my binges consists of less food when. And I eat slower, defeated by the situation.",

I was awake paralyzed, couldn't talk could not move. My hallucinations were I was in my room and something picked me up and threw me. Then something touched my back. A evil rabbit whispered in my ear. Then I woke up back on the other side of the room. This drug made me stupid as heck. I couldn't spell, talk or remember anything. My sleep paralysis scared me for life and I still think of the realistic dreams I had for 6 days. Don't take this medicine. It is terrible.",

The only side effect for me has been sodas tasting flat, which is a side effect I can get on board with! I drink a lot more water because of it and I love that! I have just now started to lose weight after about 3 months or so of being on this medication for headaches. I've started steadily losing ounces/weight. I started out at 142 and over the past month I've dropped down to 134 which is unusual for me because I haven't changed my eating habits at all really except for the soda thing. I'm okay with it all so far, but I hope I don't experience any other side effects like I typically do.",

The new meds seem to help a lot longer I had to skip a month of Trokendi and go back to topomax for insurance coverage reasons and ended up with a two day major migraine. I had to take a second dose of Imitrex for the first time. Now I'm back on Tronkendi XR all I needed a second approval from neurologist for my insurance. Wish me luck fellow head ache sufferers . God help us.",
                    "I was put on Topiramate 50mg to control almost daily migraines. It didn't work at that dosage so my doc increased to 75mg after 2.5 weeks which stopped full-blown migraines but I was still getting threats (migraines started and lasted 1/2 an hour then went away on their own). No weight loss except for what I was already losing (2 Lbs/week from my normal daily exercises). When I first started on Topiramate I couldn't think straight and couldn't remember some words so I immediately started taking it at night only instead (with my dr's approval) and that got rid of all of those problems. I was EXTREMELY hyper on 50mg per day. I'm talking EXTREMELY!!! But as soon as I switched to 75mg the hyperactivity stopped. Moving to 100mg tonight.",

I was 165 when I got pregnant with him, and on the day I went in to have my second son (who is 5 months old today) I weighed 270. I just took my first 25 mg dose of Topamax last night. I am addicted to Diet Dr. Pepper and can't even stand the taste. Not hungry either, so I'm hopeful that this medicine will work. I also take Celexa and Tenuate. I don't know if it's the combination, or just the Topamax, but I am feeling kind of \"floaty\" today, in a sense. Maybe this will improve with time.",
                    "I originally started on Topamax for Migraines and found it to be a 10 for that. I went from 4-5 monthly to maybe 2-3 per year. Life changing! It was difficult for my body to adapt to at first and I had to build up VERY slowly using 12.5mg for a few weeks in the morning and then adding an evening dose, etc. It made me feel horrible, tired, breathless, out of sorts and dopey overall but over time all that wore off and in addition to the absence of migraines I enjoyed a more even keel mood, more control over my decision making including less desire for alcohol. This made staying sober easier than at previous attempts. I also struggled less with eating issues. I've had to increase over time and take breaks/restart to manage the dosage amount vs tolerance.",
                    "There are a few ways to get rid of one of the most annoying side effects, the tingling hands and feet. Potassium- I used to eat a banana or drink fruit juice high in potassium. All of my side effects went away after 2 yrs on Topamax. It is hard to ween off of. I have not taken a pill for 2 mths and have far less headaches than before Topamax!! Great drug! I lost almost 30lb but once we found the right dosage I leveled out and stayed that weight for a yr before weening off.",

My psychiatrists prescribed me topiramate, it's been 5 days today and I'm down 8.5 pds. Side effects are I feel pretty weak doing everything, fatigue, I've been getting hot a lot and I work outside. I just hope and pray these issues go away because the topiramate really works great controlling the cravings. I'm never hungry I love it.",
                    "I started on Topiramate originally due to headaches and as a extra incentive, help with my eating/ weight loss. The product helped with both but I was left always forgetting stuff, feeling out of focus all the time, and had a constant tingle (like when you move your foot when its been asleep for a loooong time) in my hands and feet. I've thought about giving it another go due to my weight gain but just don't feel its worth those side effects because it interfered in my every day function and work.",
                    "This is the 2nd time in 10 yrs a neurologist has put me on Topomax. I am on 125 mg a day. The side effects are horrible and the migraines are worse than ever. Neuro refuses to take me off it after I have told him I do not like this drug or its many side effects. I was told I was a lost cause.",

(I'd about given up) I had just happened to be recovering from a horrific migraine from the night before that had me down with my ice packs and my trusty bucket for nine hours. So I said, \"Yes, gimme!\" I'm still trying to decide if it was the best decision... My goal was 100mg a day, I haven't made it beyond 50mg yet. My side effects are tingling hands/feet, brain fog, thirsty ALL THE TIME, hot flashes, and forgetfulness. I went from 2-3 migraines weekly to about that monthly. So it DOES help, but the side effects are ridiculous and they aren't going away. It's choosing the lesser of two evils.",

My 'mood spikes' as my husband and I lovingly call them are already beginning to subside. My toes, fingers and nose do tingle, and now that my dose is doubled (third week, time to titrate up), I'm definitely losing my appetite. (I have a few pounds to spare, so I'm not mad about it!) I hope to update this page again in a month or so to let you know how the medication is going then. After being on every anti-depressant the market has ever seen, it's a God-send to have FINALLY been pointed in the right direction. (I'm 30 years old, married with a 2 year old).",

My skin broke out and I had to see a dermatologist. I was eventually given Topamax (the brand name) and I no longer had the allergic reaction. The 50 mg wasn't strong enough and eventually I ramped up to 200 mg. I had weight loss in the beginning (close to 90 lbs, which I could afford). I've gained about 20 of it back but I've not lost any since. I do feel that I get somewhat spacey and suffer from some memory loss. I've asked my doctor if I can come off of the medication beginning next year. I've been on it too long and I am concerned with the memory side effects.",

I often forget how to spell my last name, I don't remember events of just yesterday, and I can't spell anything anymore for the life of me. I take it for Rapid Cycling Bipolar I & went off it for two weeks to attempt to get my cognition back - by about the 6th day I started to show signs of mania and by day 8 I was full blown manic with psychosis. I'd do anything to get off this brain mush of a drug but it serves a purpose. Oddly, I never went into psychosis until this drug. Oh, and the days that passed without Topamax lead to the worst headaches ever. Buyer beware.",

I do feel so tired and lethargic but it's so late before I get any sleep then I'm waking up mid afternoon missing my days I've tried getting up early going out walking etc like today still no luck .

I just want to be able to drive and not be sick.  At work, I have to be careful what I type in emails because I have a dopey effect but I can deal with that as long as I function in other areas of my life.

My neurologist and I discussed Topamax and figured it was worth a shot since my chronic, daily migraines were uncontrollable and I was getting Imitrex injections almost every week and could no longer take Toradol. Unlike other people, I have very few side effects. I weaned off Topamax once to try Gabapentin but it by itself wasn't enough and my migraines returned full force. Very few side effects: trouble finding words, thirst, and weight lose (not that I mind). Topamax is a wonderful drug and a LIFESAVER. It and my Gabapentin together is my divine combo!",

It made me thirst, so I drank a lot of water and it took away my craving for junk food.  Send time was end of May, 2016. 100mg at night. I lost 10 pounds in about 5-6 weeks easily. No desire to snack or eat emotionally. Only downside was that I was anxious a lot. I've now plateaud but at least I'm not gaining weight. I should try to up the dose. At least the anxiety has largely decreased.",
                    "I have struggled for years with what I thought was just a problem with controlling my hunger, I would never eat around anyone and then once everyone was asleep I was starved. I finally seen a psychiatrist for my ADD symptoms and while he was modifying my medication he diagnosed me with binge eating disorder. To my surprise he was right. I had no control. I had always bounced on diets. He started me on Topamax 25mg and I knew instantly it will work. It has a calming affect. I feel so full and I am going to bed without eating for the first time in years. I am very thankful. Not every medication is for everyone. I am pleased with this one so far.",
                    "I took this medicine because I was having severe headaches every day and tried everything my Doctor put me on Topamax it will take your headaches away and remove the weight I never felt bad but I had a hard time remembering simple things as coworkers names, what measuring cup to use for wet and dry items I could never remember the words I needed to carry on a conversation. I stop taking this medication because I could not function at my place of employment not to mention the short term memory loss & loosing my hair was crazy. I truly think that so many people get caught up with being able to stay so thin that they keep taking it. I took 50mg morning and 50mg @ night. Not worth it.",
                    "I love this medicine. My Dr originally gave it to me for weight loss but it got rid of all my joint pains. I had it everywhere. It was a miracle drug for me. I am noticing some memory loss, and difficulty concentrating but I'm 52 so it could be age. I'm going to cut back on the dosage and see if I notice changes.",
                    "I'm ultra-ultra rapid cycling bipolar II and bul. been thru 6 mood stabilizers / APs / AAPs. My experience on those was disastrous.Lithium made me more suicidal, lamictal made me binge, destroyed my memory, didn't help my mood, seroquel put 20 #s on me and made me a zombie, didn't help my mood, latuda and abilify made me shake. I was terrified of weight gain on depakote/valproate/risperdal. I was at my wit's end, suicidal, and terrified that I wasn't going to live to my 33rd birthday, then I found NIH considers Topamax to be a mood stabilizer so I asked my pdoc about it. Within a week at 50 mgs I had a full day where I didn't cycle at all. I woke up feeling okay and stayed that way all day. I didn't cycle at all. Things are looking good!",
                    "I've been taking this med for almost 10 yrs now. I started when I was 18 it was the first drug my Dr tried...I am almost 28 and I am so upset looking back that I didn't ask more q's or realize that this was the issue. I started at a min dose but I was eventually up to 300mg/day. I thought nothing of this because if the Dr wasn't worried, why should I be? I had been to 3 different Dr that never asked me if at that dose I was having memory problems, etc. I don't remember anyone telling me the major side effect was memory problems, brain fog, etc no kids... I went through college thinking there was something wrong with me My new Dr has put me on something else that is safe if my husband and I get pregnant. She also was in shock that for migraine prevention I was taking such a big dose.",
                    "I am a 23 year old female with partial complex seizures. I was on 100mg of Topamax, while on 2400mg of trileptal. After two months I started noticing the endless side effects. Now trileptal makes me drowsy enough and I have never had an issue with caffeine and stress before; but out of now where I got a horrible under eye twitch that lasted for (3-4) DAYS. It happened every week through out the 6 months. So I new it was related to the medication. Next was the trouble in speech, not being able to find the right word, stuttering or repeating myself. My short term memory was gone. I would have random pins and needles through out my legs which was probably the only tolerable side effect of the symptoms I had.",
                    "been on it for a couple weeks and after switching from one at nite and one during the day to one in the am and 1 in the pm (25mg), im doing much better, i seem to peter out near the time of my next dose but maybe i need to adjust a bit--25mg seems low after reading others dosages. been able to keep up w housework without feeling overwhealmed, i have more energy and more patience. Side effects=food tastes yucky, expecially my beloved sodas and rockstar energy drinks. Im loosing too much weight (Ive always struggled w being too skinny). But i feel better than i can ever remember feeling in 20yrs. i hope it continues, the side effects are worth it.",
                    "I have used Topamax off and on for the past 5 years. Off (due to pregnancies.) I am once again on and love the drug. Although the side effects are something to get used to, tingling in the hands, etc., those can be corrected with the correct dosage. The best side effect is the weight loss which certainly helps. My migraines have completely gone away. I have been a migraine sufferer since I was 5 years old (some 27 years). Topamax is a wonder drug!!",
                    "I took Topamax for 2 months until I finally threw in the towel and could take no more. It did stop the migraines but the other side effects were horrible. I did have the tingling in my hands, feet, and lips and food did taste way different. I was so depressed I could barely even get out of the bed. I actually GAINED about 5 lbs. while I notice most everyone else lost weight. I cried everyday for a week straight and I'm not like that. My house was a wreck and I could barely help my son with his homework. ",

                    "I couldn't tolerate apiprazole (Abilify) as a secondary mood stabilizer in addition to the lamotrigine, so I titrated up to 50mg. It helped. A LOT. It stopped the ultradian mood cycling that occurred when they upped my lamotrigine up to 200mg, and it stopped the self-harming urge. It did, in combination with other things, cause kidney stones, but alone did not. It helped quite a bit in stabilizing moods, and I'm just upping to 100mg/night. It did a lot for me, and I'm glad my psych put me on it. I don't want to come off. No weight gain. Even some weight loss. I wasn't expecting it, but I am certainly not sad about it. I'd recommend it, but of course, everyone has different brain chemistry, as noted with my experience with Abilify. <== Nope.",

Doc started me on 50 mg. Slowly working up to maximum dose over 30 days. I didn't like the 1st 3 days. Feel disoriented, dingy, irritable. I've lost 8 lbs in 3 weeks which is fine since my weight contributes to my hypertension which contributes to my migraines. My doc & I plan to take me off Topiramate as I lose weight & get healthier. Right now I can tolerate the negatives.",
                    "I was put on this for my fibromyalgia and all I do is sleep and still in pain. I would rather be awake and somewhat enjoy the holiday. It also makes me walk like I'm drunk! This is on a do not take list",
                    "I've had cronic migraines since I was 14 and I was put on topamax at 16 at 50mg I've been on it for 4 years now and its worked great for me until recently when I delt with the loss of my father and started experiencing light head aches so my doctor upped me to 100mg, 50mg in the morning and 50mg at night and I haven't gotten a migraine since. Its also helped me as a mood stabilizer too, I would recommend this medication if over the counter drugs aren't working for your migraines it really does wonders",
                    "Side effects in first 3 months included tingling feet, loss of sensation in hands, some minor hair loss, weight loss (11kg), appetite loss, loss of words (especially nouns), inability to taste carbonated drinks. Almost all of these disappeared after 3ish months. I am left with a somewhat reduced appetite, occasional pins & needles and I can't drink fizzy drinks. Weight loss was short lived. Effect on migraines was instant and measurable - reduced severity/frequency. Not to zero, but to a more manageable level. I am left with regular headaches, which I now think are Medication Overuse Headaches which will pass as I reduce painkiller use. I still get menstrual migraines which can be tricky to shift, but with sumatriptan I can usually cope.",
                    "I used Topamax for less than a year. I loved it for the first 7 months because it got rid of my headaches and reduced my appetite. Then I began to notice side-effects that made me anxious to get off of it. My fingernails became really thin, I was depressed and my hair was really was falling. I was taking 600 mg of Topamax which sounds like more than a lot of people but I found out online that many other people experienced the same symptoms on lower doses. I had to ween myself off Topamax and am starting Elavil. ",
                    "This is my second check in. I started Topiramate on July 4th with minor success but high hopes taking 25mg 2x daily. Now I am at 100 mg, 50 a.m. & p.m. This seems to be the turning point for me. The weight is finally starting to noticeably go down. I eat a breakfast with protein, barely hungry until dinner but make wiser choices and still enjoy desserts. Very thirsty for water all night and still biking. Good luck all!",
                    "I was diagnosed with vestibular migraines in 2010 and I had severe 24/7 vertigo. I always had \"regular\" migraines since I was a teen, but after an infection of the inner ear in 2010, my migraines changed and I had both pain and vertigo. For one year I had constant vertigo and I honestly thought I would become housebound. I could not go to theatres, malls, stores, or any areas with lots of people because crowds would make me dizzy. My work was in jeopardy. I tried Topamax and it gave me my life back. The initial side effects were awful but my body slowly adjusted to them. Eventually, the dizziness went away. I now take 225 mg daily. I have some word finding and concentration problems but that sure beats 24/7 vertigo.",
                    "Well I can say that I was taking keppra which made me psychotic. I now take topiramate x25mg twice a day and increasing until 6 weeks and I started last week Tuesday and already lost 15lbs. I have to watch this because as being in the medical field I know there are different side effects but the main two are diarrhea and anorexia. The diarrhea I maybe can deal with but I'm not made to be anorexic. I like a little meat on my bones. So just watch your weight side effects",
                    "Extremely effective. I had been non-functioning for a while and this drug was a dream. The complete turn around made me tolerate things I shouldn't have and turn a blind eye to some important side effects. I ended up staying on it for about 2 years before my weight was stuck between 125 lbs and 128 lbs (I am a 6ft tall woman!), my morning 5-8 mile run had completely disappeared and I would have liked nothing more than to curl up and die. This is a truly horrible drug. It does exactly what it says and SO much more. I am so happy to be off of it.",
                    "I was put on it plus Wellbutrin to stabilize my mood. For 3 months I was extremely nauseous, unable to eat a thing. I lost - 12kg's. The side effects were tingling in my hands and feet, a feeling that my head was being pulled to one side, metallic taste, extreme brain fog, loss of vocab (I sounded like an idiot, I could hardly string a sentence together), attention span diminished and extreme muscle weakness. I became socially anxious/awkward and still am. I developed a strange curry-like smell to me. I stopped when I fell pregnant and put on 24kg's, still holding on to 9kg's. It seems to have ruined my metabolism. I loved the appetite suppression (why I stayed on it) but won't go back on it, the side effects are too severe. And expensive",

                    "The thing I noticed is 90% of my outbreaks went away, however the other 10% were more severe. If you can group that other 10% of the time with a powerful pain medicine then making it through this is not as hard as it use to be. I had been taking other opioids for other conditions that did nothing to help fibro until topamax.",
                    "I was on Topamax for over 15 yrs and am finally coming off of it. It seemed like a miracle drug for the first few years but soon started having major side effects. I've had kidney stones every two years, no memory, major hair loss, tingling in feet and hands and other minor side effects.I wish it hadn't taken me so long to realize that the benefit of less migraines was not worth all of the side effects of topamax. Please think twice before taking this med. This med cost me $187 when first started because they didn't have a generic but since They have generic now it cost me less than $2.00!!!",
                    "At first this medication impaired my ability to drive a lot. My depth perception was way off making it very dangerous for me to be on the road, over time I did notice my migraines were less often and sometimes I would get all the symptoms of a migraine (light sensitivity, nausea) but no pain, kind of like a ghost migraine, which was weird and inconvenient. For the most part I think this medication is worth a try. I am currently on 25mg.",

I had no idea the medicine was working that fast. Well today I really knew it was working I went into town about 1:00 and I hadn't eaten anything so I stopped and got a dollar burger and fries well it was all I could do to finish it. I have never not been able to finish anything seriously I love food. But recently my dr put me on this because I have some an eating disorder that has caused me to gain weight and I've never had a weight problem and it's really upsetting me. I was afraid to get my hopes up so when I got home I tried to eat something that I loved but didn't even want it at all! It's unreal!",

The tingling goes away after a week. hot flashes - too young for this! Mentally in a better place-I was in a depressive funk before taking it. Cleared my head a bit - I actually want to get better now and am walking/making an effort b/c I'm able to b/c my pain is manageable. I still get random shooting pains, but not as harsh. Major con is my hair is falling out!!! any suggestions on hair-loss? Otc supplements I take with it: AZO Cranberry Urinary Tract Health, b12, biotin, pnv, and fish oil. drink lots of water!!!",

I've been on it about 3 to 4 years. I do have Lupus, so I have been blaming it for the brain fog and fatigue. Now I'm not sure as I talked to my doc about this * he told me it could be the drug. He is taking me off of it because it's doing nothing for the migraines. I gave it a 3 more for the lack of help for the migraines versus the side effects, since I'm not sure if it's the drugs, the Lupus, or something else. I just felt it did nothing for me & is a waste of time and money. I hope by going off of it, I feel an improvement in those side effects. Wouldn't you know it, no weight loss!",

Been taking it for years. I didn't know that it did work for me until I stopped using it. I broke into a manic episode because I started taking that Garcinia weight loss thing, and I wasn't on the Topamax. Well, I guess Topamax DOES work. ",

I also had huge problems thinking at a normal speed. Took it for 3 months thinking well I'll adapt and the side effects will lessen or go away. Nope. Didn't help decrease the frequency of my migraines either. I was very surprised at the side effects as I usually don't have any sensitivities to medicines. Hope your experience is better.",

I did loss 7 lbs my 1st week, I ended up losing a total of 20 lbs in 3 mos. been steady since. I'm still taking Topamax 6mos later.

I guess I am one of the few that do but I did therefore, I am seeking other drugs. As most have stated, my taste changed and anything with carbonation was terrible for the longest time. I eventually pushed through the changes and now everything pretty much tastes the way it should be on the medicine. I have allergies so the headaches I experience are mostly caused by that (which is why I think I have been pushed up to 200mg a day). Just a forewarning to everyone...

Not only has it changed the taste of foods, where before foods I would normally eat all of in one sitting, I now only eat a literal serving size of and don't physically want anymore, and most times don't even want to eat unless I'm physically hungry.

The pain had finally gotten so bad that even those weren't working. I work in Pre-K and didn't want to give up my job to become a disabled person living at home on pain killers. I found an awesome Doctor who understood that I didn't want to live on those types of medications. After only two visits she tapered me off of the medicines I was on and started me on Topamax along with Cymbalta. That is all I take. No more pain! Life is wonderful again.",
                    "I tried EVERY medication out there, I swear. It has always ended badly, bad side effects, bad combinations, etc. And because of that I have been more against taking meds. Once we finally figured out that depression wasn't my problem, and I was diagnosed with a mood disorder (unofficially Bipolar II since I'm still not 18), I'm finally on 75mg of Topamax, 20mg of Prozac, and then I take Adderall XR 30mg and Adderall normal 10mg and this combination has had any positive effect, without any negative side effects. I do think I have suffered from the side effect of memory loss and slow thinking, not enough to make me stop taking it though. It has helped me so much and I recommend to anyone who is having trouble finding medicines that work for them.",

Living a miserable life on this medication, cannot wait to get onto something else. Tried to give this a chance and it gave me nothing but a terrible time, almost like being unmedicated with a constant dead leg&arm, UGH. I'm a small person in general so the weight loss was not a welcome change either. Topamax does nothing!!! for my complex partials seizures or epilepsy.",

BUT Avg weight loss 2-3 lbs/week no lifestyle changes. Dr gave Adderall for concentration helped but needed Ambien to sleep. Was thinner than in highschool, got annoyed with relying on pills gained my 38lbs back & 25 more. I do recommend the medicine, make sure it doesn't effect your work life, and use vitamin B12 to get rid of the tingling I'm starting the meds again, the side effects are worth it to me! ;)",

First to 300 mg then because of G.I. side effects to 100 mg a day and adding 50 mg of Lamictal. G.I. symptoms are gone. I do experience the metal taste, some tingling in my hands and feet, tiredness, blurred vision, some diarrhea but these are few and far between, my weight is stabilized and not many problems with sleep. Any breakthrough seizures I have is usually when I don't maintain my regular sleep cycle, get overstressed, etc. The plus is that I am able to have a normal life. I work full-time, hunt, fish, exercise, have 2 grown boys, hobbies and my husband and I have a very active social life. Inconvenient yes but worth it!",

I had boundless energy, no appetite, and was always in a good mood. After two years, I decided to stop taking it because my skin was breaking out and I think I felt a little too confident in myself. I drove a little faster, said really odd things to people (no filter) and seemed to be turning into a show off about how skinny I was. Not my best personality! I stopped taking it and didn't gain any weight, but the headaches are back. Once my dermatologist gets my skin cleared up, I might go back on it, but will be very mindful of the side effects.",

I went from 252 lbs to now 167 lbs. From size 22 now size 10.

The first side effect you will experience is sleepiness, don't fight it. Let your body get a nap between 1-3, which I found to be the best time. I sleep for 1 hour and still can fall asleep at night. I am 21 now. Some advice to you, whenever you don't feel like eating I found that sweet tea gets me hungry, find that X factor in you. The weight loss is insane. I lost 40 pounds in 6 months just by breathing. Now, sleep patterns are important. If an average person needs 8 hours you and I need 9-10 MINIMUM also try to take the dose at the same time every day, you will fall asleep faster. Hang out to see sunrise.",

Just recently I came off of all my other medications other than my Zomig and now take 100mg of Topiramte in the morning.I havent had a full blown migraine for three weeks just dull headaches like I am at the end of an episode and the hangover I usually get after the migraine.",

I still have a few migraines a month which usually respond to Imitrex. As the years have gone by the tingling, loss of words have gotten much better. I can't do without this medicine. I'm a nurse and for the one or two out of control migraines per year I use injectable Toradol. That is a miracle medicine. No more Emergency department for me.

I became face blind, could not navigate my way around even with a map, memory difficulties. issues doing simple math, became asexual & had no motivation to interact with people. Towards the end of my time on topamax I was so depressed that I would just sit despondently. I switched doctors and she immediately stopped it.

The Doctor thought I was possibly having a break down due to stress. At his same time I had been battling continual Urinary Tract Infections. The Doctor immediately took me off of this drug and everything is coming back to normal! I was told this is a VERY common side effect and eventually I would probably have had kidney stones also. ",

I do not suffer migraines but had been doing some detailed work that day and thought my eyes were tired. By 7pm I could not see my children's faces, by 9pm I was in ER /A&E with almost total loss of vision.  Topamax can cause Acute Angle Closure. A very serious side effect which raises the pressure in the eye.  I still have very little vision.

So far so good with the weight loss. I'm not to pleased with the side affects however. I feel fuzzy all day. Like I'm on a cloud, Dizzy. Tingling and nubness in my fingers and toes. Hasn't helped my migraines at all either. It does though not make me hungry at all. I have to force myself to eat because I know I have too. I don't see myself taking this medication long term.

I was shocked I had gotten back down to numbers I haven't seen since I was a teen. 119-123. I'm 5'2\" so to me that's perfect. Food is never on my mind unless my stomach starts growling.

It did not help my mood it only made me dizzy and gave me uncontrollable jerky movements. I was forgetting words. I could not concentrate in school (senior in high school) Everything felt like a dream. I basically became really stupid. I was seeing flashing lights. It was bad.

My doctor had already tried Gabapentin, Sumatriptan, and Propranolol, all of which had side effects but did nothing for migraines. Next came Topamax. Side effects were: Slight change of taste (sodas tasted flat, bread tasted sweeter), and gradual loss of memory and concentration, such that it was hard to read or study an issue at work and be able to understand it. It did not affect my eating habits or energy levels, did not affect my weight at all. It also did nothing for my migraines.

My PDOC decided that a 50mg increase was fine. It sure was! I am indicated for topiramate for the following reasons: A. Bipolar Disorder; topiramate acts as a mood stabilizer. B. Drug Cravings; topiramate reduces my urge to use drugs, studies are directed at its propensity to reduce alcohol and stimulant cravings C. Anxiety: topiramate is a GABA agonist and slightly anxiolytic D. Weight loss Trokendi XR is far superior and smoother than generic topiramate when it comes to amelioration of symptoms. 10/10.",

The only side effects were in the first 2 weeks with subtle numbness and tingles and loss of short term memory.

Carbonated beverages do taste flat to me now, I'm glad to read this has happened to others as well, I thought I was going crazy.

The first week in topomax I was on 25mg in the morning and 25mg at night and had minimal side effects and no effect on my appetite and no weight loss . I did however have bad diarrhea and was a bit 'slow' I bumped it up to 50mg morning and 50mg night the next week with the same results, but no side effects ( felt like I was taking sugar pills) Feeling annoyed.... the next week I bumped it up to 100mg am and 100mg pm and I was amazed!!

I switched from amitriptyline to topamax for my migraines due to the previous medicine not doing it's job as well. Within the week of taking the new medicine I became completely unable to sleep at night, upset stomach 24/7 and an a horrible level of unquenchable thirst. The no sleep was the worst part; I'm usually a pretty great sleeper, so going from 7-8 hours of sleep a night to maybe 3-4 hours a night was rough on my physical and emotional self. I was advised to stop the medicine tonight by my doctor and cannot wait to return to myself. I even still had migraines while on this medicine. Would not recommend.",
                    "I've been taking Topamax for over 3 years and the only side effect I experienced was an initial weight loss of about 15lbs. If there was any cognitive difficulty, memory loss, difficulty remembering words, etc., I didn't notice, as it was worse when I was experiencing a migraine. Before taking Topamax I would have a headache for months, with no relief. After I started taking Topamax the migraines were down to 3 month. My Dr. started me on a dose of 25mg, 2 X day and titrated me to 100mg 2 X day. Unfortunately, the Topamax no longer seems to be effective and on my next visit I will ask my Dr. to either increase the dosage or to prescribe a different medicine. Also, I have to agree with another post I saw, I am always freezing!",

I was never diagnosed with this bipolar yet my hubby always joked saying I was. I'm not too manic. I have anger, anxiety and procrastination issues. But I work my ass off and do my wifely/motherly/grandma duties. So I didn't realize how truly bad off I was till for some reason decided to try it when offered it . I'm actually a lil more comfortable in social atmospheres now than I ever have! I can get up with a plan and actually get stuff done! There was an invisible wall blocking me. I have a lot of pain that I can't afford to look into further tho. So far so good. The pins and needles suck.",

I just can't deal with the permanent exhaustion, lack of words when I'm speaking, memory loss and I still get migraines! I've dropped the 25mg tablet from my original 75mg dose (now on 50mg morning and 75mg evening) and I cannot believe how much the \"fog\" has lifted. I am just so happy, I could cry. I already feel like some of the confusion has started to clear and for the first time in ages, I can see and think clearly. My aim is come off this medicine completely and find another way to tackle the migraines. Here's hoping! Best wishes to you all.",

I went through many different trials of treatment & nothing worked, so finally the headache specialist gave me Vicodin. It worked and I was able to begin living life again. Then a new MD took the Vicodin away and gave me Topamax. MY LIFE WAS HELL. I live alone in a 2 story house and I had to scoot up/down on my butt. I am 66 & disabled (from strokes) and I was terrified. I could barely form sentences, I had terrible brain fog, I couldn't cook a meal as I was so confused I kept burning things. It was horrible. The doc told me to keep taking it but I refused, I felt the side effects were too dangerous for me.",

I only take 50mg and have side effects, word retrieval issues, sleepiness, balance issues, etc. But it is the only one I can take that my stomach can tolerate!

Started on topamax 25mg in am and pm on July 30. I am now 178. Coke tastes flat so I drink more water I do have tingling in hands and feet but I am glad not to have migraines. The sleep is a problem so I think I will ask for something to help with that. I just wanted help with migraines now I'm losing weight, I got help for both. I couldn't be happier",
                    "5/1/2017 - I was on Bystolic for BP treatment and it caused me to gain 30lbs. I suspect the high blood pressure was due to use of e-cigarette. I put the e-cig and the bystolic down!! Dr. put me on Topamax 100mg and Wellbuterin 300mg help with the headaches and weight loss. As I ramped up from 25mg to 50mg of Topamax I noticed significant changes in my behavior as did others. I cried continuously and at the most ridiculous things. I was short tempered and wanted to be left alone (to cry). Side notes..it made my face feel numb, carbonated drinks tasted funny, vision was funky and did zero for weightloss. As a mom of 4, I can't continue this medication. 30-40lb weight loss is not worth living this way.  ",
                    "Everyones comments have been extremely helpful for me. I am on day two of Topamax and am starting with 25mg daily at bed time. First side effect I noticed was the change in taste buds. I am a big DR. Pepper drinker and went to drink one yesterday and it tasted horrible. Not too happy about that. Sleep last night was strange. It felt very restless and I woke up a lot and was confused. I feel good this morning however. I am determined to try this medicine for a couple of months. I need a solution for my migraines and it seems this has helped a lot of people. I am only concerned about the weight loss. I am already very little and definitely do not need to lose any weight.",

To think that I lived so many years never being diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder. I am so happy that life is so wonderful because of Topamax. Only side effect has been weight loss but, that really is a good thing. It is wonderful to be back at my true weight because the bipolar disorder is now managed.",

EVERYTHING has only been temporary. My new doctor has recommended Topamax. I currently weigh 282.6. I have started out on 25 in the morning and 25 at night. In 1 month I will go in for my follow up. Has anyone else tried everything else and completely fail? My doctor says it could be my genetic makeup. But anyway I plan on keeping a record on here of my journey for myself and others to follow. Thank you for your support.",
                    "Okay, up front and to be fair, I have a very sensitive reaction too many medications. I was on this medication for just over 36 hours and I think it made me more sick than any medication I had ever been on. My neurologist gave it to me as an anti-seizure medication. With in just a few hours of taking it I was feeling quite sick but was not entirely sure that that was the reason. After well under 24 hours of being on it I felt nearly catatonic very ill and ultimately had to stop taking it altogether. I ended up falling in the bathroom because I was so uneasy on my feet. The upper part of my legs went numb and at one point I was having difficulty even speaking. I was afraid I was going to end up in the ER.",
                    "I have been using Topamax for 7 months now and it has nearly eliminated my headaches. I read about the side effects prior to taking the drug and I was committed to taking the medication for at least a month to see what would happen. I had the typical side effects of tingling, change of taste but over the course of time all of these have pretty much gone away along with my headaches. The drug is expensive but it is well worth it for me.",
                    "Been taking for 3.5 years. Total godsend when I first started during a depression; I felt a calmness I'd never felt before. Got the weight loss side effect, & eventually managed to drop the 70 lbs. that I'd gained from other mental meds (karma!). Starting side effects were hard: Was nauseous 1st week & felt like someone had kicked my butt; the successive titrations over the next few months were the same, minus the nausea, lasting a week or less. Side effects afterwards: I'll occasionally get pins & needles in fingers, slight name/word recall issues but no serious case of the stupids unless I go above 150mg, & constant thirst/ dry mouth. Only 8 stars cuz I'm not sure it's working anymore (possibly cuz pharmacy switched brands).",

I was so hopeful when the neurologist mentioned this tablet because he said I would also lose weight with it which I have lost 4lb's with so far but I would rather be fat and happy then skinny and angry if that's the choice I have with these tablets",
                    "I have been on Topamax now for 2 years. I reached a breaking point where I almost lost my job because I was calling out of work so much with 3-4 (sometimes 5) migraines a week. I was initially annoyed because I wanted it to work immediately, but I still had migraines. You have to titrate the dose up 25 mg a week. I initially went up to the recommended 100 mg, but I hated the \"loss of words\" feeling I had, and found that I had about 1-2 migraines a month. So I decided to go back to 75 mg and see what happened. I had less loss of words and finger tingling, and yet my amount of migraines stayed at 1-2/month. This has been a lifesaver for me. I don't know what I would do without it.",

Inches everywhere, food taste good just eat very little of i.t I'm never ever hungry but I enjoy cooking! I have energy, not bogged down with lots of medicines anymore and not one full migraine! I'm excited to lose weight it's actually very easy to eat healthy. Its all you crave and I was a sweet addict. No ugly side effects as described, not on this dosage. So I hope this has helped someone.",

I thought it would go away with time but here I am 2 years later and it is still happening. This medication also prevented my migraines at first, then I had to be put in the hospital for 5 days to get treatment about 6 months ago, and now they are back again. If you miss even one dose you get a whole new set of side effects as if you started the medicine that day! Before I took this medicine my hair was so thick, and I never really noticed the hair loss side effect until now because my hair is falling out in chunks. Topamax also caused me to get kidney stones and be hospitalized for a month. The only good thing is I lost 50lbs",
                    "I have been taking Topamax for about 6 years now. My current dosage is 200mg/day - the dosage was recently increased during a high-stress time. The main side-effects I notice are slight tingling in fingers, which only lasts a few moments. I have gone from 5-6 migraines a week to only 1 or 2 a month. Certainly worth it.",

I have always been healthy (no high blood pressure, no diabetes, no High Cholesterol) however I've always been obese and worked towards trying to rid myself of the weight in efforts to prevent myself from getting those diseases in the future. This has given me the kick start I need. It reduced my cravings for sweets and carbs as well as suppressed my appetite. I do eat 3 meals a day (or at least I try to when I can remember) but for the most part, I have the same amount of energy, I sleep AMAZINGLY, and haven't had any major side effects as others have mentioned. All good here!",

                    "Topamax worked great to prevent migraines, however the side effects that I experienced were not worth the prevention. I experienced numbness and tingling in my extremities, severe problems with word retrieval, a complete inability to focus or concentrate, anxiety, agitation, severe mood issues (I became very angry and upset at the smallest of things). But what finally did me in was severe epigastric pain, nausea, dizziness and disorientation that came about suddenly and was persistent until I titrated myself off the medication after a visit to the urgent care. As soon as I got off Topamax, the migraines were back every day and I question which was worse - the migraines or the side effects. ",
                    "I have not had good luck with this medicine. The side effects were horrible at first but they did settle down and mostly disappeared after 4 or 5 months on the medication. If you're just starting it, give it some time and the side effects will go away, but for me it never helped lessen or decrease my migraines so now my doc has given me Amitriptyline to try so I'm hoping I have better luck with this one!!",

I've suffered with severe migraines for years and tried everything, started at 25mg, now on 100mg, they are trying to put me up as far as 400mg to find the optimum dose but I told them that I feel like it's making me sick, my memory has gone seriously bad! I keep feeling freezing cold all the time, I also have a serious stomach condition making my life miserable since taking these tabs, 3 days ago I Googled topiramate and realized why I am ill, now coming off it. It really helped reduce migraine frequency and severity but side effects I cannot cope with right now, such a shame.",
                    "It takes a while to kick in, and you HAVE to gradually increase your dosage - like, start at 25mg twice a day, then every 2 weeks, 25 mg more - gradually increase to the max dosage your doc wants you on. Otherwise the more negative side effects will be more pronounced. I am on this medication for migraines, and the weight loss is a \"side effect.\" It took about 6 months before I saw any weight loss at all, so I was frustrated at first, though the migraines did start to subside a bit. Now, I've been on it a year, and I've gone from 235 lbs. to 205 lbs. without trying at all. Like, I'm not exercising any more than I was, I haven't been dieting at all that I'm aware of - I just don't crave food like I used to. Headaches better too.",

I experienced the weight loss, tingling and the other minimal side effects at the lower dose but was encouraged to stay on the meds. As i increased the dose, i started having hair loss, dizziness and \"white outs\" where i would not be able to see at all for up to 20-30 seconds at a time. I also started having the memory issues. I started seeing a new neuro and we dropped me down to 100 mg. The hair loss stopped but I still get the vertigo. I am now down to 50 mg. I suffer from eye pain in my left eye and still the random dizziness- which is horrible. Weaning off of this - I do Botox injections now for preventative with some relief",

When my grades started to decrease I knew I had to do something about it. The doctors prescribed me Topamax (Topiramate). I've been taking this medication for about a year and I absolutely love it! Now I only get headaches once or twice a week, instead of every day. This medication helped turn dark, painful days to luminous ones!",

I'm a college student and have had a recent and serious issue with getting headaches 4-5 days a week followed by a migraine every few weeks. After going to the Neuro over break, they suggested I be put on topiramate daily, and it has been the biggest help! My number of headaches has gone down to 1-2 a week, and I think it will continue to improve. Very happy, very pleased not having to depend on tylenol to function, or having to miss class. No serious side effects, sometimes tingly in finger tips or right above upper lip for a few minutes. Haven't had a migraine since being put on this medication!",

There is a \"diet\" pill out there with both combined but she said it's usually not covered by insurance and very expensive. Advised from a pharmacist to have my doctor create the same thing which is 2 scripts the topiramate and low dose of phentermine. I just started so I'm on day 2 and it cost me 30.00. I've not had any cravings, have had to remind myself to eat. I'll keep you posted as things move along. Best of luck to you all on your journey.",
                    "Unfortunately, I got more headaches while I was on Topamax. They increased from once a week to several a week. I'm sure I'm an exception to the rule, but one size does not fit all.",

My Neurologist recommended increasing my potassium levels. That seems to help sometimes. I lost some weight and I sleep better now taking this. I do have few migraines a month, but I do not want to take a pill the rest of my life. ",

                    "Personally this drug helped my mood swings greatly, however I was quite disturbed that it agitated my diet as much as it did. I have a co-morbid eating disorder which was agitated by the med. The Topirimate made it so I HAD to eat my food a very specific way. Something soft, yet crunchy at the same time. Normally I wouldnt complain, however it was always on my mind.I think the hardest thing about the med was the appetite suppression for me. I was down to eating one meal a day, which ultimately let to me not loosing any weight which I can say was very difficult for me. I had increased irritability, and I felt overly fatigued. I am also on Citalopram, which is a terrible combination if you're prone to fatigue.",

I have extremely unbareble dry skin now that just flakes off and flakes off and flakes off. I moisturize everyday constantly but it just gets worse and there's nothing that helps it. Does anyone else experience this problem? I just want to know if it is the medication because I have not had dry skin my whole life and want to make sure that it will go away when I get off of it..",

Yes, there was some tingling for the first few months, but it was not a big deal, just felt like my toes had fallen asleep and were \"waking up\". Since I was already on a weight loss plan, I don't know if it helped in that area or not. I can't say that I had any other side affects. I've always stumbled with my words and this hasn't increased that issue. I certainly didn't notice it changing the way things taste!",

All day everyday, constant migraines. I had to stop working out, got fat and lost all my gains. I started 25 mg topamax at the same time with chiropractic care (found in neck x-ray abnormal lordotic curve) and started treatment every week. A week later of both of these combined, the migraines are finally gone! but my head still throbs except with no pain.. I am just happy I can finally exercise again, and stop hating life.

I did lose about 70 pounds. After over a year on the Topamax, my normal appetite has started to return and I have gained back about 10 pounds, but I still have self control that I lacked when I was fighting depression which is now at bay.",

By Monday, I was half-way through my day at work when I got lightheaded, dizzy, a terrible headache and started experiencing left sided numbness/tingling. Nearly wrecked and ended up in the ER where they diagnosed migraines. Was sent home to have a headache with left side weakness/numbness, confusion, foggy feeling for the next 2 weeks. 5 doctors appts, 2 ER visits, 1 outpatient infusion for migraines, and 1 admission to the hospital later. I finally figured out on MY OWN that when I stopped taking topamax, my symptoms got better. Although they are still not gone. My vision has changed as well as other long term effects.",

Still, overall I have been pleased. I have lost about 40 pounds. I went from 228 down to 189. For a 39 year old, 5'3\" woman. that'a a big difference. ",

I have tried phentermine with no luck and usually had good success with natural weight loss until being diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and needing a knee replacement that keeps me from working out too much. So so far, I am impressed. I'll be back in a few weeks for a weigh in review. No side effects like others have had with mental fogginess or tingling. 25mg 2x day.

Although I haven't had a seizure ever since I began to take the medication (which is good because the meds are working) the side effects were horrible. I would often feel very disoriented and saw a great amount of weight loss. This may not apply to everyone because everyone is different, but that was my experience with this medication.",
                    "Miracle drug! The side effects can be daunting at first, like tingling/numbness in extremities that won't stop for hours, but if you increase your water intake substantially and power through, it's totally worth it. My daily tension headaches are 90% gone, which is huge for me. It didn't do much in terms of overall muscle pain reduction or the daily body aches, but I did lose over 30 pounds in four months. I stopped drinking all carbonated drinks (because it makes them all taste super flat weirdly) and definitely am not as hungry as I used to be, so that's just a bonus.",

I was laid up with an injured back and sick so I wasn't moving, but then I wasn't really eating either. Since then I've played with the same 5ib. I am taking 100mg 2x day. After about 6wks I got some of the common side effects (vision, memory, taste, exhaustion), I stopped losing weight. But I'm fairly certain it is the source of some pretty severe depression that didn't exist prior to taking it. I'm glad I lost 13lb, but the depression is too much to handle and I'm throwing in the towel. Wish it had been more effective, but really it stopped working after about 3 weeks anyhow.",

The one good thing , I lost 60 lbs. but I sure suffered so bad for it. I have to go to a Pathtologist for the blisters on my tongue that the doctors figure are not caused by the medicine and yet it is listed twice as a side effect. Thanks for listening to me.",

The VA (my neurologist) had me try this drug to see if it would help me with the migraines. After about a month I noticed that I couldn't concentrate, and I'd began to effect my studies badly. My anxiety was the worst it had ever been and I was slipping into a depression. I had no idea what was wrong g with me. The VA gave me (a person who suffers from anxiety) a medication that makes you stupid, and wrecked havoc on my mind without warning me about any potential side effects. I had to process the change on my own, figure out what was wrong with me, and ween myself off the pills. Use with extreme caution!",

I am much more mobile, less irritable, and overall happier. I've been on the medicine for about a month though, and have seen a slight return of symptoms.

The weight loss was great at first, but with it causing crippling anxiety I had to add an antidepressant, which put all the weight back on even though I was still on the topamax. I tried going off of it twice. The first time, almost cold turkey. This was a disaster. I didn't have any seizures, but my headache was 24/7 until I got back on it. The second time I weaned myself off very slowly. Over about 2 months, even though I was only taking 100mg. It worked, but I discovered that the topamax was helping me with pain all over my body, not just headaches. Every day was a struggle. After 2-3 months off the drug, I decided to go back on it.

Word recall, memory, trouble focusing, hand numbness, fatigue, insomnia, the works. But number of days with headaches went from 21 to 9 the very first month. Now, after years of taking it, my body has been depleted of vitamin B12, and I have been suffering from horrible GI troubles. However, none of my doctors seemed to link Topamax to the B12 depletion. It took Google to figure that one out. But thank you to Google and B12 supplements. I hope this helps someone else relieve any issues they've been experiencing. ",

I also had the fairly common side effect of just feeling confused, though this wasn't all that severe and I was still able to do well in school. I also experienced tingling in my hands and feet, and though this was irritating, it was bearable. The real kicker for why I quit taking this medicine was when I began to have what felt like panic attacks and severe confusion, along with elevated heartbeat and dizziness. Also my fingers would move on their own and seem to get stuck sticking straight out and I had no control over it. ",

I do feel emotionally sensitive at times and do get occasional tingling in my fingers and toes if I don't eat for awhile, which the Topamax also decreases my appetite and I have lost weight on. I still have ocular migraines if I stay up too late or don't get enough sleep. If I have even a small glass of wine the evening before I will wake up with an awful migraine the next morning, so I see why they say not to drink while on the medication.

I was having around 3 horrendous headaches a day, I'd been prescribed 3 different triptans, verapamil, pizotofen, nortryptaline amongst other medications and was taking naproxen like smarties!! Then along came Topiramate!!! It took around 3 weeks to start working and has been a godsend. The only side effects I've had have been the tingling in my mouth, hands and feet, which, yes, is annoying but nothing compared to the pain I had from the migraines. I could do to shed a few pounds, so if weight loss is a \"side effect\" I'm waiting with open arms!!!",
                    "I've been on this medication for about three weeks. It has helped with the migraines...I don't have as many episodes, and when I do have it, it's not as severe. Haven't experienced any bad side effects. The one side effect (which seems to be the most common) is appetite suppression, change in sense of taste, and constant thirst. I haven't lost much weight in three weeks, but I have a feeling the longer I'm on this medicine, the more I will lose. I guess it's a good thing.",

No other good side effect. Gained back weight and stay depressed and anxious. Phcy. says it is the binders in the Rx.",
                    "At first this medicine worked great. I went from Tegretal to this one. I have Bilateral Trigeminal Neuralgia so they started me out at 50mg and bumped me up quickly to 100mg. It seemed to be working great and yes the bathroom trips at first seemed to be never ending but after a while it seemed to calm down. I have been on it for 6 months now but after upping my dose to 150mg, after the pain started to come through with a vengeance, I started having twitching in my eyes and mouth and other side effects happened as well. So I have to stop taking it now and start a new regimen. I did however lose 20lbs so that was a great thing because I was needing that!",

I have minimal to no side effects, a little drier mouth perhaps, plus my 15/20 vision reduces to 20/20. I feel less anxious and less \"pressure/need\" to tic. I can take much lower doses of the brand name to achieve the same effect with the generic; but my insurance won't cover the brand name. It's 100mg twice/day generic versus half that amount brand version. It's still worth it!! I feel so much more in control and \"almost normal\".",

I am cautious as I have been 6 months relapse free on 60 mg fluoxetine before the effects wore off. Will give an update. I have been on all other kinds of SSRIs or SNRIs, which had no effect. My history, I am 42 years old, I have treatment refractory Bulimia since 28 years, purging type.

I lost so much hair that when I try to braid it it's like braiding tiny strands of dental floss. It looks so ridiculous long I had to chop it all off just to conceal how grossly thin it is. People call it dopamax for a reason. It made my memory Swiss cheese and when I had to process information it felt like fighting through seaweed. The worst side effect was the depression. This stuff makes me downright suicidal.  It helped me lose about 80 pounds by starvation. I never wanted to eat. I became anemic.

My migraines significantly reduced, though I did get most of the common side effects: slight tingling in my fingers, carbonated beverages tasted gross, and weight loss.  My main warning about this medicine is weight loss. It seems to be paraded as a benefit, and to some it may be, but if you are already naturally slim, pay very close attention. I wound up dropping to an unhealthy weight despite all attempts to counter it, and it's ultimately why I had to stop Topamax. I was unwillingly wasting away. When I stopped, my migraines returned in short order, and I'm still looking for an alternative that works.",

I've had people mention the anisocoria many times, always the same effect.",

I got the tingly feeling, I couldn't sweat or cry, I was having hallucinationa at night time, I had the foggy feeling constantly and couldn't concentrate. I was a horrible mess. I was only on it for a couple of months before I stopped. It has been about 5 months since I stopped taking and I still constantly feel foggy, dizzy, off balance like I'm drunk. I do not feel like myself at all and I'm nervous that this medication has caused permanent damage.",

My Dr. warned me, also, when he gave me the Rx, to watch for symptoms of such an episode. He did not go on to tell me specifically what those symptoms would be like and I had no idea what this could entail. He said the drug had/has been known to cause these episodes. Just telling me to watch for symptoms though...by the time I starting having the symptoms, I was too paranoid to be able to do anything about it or even realize what was happening since I had never had such an episode. It was the scariest thing I've ever experienced in my life and I still have nightmares and anxiety about the things experienced in my head and thoughts during the time of the episode that lasted for 2 weeks, even while in the hospital. I would love to sue the pants off the makers and that doctor, who, by the way, when my mother called my doctor for help, he stated \"Since she won't talk to me, I am not her doctor anymore as of this moment.\" I wouldn't get on the phone because I was in the middle of a psychotic episode and thought everyone was trying to kill me. Great doctor, huh?! DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

I was really surprised to see that it is sometimes used as a weight loss medicine. I didn't really notice any difference in my appetite. However, my last visit to doctor did show that I've lost 5lbs. I don't like the tingling, crawling skin sensation side effect. That went away after a few days.",

I am quite used to the cognitive changes, they do not make you stupid. Misconception. Intellectual level is unchanging. However, I had to learn to compensate for word find instances, word pronunciation and some fatigue. I should probably take half in day, but I have days fatigue but would rather not due an extra klonipin added to night dose. But this may be needed.

If this works for you and you are on a smaller dosage great. It's made me suffer the entire time I have been on it, granted I do take a higher dosage than probably most of you. I do have to admit, as far as migraines go, I haven't had as many and I normally do.",

I will be going to see if my primary care doctor will prescribe me the new weight loss pill Qsymia next, because it has topiramate in it. I Just need a jump start to getting this weight off of me. I have been reading accounts where people have been losing off of 50mg of topiramate, but not for me hoping maybe in a week I may see results. I have a 30 day supply. Let's hope",

I went to a neurologist after trying home remidies and using Exedrin Migraine, and he put me on Topiramate 50mg twice daily, but my body metabolized it to fast, causing my head to be very painful. Also the first day I took it, I had a pain in my head that woke me from REM sleep, my wife said I was screaming in pain while sleeping. He recommended Trokendi XR 100mg Extended Release. Since I have been on Trokendi, my head hurts daily a little with a slight tingling pain which my neurologist says is normal. I have migraines on a rare occassion.",

Somehow, it helped reduce my asthma symptoms. First time I slept 7 hours in a row since my car accident 5 years prior. Lost 20 lbs easily, but I had to stop taking it due to side effects. It makes certain foods taste terrible; gave me a constant pins/needles/numbness feeling in my hands and feet; dropped things more often; handfuls of hair fell out; sweat turned orange; dumb as box of rocks.

I've been consistently losing two lbs a week and weigh myself every Monday. Still taking 50 mg at night..only noticeable side effects now are tingling in feet and hands intermittently, and fatigue at times otherwise nothing noticeable. I am thinking about increasing dosage. I would like to see quicker results but maybe I'm just being greedy. Two lbs a week is a safe, maintainable weight loss. Hope it keeps up. Currently at 230#",

I have also noticed that I get angry about stuff more than I used to.",

It did help decrease the frequency of my migraines. Unfortunately I started noticing that I was having trouble remembering things. I was feeling like an idiot and was back in school so it was not a good combination. I wasn't in school when I started on this medication so I didn't realize how much it was affecting me.",

The Depakote, amitriptyline and nortriptyline were too sedating. The propranolol worked well, but I had too increase the dosage over time to the point where my blood pressure became too low. Right now a combination of Topamax at 50 mg and propranolol extended release at 60 mg works best for me. There are few adverse effects. The Topamax does cause some frustrating cognitive difficulties but I think I can live with them, considering the relief it gives me from the migraines.",

Once I started to eat and drink (even though I didn't feel like it) the foggy brain, dry eyes and other side effects went away (I am still loosing weight though :) ) and still no migraines.

Topirimate was a god send for the headaches, and my migraines were near enough gone by the second dose. But the side effects were unbearable, I went to see my gp who told me to stop immediately and referred my to my nearest a&e.The tingly fingers and toes literally started after the first dose and only got worse to the point where my both arms were tingling from my finger tips to my elbows and my lips and face were tingling. I lost my thoughts, and felt like I had been knocked over by a truck. This drug is by far the worst experience I've had, if you want to lose confrol of your motor skills then by all means this drug will allow you to do that.",

Theres days where I just lay around in the dark and do nothing. The pounding just takes over and that's all that matters. You are not even you anymore. I was prescribed Topamax on Nov.18th and started one week on 25mg. Nothing changed. Then two weeks on 50mg, again nothing changed. This is my third week on 100mg and I am FINALLY migraine free.

The worst side effect for me has been trouble comprehending, and mild memory loss. When I lowered the dose from 400 to 100 I don't have comprehending or memory problems now. The great part about Topamax is weight loss, and not gaining weight.",

I was put on this because of severe migraines that was shutting down the left side of my body top to bottom. I was only taking 1/2 a pill for 2 weeks which in turn gave me kidney stones. The stones in turn tore my ureter so now I have had 1 blockage from scar tissue and the scar tissue is growing back again. My Ureter has narrowed and now going through all the blood work to see how much my kidney is damaged and different procedures for my tube.

I was very hesitant to start it because of the side affects, but Monday I had the worst migraine with aura I have had in about 6 months. I am taking 25 mg twice a day. My provider wants me slowly elevating by 25 mg per week until I reach 150. I feel very cloudy today, but it might be because I am still recovering from my migraine. I will update in a month.",

It has allowed me to get and maintain a full time job, get a drivers license. And I have a beautiful understanding girlfriend who knows what I deal with. Thankfully I have wonderful insurance that I only pay $20 a month for my Topiramate. Prior to not having insurance. I was in a real pickle. I found a program through Johnson & Johnson where they paid for my Topamax for two years. Saved me about $890 a month. But honestly, great medicine if your doctor gets you on the correct dosage.

I have not reacted well to medications in the past and have had serious reactions which lead to serious consequences to the other meds I was on. Topamax has been the only medication that I have been able to tolerate well. It does take a while for it to start working though and I have had a few side effects but none that I'm not willing to put up with and 2 of them have gone away since I have started the Topamax.",

BUT the side effects were just too much: terrible anxiety, irritability, diarrhea, complete brain fog, intense tingling in fingers, numbness in feet, extreme sensitivity to cold, very frequent urination, changes in taste leading to disinterest in food. I also would not recommend this medication if you are also on birth control pills to alleviate menstrual cramps. That was one of the worst side effects for me - daily cramps for over 3 weeks. If it weren't for that and the anxiety, I may have tried to wait it out.",

I drink like a 2 liter bottle a day. Well, not any more. This medicine has cured me of that in 2 days. All carbonated beverages taste flat like Robitussin cough medicine. Good side is that'll help me lose weight and the better side is I have yet to have my headache.",

I was put onto Topirmirate by my GP at the recommendation of the specialist I saw after plan A stopped working after 6 months. I had some extremity tingling for about 6 weeks when I first started (I was slowly built up to 100mg daily dose). In the interest of full disclosure I am also a type 1 diabetic so I am monitored pretty closely for sight and kidney function and I have had no issues around this. I have also started taking an anti depressant to combat a hormone imbalance issue so I don't get the mood swings either.",

Around 630pm I couldn't see in my left eye it was so blurry I had to close one eye to read. I was also confused felt like a child on ritalin. I was slow pace doing things. I didn't eat, soda tasted flat. Wednesday I woke up with stomach pains blurry vision diarrhea and nausea..what a day to start. No motivation, ringing in my ears, light sensitivity I'm just plan through with this meditation..Thursday today I'm off but still have the side effects I don't know how long it will wear off.

But I can finally sleep at night and feel rested. After reading some of the other comments I now understand why my fingertips sometimes feel numb or weird. I'm still not sure if the weight loss, better sleep are worth the disgusting taste in my mouth and the feeling sometimes that I just want to burst into tears (although that could be just because I work so hard and I'm still broke).",

It took 2 months of intensive treatment for my foot to heal but about 3 weeks after I returned to work, I started experiencing sharp, electrical type pain in my heel. It was excruciating. My doctor prescribed Neurontin at first but I was not able to tolerate it. I was switched to Topamax and within a day, I had full relief and since then, I have been pain free. Yes, I am a juvenile diabetic but I had never had problems with my feet until this happened. The neuropathy is confined to my left heel only. Topamax is the best. The side effects are minimal but even if they weren't, it's worth it to be pain free.",

I actually stopped taking it for 3 months because my I didn't have insurance, and my body felt HORRIBLE. It became WORSE AND WORSE. I started taking it again and I felt SO much better. For those of you that truly experience the extreme fatigue and pain from fibromyalgia, I strongly recommend trying Topiramate.",

I would start talking and would forget the words that came next. My friends and family would have to help me finish my sentences. After getting off the medicine, I could finally finish my thoughts again. However, I feel like I still cannot learn as easily as I did before I got on the medicine. I think it changed my brain processing capability. I have talked to a friend who had the exact same problem on this medicine. I would not recommend it unless you actually cannot live without it.",

During this year, I still suffered from a lot of ups and downs, my anxiety was getting worse and worse, so my mood swings. I kept pushing my psychiatrist, she was skeptical about my mood swings but I knew there was more going on.

When he upped the dose apparently my body did not like that and my migraines came back, just going back down didn't do the trick. After about a year of being off of it and trying 6 other prescriptions, my new doctor said she didn't understand why they had come back when the dose was upped and maybe that it was totally out of my system we could try again. I went back on it and my migraines have decreased from one every day meaning literally 7 days a week to about 3 or 4 a week, but no soda like others stated and this time I had to quit smoking cigarettes because they tasted stale.",
                    "My five year old was prescribed this medicine after he started having breakout seizures on his other medicines. After about two weeks the seizures had not decreased and he started complaining of severe eye pain. A visit to the eye doctor confirmed very high pressure in his eyes. It did not work well for him.",
                    "I started having menopause migraines in June 2014. My doctor started me on 25 mg daily. At first, this medicine helped me but my migraines started to get more frequent. Over the course of 2 years, I was bumped up to 400 mg daily, the max dosage. I always felt that my head was foggy, memory was shot, problems speaking, losing sleep, no appetite and more & more intense migraines. This medicine quit working too. I finally stopped this medicine in March 2017. I immediately noticed a difference in my head. To say this medicine is evil is putting it mildly. Your migraines can get worse while taking Topirimate and unless you pay attention to your body, you won't realize it is the medicine making them worse. Beware when taking this medicine",
                    "If you cannot tolerate Topamax/Trokendi (topamirate), please consider Zonegran (zonisamide). It is in the same class of drug as topamax, and does many of the same things. Its labeled use is an anti-convulsant, but the psychiatric and pain management clinic I go to uses it off-label for a number of uses, such as: weight loss, mood stabilization, migraine prevention, mild pain reduction properties. I took Zonegran successfully at 200 mg for 5 years and DID NOT experience tingling, numbness, dry mouth or flat-tasting carbonated beverages. Memory/recall did degrade unacceptably for me above 200 mg, but therapeutic dose is considered 300 mg.",
                    "I have been taking this medication for about 5 weeks now. Regarding the migraines, I have only had one and this is because I was over tired (not a trigger but felt terrible and it was more a bad headache). I suffer from cluster headaches/migraines and have done since about the age of 12 for about 25 years (now 38). Pretty healthy otherwise, normal weight, would like to lose 7lbs (like most) but had Xmas weight to shift. I was put on 25mg a day - at night. Wow, did I experience the crazy side effects! But, these were to be expected. Appetite reduced, about 7lb lost, until Easter...5 day binge! But, hope to get back on track. Will report back soon",
                    "The main issue I had with this is the side effects. It caused my hands and feet to tingle and feel numb for hours on end. It made me drowsy and extremely moody due to it. I'm not sure if it really worked because after two weeks I stopped taking Topamax because the side effects were so intense.",
                    "I've been in this medication for 3 weeks .At first the effects were unbearable ; brain fog, memory loss , loss for words , sleepingall day . I'm going on my 3rd week and almost all side effects subsided . I still find myself at loss of words sometimes . I started at 121lbs I'm now at 116 and still losing . I find myself never wanting to eat . Soda taste flat . I don't mind . I like the medicine . I take 50mg morning 50mg night prn.",

                    "Topamax is truly a lifesaver I have been on this for many years now for migraine prevention, and I to would get the \"pins and needles\" tingle sinsation in hands and feet. I've found A daily multivitamin helps with that, and believe it or not, prenatal vitamins take it completely away. I hope this helps!",
                    "I have been on Topamax since May of 2015 and it is now September 26, 2015. I did take it for Migraines and boy did it do its job, I was having them every day and now I get them maybe once a month. I started at 25mg went up to 50 twice a day and in the beginning of September went to 100mg where I will stay at and stabilize. Weight loss! Well where do I begin! It has been amazing! I weighed in on May 15 at 167.5lbs, I am only 5' tall, no inches there lol, and I weighed in September 2nd at 141.8lbs. It is amazing to me that I have lost 26lbs without diet or exercise. I have always done yoga and meditation, but not the hardcore kind, the gentle kind. I really haven't changed a thing except for taking Topamax.",
                    "Hello all I'm new!! Over the last few years I went from 125lb to 184lb. I've been taking topirimate and Effexor for about 2 months. My doctor said I would lose weight and I definitely have but I'm afraid to get on the scale. I feel great as far energy goes. Memory loss, wrong words, etc is real. Just look at that sentence formation... This is the best writing I can do on topirimate. Anyway, when I get enough courage to get on the scale, I'll let y'all know...how much or how little success I've had, thus far!!",
                    "My doctor put me on Topamax for my migraine headaches, I was on that medication for about 3 weeks, took 2-25 mg a day. During that time I had one huge migraine and 6 headaches. I felt very tired and couldn't speak clearly and couldn't finish a sentence. I would NOT recommend this medicine to anyone. IT WAS A BAD EXPERIENCE.",
                    "I took Topamax a few years ago and regret it. It has changed my life for the worse. Even after stopping the meds several years ago, I still have bad brain fog, loss of vision, memory loss especially short term, lost the ability to comprehend things and lost ability to do simple functions such as basic math. Prior to taking this medicine I was at the top of my game. Now I feel helpless and the doctors were no help. My vision changed after it, mind you I had lasik eye surgery and could see perfectly fine prior to this. It's frustrating because I have to do things differently now and it's embarrassing because people look at you like something wrong since you can't do simple things a 2 year old can do!",
                    "I have been taking Topomax 25mg 2x a day for 2 weeks now. I was prescribed this medication for mainly migraines, but I also have restless leg syndrome which disrupts my sleep schedule. So far the only side effects I have noticed is that it makes my hands tingle (compare to hitting your funny bone). This medication makes me really sleepy so I only take it at night (helps with my sleep schedule). I also have noticed that I don't eat as much, which is fine with me! I haven't had any migraines since I started taking Topomax which is wonderful given the fact that I usually suffer from one atleast daily!",
                    "I've been taking Topamax (brand) for approximately ten years. Due to severe migraines this was the only medication to prevent what had been dabilitating headaches, nausea & vomiting, sensitivity to light, smell, sound, movement, and dizziness. After several years, my insurance refused to continue payment of the brand until I tried the generic tablets. After 3 days, the original symptoms returned. They finally approved continued payment of brand and now two years later they again have refused to cover (pay) for medication although it falls under the plan. For three months, my neurologist and I have issued appeals with no clear explanation of the denial. I would just like to again take meds to rid myself of this pain.",
                    "I've found topamax to be a useful tool in migraine prevention. I've been fighting these now for over 25 years and I've gone as far as having sinus sx and dentures to replace my top teeth to reduce the triggers of these monstrous headaches. I've come to believe there's no magic pill to take it all away but topamax reduces the severity greatly. The little tingling sensation will go away and saltiness are great when you have to take meds and don't have a full stomach. It helps with the nausea. Whether topamax is the drug for you- don't lose hope. Just keep trying to find the right combination of diet change, sleep, trigger reduction, and meds until you find what works for you.",

                    "A little over 2 years ago I was involved in a MVA, and sustained a traumatic brain injury. My neurologist put me on Trokendi XR for 2 reasons - to prevent seizures and migraines. Prior to the accident, I had always been a fairly healthy 5'7 160 pounds and worked out almost daily, and generally are very healthy. After the accident I became almost sedentary, depressed and suicidal. I had gained over 35 pounds but I honestly didn't much care. The Trikendi XR and the Adderall (prescribed to assist with the severe ADD caused by the brain injury) has helped me lose weight along with proper diet and minimum exercise. My seizures have gone from major, grandmal to pseudo-seizures to seldom, and my migraines have gone from daily to about 4 per week.",
                    "My VA Dr. prescribed Topiramate (Topamax) to me for my Migraines and not only has my appetite decreased, so has my Migraines and my weight. He also added Magnesium and the combination has been nothing short of amazing. Topamax has really been great and I've had no side effects at all, I take 1-50MG tab in the morning and 2 at night and I've been dropping weight, migraines gone and getting back to my old self.",
                    "I have taken it for 1 and 1/2 years for migraine. Also, after developing chronic lower back pain from degenerative discs it has really helped me cope with the pain.",
                    "Currently taking with phentermine. At night. I wake up without the need to binge. I feel like I get a good nights rest also. Went from 172lb to 137lb. 170 days. No adverse effects to report.",
                    "Absolutely the worst drug I have ever taken. Caused me to feel like I had taken acid or was on an LSD trip. Strong lingering effects even 4 days after taking one dose. Significant issues with cognitive ability, change in taste, balance, drowsiness, disorientation, nausea, tingling in hands and legs, numb lips. Inability to think and caused hallucinations. Hospitalized 4 days post medication to administer DHE to counteract this drug. DO NOT TAKE this medication. No warnings on the prescription. Asked pharmacist if this would cause drowsiness, slow my mental function or have any adverse effects and he informed me that 200 mg was low dose and I would have no adverse side effects. Based on my research since taking the drug, this is NOT accurate",
                    "I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder since I was 16 and now that I'm 25. I feel good to have found a medication that helps me. The only problem I have is the fatige. I could sleep alot on this medication. I guess thats still better than being depressed and irritable.",
                    "I've been taking this medication for a little under two weeks. To give you a background, I'll be 20 in a week, and have had migraines with auras since I was about 10. I've had numerous prescription meds, from injections to triptans to hydrocodone, etc, I think topomax makes #13? Anyways, over the last year my migraines have increased in frequency, I'm guessing because of the stress of college, but I get them every week, about twice a week, one right after another( triptans for me usually trigger another migraine) I've been dreading starting this medication, but finally decided to give it ago, as I'm on winter break and quite frankly this is all I have left to try. Literally half of my life has been consumed by this. Right now my right foot is tingling, and my chest hurts, I'm rather dizzy and have been forgetting things all week. I've felt super anxious and down all week, but I haven't had a migraine in 20 days. Sprite tastes flat but I don't really drink soda apart from that so I don't mind, so far this is bearable. I noticed when I went up to 50mg the side effects increased so I'm worried about when I inc to 75 and 100mg, but we shall see. :)",
                    "When I took 50mg of topamax the first time for migraine prevention it worked wonders and I lost 20lbs in a few short months! I stopped it when I got pregnant with my daughter. Once she stopped nursing I restarted it again to help with my migraines and hopefully drop the extra weight I couldn't lose from the pregnancy. It helps with my migraines the second time around but there is no decrease in appetite and no weight loss. Very disappointing.",
                    "I suffer bi-lateral migraines and have been on Topamax for several years off and on now. I have mixed reviews. I LOVE Topamax, because nothing else works for me. In fact I was given Maxalt and Propranolol together and wound up in the hospital almost dead. You can NOT take those two together. All medicines have side effects, so does Topamax. I liked the weight loss in the beginning, but be careful with it. I lost 80 lbs and couldn't stop. I forgot to eat. Topamax makes me just not hungry. I have it fixed now and watch out for it, but it was very scary. The memory loss has been a problem at times, but has been funny too. I have not experienced the HOT they spoke of...I FREEZE ALL THE TIME!",
                    "I have been on this medicine for about a week now. I was on it before for about 3-4 years. After the inital side effects which lasted probably about a month the only one that lasted was that I had a lot of energy, which always isn't so bad. Everyone reacts to medicines differently though. I didn't have such a bad experience with this one.",
                    "I have struggled with weight loss for years. Food cravings are one of my \"symptoms.\" Topamax really did help with this, however my energy and memory are not what they use to be. Originally I thought it was a trade off I could adjust to but the fuzzy memory for me is frustrating. I sometimes say words that I am thinking about and don't even realize it. Then argue that I didn't say it, only to find out I did. Silly, but worth revisitng my physician about. I struggle with the same 10-20 lbs but won't give up. I would recommend trying it to people who are serious about weight loss. It helps you push your plate away and not obsess about food. That was an experience I had never had before, but I need my memory.",
                    "I have been off and on Topamax for about 5 years now and I must say that it works better for bipolar mood stabilization than any other one out there. The one thing I love the most about this medicine is that it is helping me lose weight. They need to put in the time to verify that this drug is in fact a mood stabilizer because it certainly does help with bipolar disorder.",
                    "I was taking 400mg daily for chronic migraines, depression, and weight loss. It's very important to build up slowly otherwise the side effects can be extreme. I lost around maybe 50lbs while on it. When I got up to 300 - 400mg I started to have memory problems and sleep issues. After a while I felt like it had stopped working and dropped it, but that could have been from me forgetting to take it (memory issues remember). It takes a few weeks to a few months for the side  effects to fully wear off. I started at 235 or 245, and went down to 185. I'm now back up to 200. I haven't exercised in years, and I didn't change my diet (I probably don't eat as healthy as I should).",
                    "Topamax worked great to relieve my daily headaches and migraines. Taking it twice daily, it didn't take long to start enjoying life again without headaches, but as time went on, the side effects just kept getting more and more intense. I could deal with the tingling in my fingers, hands, and feet, but waking up completely disoriented, not being able to think straight or concentrate, not being able to form sentences or find the right words finally got to me after about a year/year and a half and I weened off of it. It's unfortunate because it felt amazing not to have headaches everyday. I am also small to begin with and I lost about 15 pounds on it, I usually had to force myself to eat due to having absolutely no appetite.",
                    "With side effects of many other meds being a problem I went on this as it worked well for my mom. Dr. explained that genetics play a part in medicine effectiveness as well as diseases. It had an immediate effect on my severe depression. It also helps with mild psychotic episodes during mania for me. (Voices, hearing noises that aren't there) There is a slight tapering of appetite for me that stabilizes after prolonged use. I also have to search for common words sometimes. Pins and needles in my hands and feet, especially when I'm driving or it's really cold outside. Extreme thirst and I rarely sweat, even when working out. ALL tolerable and SO much better compared to laying in bed all day long.",
                    "First week ok. Dizzy first day. Overwhelming sense of wellness for the first week, minus dizzy feeling. I thought this is great.  When I increased the dose as prescribed the second week I developed a headache the next day. Had pains in my abdomen, all throughout my back. Continued for 2 more weeks then my body shut down, had the worst migraine that lasted 2 days. I slept for 4 days. Then muscle weekness, nausea, and persistent headache. My bladder was painful and felt like I could not empty it. Three days off them, I can finally stand up straight, but I lost a week of work. Might have been ok if dose was not increased.",
                    "Works extremely well to prevent my migraines.",
                    "This is a fantastic medication. The day I was prescribed it and started taking it was nothing short of a miracle. I had never heard of anything like it before. I had been on and off trials of anti-depressants like Zoloft, Wellbutrin, Zypreza, etc for years and none of them did anything for me. This was an entirely different class of medication and the new psychopharmacologist I had told me so before he gave it to me. When it kicked in after several weeks I literally felt it one day while riding the bus. I was trying to have one of those negative, anxiety-ridden feelings and a flush just came over me that downgraded that sensation. The only drawback is that this medication completely stopped working for me after one and a half years.",
                    "I've been taking this 100g for about 4months now; completely made a difference to my life I no longer have worry of waking up or been at work with migraines. I've had maybe a couple bad headaches but a migraine maybe once since taking these tablets. Although I'm finding the side effects difficult; memory loss is seeming to be tricky especially as I'm 24 and I'm forgetting the most simplest things. I've had a few anxiety attacks. Can't stomach coco cola taste flat. Mood swings seem to be a change in behaviour, feeling frustrated , and impatient And I'm extremely paranoid since I've been taking them don't like been alone etc.",
                    "I've been on Topamax (topiramate) for 6 years, and loved it at first. My migraines decreased dramatically, I had weight loss from the appetite suppression, and I overall felt better. But I had pretty bad tingling in my hands and all over my face for the whole time I've taken it. Also more recently, I've made the connection with my severe memory loss to the medication. I used to be able to retain information and facts like an elephant, but I can hardly recall simple words some days. I'm planning on going off the Topamax (with the direction of my neuro) because the memory loss issue is so disturbing to me.",
                    "Good",
                    "I was very excited when I started taking this medication. And then.... I had read the side effects and was like oh this is crazy. I will say I was on no other medication. I have never had hair loss like this. It was gobs of hair in my shower. The previous posters that refer to brain fog - yep that too.",
                    "I was prescribed Topamax many years ago... before they even offered a generic version and before they could legally prescribe it for obesity! So, my doctor prescribed it to me for migraines because I had a slight history of migraines but she said it would cause weight loss. Oh boy, did it! I was over 200lbs and in a size 18 pants, within 6 months I was in a size 8 pants! By the time a year rolled around, I was 103lbs and in a 00!!! No exercise! This is a wonder drug. I felt great! I had quit smoking, cut out all sugars and red meat, minimal alcohol. This medicine effects the addiction part of the brain as well as other areas. It's just amazing! I did warn my friends that I would forget sentences halfway thru; in 4 weeks no side effects.",
                    "I've been on Topamax before and it worked and went off I don't know why. I recently went back on it and it has made a world of difference. It's like night and day. I take it with Abilify and Xanax because I have really bad anxiety also. I am 24 and was so depressed I wasn't leaving my apartment but now I feel like a new person like I want to go out and do things again. I'm not held back. I like that this medicine doesn't make me gain weight too because I've had that problem in the past, I lost 10 pound since I went back on it 4 weeks ago. The only thing I will say that is not great is it slows down my thought process sometimes and it gives me tingles in my hands and face but not all the time. The benefits outweigh those side effects greatly.",
                    "Terrible side effects.",
                    "Absolutely horrible!! It wasn't until a yr of several tests, scans and a colonoscopy that made me go to another Dr and beg him to find out what was wrong with me. I never dreamed it was this medicine. I had lost 30 lbs but I had diarreha, funny taste in mouth, weak, hair loss, foggy, memory was bad, felt like my muscle mass was going down to nothing...my daughter said I was looking frail all the time. It started getting hard to get out of bed...this went on for a yr and a half.I was getting older and taking care of my elderly folks so I didn't read into it much. I'm so glad I switched drs...he noticed immediately what it was and told me to wean myself off of it.",

                    "I took this medication for nearly two months before seeking a second opinion about my hormonal migraines. I was only having 1-2 migraines a month; however they would last 4-5 days at a time. When the pain medications didn't help, my doctor started me on Topamax. I do a great deal of technical writing and crisis management in my job, and my migraines really got in the way. I was able to deal with the weight loss and taste changes, but the difficulty in concentrating became a serious issue. When I started losing hair, that was the last straw. If my migraines became worse I may return to Topamax though.",
                    "Note that everyone's experience with medication is different. I feel like it's important for others to know the risks as well as the benefits of a medication and then decide for themselves if it's worth a try. That being said, this is my experience. I started this medication for migraines caused by different medication that I'm taking for depression. So far, my anxiety is horrible and I'm extremely paranoid about everything, also I'm very depressed with suicidal thoughts. I haven't had weight loss but rather, weight gain! I become delusional and lose touch with reality, I'm very agitated and my body feels like it's made of bruises. Anyway, I've become a completely different person but not in a good way. It's not worth all the suffering!",
                    "if you have anxiety or depression DO NOT i repeat Do NOT take this medication i was only on it a couple weeks but for two weeks it made me so anxious and so depressed i wanted to kill myself. this drug made me suicidal luckily there was no self harm but i would strongly advise against it!",
                    "I have been taking 25MG of Topamax before bed daily for the prevention of my migraines with aura. Been taking it for almost 2 months. I haven't had an aura or a migraine since I started taking it. I love this medicine! Only side effect I have noticed so far is tingling in my feet sometimes, but so far not bad. The one thing that is bothersome about this medicine is that birth control bills are less effective and its recommended to use a different form of birth control. IUD is what I think I'm going to try. ",
                    "I was on Topamax for 6 years and it worked very well until this past winter when I realized the migraines were starting to increase in frequency again, so my doctor has switched me to Bystolic and I'm tapering off the Topamax. But for a long time Topamax was wonderful. The first 3 months were hell and my boyfriend almost left me but I started taking a small amount of antidepressants and that seemed to calm me down. Or maybe it was a coincidence. Anyway all of the side effects did go away except for the difficulty remembering words. I am looking forward to not having to fumble for words any more, but it was a small price to pay for no migraines.",
                    "My neurologist added Topamax to my tricyclic and beta-blocker in hopes that it would control my vestibular migraines (total balance loss). It failed completely, but its side effects included immediate impotence, decreased libido, and substantial difficulty finding words. My vocabulary for 3 syllable words dropped 50%. I sounded drunk.",
                    "I've been on Topamax for quite a few months now, and I love it for the most part! I have only had the occasional minor headache, but the side effects are good/bad. The good ones in my book are the weight loss and carbonated beverages and other sweet things tasting horrible. The bad side effects are tingling, usually in my fingers and confusion/'blonde moments\" but those are usually more pronounced the more tired I am. I can live with the bad side effects so much easier than I can a migraine everyday!",
                    "This medication has been a life saver for me. After the initial side effects of tingling hands and feet, funny tasting carbonated drinks, loss of words, which lasted only a couple of weeks and a massive weight loss of 30kg (60lb approximately) everything settled down nicely. I have been taking Topamax for over two years now with no problems whatsoever and in those two years have only had one migraine that was not nearly as bad as what I used to experience. For me, this is the best medicine I've ever been prescribed.",
                    "I got put on Topamax about 3 years ago, I felt it wasn't helping with my migraines so I took myself off. Then I had a seizure because I didn't have it. So I started back on it and had no luck with migraines. I quit taking it again and more seizures. Ever since I've been on it I have had seizures and they are not in my family at all.",
                    "I was given this medication several years ago in an attempt to reduce migraines. I began using the lowest prescribed dose, as instructed by my physician. On the 3rd night, 3-4 hours after taking my 3rd dose, I woke out of a sound sleep with tachycardia (fast heart rate). I didn't know what was up. To \"calm down\" I took a shower. By afternoon of that day, I knew that it was the medication. I had pressure in my head, tachycardia, nausea. This is about the worst I have ever felt. Needless to say, I had to discontinue Topamax immediately. I long for the day when medications can be chosen based on genetic coding information. For many people, Topamax is a God-send; but not for me.",
                    "Started this as a mood stabilizer for my bipolar. I've been on it almost 30 days now, it has stabilized my moods for sure! Usually before my period I'm a monster. A crazy hormonal mess. I feel normal, not \"flat\". It's a double win for my constant headaches and hormonal migraines that are now gone too. Only side effects, minor pins and needle tingles in my toes and fingers which last seconds off and on and aren't even bothersome too me. It seems to happen with each increase I do.",
                    "I take this as a mood stabalizer it has really helped level out my moods",
                    "I believe alot of the negative side effects are caused from not eating or drinking. Once I started to eat and drink water foggy brain and unpleasant side effects went away (I am still loosing weight though :) ) and still no migraines. I also split my dosage 50 mg morning 50 mg at night, this has helped minimize side effects.",
                    "I've been taking Topiramate, 50mg twice a day, for several years. At first, it worked great and I was recommending it to all my migraine sufferer friends, but gradually, week by week, I seem to have built up a resistance to it and recently, the migraines are back with a vengeance. I have a condition that causes the migraines and I get them most days now. Also, I can only take paracetamol as I take blood thinning medication and it doesn't work for me at all as a painkiller. The side effects I personally get with Topiramate are negligible compared to the pain of migraine, I have 'brain fog' now and then, temporarily forget words, peoples names, etc. But it's back to the Dr. again now to ask for an alternative preventative - if there is one",
                    "Female. 19. I had sinus surgery then started getting headaches after surgery because of nerve damage. I was taking 25mg once every night for a week and every next week would up the dose. My experience was awful! I had the usual side affects people had- tingling in lips/hands, and weight loss. Main one for me was, I was so extremely fatigued and weak. I'm a young healthy girl who eats healthy, is a healthy weight, and before my surgery worked out 4 X a week. I would have physically to force myself out of bed. And as far as the headaches it reduced the intensity of the migraines, but did nothing for the frequency. ",
                    "I suffered a stroke in '04 and my neurologist prescribed Neurontin to deal with the resulting numbness and tingling on the right side. A year later, and after emergency gall bladder surgery, he put me on a low dose of Topamax instead. It worked well, but I've had to eventually increase the dosage. The side effects were minimal; I needed to lose the 35 lbs I lost (and my wardrobe needed updating :0), and the additional tingling is nothing compared to what I feel when I don't take it. Expensive!",
                    "I've been taking Topamax for about 2 years now, 100 mg a day. I have severe chronic migraines due to my spinal cord. So my doctor put me on this medication. The only side effect I've had was the tingling but I get that anyways even before this medication so who knows if it was a side effect. But it works ok for me when I take it regularly but I also have focal seizures so this medication is for both of my problems. But I always take it with my hydrocodone so my migraines are fine.",
                    "Topamax is very good at helping me with keeping my seizures away. My main problem though, is sometimes anywhere between 3:00 and 5:00 in the afternoon I have a \"nap crash\". Meaning my eyes want to close because I feel drowsy no matter how much I try to fight it and within a few minutes after my eyes close I'm completely unconscious.",
                    "Well I was on Topamax for approximately 6mos. My doctor hoped that he would be able to get me to the medicinal dosage of about 25mg twice daily. However I could not stand the way the medicine made me fall asleep. If I took it at 8pm, I passed out by 8:15. I can say that I was getting the BEST sleep of my life. I was afraid to take it in the morning before/during or after work, so I only took it once I got home. I only got to the 5mg dosage before I stopped taking it.",
                    "I love this medication. I have chronic migraines. It was nothing for me to have 5 in 3 days. I started this medicine and I have only have two migraines and it was nothing compared to what they used to be like. I only had one side effect my soda tasted funny. I don't drink soda any more... Easy fix. I've been on it for 4 months now. I would highly recommend it.",
                    "I really hated taking this medicine . At only 25 mg I was feeling like a zombie all day , very dizzy , confused , had a hard time putting sentences together . Very embarrassing I couldn't drive cause I was almost always crashing due to the. Lack of concentration. Also I was always angry . I didn't even want my kids to come near me :( that's when I decided to stop taking it. It really did help me loose weight but I rather loose weight on my own than to have to go through that nightmare again.",
                    "I have suffered from migraines for the past three years. I would wake up with a headache almost every single day and have a headache at least 27 days out of every month. I started taking just about a week ago and have only had one headache. I could not be any happier. I have had one strange side effect (a yeast infection), but that's a small price to pay for being headache free. I could not be happier.",
                    "I went on topiramate January 2012 for migraines with positive results. By the end of of 2012 I had lost 85lbs. I had also lost the ability to form sentences because I couldn't find words and was constantly in a fog. That is not good if you're a nurse. Also my short term memory was non existent also not good for an acute care medical nurse. By the time the side effects became debilitating, I had to take a short leave of absence to sort out my situation. In the end, the medication was discontinued and I gained 23lbs of the weight back. I'm not upset because now I have my short term memory back, plus I've returned to work migraine free. I'm still better off because I'm still thinner than before I started with topiramate.",

Thank you.",
                    "I weighed 230 pounds and felt like a cow.. I started off on 25 mg 1x a day and noticed no change. So asked doc to change me to 100 mg twice a day. I just take the 200mg at once. That's when I finally noticed a change. I've lost 45 pounds in 6 months! I'm continuing to lose and my goal weight is 160 since I'm tall so only 25 more pounds to go. I noticed at first pop tasted different but now it tastes fine. I used to love beer but now I don't want it..which is fine since it's so fattening lol. I only eat once or twice a day and the carb cravings are gone. I don't exercise much at all. I have no side effects at all. I'm so glad I found this medication it really has been a miracle. :)",

Took only 30 for days worked great but my blood pressure went from 128/78 before starting to 178/116 the day I stopped it . My Doctor told me it probably wasn't the Trokendi XR because there is no listing of raising blood pressure in the list of side effects, but 1 week after stopping it my BP is back to normal . USERS BEWARE !!!",

I do have some weight loss a plus for me and some tingerling in my feet but if you eat at least 2 bananas a fm day this really helps and make multi vitermins",

Next day was completely out of sorts, depth perception was off, felt outside myself, brain fog, headache, shaky, numbness in hands, burning in heals, no appetite, nothing tasted right, pop had no sweetness, next day same symptoms to a lessor extent with a constant tremor, overheating with movement, confusion, mood swings and horrible mental fog, then a headache hitting about 9 out of 10, worse than my average. I decided to discontinue that evening. The next day felt hungover, had light sensitivity, diarrhea and an upset stomach. Next day, the cloud slowly has lifted, my taste buds have not returned yet and pretty fatigued.",
                    "As I type this it is hard to relay it understandably because of the Topamax. I researched Topamax and heard it suppressed eating and stabilized mood which I figured would helped my bulimia, which I have been getting help for and am in recovery for. The Topamax definitely suppresses the desire to eat and have cravings which is great. You do lose weight. However, it created other problems. I didn't realize it but I was increasingly having a harder time talking to people. I can't do homework, write papers, and my relationship with my boyfriend- we ended breaking up. My hair falls out. I had bad anxiety, I thought I was going insane. I then researched side effects of Topamax and now realized this is what I am experiencing. I'm getting off.",
                    "I have Tourette's Syndrome and ADHD. Tried different kinds of medicines for my TS. Depending on my day, I could have some to a lot of tics. Topamax did wonders for my tics, but it can have side effects that are similar to ADHD symptoms - different remembering some words/names when asked, unable to concentrate, etc. I also experienced that my thought-pattern were kind of limited to a certain degree, as I would sometimes have difficulties thinking further ahead. This medicine however, was much better than other kinds I've tried. ",
                    "I was prescribed this medicine to treat my petite mal seizures. I was never warned of any potential side-effects, and never thought to ask, seeing as I had never taken a medicine before. After I began taking this, my seizures graduated to full out grand mal seizures. I couldn't speak, I couldn't understand others' speech, and I couldn't sleep more than a few hours most nights. Everything came to a heads about four months after I began taking the medicine, when I couldn't remember how to say \"Bye\" to my dad. I would have rather had seizures EVERY day than stay on Topamax! I got off of the medicine, and am now on Lamictal, under which I haven't had any seizures or side-effects in the two years I've been taking it.",
                    "After 2 years of terrible 3 days disabling migraines I did have a break from the migraines with this medicine. It took 2 months to decrease pain from 8 to 2. I do have to follow a very strict diet , I use the pre-diabetic diet even though I'm not have diabetes.",
                    "I was prescribed Topamax as a preventative migraine med. It was effective in significantly reducing migraine. However it gave me insanely severe sinus/hayfever symptoms. I couldn't leave the house because my nose was running like a tap. I was sneezing all the time and totally stuffed up. I got all the other usual digestive upset side effects, but I could live with those as they seemed to reduce as time went on whereas the sinus problems intensified.",
                    "I was suffering from migraine, 10 times a month on average during late 2014. I have been always suffering from Migraine for years, but it was more frequently than before. I consulted a doctor in Dubai, educated in Sweden and Canada, a very successful doctor. He prescribed Topamax, for 6 months. In 2 months, I ended up going into depression, first time in my life! I had to quit the medicine as I was travelling to UK, and forgot taking the medicine with me and they don't sell this without prescription. After quitting, depression gone. I thought this is coincidence. Until I saw the doctor again, again prescribed Topamax. Again, after 2 months - depression. Mood swings, almost suicidal thoughts - I quit, depression gone. NOT RECOMMENDED!!",

                    "This drug isn't for everyone. The side effects are completely crazy. I have been on it for almost 12 months now. It has provided relief from migraines by almost 95% of the time. This has been a big deal for me. Side effects I've experienced: hands and feet tingle periodically (some days are worse than others), hair loss started 3 months after taking it but began to cease 6 months later, definite brain fog (some days I feel like I'm losing my mind), grogginess (I can only take my dose at night otherwise I'm a zombie during the day), changes in vision, loss of appetite, fatigue, irritability. At first I convinced myself the side effects were worth tolerating compared to having a migraine. But as time goes on, I'm beginning to think im wrong",
                    "This pretty much saved my life. I've been on EVERYTHING (or so it seems) for major depressive disorder and when I was about 32 something wasn't adding up and I was diagnosed BP2. I tried Lamictal and I couldn't handle the headaches. The other BP medications all seem to cause weight gain so I'd stop taking them. I got a new doctor who said if I tried lithium she would give me a little Topiramate to help offset the hunger the lithium caused. Well, the topiramate seemed to help the BP2. So I've slowly worked up to 150/day topiramate along with wellbutrin and Lexapro. It's a GODSEND. Side effects: when titrating up at any point, tingly fingers or feet for a week but then goes away. Take at night because can make you sleepy. Hope FDA approves!",
                    "I was placed on this for Miragine prevention. The weight loss was cool, but the resulting High Blood Pressure not cool. So much so that I was not able to be put on birth control medication. I am no longer on this medication and still am suffering from HBP. I do not smoke or drink and my blood pressure was perfect before starting this medication.",
                    "I started this medication at the suggestion of my neurologist in June 2016. I was overweight and having frequent migraines. I started on 25mg and increased by 25 mg every week until I was at 100 mg. I started to notice slow weight loss at first, and my migraines were instantly better. The weight loss definitely increased once I got to 100mg. After the one month mark the doctor increased me to 125mg and the wight loss slowly continued. As of now I am down 27lbs and still going! As some have said the side effects of \"word soup\" and tingling in my hands and feet have all happened, but they have all worn off once I have become used to the increased dosage (which is a good and bad thing). I'll be talking with the dr soon! Good luck everyone!",
                    "I still get slight headaches once in a while, and use Excedrin Migraine with the Topamax, but its nothing compared to what I had. The side effects go away and the ones that don't, you get used to. I still have memory problems, so I had to lower the dose.",
                    "I was given Topiramate for a list of conditions including Fibromyalgia, Migraines, Weight Loss, and tremors. I was prescribed only 25 mg 1 X a day. As for side effects, I have found that many foods do not taste the same including yogurt and cottage cheese. They tasted old or out dated. I don't usually drink carbonated beverages, but those I have, tasted fine. I had a decrease in appetite beginning the first month, but only realized it upon looking back after a weigh in at my doctors office where I had lost 20 lbs. I had no migraine episodes during that first month, my Fibromyalgia had improved only slightly and my tremors improved also slightly. After 6 months, I had lost a total of 30 lbs with out trying as my appetite had decreased.",
                    "I can't believe I happened to read an article in my Dr office on topirimate today about weight loss. 3 years ago I took it for migraines and it worked . I also lost 100 lbs with very little exercise . I thought it was due to my not eating carbs.. Lolol. I stopped the topirimate and immediately put on 30 lbs. Well you can bet I pulled those pills back out of my meds box qjd am now going to take them !!! And maybe my migraines will let up a little. I stopped the pills because I was cutting down on all the meds and thought I could go without .. No more of that !!",

                    "After suffering with migraines for over 10 years Topamax has been a life saver. I had tried several other medicines but they would only work for a while and then stop working for me all together. I have been on Topamax for over a year now and went from 4 or 5 migraines a month to one every couple of months. I am currently taking 200mg/day (100mg in the morning and evening). Side effects are minimal compared to the agony of having migraines all the time.",

I've had no fuzziness or other issues, I'm sharp as ever and I've lost about 15 lbs so far, I was a muscular 140 lbs at 5'1\", about a size 8 and now I'm about 126, still losing and down to a 6. I'm about to make the step up to 200mg. I went up in weekly steps of 25mg. My doctor told me this was best and that there is a serious skin condition and an eye disease that can result from jumping up to a high dose too quickly, so I suggest asking your doctors about a slow triation to achieve maximum benefit and avoid fogginess.",
                    "After menopause, migraines soared to three per week. Top ax 50 mgs daily has been a miracle drug. Not one headache in 18 months. One side effect is dry eyes and dry mouth. Easy to live with that in lieu of disabling migraines that eroded my life.",

I have been taking it for about a year now and the only time I get migraines is when I don't refill my prescription right away. Even though I get the occasional migraine, it is nothing compared to what it was before I started taking the medicine. Also, I have not noticed any side effects. Topamax is a miracle!",
                    "First- there is absolutely no difference between brand and generic. There can't be legally. It is the same active ingredient and the same strength. It's just the name and cost and inactive ingredinets.  This being said... I don't understand where negative remarks come from. This medicine is amazing. I took it a while ago then asked to be changed to something else. I gained 20lbs and the other med didn't so anything. So I asked to be changed back. My leg muscles hurt and I have a few word issues but it's an amazing medicine.",

Been on it about 4 months and gone are the daily headaches, shooting head pains, and many days of debilitating migraines. I am just starting to lose weight. I have the head fog and the loss for words. My tongue tingling has gone and mostly I just have the \"falling asleep\" of my fingers and toes, which is annoying, but manageable. I am on 100mg a day. I am hoping that this will take me through menopause.",

Over the years (I'm now 55) I have tried many drugs for the treatment of or prevention of migraines. I get the classic vascular migraine with an aura each time I get a migraine. I finally was prescribed Topamax as a preventative, the final dose that worked was 75mg in am and 75mg in pm. My migraines went from daily to MAYBE once a month. I took this for 3 years at least. I was just at the point of quitting it when I lost my job so I had no choice. The reason I was quitting it was that I lost SO MUCH WEIGHT that I looked anorexic! And soon realized that my memory was HORRIBLE!",

Constant anxiety, panic attacks, insomnia, nerve zaps, tingling, numbness, visual disturbances, memory loss, brain fog, you name it. Ruined my life for a good month and I was only on 50 mg. Currently tapering off and already feeling better!",

I lost all the weight that I gained after being on Zyprexa and Depakote, and my moods were controlled well for about two and a half years. I had minimal negative side effects that seemed to fade after a few months' use. For the last six months I've been struggling with dosage adjustments and adding new drugs to my cocktail while trying to keep Topamax. Finally I'm giving up and going off Topamax because it's not doing anything anymore. ",

Had to cancel a follow up apt with Neurologist due to an emergency and would take about a month to get back in so I was now on it for 6 weeks at the 25 mgs. A week before my apt while at work I started stuttering really bad and just couldn't put my sentences together and was very out of it. My supervisor took me to the ER thinking I was having a stroke. They did both a CT scan and a brain MRI but they were clean. I continued for another week same symptoms. Stopped the Topamax and it has all gone away.",

Topiramate makes you less hungry, the rest is up to you. (I did get some brain fog.) I took magnesium and biotin, as the reduced appetite can cause nutritional deficiencies in some that can give you hair loss if you aren't careful and the magnesium helps you \"go\"! If you're taking that Topiramate at night, a small dose of melatonin every few days (if you take melatonin consistently every night your own pineal gland will stop producing it and you'll have more sleep probs!)",

I lost 10 lbs within 14 days which was nice but dropping the weight that fast caused major stomach issues. I never had the tingling others have had though. If it wasn't for the weight loss and insomnia it could have been a miracle migraine medicine!",

I used to get at least 15 migraines in a month and now I don't even get 15 migraines a year. Some side effects that I have noticed are a decreased appetite and it makes me forget words. When I started it I weighed 165 (which I gained 35 pounds from amitriptyline) and now I am down to 115. A lot of that weight was lost from healthy eating and exercising, but it curbs my appetite a lot and I don't feel the need to impulsively eat in between meals or snack. I also have noticed that it makes my brain foggy and it makes me forget words mid-sentence. Other than that, it saved my life!!",
                    "I cannot recommend this medication. Yes it did prevent migraines but the side-effects far outweighed the benefit. My doctor put me on a gradual increase in dosage and I was unable to get past the first week. After a couple of days I lost control of my own thoughts and focused on every negative I my mind could come up with. My work was impacted. I work in an accounting office and lost my ability to count and remember the alphabet. Not to mention I would stop talking in mid-sentence quite often. I knew what I needed to say but my mouth just wouldn't do it. My short term memory was non-existent and I decided to stop taking this medication after I forgot where I was driving to on my way to work; the same place I've been to for the last 9 years.",

I even lost a job because of my migraines. I had to plan my life around them. Now at 35, I've been on Topamax for 6 years and it's changed my world. It's given me a life back. I'll still get an occasional headache that requires me to break out the Imitrex, but nothing serious. I haven't had too many problems with side effects other then having a little less quick recall/memory, but not enough to really matter. Potassium seems to help with the side effects. My main side effect is getting rash/hives from overheating. ",

I felt completely drugged. When the generic came out, I was switched to it. It didn't make me loopy like the brand name did, but I didn't think it worked as well either. I get more migraines on it by a lot than I got on brand name Topamax and I think I'm on the highest dose. I take one 200 mg pill in the morning and one 200 mg pill at night.",

The second time I was put on it was after I was diagnosed and put on mood stabilizers and my doctor wanted to try it again because he thought my depression may have been from my bpd not the meds and it really did help my migraines. Same exact thing happened. Within a few weeks of being on it my mild bipolar disorder was uncontrollable. I wish I could be on it because it really helped my head and counteracted weight gain from my other meds but my body just cannot handle it.",
                    "I have been taking Topamax for mood disorder for the past six months along with my antidepressant and anxiety meds and I thinks it's GREAT! It's improved my mood so much with no side effect. I recommend it to anyone.",
                    "I have been on the med for one full week. My doc prescribed me 50mg 2 x's daily. I immediately noticed a moderate fatigue. But it has been better toward the end of the week. My mind is a bit cloudy but it too is also a bit better by the end of the week. On the positive I have had no tingling in my fingers and toes like many reviews I have read. Carbonated drinks taste terrible. I was a Diet Pepsi ahololic , and should stop drinking it anyway. And without out any other dietary changes I went from 210 to 206 this week! So, now I am going to eat healthier this week and see what happens. Rating a 9 only because of the fatigue. Good luck in your journey!",
                    "I was prescribed topamax as a migraine preventative & had a terrible experience from it. Not only did it fail to prevent migraines, it made me develop kidney stones. I had never had one before using this awful drug,which also made me feel constantly tired & forgetful. The worst part is that once you kidney stones your body is more susceptible to getting them again & you most certainly will. For anyone unfamiliar with the pain from kidney stoned I can assure you it is sheer agony. And even worse is the hellacious migraine that lasts for days that comes along with it. It's so bad that even medicines like imitrex won't work on it. There are blogs & websites which tell of the awful experiences people have had with this drug. Beware.",
                    "I have been taking it for mood and it works wonders! Mood is stable with only one side affect.",
                    "I was on this medication for about three years to prevent migraine. It decreased the amount of migraines I would have each month but I still got them. I did experience side effects such as tingling in heels, constantly tired, diarrhea, weight loss and change in taste (specifically with carbonated beverages). I was recently hospitalized for a separate issue and the doctor's would not let me take topiramate. I ended up discontinuing it all together to see how I would adapt. I noticed that the diarrhea I was experiencing was not IBS like I had thought, but because of topiramate. It was terrible and I had  previously been taking an anti-diarrheal about 5 days a week. I feel like I've got my life back since discontinuing.",
                    "I just took my first dose of Topamax last night and have already started to notice some of the side effects. I normally am ADDICTED to Red Bull. Now I can't even stand the taste, just after one dose. My mouth has also been tingling all day and I ate just one pop tart and got extremely full. Reading every one else's reviews is comforting. I am also still on propranolol because my migraines were coming back.",

                    "I have to say that the side effects are pretty harsh, but you have to remember that migraines are pretty debilitating and make life unbearable. I'll take forgetting words rather than having 20 or more migraines a month. The first month of taking the med is the absolute worst, but your doctor should strongly warn you and advise you that this will happen and encourage you to work through it. I kept remembering her words and am glad I did. started slowly, with 25 mg in the morning, working up to 25 mg twice a day, then 50 mg at night with 25 in the morning, then up to 50 mg twice a day by the end of the month. Never ever start bing bang boom all at once, or you won't want to continue. Maybe for those who quit, you could try again.",
                    "I wish I would have read these reviews before I started taking topamax instead of wandering around like a clueless zombie wondering what the hell was wrong with me. As of now I have no solution to my chronic migraines but what else is new, this is the story of my life. Topamax surly isn't the solution. I have no clue if topamax would have worked if taken longer but the side effects are not worth it. Even their website says they are unclear as to how it works. Wtf. I basically felt like I was moving around with no destination.. I couldn't focus, I felt lost, I kept doing things on repeat. I can't live like that. My driving was off. My sight was blury. The pins and needles feeling's in my hands and feet was just awkward and inconvenient.",

                    "Horrific experience! It was working, but had to stop to protect sanity. Side effects were SO AWFUL, that I give it a \"2\" rating, despite effectiveness of quitting, a \"9\". Piece of cake to reduce by half, in a matter of days, with zero effort. 46 year smoker. Had to stop before ever reached full dosage. Almost went to ER, to have myself admitted for psych treatment. (Also lost 20lbs., in one month, with no effort.) Trust me - I would have loved to have stayed on it. Some effects - mild paranoia, visual and auditory hallucinations, cry at drop if a hat, intense sense of insecurity, inadequacy, fear of loss of self-control. 3 months later, still smoking about 25% less and 10lbs loss. Other side effects I can't recall, except acne and weird skin rash.",
                    "This medicine did reduce the frequency of my migraines. However, it caused severe memory loss, problems with concentration, and an inability to remember certain words. This led to my GPA plummeting after years of hard work to keep myself on the Dean's List, severely decreased my scores on the GRE, and decreased my chances of getting into graduate school. I'm off the pills now and looking for a different option; there is no way I can keep my job in tech support if I start the pills again. ",

I had a very difficult time comprehending very basic stuff. I was put on it for my headaches I've dealt with for near 2 decades. My dr took me off my medication I've been on for 18 years suddenly, which has worked for my heaches, and switched me to Topimax. I decided to push through because I was no longer getting my medication that worked for me and I kept being told that the brain fog would get better wich it has the past 2 weeks. New problem is my hair is falling out in clumps. Every day literal clumps of hair fall out in the shower.",

This prompt to go on line to see if my medicine was the caused of this. The 1st few comments I started reading were people saying their hair thinning out. So I am going to assume this medication is culprit of my hair thinning. What do you think?",

Immediately stopped taking it.",

The second week I was supposed to move up to 50, the third week 2 75mg and then finally to 100mg on the fourth week. I never really had to move past 25mg. My migraines all but stopped after a month of being on the medication and at the lowest dose. I had all the side effects - tingling, weight loss (very happy about it too), forgetting certain words and the nasty taste of soda. That was okay because I only drink it very rarely anyway. I was getting 1-2 migraines a week and now, I may have 1-2 a year. Most of the side effect seemed to have faded with time as well. Very, very pleased with this medication.",

We had tried her on nearly every other Bipolar medicine on the market, with no results. We took her completely off every other drug, and started her on Topamax as a solitary treatment and within 30 days she was a new person, and has been stable on Topamax now for over 5 years. We started at 25mg and worked our way up until we had the proper dose. At age 19 she takes 200 mg per day...100mg in the morning and 100mg in the evening.",

The first night I took it I felt nothing so I figured no side effects. The next day I still was in pain and took my medication that night I had a very severe reaction to it and was taken to the ER... I felt like I had a million bugs crawling through my skin and I couldn't see clearly. I have friends who this has worked for but for me it did not",

I have had only 2-3 migraines since my Dr upped my dosage 3 months ago. I still get \"regular\" headaches 4-5 times a day but I can handle those. I was gearing 5--6 migraines a week before Topamax. The side effects are all there but I don't care as long as the migraine pain stays away.",

But my nausea \"attacks\" are totally debilitating and the headaches get more so every day. I took Topamax starting at 25 mgs then increased. I noticed it really helping my symptoms, way less nausea, headaches stopped and I could sleep well.  Unfortunately, I am one of the people who react with a rare side effect of an acute onset closed angle glaucoma attack and my vision got very blurry and got so bad I could not see anything but blobs if it was more that 12 inches from my face. If you get blurred vision go to the ER and show them the letter from the Topamax website, because ER had never heard of that reaction. I gave it a 5 because it worked until then.",
                    "I love the weight loss attribute to this drug. When at a dosage of 50 or 75 mg per day, I have felt happier. One day, I doubled the 50 mg dosage in the late afternoon. Note: This doubled dosage was done 4 MONTHS after initially being prescribed the medicine. 100 mg of generic Topiramate made me feel wired. An hour later, I could be found with a full cart at the grocery store.The manic in me had returned. This was not a coincidence. I took the dosage at 75 mg the following day out of curiosity.. The compulsive cleaner had returned. My b/f at the time watched me scrub away at an already squeaky clean countertop.  This medicine eventually will also begin to make you stutter. You can fix this predicament by reading more. All in all, B rating",

Now it has been 7 months and life without migraines is wonderful. No more fear of when the Big One will hit. The weight loss (20lbs) was nice too. My worst side effect is the stumbling and grasping for words. My kids die laughing. So do I. My husband doesn't understand that part but it's ok. As long as the headaches don't come. I still have small, treatable headaches (part of another problem that I hope soon goes away). Topamax is my hero. Take away my car, my clothes, my house...but don't take away my Topamax.",

I also take neurontin now for nerve pain and muscle pain and head pain. Topamax is worth trying for migraines. The side went away after a month.",

This first I took it, I had a bad experience and had to stop but after a year my doctor suggested that we try again. It has been a full year now. Since then I didn't have any weight change however; in October - she added another management pill to my list in addition to the topiramate and I have lost almost 30 lbs. I started at 199 lbs and as of today, I am down to 175 lbs. I was a size 16 Jean and bought a size 10 Jean today.

On my 30 day follow up the doc decided to add 25mg Topomax into the mix. Only lasted a week on it.I found myself experiencing extreme emotions . I took it before bed as instructed, however I did not sleep at all for the duration of taking the pill. My nose would run randomly-like mid conversation with clients at work. I felt high, lethargic, irritable, and when not working laid around like a bump on a log. Not possible to function on this stuff with anything or anyone that required my undivided attention. Thanks to this pill I lost a week of exercise and my to-do things are through the roof.",

And I am at 200 mg now... dont know what to do.",

I went off of it because I didn't like some of the side effects, and my Fibro symptoms came back with a vengeance, crippling pain... bedridden most of the time, etc. I'm going back on next week. If you take this drug DO drink a lot of water as instructed to avoid kidney stones. I didn't drink hardly any water and got a stone. Also, I didn't have ins when on it so had to get a card from manufacturer (free). As for effectiveness.. it worked for me!",
                    "After taking 100mg daily, it took me roughly 3 months for my migraines to dramatically stop. I went from having approximately 12 migraines monthly to having maybe two. The side effects of this medication for me: for 3 weeks I could not focus, extreme fatigue, restlessness. I cannot drink anything carbonated, as a result, I lost 20 pounds in the first month. Serious appetite loss. I've been on this medication for 9 months and lost a total of 43 pounds. I have to take in the morning otherwise I cannot sleep. It also helps with my OCD tendencies. If you can make it through 3 weeks of outter space, this medication is worth it!!",

When I was told by a new psychiatrist to pick out a new medicine for my bipolar illness, I chose Topamax even though it is an off-label treatment for bipolar disorder, it seemed to have the least amount of side affects and I feel WHOLE again. I have been on Topamax for 15 years (I think) and the only adverse effect I have is decreased sweating in hot weather.",

I've always been very active and ate well because I suffer from hypertension so the weigh was easy to manage. But now at age 34, and off the meds for 3 months and 20lns heavier I'm back taking 100mg a day. After only being on them for 8 hrs I feel the immediate effects.

I still have a lot of my appetite so I have been making a conscious effort not to eat a lot and to make healthy choices so that has been a bit of a struggle. I am very hopeful with this medication but I planned to ask my doctor writhin the next week to increase my dose so the cravings can be under control do I wouldn't have such a struggle.",

My migraines reduced a lot for a long time but I also do not drink alcohol, caffeine, or eat chocolate, cheese. The last few weeks my migraines are back with great intensity. One lasted 4 days. So I will be going back to my doctor. Topamax did not affect my appetite at all. I get occasional tingling.",

I would get a migraine an hour into my slumber then toss & turn all night and of course the cranky morning ensues. This med caused more migraines for me, stomach pain, and less sleep and that hardly outweighs my regular migraine schedule of pain three days in a row. More pain does not equal beneficial.",
                    "Topamax is an uncertainty at this time. I took it decades ago and because no med or mixture of meds controls seizures sufficiently for me I'm circling back. I've noticed major neurological feelings (e.g., tingling) transmitting down my legs to the point that it keeps me awake for many hours, which results in sleep deprivation and then seizure activity. It's not good at night. One reason I stopped the med years ago is because it can cause kidney stones. Not anything I want on top of seizures plus the tingling, foginess, and fatigue caused by Topamax.",

I must be one of the lucky ones because I didn't have any horrible side effects, just some mild finger tingling. I lost a little appetite but made no difference (I'm slim anyway and probably lost 5 pounds), otherwise... it has been a miracle!! I started with 25mg, increased to 50, then to 100, didn't like it, went back to 50 and am now on 25 again and feel great. Sometimes I also take the generic and have no problem at all.",
                    "Was rx'd for migraine control and prevention. Worked. But the painful tingling in my hands and feet was so extreme, I couldn't handle it. It also messed me up with some outrageous severe insomnia, and that's one thing that I can't have any more out of control. Even with Lunesta and other hefty sleep aids I was a mess, no sleep at all. I'm just now hearing how it helps with weight loss, which Id love to get advantages from, but the side effects weren't worth it at all.",
                    "We tried this for my daughter when she suddenly started getting migraines every day. Migraines down to 2 per week and less severe but when we tried increasing the dose side effects became intolerable: doesn't help her sleep at night yet makes her very tired all day, have to force her to eat, her legs tingle all the way up to her hip. She also has nightmares, and vivid dreams, even during the day. That was the last straw and we'll be trying something else. Real shame because we think it was helping.",

By week four the feeling went away. Took 2-3 months for the fingers and toes to stop tingling but I had that in the toes any ways from nerve damage in the back. They increased my evening dose and within two weeks again I tried to commit suicide again. This time twice in one week and within a month I stabilized again. My doctor will not raise it anymore even though I just begged her to, it's only day 7-21 that I need to be watched and the last time, I called my sister to take me to the hospital the second attempt.I didn't lose weight on it.",

I just started my first dose an hour ago doing 50mg total half a day then other half at night. Going to try it that way instead of morning because I'm terrified of the fog and driving confusion since I work full time an hour away from home... Anyways I weigh 184lbs... Weighed 100-107 from age 14-23 maybe even younger than I got addicted painkillers and when I got sober I gained a good 80 lbs!

                    "I just started taking Topamax a little over 2 weeks ago. I am up to 100 mg a day. I am starting to really notice some short term memory issues, however I have not had a migraine, let alone a single headache since starting the medicines. Everything has started tasting weird since starting the 100mg dose. I used to drink at least 4 cups of coffee a day and can't stand to drink it at all. The bonus is that it has helped with the caffeine withdrawal. I am also a smoker and it has helped reduce my craving for tobacco! I have read a lot of the posts on here and am seriously concerned about many of the side effects such as hair loss. However the weight loss aspect is really appealing. I haven't lost anything yet though.",
                    "I hate this med. it is super cruel and I don't recommend it to ANYONE. I have been taking it for a few months, and it hasn't helped much with my headaches. The side effects are brutal. I have no appetite, and I am basically forcing myself to eat. I've almost passed out 5 times this week from not eating enough, and lost 30 pounds thanks to it. It also causes severe gum irritation which SUCKS with braces, and it makes you really foggy and hard to concentrate. I will say Qudexy helps with seizures, but nothing else.",
                    "I have been on Topiramate for several years in combination with gabapentin for seizures and migraines. Then my neurologist put me on 400mg topiramate to stop the breakthrough seizures. It works great. I lost 60 pounds. But I do have side effects of tingling, confusion, loss of words. However all that is better than seizures.",
                    "I've been on 50 mg of Topamax for a month now and it's changed everything for me. I went from having a headache every day for the past 2 years to not having a single one. I was skeptical at first because of the possibility of weight loss, as I am already very small. So far I have had no side effects. It truly has been a life saver.",
                    "LOVE ! Honestly. In the beginning, I did want to get off this medication. Some of the side effects for the first couple months are just annoying, but I was able to push through them. I was overweight at the time of starting this too for my migraines, and my migraines/headaches were SO BAD. But I was able to lose some weight from it too, which is nice. The most annoying side effect in my opinion would be the tingling in the tips of the fingers and toes, only lasted maybe 2-3 months for me. After that they faded and they're gone. After about a month a half of using this drug my headaches subsided quickly, now I'm migraine and headache free completely. I will forever take this medication as long as my Neuro says its okay too.",
                    "I took this medicine off and on for years. And I can honestly say it has helped my migraines tremendously. I suffer from migraines with the aura, and while off Topamax they come in weekly clusters. About once every couple of months I will have a week from hell. On Topamax I have one attack every couple of months. BUT, the side effects are unbearable.",
                    "This medicine changed my life. I went from bedridden to active. I still get flare ups, but I can function in them now. My pain is greatly reduced. I no longer have constant flu like symptoms or muscle spasms. My pain has been reduced to a dull ache and I can manage without narcotics. I unfortunately did show the rare side effect of hair loss. I solved that by cutting it short and dying it purple! Topamax is also sold as a diet pill, so I also lost about 40 pounds, which is helpful for a lot of fibromyalgia patients since we tend to gain weight from lack of activity or taking meds like Lyrica . In fact, I ended up on Topamax because my insurance wouldn't cover Lyrica. Best thing to ever happen to me since I became ill!"

                    "//What is it?//Headache and migraine are different entities. Migraine is one of the most common and well characterized, but there are 14 broad categories that can be subdivided into more than 200 different forms. Migraine itself has about 20 different genres. In general, headaches are divided into two large groups: primary and secondary. Primary illnesses correspond to a disease, not reflecting other health problems and represent around 90% of the total. Secondary symptoms are symptoms of diseases of the nervous system or other organs of the human body. They can occur in cases of flu, alcohol poisoning or withdrawal, minor head trauma, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels) or a high blood pressure crisis. Migraine is a primary headache in which very intense episodes of pain occur interspersed with periods without symptoms. In general, it begins between the ages of 15 and 40, but it can appear in childhood or shortly after the first menstruation. If it appears for the first time after the age of 45, other causes must be excluded. Some of its characteristics are closely associated with the female reproductive cycle: higher prevalence after the first menstruation or during the menstrual period; occasional worsening due to taking birth control pills or hormone therapy; attenuation or disappearance during pregnancy or menopause. Before adolescence, migraines affect boys and girls equally. From then on, it is two to three times more common in females. It is estimated that 8% to 15% of individuals living in Western countries (including Portugal) suffer from this problem. The fact of reaching people in the productive phase implies large economic, social and family costs.//Symptoms//It appears recurrently, several times throughout life, but always with completely free intervals. If it occurs every day, it is probably overuse of painkillers or other medications. Drug abuse can convert a migraine into a chronic daily headache. There are people who preferably appear on the weekend. These crises can be precipitated by changes in sleep schedule, failure to eat breakfast, reduced stress or alcohol abuse. In these cases, it is important to consider a lifestyle change over the weekend. The symptoms are intense and often prevent work or study. The pain tends to be throbbing, worsening with physical exertion or head movements. In general, it affects only one side of the head, and is accompanied by nausea, vomiting, intolerance to light, noise and some smells. It is not mandatory that all of these elements are present simultaneously. And they can occur twice a week or just a few throughout a lifetime. During attacks, people seek a dark, quiet place to rest or fall asleep. An episode can last from a few hours to three days. Between attacks, there are usually no complaints. Some types of migraines may have more complex symptoms (with aura). These forms are less common, affecting around 15% of people with this problem, and include transient neurological symptoms, originating attributable to certain areas of the brain. The other signs are identical to those of migraine without aura. The most common auras are temporary vision disorders, in the form of loss of vision on one side of the visual field, blurred images, perception of bright points, geometric figures or bright zigzags. Other auras can be translated as tingling or numbness on one side of the face or one of the hands. There are people who have difficulty speaking or even temporary paralysis of their limbs, usually only on one side of the body. These changes last about 10 to 30 minutes and precede the pain. In children, migraines tend to be bilateral, less intense and of shorter duration. Vomiting and dark circles can be exuberant. Disturbances in sleep and meal schedules are common precipitating factors. Treating these crises is easier than in adults. Sleep usually gives good results. At these ages, the occipital location is not normal and, when present, requires a medical consultation. Likewise, the presence of headaches with morning vomiting or other unusual symptoms in very young children should be seen by a healthcare professional.//Causes//It is caused by a combination of brain processes: excitation/depression of cells, dilation of arteries and release of chemicals. People with migraine are more sensitive to certain stimuli, environmental or from their own body, that can trigger these brain processes. It is also thought that there is some genetic susceptibility. Some individuals can identify the signs of their attacks. The most common are cheese, chocolate, strawberries, seafood, wine, artificial sauces, changes in sleep patterns, stress, menstruation, fasting, physical exercise, and minor trauma. Others cannot identify them at all. People who drink coffee regularly may experience headaches when they stop this habit.//Diagnosis//The key to diagnosis lies in the clinical history, physical and neurological examination. Observation of the fundus is a very important part of these procedures. In some cases, it may be necessary to resort to computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to exclude other diseases.//Treatment//Migraines have no cure but can be controlled. There are medications and behaviors that can reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks. Symptomatic treatment, during acute periods, involves resting in a quiet, dark place. Pressure or cold can be applied to the area of \u200b\u200bpain. At this stage, analgesics, anti-inflammatories, antiemetics and triptans are very useful.//Prevention//People with migraines should create calendars that allow them to identify their symptoms and assess their impact on their quality of life. The first step in prevention is to identify and eliminate precipitating factors, whenever possible. In some cases, it is necessary to use daily medication to reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks, but there are no drugs specifically developed for their prevention. However, there are some drugs used in other contexts that have proven to be effective, such as beta-blockers, antidepressants or antiepileptics, and these should always be prescribed by a doctor.

                    "//What is it?//It is a neurological disease that involves the nervous system. Epilepsy is defined as the occurrence of at least two episodes of seizures that are not related to alcohol withdrawal, hypoglycemia, heart problems or other conditions. In some cases, one seizure is enough to diagnose epilepsy, provided there is a high risk of more occurring. Seizures result from a change in the electrical activity of the brain and may result from trauma, familial tendencies, or have no identifiable cause. This activity or discharge has an unpredictable onset and is, in general, of short duration (seconds to minutes, rarely exceeding 15 minutes) with normal brain functioning maintained between attacks. These tend to recur over time, with frequency varying between patients. Epilepsy affects several mental and physical functions and is a very common condition, occurring in around 65 million people worldwide. In the United States, it is the fourth most common neurological disease, surpassed only by migraine, stroke and Alzheimer's disease. In Portugal, it is estimated that it affects four to seven thousand inhabitants. However, the number of individuals who, although not epileptic, may have a seizure during their lifetime is approximately one in every 20. It is more common in very young or elderly people, but can occur at any age. Although treatment allows many patients to live with this condition, for others the seizures are uncontrollable and affect their quality of life in all its aspects.//Symptoms//Epilepsy does not manifest itself in the same way in all patients, and can occur in simple or complex seizures. Furthermore, they depend on the location of the discharge focus in the brain, and can affect gait, face, specific activities, or cause various types of alteration in the state of consciousness, often accompanied by automatic, unplanned movements (getting dressed or undressed, walking, chewing or swallowing). They can occur during sleep and the patient may be conscious or not remember anything after the seizure ends. Seizures themselves can be of different types, with muscles being relaxed, contracted or showing spasmodic movements. Some exhibit signs that precede them (aura) while others occur without warning.//Causes//In a large number of cases it is not possible to determine a cause. But any injury that reaches the brain can leave a \"scar\" that is a potential starting point for epileptic seizures.//Diagnosis//Diagnosis is a complex process that involves several steps. The clinical history, neurological examination and laboratory tests are generally the first steps, as they allow the occurrence of seizures unrelated to the disease to be ruled out. Electroencephalogram, magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography scans allow the exploration of possible causes. Finding the origin of epilepsy is very important because it allows the selection of the most appropriate treatment.//Treatment//Treatment must be highly personalized, taking into account the patient's own risks and the dangers of further seizures. It is therefore important to consider the patient's age, the characteristics of the seizures, associated factors and the patient's social and professional context. Many antiepileptic drugs have significant side effects and this risk requires careful consideration. In some cases, one type of medication is sufficient, but for other patients, it may be necessary to combine several. As a rule, treatment is started with a reduced dose of the selected medication, with a gradual adjustment based on the clinical response. The goal is not to cure epilepsy but to control the occurrence of seizures. For this to be successful, good cooperation from the patient is essential, since in some cases, the patient may have to stop the treatment after a period of time without seizures. When medications are not effective, alternatives such as a ketogenic diet or surgery may be considered: The ketogenic diet uses a high percentage of fat, few proteins and carbohydrates and a total suppression of sugar. Creates a metabolic state called \u201cketosis\u201d, which appears to reduce epilepsy seizures;;/ The surgery aims to remove the areas of the brain responsible for the electrical discharges or to interrupt the transmission of the electrical signal. Stimulation of the vagus nerve is performed using a small device surgically implanted under the skin, just below the collarbone, and allows the desynchronization of convulsive activity in the brain.;/ For each case, the neurologist decides which path to follow.//Prevention//Seizures are often associated with specific triggers or changes in daily routines, such as: Stress;/ Anxiety;/ Excessive alcohol consumption;/ Tobacco;/ Changes in sleep rhythm;/ Tiredness;/ Changes in ongoing medication;/ Very intense stimuli (bright lights, television, video, computer);/ Hormonal changes in women;/ Some of them can be avoided. Epilepsy Foundation, Nov. 2012 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, Abril 2011 Epilepsy. for Embrace Epilepsy, Neuropsychology Group of the University of Madeira, 2012 Load more;/ Epilepsy in adolescence is a common disease. But most people can live a normal life if the disease is properly controlled. There are several types of epilepsy, so treatment varies from case to case. Find out what you can do to control this disease. Febrile seizures scare parents, who don't know what they are and how they should act. Learn what to do if your child has a febrile seizure.

                    "I have been on this medication almost two weeks, started out on 25mg and working my way up to 100mg, currently at 50mg. No headaches at all so far and I was having 2-3 crippling migraines a week. I have lost 5.2lbs so far but note I am really paying close attention to what I am eating, I have a lot of weight to lose and if weight loss is a side effect I want to help it along as much as I can. Now, other side effects, they are there the word recall issues exist, the memory issues, the worst of it seems to be the vision disturbances, there have been times I have just not driven because I'm sure it would not have been safe. The good news is it seems to be wearing off...I have tons of energy and I am in a great mood.",
                    "I didn't like Topamax. I became very paranoid, anxious and since I have been off of it I still have mild side effects from it. Not a good experience. Glad it works for some.",
                    "I have been taking 75mg topamax one a day for about 10 years now. I have gone as far as taking 100mg until I started not being able to get the words out that I was thinking of. That side effect has not completely gone away but is better. When I first started I did have the tingling in my hands and feet but it was no more than like having carpal tunnel, I also have the weird taste where soda tasted flat and tomatos tastes weird. I did loose a little weight. The tingeling went away, I adjusted to just not drinking soda. And tomatos started to taste fine. I also take Sumatriptan for when I still do get a headache. However the headaches are much fewer and further beteeen. I will get a cluster of them about every six mths but still better.",
                    "Topamax is amazing. I originally took it 6 years ago to prevent migraines and lost 80 lbs as a bonus. At that time my doctor and I speculated that it would some day be approved for weight loss because I was not his only patient to report changes in the taste of carbonated beverages and chocolate while taking the medication. I also noticed that I did not dream about food while taking the medication, but within 3 months of changing medications food reentered my dream content. I am now back on the medication to address chronic pain issues and have already found the same results in weight loss, taste changes, and dream content.",
                    "Definitely takes away my hunger.",
                    "I like this medicine. I don't have many of the other problems that others have had. I was on Dilantin for years and was up to 1000MG per day until my body had gotten used to it and was still giving me grand maul seizures. My Neurologist after trying many other medicines (a certain combination he gave just made me stumble around like I was a drunk and made the police in my area look like a bunch of monkeys after I had a blood alcohol level of 0.0. Anyway I still have bright flashes and small dark spots and little halo's but not full blown grand mals. Just remember to drink lots of Water.",
                    "I am currently taking it for intense migranes. It is the only thing that I have found that has helped. I do have breakthrough migraines but the medication does keep the majority of them at bay. I do get many of the side effects. I get the tingling in the hands and feet. I occasionally get tingling on my tongue and a weird burning/taste when I drink soda. I get a slight dizziness when I first take it. I am more sensitive to cold and I get diarrhea. All of these side effects I can either live with or treat and are worth the freedom of the migraines. If you live with migraines everyday your willing to put up with a lot of side effects just to be pain free for a while. This medication is totally worth it.",
                    "Been on Topamax for 3 months I have recently gone up on the dose to 75 mg at bedtime. I've been all right dealing with the tingling. I have quit smoking and drinking which is great. I started working out alot since I've been so anxious. Possible side effect? The worst for me is the sleep issues and the mood swings. Since the dose went up I am having terrible night sweats and am waking up all night long. I'm exhausted all day with little to no motivation. My mood swings quickly and dramatically from happy to annoyed. Just trying to wait it out. I'm still having headaches everyday. Just not migraines.",
                    "I've been taking this drug since the end of Sept 2014. On 100mg per day, taken 25mg 4 times a day as I find them so strong. They've been working really well up until about a month ago, but the migraines have returned, so wondering whether I need to increase the dose or to request to try botox - anyone tried this for migraine treatment? Side effects-these have been tough and ongoing. Pins and needles in hands&feet, severe nausea, dizziness, memory loss, lack of concentration, reduced heart rate (normal 70 bpm to 48 - I'm a 35 year old female), find it hard to sleep. Have lost 2.5 stone so far, have real trouble eating as feel so sick-dietician scored me with a high risk of malnutrition. Concerned about the damage this drug is doing.",
                    "I have been migraine free for 6 months (previously I had 3-4 migraines per month). I also lost 25lbs and look great.",
                    "Wow, what a roller coaster ride! Started on 25mg, no effect, then 50, 200 finally 400. It did stop the cluster headaches, but Extreme confusion, serious loss of hearing, forgetfulness, couldn't remember my phone number! My wife wouldn't let me drive at 400mg, I was dangerous, parking became very difficult, once I had to get out of the car and let her park. Frustrating and humiliating. In the end, I was down to 50mg a day, Doc said that wasn't causing any side effects at that low dose. WRONG! When I finally stopped, it took a couple of weeks to become me again. I was shocked at the difference it made being off of it. Some of my hearing came back thankfully. I did lose 30 pounds that did not come back.",
                    "I am on a two week trial. I have been on the medication for 5 days. I have noticed that soda taste disgusting. Which is a good thing for me. I don't feel or look as bloated. I have not lost any weight as of yet. I hope that comes soon. I do notice that I am more thirsty and not as hungry. I try to eat at least three times a day so that I don't \"binge\". I have noticed that I am more constipated than normal even with drinking more water. I hope to see weight loss soon. I have been \"obese\" for some time and very unhappy with myself. This puts a huge wedge into my married life. I also would love to loose weight to take the pressure off my knee, my back, and to reduce my asthma some. I hope this medicine is the key to a new life for me.",
                    "I started out slowly at 25mg. on Topiramate for migraine prevention since I was getting 2-4 a week. The morning after I took my first dose my diet coke tasted flat, and I opened 3 other cans thinking there must be something wrong with the case of soda I bought, refusing to believe that the side effect of making carbonated drinks taste flat could start after just one dose, but it did. Within 72 hours I began having eye pressure and weird eye pain, I was concerned and saw an ophthalmologist, one of the adverse effects of the med. is glaucoma, but everything was fine. When I increased to 50 mg./day I was so THIRSTY all the time. At 150mg. Migraines were decreased, but I was cognitively impaired with hair loss. Lost 8 lbs. after starting 150 mg",
                    "This medication worked for me for a while, however, my body became accustomed to it, and it stopped working. I also experienced the majority of side effects. Mainly weight loss, but also decreased cognition and spelling abilities. I discontinued this medication specifically because losing my ability to think and communicate was horrible. Before I started this medication, my migraines were never affected by food (caffeine, sugar, etc), however, since discontinuing the medication I can no longer drink coffee/soda and have sugary desserts and foods. I also feel like my speech and communication skills (verbal) have been affected. ",
                    "I took this for my chronic central pain state and it was a very effective pain killer as long as Tapentodol not taken simultaneously, then skin itch develops at low dose of EXTENDED RELEASE (capsule) 100mg nocte and 50mg morning. The itch was severe by time dose increased to 200mg am and nocte but no,other side effects except possible responsible for my delayed circadian Rythm disorder. Waking constantly before 4am sleeping 4-11am so very inconvenient, but others side effect free and a good pain killer. Remember to check if you have been prescribed the normal tablets or extended release capsules and that pharmacy has given you the correct kind.",
                    "I started this medication for weight lose, bipolar, migraines. Seems like it may just be perfect...hopefully. I just finished my first week and lost 3 pounds! I workout 5-6 days a week but due to antidepressants making me gain so much weight, regardless of my diet and exercise I am fat. So today stepping on that scale and seeing 3 POUNDS LIGHGTER! I am a very moody person but the medicine seems to be making it right, moods seem to be very level. And haven't had one migraine! No side effects other than weight loss and loss of appetite..can't complain about that!",
                    "The first month was great, started on 25mg and upped to 100mg within 4 weeks. Totally migraine free except when I came to my period. Then I started to have a visual aura which I never previously experienced and had a 3-day intense migraine. My usual vertigo and severe travel sickness completely disappeared. After that, I stayed headache free mostly for a couple of months, apart from my time of month and ovulation. I continue to get the visual auras almost daily. They're not painful so don't bother me. Last month, the headaches came back almost daily with the auras. My doctor increased dose, going to 200mg and headaches are gone already. I'm hoping this will also help with back pain from disk degeneration. Lost 33lbs",

I don't know how much I have lost because I did not know what I was when I started and I need to get a new set of scales. I was around 240 lbs so I needed. I noticed right away that my diet Dr pepper tasted flat and just thought that I had a bad batch till the next case tasted worse. I also noticed that food tasted \"off\" too, now my appetite is down and I took a deeper look at the info on topamax and know this is the drug I have been needing the last 10 years!",
                    "Topamax has helped my diabetic nerve damage more than any other drug that my doctor has prescribed for me, and it does not have all the other nasty side effects, including the weight gain. I get enough of that from the insulin. I love taking the Topamax. I'm on a low dose (25 mg) but it sure has helped me.",
                    "At 42 and suffering migraine attacks with aura from a young age I have tried lots of meds,acupuncture with no real success,I started of on 25mg of topamax then increased a month later to 50 mg which made me like a ticking time bomb towards my family so dropped back to 25mg at night no more and been having excellent results,when I do get a migraine the pain is very minimal if any and can continue working which would never happen before I would be out for days ,just stay on low dose ,I find once well in your system works well.",
                    "The drug would get a 10 as it worked miraculously for me.  In my case -- and this probably won't happen to you -- the medication caused me kidney stones, the first of which was agonizing and led me to stop using the medication. Then the headaches resumed. I was willing to take an occasional Kidney Stone attack as a tradeoff for frequent migraine so I went back on the drug knowing the risks. Unfortunately, I peed gravel constantly, oddly without pain, but it was a warning. I'm now off the drug. If it did not cause me that side effect, I would have remained on the medication as it was, again, close to 100 percent effective. Not everyone responds the same way; your experience will probably be different.",

                    "I was prescribed Topamax after experiencing 2 seizures from extreme stress, anxiety, and insomnia for an extended period of time. I have a history of anxiety/mood issues, and have tried several SSRI's and other medications with no success over many years. I had given up hope until I tried topamax. Within the first few days I knew something was different. My anxiety was erased for the first time in 15 years. I was happy again, and was looking forward to spending time with people. This medication completely turned my life around. If you are stuck in a anxiety/depression hole with very little hope, please be patient. There is something out there for you. Topamax has side effects, but you get used to them within a month, its well worth it.",

I have a daily headache that ranges from pain threshold of 1 to 5, plus nausea, with a haze over my brain which slows down capability and causes general fatigue. Every 3 weeks this works its way up until a major migraine attack of a 9. But with Topamax the daily headache so far has reduced to a 1/2. ",
                    "I've only been on this medication for 2 weeks now but it has changed my life. I have lived with chronic migraines since my entire life..since I was 18 months old. I have lived with daily headaches and almost daily migraines for the past 10 years and it has taken over my life. Since starting Topamax, I have had 2-3 manageable headaches and I have my life back! It has even taken away chronic fibromyalgia and arthritis pain, given me back my ability to sleep soundly for hours at a time, and has gotten me out of a daily triptan habit that almost caused a stroke a few weeks ago. The side effects (brain fog, drowsiness, etc) are nothing new for me given I have fibromyalgia. A life without pain is worth it to me! What a miracle!!",
                    "I started taking 25 mg about a year and a half ago I got up 200 mg once a day I found in the beginning my hands would tingle I had bitter a taste in my mouth but overtime that went away it did help with weight loss I lost about 10 pounds. I didn't experience any hair loss in the beginning I had trouble remembering things but it eventually fades away and you're back to normal at least for me . I believe this drug does work specially if you have migraines.",
                    "I have taken topiramate since June 23, 2015 for weight lose and to help with my type 2 diabetes, I have now lost 25 lbs as of Oct 15 I have also joined Weight Watchers in August because I found that the pills alone were not a miracle pill they do help with not having the carb cravings but you do need to eat well to lose weight. I currently take 50mg in the morning and 50mg at dinner time and do not see any side affects. At first I did have the tingling in the hands and feet but after a few weeks that went away. I plan on staying on it and staying with the weight watchers and hopefully making my goal weight for the first time I am 50 years old and have been overweight since age 20",
                    "Although it did work for reducing my migraines, I found that the side effects outweighed the treatment. I had almost all of the side effects mentioned: confusion, irritability, diarrhea, tingling hands and feet, vision changes, loss of appetite and weight, change in sex drive and worst of all hives. The people around me were glad I stopped taking it, as it made me act differently than I would normally.",

I have headaches almost everyday and they usually turn into a migraine. But so far in the 4 days on Topamax I've only had to take one triptan and it worked ASAP. I hope I can hang in there. I'd like to lose some weight too!",

                    "Started 100mg at bedtime (in case of drowsiness) because I was waking up with 3 migraines/week. Later we added 25mg in the morning to prevent afternoon migraines. My headaches have gradually improved, not just in frequency but also in intensity. Only side effects have been weight loss (about 10-15 lb, and it seems to have levelled out there, which is fine; I'm a relatively small person) and paresthesia/tingles in my hands & face. Tingling is more frequent in cold weather, but it's not bad enough to make me quit, especially not with the benefits I'm experiencing. There's been a bit of research into its use for mood disorders, which I have. I'm on other meds for that, but I wonder if the topiramate is having any extra little benefit there.",

When my doctor put me on Topamax, my hands and feet tingled, everything tasted like metal, for about a month or so I also felt like I was on \"speed\". After the first month or so and some dosage alterations, I am very happy. No seizures, headaches gone, I am now a size 3, yeah, and will be very upset if someone takes my Topamax away.",

Through Topamax, I have lost 10 kgs in one month (that would be around 22 pounds). I feel so much better. My urge to binge eat is gone. I feel human again. I don't feel any side effects. I sleep better than before, I drink more water than before (as much as I should drink, before I didn't drink at all and had problems with my kidneys). When I first started topiramate, I got double vision. I read that this was a common side effect and saw my eye doctor about it. She said that it was because my vision improved a great deal. So, thank you Topamax, My health greatly improved.",

It immediately made me drowsy which I didn't mind because I also have severe insomnia, but when I woke up I was still drowsy and continued to be throughout the day. I was also the hungriest I have ever been in my life and I had a headache. It took 2-3 weeks to fix my appetite after taking this drug only once.",

Then I found Topamax and asked my Neurologist if we could give it a shot for me. That was 6 yrs ago and now I have less than 50 headaches (not migraines), headaches in any given year. My dose is 200mg in the morning and 200mg in the evening, and yes like most of you I have had to deal with the numbing in the extremities but you get over it in time. The memory thing, well, how good was my memory anyway when I had a migraine that lasted for 6 months and I was blacking out at times, tunnel vision and puking almost daily.

No side effects and it calmed the pain - but the relief only lasted 6 hours at the most per day then the pain returned with increased intensity until the next dose the following day. One week of that was enough. The Extended Release (XR) did not work for me but changing to topiramate twice a day has, thus far, been a significant improvement!",

But my seizures were debilitating, & I was having migraines 3x a month, so I can deal with the side effects. My biggest problem is the lack of appetite. Because of my insomnia, my doc switched me to Qudexy, which is topiramate in a time release capsule. When I was taking regular Topiramate I did lose weight, approx 60lbs in 2 yrs & then the weight loss stopped. I went from 200 lbs-140 lbs. & I very happy with that. Since I switched to Qudexy 2 months ago, I've lost close to 20 lbs & have no desire to eat. I feel like I'm force feeding myself. I dont know what to do.",
                    "I was placed on Topamax (aka Topiramate) several years ago for Migraines. For the most part (during that time), it seems to have worked with minimal adverse effects like slight tingling. In late 2016 while I was asleep, I experienced the most awful leg pain (as if my thigh muscle did a flip flop or wanted to rip out of my leg). After various conversative methods which included Vitamin D 5000mg, it was suggested that I cease the Topiramate as a process of eliminating things. It has been 5 days since being off of the medication and the numbness/tingling in that single quadrant of my thigh went away.  Now, I have migraine headaches that are coming back.",

Mainly due to diarrhea & lack of appetite. I almost gave up on taking it because of the stomach cramps I was getting but they subsided after the 1st week. I have changed a lot about my lifestyle since taking topamax so I don't know how much of my weight loss can be attributed to the drug itself but I definitely have lost weight 12 lbs & don't crave sugar. I stopped drinking soda over a yr ago so I don't know if it tastes different now. I do want water more than anything, which is fine. It does make you drowsy/foggy but I take my dose at bedtime, I do get weird tingles a few times a day in hands",

My doctor recommended topiramate and after a few trials of different mg it's a game changer. I honestly never get headaches anymore and had not a single side effect from this medication (which I was concerned about). It really does help and gave me a feeling of normalcy back in my life.",

I have the usual tingling, numbness, and weight-loss/loss of appetite that most everyone seems to have, but I've also gotten really bad heartburn. It gets to the point where it feels like I'm gonna throw up, and an episode might last anywhere from 2 hours to the whole day. It's not when I eat certain foods either. I also still get really horrible migraines, just not as often. I can't go on imitrex anymore because I have \"complex\" migraines, but sometimes no medicine helps. Does anyone else have these problems too?",
                    "I've been on Topamax for about 5 months now (100 am/100 pm) and finally giving up faith. The negative side effects outweigh the slight change in my migraines. Carbonated beverages taste terrible, I have to force myself to eat, I stutter constantly, I can never find the right words and often switch up words in a sentence. My memory is horrid, and I always see tracers, which is enough to drive anyone crazy. The only pluses are the slight decrease in consistency of my migraines and the weight loss.",

I was on Trokenid XR for a total of eight months and just got off the medication this week. I had a lot of the severe side effects. After the first 3 weeks of being on this medicine it caused a drastic change in my mood, depression, thoughts of suicide, dramatic increase in memory loss, tingling in the hands, legs and feet, could never get enough sleep, and was very aggressive and irritable. I did not have a seizure while on Trokendi XR, but the side effects I was having with this medication was not worth it for me.

I guess the plus side of this medicine is that it works right away. I've stopped taking it today on the advice of my Doctor and am starting to feel better. I hope this helps someone out there.

Positive is that I finally have a break in the migraine of 8 plus days, no tingling in extremities as others mentioned. No additional mental fog. Cola taste flat and that is a plus to me as I need to drink more water. Negative is the nausea that occurs after I take the pill and it is horrible but I counter it with a suppository of phenegrin(sp). Of course that knocks me out for hours. I was to increase dosage to 50mg but doctor gave okay to wait another week. This is a promising option for me after 16 yrs of suffering. And I have tried numerous meds over that time.",

The frequency that I would get them,would be more than six times a month. Anyway, I went on propannalol? (Beta blocker), NO SUCESS. & then doctors prescribed me topamax. I didn't have any side effects. At all. No tingling. Nothing. And GUESS WHAT, I didn't have a migraine for 3 years!!!! NOT ONE. but I got off of it, thinking they were \"gone\" & now I'm suffering with new hormonal migraines. Going back on topamax & hoping for same results!!!!",

In short, the nickname \"dopamax\" seemed well earned to me.",

Thought I was stressed out and overwhelmed with small kiddos and hubby deployed, my dermatologist didn't see anything very serious, like alopecia, so I continued. I began taking biotin and vitamins, but hair still kept coming out and scalp was starting to show more. I stopped completely and only lasted 4 days before a migraine wanted to come on. Luckily I took a rizatriptan in time to fight it off. Topamax worked beside the side effects of hair loss, forgetfulness, some leg cramps.

When I started Topamax, I could attend lunches at work and can honestly say I haven't binged at work this year (I am a teacher). In previous years, I binged and purged, 3-4 times a day. I know socialize and have friends. I do admit though that the meds have made me very, very, tired.

Can't take diet pills make me too jittery. After three years stopped topamax because of minor memory loss which I thought was embarrassing. Stayed on Prozac 30mg and gained all weight back and more up to 291. Now I am really depressed. Came off Prozac and am back on topamax 25 mg in morning and 25 mg at night only.

Oh, I drove? Wow. I don't remember. Ever rode on the gravitron? That's how bad my vertigo was, I could not lift my head up off my pillow. I actually ate more on this medicine because I felt shaky, like you would get if you hadn't eaten all day, for me the only thing that kinda tastes close to normal was sugary foods. Heartburn. Nausea. Dry heaving. Motion sickness from waking, standing, sitting, and existing. Light sensitivity. Tremors. I'm sure I'm forgetting things but the memory fog is too real. I felt drunk over all.",

I also was super spaced out, unfocused and constantly feeling like my brain was going but my body wasn't (It was WEIRD). This went on for about a week, then it worked perfectly and I was completely normal. However the migraines started coming back so I am now on 100mg a day and the same thing happened when I upped the dosage. It's working now though! I didn't notice any difference in tasting things but I did get tingles in my fingers and toes! Otherwise all round amazing medicine!!",

However, at around the four month mark, both came back to haunt me with a vengeance, seemingly doubling pain and severity. I also began experiencing tingling in my hands and numbness in my face, a totally unpleasant and unforeseen side effect that I only discovered by exploring online forums reviewing the medication. Additionally, this medication severely affected my anxiety and also led me to have extreme suicidal ideation, so much so that I had to stop altogether. I lost 15% of my total body weight whilst on this medication. If possible, avoid if you have a history of anxiety or depression.",

Recently I decided to give Topamax one more try. Within 2 weeks I have felt better than I have in two years.

When menopause hit, my migraines came roaring back with a vengeance. But I stayed on Topamax & my neurologist added other meds to supplement. Things are better now; Topamax has been a lifesaver for me. But it takes some time to let the side effects settle out & for your doctor to tweak the dosages.",

From day 1 zero appetite none whatsoever. Like I have to make an effort to eat. When I do eat it is just cut up raw veggies in a bowl of vinegar that is it for the day.

In July 2015 i started with 25 milligrams and evolved to 125 miligrams. It is now December 8 and I weigh 221 pounds. Here is how I would describe the experience. It stops the need to impulse eat, so you don't feel deprived, so...your not crying when the scale isn't moving quickly. Its not quick, because I am post menopausal...but its not painful. Appetite is down, I can now walk 45 minutes...and for the first time in my life..I know I will reach a goal weight.",

I lost 20 lbs over the course of 8 months. I now weigh 136lbs and sort of want to continue because I love the fact that I'm losing all this weight but I know it's bad for me as I am now getting addicted.

The stuff has completely diminished my migraines, I don't even get them anymore and I started taking the medication mid August. However I am intolerate to temperatures above 68 degrees and I am a healthy 23 year old female who did not have this problem prior to this medication. Even with ice pressed to my neck I will overheat in a house set on 70 & I puke and get a migraine instantly. Apparently that's one of the side affects of the medication. Two other side effects are I am rarely hungry and caffeinated beverages taste terrible but that price is a small price to pay to be migraine free. And take in morning!! Will keep you awake at night!!!",
                    "I've been taking Topamax for about a year and a half now and it has drastically cut down the frequency of my migraines and that is so worth the side effects I've noticed. Yes, I've had the tingles and some facial twitches, I've lost about 20 lbs. and have trouble with word retrieval & memory... but is it worth it? Absolutely! I currently take 250 mg/day -- all at night to help minimize the noticeability of the side effects. A good option, IMO.",
                    "I'm a 24 y/o male and have been on Topiramate for almost a month.. Started with 25mg daily increment and increased dosage by 25mg every week. I was suppose to make it up to 100mg daily, but that hasn't happened. . The first week was good. Second week I did notice the pins and needles sensations all over. When I got up to 75mg per day my brain fog was BAD, my anxiety sky rocketed, and I seemed to have more headaches. I've started to have panic attacks and have been scared to drive lately or even go to the store which is so unusual for me. I am also sleeping hours upon hours at a time and I am also getting tingling sensation in face and arm which is scaring the heck out of me. Going to stop taking without consulting doctor.",
                    "Prescribed a half 50 mg tab at bedtime for a week. It's been two days and I have no more headaches! Finally! I have a strange side effect of pain in my private area though. Does anyone else have this issue? It's just annoying. I hope it doesn't get any worse. I've been looking for a migraine med that actually helps without too many side effects.",
                    "I started taking Topiramate several years ago for pain/neuropathy, as I read these posts I found out it could also be helping my obesity, fibromyalgia, Crohns and my smoking. I stopped taking it about two months ago because I was having kidney stone problems and thinking this medicine could be the reason why. In the two months I have gained 25lbs, I'm in so much pain I can't wrap my head around it, and my smoking is got in out of control. I had no idea this medicine could or was helping all my other issues so I'm going back on it to see if I loose the weigh, control my pain, stop smoking, Although kidney stones can be the most excruciating pain ever! I'd rather have that pain once a year than suffer every day in my other pain.",
                    "I tried it for 1 month. I drank tons of water.  I was extremely tired all day, but could not sleep through the night. Kidneys constantly felt like I was getting stones. I felt bruised for weeks after cessation. I would rather have a migraine!",
                    "I was prescribed Topamax as a Migraine preventative and experienced just about every side effect. I started 25mg/day at night for 7 days, moved up to 75mg after 3 weeks and remained there. Within 48 hours I was didn't have a headache at all, but was experiencing side effects of tingling fingers, no appetite and change in taste of foods/carbonated beverages. I did have a hard time concentrating, I'd get confused and would randomly slur words. I weighted 120-ish when I started and within a few months, was 110 or less. I did work out and noticed no matter how hard I pushed, I didn't sweat and randomly got dizzy. Side effects are no joke, but you adjust after a few weeks.",
                    "I was taking 50 mg a day and it really reduced my migraines. I had no side effects except that I lost about 10 pounds, so that was a plus though my weight was normal. My neurologist bumped me up to 75 mg to try to get rid of the last of my migraines, and then a few months later I noticed my hair was falling out just like it did each time when I was postpartum. I'll have to go back down on my dosage to see if that will make my hair come back or if I need to go off it altogether, but it will take years to grow my long hair out again. ;(",
                    "I'm 18 years old and was put on Topamax for headaches at 16. In the beginning, I was put on 2 x 25mg per day, then increased to 2 x 25mg in the morning, and 2 x 25 mgs at night. After reading everyone's reviews I think I was put on way too much. I weighed about 125 and I got down to 108! I thought I looked great although many people said I looked too skinny. The con is that it made me feel very slow and I couldn't concentrate well. As I started to ween myself off of it, the headaches went away. I now weigh 135 and gained about 30 lbs since being off of it. I am considering going back on to lose weight.",
                    "I actually requested to be put on topiramate to help lose weight knowing it was a side effect and to prevent my horrible migraines. I can say it has worked for both. I started out on 50mg a night on Dec.21, 2014 and at that time I weighed in at 227 lbs per Doc scales. At my last check up on March 31st I weighed 203. And my migraines were reduced greatly. The thing was my body was starting to get use to the medication so they did have to up the dosage to help my migraines; I'm now on 100mg a night. The side effects subsided after about two months of taking the medication (slightly tingling in the fingers and feet from time to time, little foggy/forgetful). I can not taste and have not had one carbonated beverage since the 21st of December.",
                    "I lost every piece of my beautiful long black hair in just over 3 months! Md's asured me it would pass. Never did.",
                    "I have been taking Topamax for 2 years now after trying many different medications. Yes I got some of the side effect mainly thought process was slow and word confusion that was real frustrating it is worse under stress. The all over tingling is not as bad anymore but not have headaches every day, you have to weigh you options.",
                    "Topamax for me worked at preventing headaches but the side effects were unbearable. This medicine worked in the beginning but slowly BAD side effects appeared, I became so depressed, I was angry and sexually numb. I lost my sense of taste all sodas starting tasting flat. I also lost 15 pounds very quickly and I am now underweight do to this medication. I would never recommend it but only as a last resort. There are far better options out there. After failed topamax I then was prescribed the extended release version of it \"Trokendi XR\" and it was a little better but again over time side effects started appearing. Beware because it seems good in the beggining then side effects! Withdrawals from this med are terrible! Migraines x10!",
                    "My experience with topiramate was quite positive in terms of migraine frequency. I did have trouble with anomia: the inability to find words, especially nouns. We in the healthcare field call it \"Dopamax\" due to the side effects of forgetting things and making you dopey . I lost my insurance and had to stop it abruptly, which is oh-so-wrong. It should be tapered. The enormous downside to this drug--even generic--it its outrageous cost. Needless to say, I am suffering as much as I was before having taken it. I was titrated up to 400 mg/day, which is the maximum does recommended. On the other hand, my memory has returned.",
                    "This medication has been a miracle. My migraines have been disabling to the point where I could not turn my neck and I could not stand up. With this medication, I can live my life. I am on 150 mg a day. Thank you topamax!",
                    "I took Topamax for a month. It helped with my headaches very little and the side effects were terrible. My feet and hands would go numb several times a day. My short term memory was completely gone. I had a hard time finding the words to speak especially in the evenings. And the very worse was the depression and anger.",
                    "After having developed neuropathy post surgery I was suffering daily. I had tried Neurontin with little relief and was prescribed Topamax initially at 25mg. Over the last 6 years I've been titrated up to 300 mg and can tell you that this drug has helped tremendously. Initially I had common side effects, difficulty finding words, I lost weight about 20 pounds, and found that I had some tingling in my hands and feet. These issues generally resolved in time or I have just grown accustomed to them. For anyone who initially has issues with the side effects try and stick with the medicine for a little bit unless totally intolerable, it gets better.",
                    "I have been on 200mg/day of Topamax for about 6 years along with a bunch of other things and it seemed as though my headaches were worse. I kept begging to increase the Topamax as I had stopped having any side effects. Finally I fired my pain doctor after he told me just to go \"cold turkey\" off of morphine (I wanted to stop taking it, but not exactly that way!). Life is so much better without daily pain medicines and I found a neurologist who took me all the way up to 400mg/day on Topamax. I did start to have some more weight loss and taste issues and sleepiness, but my migraines became much more manageable with Imitrex and much less frequent. That is down to maybe once a week from near daily.",
                    "Now in my late 50's, I have been a lifelong migraine sufferer. My new neurologist recommended Topamax (FDA approved for migraine therapy). I am going on week 3 with promising results...for the first time in years I am waking up to no headaches and am not getting headaches as the day wears on. I'm sleeping better. I am experiencing a slight problem with focus/concentration but am told that this side effect should subside over time. Providing the side effects are minimal and non-intrusive, I can see staying on this medication-I'm hopeful.",
                    "I'm taking Topamax 200mg daily for Bipolar Disorder and I love this medication. It's changed my life and made me able to function again where other medications for bipolar disorder has not! The only reason I did not give it a ten is because sometimes it still makes my face and lips go numb and I get a twitch on the left side of my face, but honestly, I'll take it compared to how horrible my life was before.",
                    "I do not recommend Topamax as a solution to migranes. Although it did help keep the frequency of the headaches down at first, in the long run, I had just as many migranes as usual and there were too many side effects to make it worthwhile. My short term memory was practically shot, my hands would tremor and go numb as some points, and i experienced irregular heartbeat, trouble focusing, and sleep issues.",

I had a sudden onset of massive Migraine's.In one month alone I went 27 days with Migraine's, I was a nonfunctioning person. I ended up in the hospital for 2 days finally,I started taking this wonder drug!I have only had 2 bad Migraine's in 2 months.I am able to go to work and most of all function at home.I do find however that I have memory issues, and speech issues, ThankGod everyone around me is very understanding and we laugh about it.",

                    "Hi. I took the time to read every review and register. I have been on Topamax since May of '09 it is Dec.5th '09. I was put on Topamax after being taken to the Hospital for a TIA(mini stroke)due to complicated migraines. I don't really know how I feel about Topamax. I still get migraines a lot, and most of the side effects. I've lost 70 pounds. I am weak. But the banana tip is very helpful. My math is shot. And I stumble on my words. Short term memory is a loss. But I will give the medicine more time and try the banana's to help with the side effects. I take 150mg 2x's daily. I started at 25mg's. But I have other illness's that factor in. No one has mentioned TIA's. No one has this from their migraine's? Thanks for the info. It's all helpful.",
                    "I took Topamax for approximately 5 years with little trouble. I did have the metallic taste, and could not drink carbonated beverages. In July 2009, I had to quit Topamax due to a little published side effect, kidney stones. I was on a pretty large dose (600 mg). I had a 9mm Kidney stone and many many small stones. I take Keppra XR now. It prevents the seizures, but I have gained all the weight plus some that I had lost on Topamax, but no seizures or kidney stones.",
                    "I love Topamax! I can finally sit through school without getting a migraine. It might make concentrating a little more difficult, but no harder than trying to concentrate with a migraine! The only side effect I can complain about is the tingling in my hands and feet, but that usually only lasts about 15 min. I haven't experienced any hair loss (thank god)and I also can't complain about the appetite loss.",
                    "I was in a car accident with a head injury. I had intractable migraine and other headaches that came and went daily on top of that and three months after the accident my neurologist offered Topamax. It's been 9 months. I lost a lot of hair; I have the soda is flat thing; the pins and needles; and I have lost weight. I think the brain fog was not noticable because of the brain injury. It took care of my headaches immediately. I didn't mind the side effects. I ran out of it once and on day two had a seizure. I tried to titrate off recently and the migraine returned with a vengeance so I am still going to be taking it. I don't mind the side effects in comparison to the headache. Also-I use hypnosis for some of the side effects.",
                    "My neurologists prescribed me Topamax to prevent migraines 4 days ago. The first night I took the the pill I had HORRIBLE side effects (tingling and numbness for hours). The following night I decided to take my vitamins (which I didn't do the night before) and I didn't experience the same side effects. Not sure if it helped, but I make sure I take them every single day!! The only side effect that I get is slight tingling in my hands occasionally.",

My doctor just keeps upping the dose apparently it's suppose to be one of the best medications in headache/migraine prevention out there. I also take blood pressure medication as well, so taking this with a fairly high dose should take them away completely, correct? Not completely.",
                    "I've been on topomax for 6 weeks now along with walking at least 2 to 3 miles a day sometimes skipping a day or two depending on the weather I'm 40lbs down. Appetite gone, smoothies are enough for me and no snacks. No side effects by the way. 50mg twice daily",
                    "Began taking Topamax in 2006. Before starting on Topamax migraines were lasting 4-5 days after onset; and frequency of approximately 3 times per month. I experienced some diarrhea which subsided after breaking dosage up throughout the day (200mg daily). Additionally, I have experienced weight loss (a significant amount 50lbs) I could not afford to lose. However, the weight loss has subsided as well. Upon beginning the medication I had trouble with recalling words and memory loss. At this juncture the side effects have since passed and so have the migraines. I experience 1-2 migraines quarterly. Topamax has been a life-saver for me. I had tried many other migraine preventatives to no avail.",
                    "This was prescribed for binge eating as I have mood disorder and I need to lose weight. The binge eating was causing me to go over my calorie plan.

                    "I was diagnosed with bipolar depression about a year ago. I have been on topamax for that as well as migraine headaches for 8 to 9ish months now. The migraines went away, and I have lost about 40 pounds since taking Topamax! The only downfall is hair loss. I highly warn anybody taking this drug not to miss a dose or try weaning yourself off, because I have done both and ended up with very bad mood swings and will be crying on the floor one minute, then raging and angry, then it will be as if nothing happened.",

                    "I only took Topamax 25mg 2x daily for 10 days before I could no longer take the side effects. I have suffered from almost daily migraines since I was 6 years old and have always resorted to OTC medicines to \"attempt\" to ease the pain. I have taken Imitrex to combat the pain and even resorted to Valium to knock myself out and sleep through it. When I heard about Topamax I was elated and it really does work at preventing migraines. However, within a few days I developed some side effects ranging from annoying to considering whether I should go to the ER: burning/stinging sensation when drinking soda, tingling feet, nausea, weight loss, memory loss, irregular heartbeat and passing out. I can't function like that. ",
                    "I was diagnosed bipolar 2 about 3 years ago. I am a 36 yr old female. I was originally given topamax 50mgs at night with seroquel 50mgs, as well as a variety of antidepressants and klonopin for anxiety. That worked great for awhile until it didn't and I weened myself off everything. DON'T DO THAT!! I had a horrible hypomanic episode followed by a 4 month depressive crash. I'm now on Latuda, Celexa, Klonopin, and my good buddy Topamax. I have had no serious side effects from Topamax. A little hair loss (more like extra hair in the brush) but it's only noticeable to me. Not bad. No word loss, no memory problems. I'm in grad school with a near 4.0 GPA. It helps me maintain my weight so the other meds don't affect me.",
                    "I have been taking Topamax now for ten years. I love it. It has controlled my seizures and the side effects are minimal. I still get tired but not as bad as the other drugs I have been on.",
                    "I'm giving it a 10 for the decrease of nerve pain and it saved my life truly. However, the weight loss? The only weight I lost was 17lbs walking my dog and Nutra System 2 years ago and gained back 5lbs of that when he got injured 3 months ago. This didn't help me lose one pound. I'm on 75mgs a day, started at 50. It did change my taste, I no longer like orange but does zero for weight loss which I was looking forward to since I have a good 30lbs to lose :) So big ups for the nerve pain and I had no idea it worked on migraines no wonder I hadn't had to have my migraine prescription filled in 2 years! So it has great benefits and I would highly recommend it for other issues but not weight loss. Good luck and happy new year all!",
                    "I started Topamax on August 18th and my life has changed! Today is September 2nd, two weeks without a migraine is a miracle. I'm on 50mg. At first I was having a hard time at work. Brain fog is an understatement. But I would say it's gone now. Within the first week my sensitivity to light disappeared. I actually started crying tears of joy while driving because I could finally see in the day time without migraine. And same thing at night. I don't have to turn the mirror up anymore. I can see! I occasionally get some tingling in my hands and feet but not bad at all. I will update again on my progress/side effect in a month or two. Good luck to everyone. This has been such a blessing for me.",
                    "My doctor prescribed me Topamax as a preventative measure for my common migraines. It helped with my headaches really well. I used to get migraines at least a dozen times a month and this medicine allowed me to only have 2 headaches in the month that I took it.  I stopped taking it, however, because I felt so out of it. I felt like a space cadet. It also made me very moody. Everything irritated and bothered me. I didn't think those feelings were worth continuing with the prescription.  I would suggest trying it, as those effects, from what I understand, are rare. And, I have to say that I didn't get migraines for a few months after I stopped taking it. So that was a bonus.  As a side note, it does make soft drinks taste 'flat'.",
                    "To be honest, I can't tell you if it helped with the prevention of migraines or not. I have had chronic migraines for 15 years now. They are accompanied by loss of feeling in my hands, aura, and sometimes my words come out as gibberish. I have tried just about everything from medications to natural remedies for my migraines. When my new neurologist suggested I take Topamax I thought that I would finally be rid of my migraines. I didn't even last a week on this medication though. I couldn't stand for more than thirty seconds without being dizzy and having shortness of breath. My stomach ached and I had a tingling sensation in my hands. I also had a slight fever. My doctor wanted to attribute all of these things to the start of a cold.",

Saturday I made peach cobbler I love cobbler! I ate four bites and threw the plate it tasted like dirt! I notice if I force myself to over eat I need a bathroom very fast! I did a one week weigh in this morning I started at 229.9 and today I weight 223.3! Total of 6.6 pounds! I take mine for headaches and migraines.. Today I start 25mg twice a day! Then move to 50mg twice a day next week! I'm excited about losing weight!!!!",

I will probably stick with the one pill because I am losing the weight. I do exercise 5 days a week also so this helps. This pill alone is not going to work you need to get moving just a little.

Im not counting calories; just not interested in junk food. I read a poster on another forum to take extra B complex and Biotin to avoid any hair loss as the drug seems to deplete that nutrient in the body.

I am able to eat very small portions and have full control over myself. I have changed to healthy eating. Less bread and pasta. More brown rice, veggies, sweet potatoes. I still fry veggies in olive oil. Still eat a baked potato sometimes. But cut way back on portions and added snacks between meals. Then every 3 days I be sure to eat something a little more fattening and it makes me lose weight. For salad dressing, oil and vinegar with seasoning packet. No sweet tea etc. Lots of water.

Recently, my pharmacy switched me to the generic version and I hated it. Immediately that first day, I would get crazy headaches, feel dizzy, sick to my stomach and I couldn't concentrate on anything.

Struggled to breathe (had to breathe deeply with each breath and even took an inhaler to see if that would help). I felt disoriented, dizzy, and like I was walking under water with blurry vision. I was extremely lethargic and had trouble climbing a flight of stairs without getting winded. I was having sharp pains throughout my body (breasts, stomach & back). My heart felt like it was beating really hard (not fast, just through my chest). My face and arms were tingling. I had a really bad taste at the back of my mouth and everything I ate/drank tasted weird. I'd prefer the migraine.",

I also have generalized anxiety with panic attacks for which I take Lexapro for over 10 years. My psychiatrist suggested that I may have something similar to \"The Kindling Effect\" rather than explosive disorder. He asked me if I'd like to give Topamax a try. I said sure why not! He started me on 25 mg twice a day. Within five days I noticed a difference for the better. I can handle my mood much better, I can handle situations much better, and I have not had any explosive episodes at all in five months! To me this drug is a miracle. To finally find something that keeps me balanced and able to regulate my emotions without going to extremes is an absolute miracle! I love it!",

The last time I took Topamax it stopped the cluster within a week. I continued working up to the full dose and the side effects gradually decreased (confusion, hard to concentrate, difficulty with finding the words to express my thoughts). I found that a lower dose kept the headaches away so I dropped down for a few months then came off the drug completely. Last week a new cluster started so I am back on the Topamax and have had a couple of headache free days already. This medication works well for me at a lower dose and limits the side effects.",
                    "Over the edge..best thing ever!",
                    "Horrible drug. It did not prevent my migraines at all, and I had aweful side effects. Nausea, fuzzy thinking, tingly hands, and feeling overall sick the whole 4 weeks easing on and two weeks easing off. Not worth it. I'm back to Amitriptyline .",
                    "Developed Aurora symptoms of migraine as part of diagnosis of fibromyalgia & chronic fatigue diagnosis as result of a car accident. Debilitating vertigo, light and noise sensitivity. Extreme cognitive disfunction and fatigue which were constant but the migraine came and went but would last for weeks. Eventually it just stayed and I felt like I was walking about drunk!! I was told there was nothing that could be done for me and this was part of my condition. I found topamax myself when I had reached the point where I had decided to end it all if this was it. Sad but true. Fortunately and happily I am a new women. My brain has been unscrambled! I can function again!No more hiding from the light or trying to remember why I started a sentence",
                    "I weighed 268 pounds when I started out on Topamax about 12 years ago. I was put on them due to Cluster Migraines A/K/A Suicide Headaches. The level of pain I suffered daily was unbearable. Topamax was fabulous. In small doses, which have been increased to 200mg, 2Xdaily, they (along with other meds) saved my life. My weightloss?? Hold your hats, people! I've lost a person!! I weigh exactly 120lbs, am 5'8\" & very active when I can be. I've lost 148lbs total. MORE THAN ENOUGH! So, how do I stop losing? THAT is the question.",

Head pain from hell , ear pressure , nausea ect 24 /7 my life was stopping Had cat scan showed I had empty sella syndrome, Migraines lasted daily for 5 months so neurologist paced me on Topiramate and so far wow I slept for 3 days , head pain and symptoms started to go and now I am starting to feel like me again What works for one person , may not work for next but for me so far pain and symptoms have gone ,",
                    "This medication should be taken off the market. It has too many FDA warnings on it for it ever to be taken lightly, and frankly I don't think it should be prescribed as a migraine preventative or for the vast majority of conditions above.  I was only on it for 3 weeks, 1 week at 50 mg the other two at 25 mg. This is what happened to me: -Early signs of glaucoma (eye swelling and bloodshot eyes) -Hearing loss that has yet to be reversed -Fibromyalgia like symptoms -Extreme tightness and muscle pain in my face and along my TMJ, which caused dysphagia, other problems -Shortness of breath and heart issues -Tremors, very bad tingling, and light flashes in my eyes which were not a product of my migraine My advice? Avoid!!!",
                    "I had fewer migraines while on Topamax, but the side effects were HORRIBLE for me. I had tingly/numb fingers, brain fog and problems with word retrieval (not good for a teacher), plus it triggered depression-like side effects. The side effects were just not worth it.",
                    "Been on/off topamax since I was 15, I'm now 21. First time I took topamax at 15, I went frm 235lbs to 114lbs. Over time I got used to it & couldn't find something to help w/my binge eating disorder. I gained all the weight I lost & more over a 5yr period of trying to lose it/find the right meds to help. 2012 17 y/o tried topamax & had bad anxiety so that didn't last long. 2015 20 y/o I weighed 248lbs, the biggest I've been. Was on phentermine (diet pill, 37.5mg) for a few months but was starting to get used to it. Decided to try topamax again (50mg 2x a day) along w/vyvanse (ADHD/binge eating, 70mg) & lexapro (depression, 20mg). Currently 160lbs. Always adjusting my meds though, I seem to get used to them quickly.",
                    "Helped a lot with chronic migraines. I lost a lot of weight (I weighed 146 and I dropped down to 123 in two months). I ate less but I was still eating close to what I ate before being on the medicine. I think it must speed up your metobolism. I had some mood changes and I did have a little memory loss. I would forget words and things like that. I work with people so I noticed it more because people would point it out. My hands/feet tingled. I noticed less side effects when I took the medicine at night. I only take 50mg at night, that's all I ever have taken and it works for me. It does wonders for my migraines and it's worth the minor side effects. If you are a pop or beer drinker you will HATE it because it ruins carbonated beverages.",
                    "It took me a year to be diagnosed with Trigeminal Neuralgia - and I had to go to a doctor in Vienna for this, because the doctors in Romania misdiagnosed me - but Topamax is the medicine that really saved my life. Literally! Because I was contemplating suicide, the pain was that bad and nothing else was working for me. I have lost a little weight in the first couple of months and I also have some trouble finding common words while speaking, but otherwise I did not experience any other side effects so far. My cholesterol level is now increasing - I am wondering if anyone is experiencing that as a possible side effect.",
                    "It helps. For me it wasn't so much the appetite suppression that worked, but the way it makes me more conscious of the situation before I binge. Its makes me stop in the middle of the binge or just before completely, and ask myself whats up with the need to hit the self destruct button.  In case that I do binge on Topamax, my binges consists of less food when. And I eat slower, defeated by the situation.",
                    "Ok so I am going on my third week of topamax I have seizures uncontrollably migraines and obesity so let me begin with saying this I have noticed a significant change in my body as far as the weight loss goes 6pds since I have been on it and still loosing however I have lost my appetite I have no desire to eat I may eat one time a day that's the only downside I have noticed a change in carbonated drinks they don't taste the same anymore I am currently coming off tegortol which was only treating my seizures and I was gaining so much weight so I'm thankful that topamax is working for me and i only have to take one pill a day to treat all my ailments",
                    "I lost 10 pounds. I also almost went blind so after a month I quit and my vision returned. I quick cold turkey and had sleep paralysis with hallucinations. It was scary as heck. I was awake paralyzed, couldn't talk could not move. My hallucinations were I was in my room and something picked me up and threw me. Then something touched my back. A evil rabbit whispered in my ear. Then I woke up back on the other side of the room. This drug made me stupid as heck. I couldn't spell, talk or remember anything. My sleep paralysis scared me for life and I still think of the realistic dreams I had for 6 days. Don't take this medicine. It is terrible.",

The only side effect for me has been sodas tasting flat, which is a side effect I can get on board with! I drink a lot more water because of it and I love that! I have just now started to lose weight after about 3 months or so of being on this medication for headaches. I've started steadily losing ounces/weight. I started out at 142 and over the past month I've dropped down to 134 which is unusual for me because I haven't changed my eating habits at all really except for the soda thing. I'm okay with it all so far, but I hope I don't experience any other side effects like I typically do.",

The new meds seem to help a lot longer I had to skip a month of Trokendi and go back to topomax for insurance coverage reasons and ended up with a two day major migraine. I had to take a second dose of Imitrex for the first time. Now I'm back on Tronkendi XR all I needed a second approval from neurologist for my insurance. Wish me luck fellow head ache sufferers . God help us.",
                    "I was put on Topiramate 50mg to control almost daily migraines. It didn't work at that dosage so my doc increased to 75mg after 2.5 weeks which stopped full-blown migraines but I was still getting threats (migraines started and lasted 1/2 an hour then went away on their own). No weight loss except for what I was already losing (2 Lbs/week from my normal daily exercises). When I first started on Topiramate I couldn't think straight and couldn't remember some words so I immediately started taking it at night only instead (with my dr's approval) and that got rid of all of those problems. I was EXTREMELY hyper on 50mg per day. I'm talking EXTREMELY!!! But as soon as I switched to 75mg the hyperactivity stopped. Moving to 100mg tonight.",
                    "I have been battling my weight since I was pregnant with my first son, who just turned 2. I was 165 when I got pregnant with him, and on the day I went in to have my second son (who is 5 months old today) I weighed 270. I just took my first 25 mg dose of Topamax last night. I am addicted to Diet Dr. Pepper and can't even stand the taste. Not hungry either, so I'm hopeful that this medicine will work. I also take Celexa and Tenuate. I don't know if it's the combination, or just the Topamax, but I am feeling kind of \"floaty\" today, in a sense. Maybe this will improve with time.",
                    "I originally started on Topamax for Migraines and found it to be a 10 for that. I went from 4-5 monthly to maybe 2-3 per year. Life changing! It was difficult for my body to adapt to at first and I had to build up VERY slowly using 12.5mg for a few weeks in the morning and then adding an evening dose, etc. It made me feel horrible, tired, breathless, out of sorts and dopey overall but over time all that wore off and in addition to the absence of migraines I enjoyed a more even keel mood, more control over my decision making including less desire for alcohol. This made staying sober easier than at previous attempts. I also struggled less with eating issues. I've had to increase over time and take breaks/restart to manage the dosage amount vs tolerance.",
                    "There are a few ways to get rid of one of the most annoying side effects, the tingling hands and feet. Potassium- I used to eat a banana or drink fruit juice high in potassium. All of my side effects went away after 2 yrs on Topamax. It is hard to ween off of. I have not taken a pill for 2 mths and have far less headaches than before Topamax!! Great drug! I lost almost 30lb but once we found the right dosage I leveled out and stayed that weight for a yr before weening off.",
                    "I have ADD and with that I have no self control over food, I've battled weight my entire adult life. My psychiatrists prescribed me topiramate, it's been 5 days today and I'm down 8.5 pds. Side effects are I feel pretty weak doing everything, fatigue, I've been getting hot a lot and I work outside. I just hope and pray these issues go away because the topiramate really works great controlling the cravings. I'm never hungry I love it.",
                    "I started on Topiramate originally due to headaches and as a extra incentive, help with my eating/ weight loss. The product helped with both but I was left always forgetting stuff, feeling out of focus all the time, and had a constant tingle (like when you move your foot when its been asleep for a loooong time) in my hands and feet. I've thought about giving it another go due to my weight gain but just don't feel its worth those side effects because it interfered in my every day function and work.",
                    "This is the 2nd time in 10 yrs a neurologist has put me on Topomax. I am on 125 mg a day. The side effects are horrible and the migraines are worse than ever. Neuro refuses to take me off it after I have told him I do not like this drug or its many side effects. I was told I was a lost cause.",

                    "Until three months ago I thought I had tried it all. My doctor mentioned Topamax in a follow-up and asked if I'd be willing to try one more time. (I'd about given up) I had just happened to be recovering from a horrific migraine from the night before that had me down with my ice packs and my trusty bucket for nine hours. So I said, \"Yes, gimme!\" I'm still trying to decide if it was the best decision... My goal was 100mg a day, I haven't made it beyond 50mg yet. My side effects are tingling hands/feet, brain fog, thirsty ALL THE TIME, hot flashes, and forgetfulness. I went from 2-3 migraines weekly to about that monthly. So it DOES help, but the side effects are ridiculous and they aren't going away. It's choosing the lesser of two evils.",
                    "I'm going into my third week on Topamax. For the twelve years previous to this medication, I was treated vigorously for clinical depression. (Clearly, to no avail.) My 'mood spikes' as my husband and I lovingly call them are already beginning to subside. My toes, fingers and nose do tingle, and now that my dose is doubled (third week, time to titrate up), I'm definitely losing my appetite. (I have a few pounds to spare, so I'm not mad about it!) I hope to update this page again in a month or so to let you know how the medication is going then. After being on every anti-depressant the market has ever seen, it's a God-send to have FINALLY been pointed in the right direction. (I'm 30 years old, married with a 2 year old).",
                    "I've been on Topamax since 2010. I started taking 50 mg but I was given the generic and had a really bad allergic reaction to it. My skin broke out and I had to see a dermatologist. I was eventually given Topamax (the brand name) and I no longer had the allergic reaction. The 50 mg wasn't strong enough and eventually I ramped up to 200 mg. I had weight loss in the beginning (close to 90 lbs, which I could afford). I've gained about 20 of it back but I've not lost any since. I do feel that I get somewhat spacey and suffer from some memory loss. I've asked my doctor if I can come off of the medication beginning next year. I've been on it too long and I am concerned with the memory side effects.",
                    "I've been on 50 mg of brand Topamax for two years and the cognitive impairment is significant. I often forget how to spell my last name, I don't remember events of just yesterday, and I can't spell anything anymore for the life of me. I take it for Rapid Cycling Bipolar I & went off it for two weeks to attempt to get my cognition back - by about the 6th day I started to show signs of mania and by day 8 I was full blown manic with psychosis. I'd do anything to get off this brain mush of a drug but it serves a purpose. Oddly, I never went into psychosis until this drug. Oh, and the days that passed without Topamax lead to the worst headaches ever. Buyer beware.",

I'm On 25mg he has not mentioned anything about higher dose but I have not been able to sleep !!! It's driving me crazy now . Was wondering if any of you had the same experience? I do feel so tired and lethargic but it's so late before I get any sleep then I'm waking up mid afternoon missing my days I've tried getting up early going out walking etc like today still no luck . I suffer with mental health problems and was dubious about taking them at first but read a lot on your feedback that it's helped some people.I just hope this depression is through my sleep pattern and not the med .",

I am a taking 25 mg in am/pm and and I am down 4.5 lbs. I did not know this was a weight loss drug too until I saw I lost weight. For me, it's a bonus. I just want to be able to drive and not be sick.  At work, I have to be careful what I type in emails because I have a dopey effect but I can deal with that as long as I function in other areas of my life. I have noticed beer does not taste good so I cannot drink that any longer. I thought it was bad beer until I read something about how our brains are functioning differently on topamax .",

My neurologist and I discussed Topamax and figured it was worth a shot since my chronic, daily migraines were uncontrollable and I was getting Imitrex injections almost every week and could no longer take Toradol. Unlike other people, I have very few side effects. I weaned off Topamax once to try Gabapentin but it by itself wasn't enough and my migraines returned full force. Very few side effects: trouble finding words, thirst, and weight lose (not that I mind). Topamax is a wonderful drug and a LIFESAVER. It and my Gabapentin together is my divine combo!",

It made me thirst, so I drank a lot of water and it took away my craving for junk food.  Send time was end of May, 2016. 100mg at night. I lost 10 pounds in about 5-6 weeks easily. No desire to snack or eat emotionally. Only downside was that I was anxious a lot. I've now plateaud but at least I'm not gaining weight. I should try to up the dose. At least the anxiety has largely decreased.",

I finally seen a psychiatrist for my ADD symptoms and while he was modifying my medication he diagnosed me with binge eating disorder. To my surprise he was right. I had no control. I had always bounced on diets. He started me on Topamax 25mg and I knew instantly it will work. It has a calming affect. I feel so full and I am going to bed without eating for the first time in years. I am very thankful. Not every medication is for everyone. I am pleased with this one so far.",

I stop taking this medication because I could not function at my place of employment not to mention the short term memory loss & loosing my hair was crazy. I truly think that so many people get caught up with being able to stay so thin that they keep taking it. I took 50mg morning and 50mg @ night. Not worth it.",
                    "I love this medicine. My Dr originally gave it to me for weight loss but it got rid of all my joint pains. I had it everywhere. It was a miracle drug for me.

My experience on those was disastrous.Lithium made me more suicidal, lamictal made me binge, destroyed my memory, didn't help my mood, seroquel put 20 #s on me and made me a zombie, didn't help my mood, latuda and abilify made me shake. I was terrified of weight gain on depakote/valproate/risperdal. I was at my wit's end, suicidal, and terrified that I wasn't going to live to my 33rd birthday, then I found NIH considers Topamax to be a mood stabilizer so I asked my pdoc about it.

I started at a min dose but I was eventually up to 300mg/day. I thought nothing of this because if the Dr wasn't worried, why should I be? I had been to 3 different Dr that never asked me if at that dose I was having memory problems, etc. I don't remember anyone telling me the major side effect was memory problems, brain fog, etc no kids... I went through college thinking there was something wrong with me My new Dr has put me on something else that is safe if my husband and I get pregnant.

Now trileptal makes me drowsy enough and I have never had an issue with caffeine and stress before; but out of now where I got a horrible under eye twitch that lasted for (3-4) DAYS. It happened every week through out the 6 months. So I new it was related to the medication. Next was the trouble in speech, not being able to find the right word, stuttering or repeating myself. My short term memory was gone. I would have random pins and needles through out my legs which was probably the only tolerable side effect of the symptoms I had.",

Side effects=food tastes yucky, expecially my beloved sodas and rockstar energy drinks. Im loosing too much weight (Ive always struggled w being too skinny).

I did have the tingling in my hands, feet, and lips and food did taste way different. I was so depressed I could barely even get out of the bed. I actually GAINED about 5 lbs. while I notice most everyone else lost weight. I cried everyday for a week straight and I'm not like that. My house was a wreck and I could barely help my son with his homework. ",

It stopped the ultradian mood cycling that occurred when they upped my lamotrigine up to 200mg, and it stopped the self-harming urge. It did, in combination with other things, cause kidney stones, but alone did not. It helped quite a bit in stabilizing moods, and I'm just upping to 100mg/night. It did a lot for me, and I'm glad my psych put me on it. I don't want to come off. No weight gain. Even some weight loss. I wasn't expecting it, but I am certainly not sad about it. I'd recommend it, but of course, everyone has different brain chemistry, as noted with my experience with Abilify. <== Nope.",

Doc started me on 50 mg. Slowly working up to maximum dose over 30 days. I didn't like the 1st 3 days. Feel disoriented, dingy, irritable.

Effect on migraines was instant and measurable - reduced severity/frequency. Not to zero, but to a more manageable level. I am left with regular headaches, which I now think are Medication Overuse Headaches which will pass as I reduce painkiller use. I still get menstrual migraines which can be tricky to shift, but with sumatriptan I can usually cope.",
                    "I used Topamax for less than a year. I loved it for the first 7 months because it got rid of my headaches and reduced my appetite. Then I began to notice side-effects that made me anxious to get off of it. My fingernails became really thin, I was depressed and my hair was really was falling. I was taking 600 mg of Topamax which sounds like more than a lot of people but I found out online that many other people experienced the same symptoms on lower doses. I had to ween myself off Topamax and am starting Elavil. ",
                    "This is my second check in. I started Topiramate on July 4th with minor success but high hopes taking 25mg 2x daily. Now I am at 100 mg, 50 a.m. & p.m. This seems to be the turning point for me. The weight is finally starting to noticeably go down. I eat a breakfast with protein, barely hungry until dinner but make wiser choices and still enjoy desserts. Very thirsty for water all night and still biking. Good luck all!",
                    "I was diagnosed with vestibular migraines in 2010 and I had severe 24/7 vertigo. I always had \"regular\" migraines since I was a teen, but after an infection of the inner ear in 2010, my migraines changed and I had both pain and vertigo. For one year I had constant vertigo and I honestly thought I would become housebound. I could not go to theatres, malls, stores, or any areas with lots of people because crowds would make me dizzy. My work was in jeopardy. I tried Topamax and it gave me my life back. The initial side effects were awful but my body slowly adjusted to them. Eventually, the dizziness went away. I now take 225 mg daily. I have some word finding and concentration problems but that sure beats 24/7 vertigo.",

I now take topiramate x25mg twice a day and increasing until 6 weeks and I started last week Tuesday and already lost 15lbs. I have to watch this because as being in the medical field I know there are different side effects but the main two are diarrhea and anorexia. The diarrhea I maybe can deal with but I'm not made to be anorexic. I like a little meat on my bones. So just watch your weight side effects",
                    "Extremely effective. I had been non-functioning for a while and this drug was a dream. The complete turn around made me tolerate things I shouldn't have and turn a blind eye to some important side effects. I ended up staying on it for about 2 years before my weight was stuck between 125 lbs and 128 lbs (I am a 6ft tall woman!), my morning 5-8 mile run had completely disappeared and I would have liked nothing more than to curl up and die. This is a truly horrible drug. It does exactly what it says and SO much more. I am so happy to be off of it.",
                    "I was put on it plus Wellbutrin to stabilize my mood. For 3 months I was extremely nauseous, unable to eat a thing. I lost - 12kg's. The side effects were tingling in my hands and feet, a feeling that my head was being pulled to one side, metallic taste, extreme brain fog, loss of vocab (I sounded like an idiot, I could hardly string a sentence together), attention span diminished and extreme muscle weakness. I became socially anxious/awkward and still am. I developed a strange curry-like smell to me. I stopped when I fell pregnant and put on 24kg's, still holding on to 9kg's. It seems to have ruined my metabolism. I loved the appetite suppression (why I stayed on it) but won't go back on it, the side effects are too severe. And expensive",

If you can group that other 10% of the time with a powerful pain medicine then making it through this is not as hard as it use to be. I had been taking other opioids for other conditions that did nothing to help fibro until topamax.",

I've had kidney stones every two years, no memory, major hair loss, tingling in feet and hands and other minor side effects.I wish it hadn't taken me so long to realize that the benefit of less migraines was not worth all of the side effects of topamax. Please think twice before taking this med. This med cost me $187 when first started because they didn't have a generic but since They have generic now it cost me less than $2.00!!!",

My depth perception was way off making it very dangerous for me to be on the road, over time I did notice my migraines were less often and sometimes I would get all the symptoms of a migraine (light sensitivity, nausea) but no pain, kind of like a ghost migraine, which was weird and inconvenient. For the most part I think this medication is worth a try. I am currently on 25mg.",

I had no idea the medicine was working that fast. Well today I really knew it was working I went into town about 1:00 and I hadn't eaten anything so I stopped and got a dollar burger and fries well it was all I could do to finish it. I have never not been able to finish anything seriously I love food. But recently my dr put me on this because I have some an eating disorder that has caused me to gain weight and I've never had a weight problem and it's really upsetting me. I was afraid to get my hopes up so when I got home I tried to eat something that I loved but didn't even want it at all! It's unreal!",

The tingling goes away after a week. hot flashes - too young for this! Mentally in a better place-I was in a depressive funk before taking it. Cleared my head a bit - I actually want to get better now and am walking/making an effort b/c I'm able to b/c my pain is manageable. I still get random shooting pains, but not as harsh. Major con is my hair is falling out!!! any suggestions on hair-loss? Otc supplements I take with it: AZO Cranberry Urinary Tract Health, b12, biotin, pnv, and fish oil. drink lots of water!!!",

I've been on it about 3 to 4 years. I do have Lupus, so I have been blaming it for the brain fog and fatigue. Now I'm not sure as I talked to my doc about this * he told me it could be the drug. He is taking me off of it because it's doing nothing for the migraines. I gave it a 3 more for the lack of help for the migraines versus the side effects, since I'm not sure if it's the drugs, the Lupus, or something else. I just felt it did nothing for me & is a waste of time and money. I hope by going off of it, I feel an improvement in those side effects. Wouldn't you know it, no weight loss!",

I'm only taking Lithium ER 450 mg right now cos my body can't handle more of it. I was taking Topamax for headaches, I thought, but my psychiatrist said it might help my mood. Been taking it for years. I didn't know that it did work for me until I stopped using it. I broke into a manic episode because I started taking that Garcinia weight loss thing, and I wasn't on the Topamax. Well, I guess Topamax DOES work. ",

I also had huge problems thinking at a normal speed. Took it for 3 months thinking well I'll adapt and the side effects will lessen or go away. Nope. Didn't help decrease the frequency of my migraines either. I was very surprised at the side effects as I usually don't have any sensitivities to medicines. Hope your experience is better.",

I did loss 7 lbs my 1st week, I ended up losing a total of 20 lbs in 3 mos. been steady since. I'm still taking Topamax 6mos later.

I guess I am one of the few that do but I did therefore, I am seeking other drugs. As most have stated, my taste changed and anything with carbonation was terrible for the longest time. I eventually pushed through the changes and now everything pretty much tastes the way it should be on the medicine. I have allergies so the headaches I experience are mostly caused by that (which is why I think I have been pushed up to 200mg a day). Just a forewarning to everyone...

I drank one today and it was HORRIBLE! I also feel really lightheaded. I am determined to ride this one out for as long as possible, though.

Not only has it changed the taste of foods, where before foods I would normally eat all of in one sitting, I now only eat a literal serving size of and don't physically want anymore, and most times don't even want to eat unless I'm physically hungry.

I am 21 now. Some advice to you, whenever you don't feel like eating I found that sweet tea gets me hungry, find that X factor in you. The weight loss is insane. I lost 40 pounds in 6 months just by breathing. Now, sleep patterns are important.

The side effects went away after stopping the first time but after the 4yrs on it I still have some side effects that haven't completely gone away.",
                    "Best medication for me yet- I have my life back. Give it time and be patient. Let your body adjust to the drug slowly and be sure to stay hydrated and eat enough even though you might not feel hungry. Drinking smoothies helps. Get enough potassium and you wont feel tingly. I can finally go back to being a student and ballet dancer without seizures! Trust me- this medication can give you your life back.",
                    "This medication DID eventually help with the migraines BUT I started losing cognitive skills. I lost my ability to process thoughts, complete sentences, was even being lost in the place I lived for 35 years. I was very scared. My mind was clouded all the time. The Doctor thought I was possibly having a break down due to stress. At his same time I had been battling continual Urinary Tract Infections. The Doctor immediately took me off of this drug and everything is coming back to normal! I was told this is a VERY common side effect and eventually I would probably have had kidney stones also. ",
                    "I have only been on this medicine for about a month and a half. I was having about 6-8 migraines a week. I cannot tell you how much difference Topamax has made in my life. I feel like a new person. Some side effects , little tingling, my tongue feels weird, but only a few mini migraines here and there now and well manageable. Love it.",
                    "I have been on Topamax for eight months. Prior to that I was having clusters of migraines (5 to 7 per month). I have had two total migraines since starting the medication. Recently my doctor increased my dosage to decrease the breakthrough migraines. I do have the tingling in my hands/feet, and have lost 35 pounds (but needed to). I also was a soda drinker prior to taking the medicine, but have not drank soda since starting Topamax. I do struggle with memory and finding words. Although the side effects are problematic, they do not outweigh the benefits of not having migraines.",

I do not suffer migraines but had been doing some detailed work that day and thought my eyes were tired. By 7pm I could not see my children's faces, by 9pm I was in ER /A&E with almost total loss of vision.  Topamax can cause Acute Angle Closure. A very serious side effect which raises the pressure in the eye.  I still have very little vision. I had read all the warnings and thought- it won't happen to me, but it did so please consider very careful if the risks are worth the benefits. For me they were not",
                    "Ive been on psychiatric meds for a greater than 10 years. Most of these medications had cause me to gain a lot of weight. At my last doctors appointment I weighed 265 and was given the option to start taking topiramate. I took 1/2 50 mg tablet every night for 3 days then 1/2 tablet twice a day starting on June 30, 2016. Well when I was weighed on July 15, 2016, I had lost 5 pounds with no exercise. I have a follow up appointment tomorrow on July 28,2016. Oh I haven't noticed any side effects. I'll keep you guys posted.",

A few times I've had tingling in my fingers that lasted avery short duration. I 've been a chronic migraine sufferer for over 30 years. Started at 20 and I'll be 54 soon. Like many...I 've been to many Dr's and tried too many meds. This was the only thing that worked. Thankfully, for me, the side effects were minimal. Just because you have one bad experience, don't suffer. Find something. Meditation. ..something. You deserve a better life. We wouldn't be on this board if we didn't want to discourage or encourage someone else. Keep trying to live pain free.",

After being on this drug for 6 years or so, I developed kidney stones (another side effect) on five different occasions. My urine citrate levels dipped to 18. 550 and higher is normal. I had become so ill, I was close to renal failure. Calium and vitamine D levels were dangerously low. My bones developed osteomalasia, or softening of the bones. ",

It did decrease my appetite- I went from 209 lbs back to my regular 135 which I hadn't been in 7 years. This took place in about 10 months. At abt the same time I started taking it, I was rearended and suffered a MTBI and scored very low on my neuropsych exam. My old psychiatrist retired and the new psychiatrist is against Topamax bc of the \"foggy\" side effects that are common. Now, a little over a year later, I feel ok abt this med considering the alternatives- wish there were better alternatives!",
                    "Topamax saved my life! I'm currently on 25 mg and will go up if needed. I woke up every single day from a headache. It literally got to the point where I didn't want to wake up. The only side effect I had was nausea for about 3 days but it was gone after that. It took about a week to it to start working for me. I haven't been so happy in my entire life! Headaches controlled my life but not anymore!",

I've been on nine meds to treat my suicidality associated with my ultra-ultra rapid cycling bipolar ii. the AAPS gave me tremors, seroquel made me a zombie, lithium made me suicidal, lamictal and saphris aggrivated my bulimia. My doc didn't want to use antidepressants for fear of driving me into mania. We thought we were out of options. I stumbled on topamax while looking at an NIH research study. I suggested it to my doc. he said, why the hell not? In three days my suicidality was gone, and I barely cycle at all any more. THIS IS A MIRACLE DRUG.",

I was put on these tablets 2 months ago and they have massively helped, while they have not got rid of the migraines completely, rather than having one every day and not being good for anything at all times I tend to go weeks without one and just suffer with a migraine for 2-3 days which I much prefer as I know that most days I will be fine. I have had most side effects but they are manageable; pins and needles, memory loss, clumsiness, runny nose, sore throat, swollen joints, mixing words, tired all the time, unable to sleep a full night, lack of concentration and more.",
                    "I took it for about 3 weeks with no improvement in symptoms whatsoever. Side effects included complete loss of appetite and rapid weight loss, mood swings, intense nausea, insomnia, hallucinations, memory problems and constant confusion. Everyone reacts differently I guess, but this was not the medicine for me.",
                    "I suffer from migraines and also am overweight. So the Dr prescribed me topamax for both. I weighed in at 209 on Feb 2 2016 and today Feb 12 2016 I am 203. So far so good with the weight loss. I'm not to pleased with the side affects however. I feel fuzzy all day. Like I'm on a cloud, Dizzy. Tingling and nubness in my fingers and toes. Hasn't helped my migraines at all either. It does though not make me hungry at all. I have to force myself to eat because I know I have too. I don't see myself taking this medication long term. I'd rather try and lose the weight naturally. Not worth all the side affects",
                    "I recently went back to the dr. for antidepressants. She wanted to put me on a mood stabalizer. Most of those cause weight gain so i said not if its going to make me huge. She gave Topamax. Said I will lose weight. Within about 6 months none of my clothes fit so I weighed myself. I was shocked I had gotten back down to numbers I haven't seen since I was a teen. 119-123. I'm 5'2\" so to me that's perfect. Food is never on my mind unless my stomach starts growling. I forget to eat. This drug is great for people who have problems with weight. I don't get any other side effects. It doesn't make me a zombie. I take 50mg near bed time. I know it's for seizures & migraine. Sometimes mood. NEEDS TO BE FOR WEIGHT LOSS TOO. highly recommended!!",

Initially I noticed a lot of tingling in hands, feet & face, in week 2 a very tense jaw, I still feel like myself, but I feel more tired. I dont need to nap or anything during the day but at night i have NO trouble sleeping .All of the pain in my head disappered I thought it was amazing but I did get 2 hormonal headaches (not migraine strength) all in all not bad. I eat a dinner meal only and drink water all day long this med just makes me not want food. Weightloss:10kgs in 3 months.. I have no depression just tiredness its not fixed by naps",
                    "I took this medication for about 2 weeks hoping it would help my hypo mania . Some members of my family said it helped them. NOPE! Complete DISASTER for me. I could not stay on this thing for a month! The loss of appetite really sucked but I expected that I thought maybe I could look past that. But l went from 120 to 117 in 5 days. It did not help my mood it only made me dizzy and gave me uncontrollable jerky movements. I was forgetting words. I could not concentrate in school (senior in high school) Everything felt like a dream. I basically became really stupid. I was seeing flashing lights. It was bad. Once I got off of it everything I felt much smarter and better. I had many adverse effects to this medication.",

My doctor had already tried Gabapentin, Sumatriptan, and Propranolol, all of which had side effects but did nothing for migraines. Next came Topamax. Side effects were: Slight change of taste (sodas tasted flat, bread tasted sweeter), and gradual loss of memory and concentration, such that it was hard to read or study an issue at work and be able to understand it. It did not affect my eating habits or energy levels, did not affect my weight at all. It also did nothing for my migraines. It severely impeded my ability to think and thus my ability to work in the tech field, so I stopped taking it, and my work performance improved drastically.",

Fortunately I can rotate back after about a year off. This is one of my favorites, because the side effects don't interfere too much with my day-to-day life. Tingling in the hands and feet, decreased appetite, and a bit of increased anxiety (but manageable). For me, the benefits of having my migraines under control (ones that went on for days and weeks, 7-9 scale pain on a regular basis), far outweigh the cost of the side effects.",

TID (three times a day) to brand Trokendi XR 200mg (once daily) because I and my psychiatrist believed plasma levels would remain comparable to TID dosing due to Microtrol technology. My PDOC decided that a 50mg increase was fine. It sure was! I am indicated for topiramate for the following reasons: A. Bipolar Disorder; topiramate acts as a mood stabilizer. B. Drug Cravings; topiramate reduces my urge to use drugs, studies are directed at its propensity to reduce alcohol and stimulant cravings C. Anxiety: topiramate is a GABA agonist and slightly anxiolytic D. Weight loss Trokendi XR is far superior and smoother than generic topiramate when it comes to amelioration of symptoms. 10/10.",

The side effects were rough, but you MUST start with a low dose and work up gradually, I would suggest not more than 50mg a week, until you reach your target dose. I loved that it took also away my over- stitmulated appitete and I was able to reduce my BMI to 24.",

When Imitex came out I thought that was a lifesaver and it was, I used to get a migraine and have to go home and hide under the covers for a day or two but Imitex isn't a preventive like Topamax. The only side effects were in the first 2 weeks with subtle numbness and tingles and loss of short term memory. The longer side effect has been the weight loss but I had been overweight by 20 lbs anyway so this has been a blessing! I look great and have only had a few minimal headaches since June.",

I've struggled with my weight since I was young, [I'm 17 and I started these pills at 260lbs. I'm now at 231lbs]. These pills make me feel like food is the enemy.

The side effects from this one wore off for me after about 2 months..you gotta stick through it to get used to it, once you do it's totally worth it. I went from having almost daily headaches and weekly severe migraines to maybe 1 migraine every couple of months that even then it was very minimal. Totally worth trying!",

They killed me especially with my grades. I couldn't focus in school, but it worked wonders with my migraines. I will get one every once in a while but hardly ever, plus I lost like twenty pounds. Totally worth it to be migraine free.",

The side effects (peripheral neuropathy, inability to remember anything, altered taste of just about everything, insomnia were not worth suffering through. So I'm still going through an adjustment.

The only benefits I can say I had were the loss of weight (159lbs at appointment on Thursday/ 155.5lbs on Sunday) and I was able to quit smoking as I didn't have the urge to.",

My headaches are down from waking up with one everyday, to maybe one once a week and one migraine a month. I'm take 100 mg at night, I was tired for the first few weeks but built a tolerance to it. Carbonated beverages do taste flat to me now, I'm glad to read this has happened to others as well, I thought I was going crazy. Hoping now that I'm up to 100mg that I will begin to lose more weight, I have noticed a surpressed appetite, eating much less of my meals, and have less of a \"sweet tooth\" which is a big deal for me",

I was put on topamax to attempt to get rid of these urges. The first week in topomax I was on 25mg in the morning and 25mg at night and had minimal side effects and no effect on my appetite and no weight loss . I did however have bad diarrhea and was a bit 'slow' I bumped it up to 50mg morning and 50mg night the next week with the same results, but no side effects ( felt like I was taking sugar pills) Feeling annoyed.... the next week I bumped it up to 100mg am and 100mg pm and I was amazed!! Immediately my cravings for sweets went away completely! I did not want to binge! Now I'm eating small healthy meals and losing weight! Love it",

Within the week of taking the new medicine I became completely unable to sleep at night, upset stomach 24/7 and an a horrible level of unquenchable thirst. The no sleep was the worst part; I'm usually a pretty great sleeper, so going from 7-8 hours of sleep a night to maybe 3-4 hours a night was rough on my physical and emotional self. I was advised to stop the medicine tonight by my doctor and cannot wait to return to myself. I even still had migraines while on this medicine. Would not recommend.",

Before taking Topamax I would have a headache for months, with no relief. After I started taking Topamax the migraines were down to 3 month. My Dr. started me on a dose of 25mg, 2 X day and titrated me to 100mg 2 X day. Unfortunately, the Topamax no longer seems to be effective and on my next visit I will ask my Dr. to either increase the dosage or to prescribe a different medicine.

Then a new MD took the Vicodin away and gave me Topamax. MY LIFE WAS HELL. I live alone in a 2 story house and I had to scoot up/down on my butt. I am 66 & disabled (from strokes) and I was terrified. I could barely form sentences, I had terrible brain fog, I couldn't cook a meal as I was so confused I kept burning things. It was horrible.

I put the e-cig and the bystolic down!! Dr. put me on Topamax 100mg and Wellbuterin 300mg help with the headaches and weight loss. As I ramped up from 25mg to 50mg of Topamax I noticed significant changes in my behavior as did others. I cried continuously and at the most ridiculous things. I was short tempered and wanted to be left alone (to cry). Side notes..it made my face feel numb, carbonated drinks tasted funny, vision was funky and did zero for weightloss. As a mom of 4, I can't continue this medication. 30-40lb weight loss is not worth living this way.  ",

It felt very restless and I woke up a lot and was confused. I feel good this morning however. I am determined to try this medicine for a couple of months.

I was on this medication for just over 36 hours and I think it made me more sick than any medication I had ever been on. My neurologist gave it to me as an anti-seizure medication. With in just a few hours of taking it I was feeling quite sick but was not entirely sure that that was the reason. After well under 24 hours of being on it I felt nearly catatonic very ill and ultimately had to stop taking it altogether. I ended up falling in the bathroom because I was so uneasy on my feet. The upper part of my legs went numb and at one point I was having difficulty even speaking. I was afraid I was going to end up in the ER.",

I read about the side effects prior to taking the drug and I was committed to taking the medication for at least a month to see what would happen. I had the typical side effects of tingling, change of taste but over the course of time all of these have pretty much gone away along with my headaches. The drug is expensive but it is well worth it for me.",

Got the weight loss side effect, & eventually managed to drop the 70 lbs. that I'd gained from other mental meds (karma!). Starting side effects were hard: Was nauseous 1st week & felt like someone had kicked my butt; the successive titrations over the next few months were the same, minus the nausea, lasting a week or less. Side effects afterwards: I'll occasionally get pins & needles in fingers, slight name/word recall issues but no serious case of the stupids unless I go above 150mg, & constant thirst/ dry mouth. Only 8 stars cuz I'm not sure it's working anymore (possibly cuz pharmacy switched brands).",

I was so hopeful when the neurologist mentioned this tablet because he said I would also lose weight with it which I have lost 4lb's with so far but I would rather be fat and happy then skinny and angry if that's the choice I have with these tablets",

I was initially annoyed because I wanted it to work immediately, but I still had migraines. You have to titrate the dose up 25 mg a week. I initially went up to the recommended 100 mg, but I hated the \"loss of words\" feeling I had, and found that I had about 1-2 migraines a month. So I decided to go back to 75 mg and see what happened. I had less loss of words and finger tingling, and yet my amount of migraines stayed at 1-2/month. This has been a lifesaver for me. I don't know what I would do without it.",
                    "Before Topamax I used to suffer from chronic migraines I mean 3-4 migraines a week. Been on Topamax for nearly 3 weeks, day one 25mg instant appetite suppressant loss 18.7lbs in 2wks! Inches everywhere, food taste good just eat very little of i.t I'm never ever hungry but I enjoy cooking! I have energy, not bogged down with lots of medicines anymore and not one full migraine! I'm excited to lose weight it's actually very easy to eat healthy. Its all you crave and I was a sweet addict. No ugly side effects as described, not on this dosage. So I hope this has helped someone.",
                    "When I first started topamax I couldn't notice the side effects except for the tingling in my hands, feet and face. I thought it would go away with time but here I am 2 years later and it is still happening. This medication also prevented my migraines at first, then I had to be put in the hospital for 5 days to get treatment about 6 months ago, and now they are back again. If you miss even one dose you get a whole new set of side effects as if you started the medicine that day! Before I took this medicine my hair was so thick, and I never really noticed the hair loss side effect until now because my hair is falling out in chunks. Topamax also caused me to get kidney stones and be hospitalized for a month. The only good thing is I lost 50lbs",
                    "I have been taking Topamax for about 6 years now. My current dosage is 200mg/day - the dosage was recently increased during a high-stress time. The main side-effects I notice are slight tingling in fingers, which only lasts a few moments. I have gone from 5-6 migraines a week to only 1 or 2 a month. Certainly worth it.",
                    "I have been on Topiramate 25mg for 1 week to be exact and have lost 8lbs as of this morning. I feel this has been my savior. I have always been healthy (no high blood pressure, no diabetes, no High Cholesterol) however I've always been obese and worked towards trying to rid myself of the weight in efforts to prevent myself from getting those diseases in the future. This has given me the kick start I need. It reduced my cravings for sweets and carbs as well as suppressed my appetite. I do eat 3 meals a day (or at least I try to when I can remember) but for the most part, I have the same amount of energy, I sleep AMAZINGLY, and haven't had any major side effects as others have mentioned. All good here!",
                    "I've been on Topamax for about a week now great results. carbonated drinks taste horrible little confused in class but overall its a Lifesaver. My migraines had me suicidal.",
                    "Topamax worked great to prevent migraines, however the side effects that I experienced were not worth the prevention. I experienced numbness and tingling in my extremities, severe problems with word retrieval, a complete inability to focus or concentrate, anxiety, agitation, severe mood issues (I became very angry and upset at the smallest of things). But what finally did me in was severe epigastric pain, nausea, dizziness and disorientation that came about suddenly and was persistent until I titrated myself off the medication after a visit to the urgent care. As soon as I got off Topamax, the migraines were back every day and I question which was worse - the migraines or the side effects. ",
                    "I have not had good luck with this medicine. The side effects were horrible at first but they did settle down and mostly disappeared after 4 or 5 months on the medication. If you're just starting it, give it some time and the side effects will go away, but for me it never helped lessen or decrease my migraines so now my doc has given me Amitriptyline to try so I'm hoping I have better luck with this one!!",
                    "Been on topiramate for around 9 months now. I've suffered with severe migraines for years and tried everything, started at 25mg, now on 100mg, they are trying to put me up as far as 400mg to find the optimum dose but I told them that I feel like it's making me sick, my memory has gone seriously bad! I keep feeling freezing cold all the time, I also have a serious stomach condition making my life miserable since taking these tabs, 3 days ago I Googled topiramate and realized why I am ill, now coming off it. It really helped reduce migraine frequency and severity but side effects I cannot cope with right now, such a shame.",
                    "It takes a while to kick in, and you HAVE to gradually increase your dosage - like, start at 25mg twice a day, then every 2 weeks, 25 mg more - gradually increase to the max dosage your doc wants you on. Otherwise the more negative side effects will be more pronounced. I am on this medication for migraines, and the weight loss is a \"side effect.\" It took about 6 months before I saw any weight loss at all, so I was frustrated at first, though the migraines did start to subside a bit. Now, I've been on it a year, and I've gone from 235 lbs. to 205 lbs. without trying at all. Like, I'm not exercising any more than I was, I haven't been dieting at all that I'm aware of - I just don't crave food like I used to. Headaches better too.",
                    "I love the memory loss who wants to remember all the bad crap anyway! As for the good stuff Facebook will remind you with your own damn photos!",
                    "i have been on topamax for a little over 6 years. I started at 25 mg. and slowly went up to 250 mg. I experienced the weight loss, tingling and the other minimal side effects at the lower dose but was encouraged to stay on the meds. As i increased the dose, i started having hair loss, dizziness and \"white outs\" where i would not be able to see at all for up to 20-30 seconds at a time. I also started having the memory issues. I started seeing a new neuro and we dropped me down to 100 mg. The hair loss stopped but I still get the vertigo. I am now down to 50 mg. I suffer from eye pain in my left eye and still the random dizziness- which is horrible. Weaning off of this - I do Botox injections now for preventative with some relief",
                    "I've suffered from chronic headaches/ migraines all my life and now being that I have finished high school and moved to university the headaches would cause me to loose focus in university work. When my grades started to decrease I knew I had to do something about it. The doctors prescribed me Topamax (Topiramate). I've been taking this medication for about a year and I absolutely love it! Now I only get headaches once or twice a week, instead of every day. This medication helped turn dark, painful days to luminous ones!",
                    "I started taking Topiramate about a month ago for the prevention of headaches and migraines. I'm a college student and have had a recent and serious issue with getting headaches 4-5 days a week followed by a migraine every few weeks. After going to the Neuro over break, they suggested I be put on topiramate daily, and it has been the biggest help! My number of headaches has gone down to 1-2 a week, and I think it will continue to improve. Very happy, very pleased not having to depend on tylenol to function, or having to miss class. No serious side effects, sometimes tingly in finger tips or right above upper lip for a few minutes. Haven't had a migraine since being put on this medication!",
                    "I've struggled with my weight for years so my doctor started me on a combination drug of the topiramate/phentermine (low dose) she said the success rate is awesome. There is a \"diet\" pill out there with both combined but she said it's usually not covered by insurance and very expensive. Advised from a pharmacist to have my doctor create the same thing which is 2 scripts the topiramate and low dose of phentermine. I just started so I'm on day 2 and it cost me 30.00. I've not had any cravings, have had to remind myself to eat. I'll keep you posted as things move along. Best of luck to you all on your journey.",
                    "Unfortunately, I got more headaches while I was on Topamax. They increased from once a week to several a week. I'm sure I'm an exception to the rule, but one size does not fit all.",
                    "I have been on 50mg of Topamax for one year now. I am still on the fence. I have still have the tingling/numb hands and feet (sometimes so bad, it wakes me up at night.) My Neurologist recommended increasing my potassium levels. That seems to help sometimes. I lost some weight and I sleep better now taking this. I do have few migraines a month, but I do not want to take a pill the rest of my life. ",
                    "It help with less migraines but I lost a ton of weight I usually was at 130-135 but Topamax I was at 112-115. I never had an appetite",
                    "Personally this drug helped my mood swings greatly, however I was quite disturbed that it agitated my diet as much as it did. I have a co-morbid eating disorder which was agitated by the med. The Topirimate made it so I HAD to eat my food a very specific way. Something soft, yet crunchy at the same time. Normally I wouldnt complain, however it was always on my mind.I think the hardest thing about the med was the appetite suppression for me. I was down to eating one meal a day, which ultimately let to me not loosing any weight which I can say was very difficult for me. I had increased irritability, and I felt overly fatigued. I am also on Citalopram, which is a terrible combination if you're prone to fatigue.",
                    "I had started taking this medication quite a few years ago. About 4 to be exact and it wasn't until about 1 year ago that I started to see a HUGE difference in my skin. I have extremely unbareble dry skin now that just flakes off and flakes off and flakes off. I moisturize everyday constantly but it just gets worse and there's nothing that helps it. Does anyone else experience this problem? I just want to know if it is the medication because I have not had dry skin my whole life and want to make sure that it will go away when I get off of it..",
                    "This is the best thing that ever happened to me. I suffered through migraines starting at about age 12. Tried Inderal, Imitrex, among a host of other drugs. I've been on it for over 4 years and no more migraines. Yes, there was some tingling for the first few months, but it was not a big deal, just felt like my toes had fallen asleep and were \"waking up\". Since I was already on a weight loss plan, I don't know if it helped in that area or not. I can't say that I had any other side affects. I've always stumbled with my words and this hasn't increased that issue. I certainly didn't notice it changing the way things taste!",

Fibro kicks butt and I don't know which one works and which one doesn't at this point. I do know I am losing my hair and my nails are peeling off! If anyone has any suggestion as to which drug might be doing this please help! I can't find this as a reaction to any of them.",
                    "I am 19 year old active kid that exercises 4-6 times a week and suddenly after years of working out some migraines began in the gym that didn't go away for 3 months. All day everyday, constant migraines. I had to stop working out, got fat and lost all my gains. I started 25 mg topamax at the same time with chiropractic care (found in neck x-ray abnormal lordotic curve) and started treatment every week. A week later of both of these combined, the migraines are finally gone! but my head still throbs except with no pain.. I am just happy I can finally exercise again, and stop hating life. (Got CT Scan and MRI of head before X-ray of neck, was clear {checked neck because it got stiffer a month into migraines} ) NO SIDE EFFECTS! :-)",
                    "I've suffered headaches that progressed into migraines for years and they drove me wild, I first tried out beta-blockers for them, they did nothing but make them worse and give me insomnia so I was given topiramate about 3 weeks ago, only a low dose to start with but I've already noticed an improvement, I suffer migraines 1-3 times a week and now if I get one, it's nothing a triptan can't fix - I've noticed a few inconsequential side effects, like the pins and needles in my feet and the stuttering and struggling to get words out but I can deal with that if it means my migraines are alleviated",
                    "I have had a good experience after trying to find the right cocktail for several years. I have a very high-stress job and my anxiety is put to the test daily. It is not clinically significant at this point and I can only attribute that to finally having my medicines right. I am taking Wellbutrin, Lamictal, Topamax and Zoloft at pretty low dosages for each. I did lose about 70 pounds. After over a year on the Topamax, my normal appetite has started to return and I have gained back about 10 pounds, but I still have self control that I lacked when I was fighting depression which is now at bay.",
                    "The 2 weeks I was taking topamax ended up being the worst 2 weeks of my life. I was started on this med on Wednesday. By Monday, I was half-way through my day at work when I got lightheaded, dizzy, a terrible headache and started experiencing left sided numbness/tingling. Nearly wrecked and ended up in the ER where they diagnosed migraines. Was sent home to have a headache with left side weakness/numbness, confusion, foggy feeling for the next 2 weeks. 5 doctors appts, 2 ER visits, 1 outpatient infusion for migraines, and 1 admission to the hospital later. I finally figured out on MY OWN that when I stopped taking topamax, my symptoms got better. Although they are still not gone. My vision has changed as well as other long term effects.",
                    "I have been using Topamax since February 2008 (this is August 2008) until recent stress reached an all time high Topamax had been working great. But with added stress of the death of my husband's father, my bipolar son going off to residental treatment, my other bipolar son having to come off of his Lithium due to his kidneys...well I am sure you can guess I have had several break through migranes.  Still, overall I have been pleased. I have lost about 40 pounds. I went from 228 down to 189. For a 39 year old, 5'3\" woman. that'a a big difference. ",
                    "This is an early review as I just started it on 10/16/16 but the food cravings are gone, it takes less food to satisfy me, soda tastes terrible, cigarettes taste different and bad (which is a surprising good side effect!) and I just feel better with less food in me. I have tried phentermine with no luck and usually had good success with natural weight loss until being diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and needing a knee replacement that keeps me from working out too much. So so far, I am impressed. I'll be back in a few weeks for a weigh in review. No side effects like others have had with mental fogginess or tingling. 25mg 2x day. Here's hoping my 235 can become 155 again!",

Although I haven't had a seizure ever since I began to take the medication (which is good because the meds are working) the side effects were horrible. I would often feel very disoriented and saw a great amount of weight loss. This may not apply to everyone because everyone is different, but that was my experience with this medication.",
                    "Miracle drug! The side effects can be daunting at first, like tingling/numbness in extremities that won't stop for hours, but if you increase your water intake substantially and power through, it's totally worth it. My daily tension headaches are 90% gone, which is huge for me. It didn't do much in terms of overall muscle pain reduction or the daily body aches, but I did lose over 30 pounds in four months. I stopped drinking all carbonated drinks (because it makes them all taste super flat weirdly) and definitely am not as hungry as I used to be, so that's just a bonus.",
                    "I do not tolerate Neurontin or steroids well. They blow me up like a balloon. Topamax, along with Cymbalta has given me excellent relief with little side effectcs. Yeah to no more invasive injections and cankles!",
                    "I am stopping Topamax after 3 months. Initially I lost 13lb pretty fast, within a couple weeks. I was laid up with an injured back and sick so I wasn't moving, but then I wasn't really eating either. Since then I've played with the same 5ib. I am taking 100mg 2x day. After about 6wks I got some of the common side effects (vision, memory, taste, exhaustion), I stopped losing weight. But I'm fairly certain it is the source of some pretty severe depression that didn't exist prior to taking it. I'm glad I lost 13lb, but the depression is too much to handle and I'm throwing in the towel. Wish it had been more effective, but really it stopped working after about 3 weeks anyhow.",

I have so many and I know it is not doing much for my pain so today I am going to have to go on yet another different med, have been on so many. The one good thing , I lost 60 lbs. but I sure suffered so bad for it. I have to go to a Pathtologist for the blisters on my tongue that the doctors figure are not caused by the medicine and yet it is listed twice as a side effect. Thanks for listening to me.",
                    "This has been a life saver for me as far as migraines go. At first I had a few of the side effects, brain fog, forgetfulness, but that went away after a month or so. Without this drug, I get at least 2-3 headaches a week ranging from dull to severe. I rarely have a migraine while on it.",

I will do that for 7 nights, then up to 50mg for 7 nights, then 75 mg for 7 nights, then 100 mg for 7 nights, and so on until I reach a mg my Dr. and I are comfortable with. So far I have not had any side effects except- not being hungry. In the last 3 days I have hardly eaten anything. I've been very thirsty for water, soda taste like crap- and I was very addicted to diet coke. I haven't weighed yet... been meaning to. Last I weighed was a month or so ago, and I was at 180 ish. Today is July 10th 2017. I will weigh after work and see where I am so I have a better idea who this will effect me! I've gone from 120 to 180 ish in the past year - with different meds..",

The VA (my neurologist) had me try this drug to see if it would help me with the migraines. After about a month I noticed that I couldn't concentrate, and I'd began to effect my studies badly. My anxiety was the worst it had ever been and I was slipping into a depression. I had no idea what was wrong g with me. The VA gave me (a person who suffers from anxiety) a medication that makes you stupid, and wrecked havoc on my mind without warning me about any potential side effects. I had to process the change on my own, figure out what was wrong with me, and ween myself off the pills. Use with extreme caution!",

I am much more mobile, less irritable, and overall happier. I've been on the medicine for about a month though, and have seen a slight return of symptoms. I used to live off of over the counter pain killers, but this medicine has really helped to repair the damage to my brain after tbi.

The weight loss was great at first, but with it causing crippling anxiety I had to add an antidepressant, which put all the weight back on even though I was still on the topamax. I tried going off of it twice. The first time, almost cold turkey. This was a disaster. I didn't have any seizures, but my headache was 24/7 until I got back on it. The second time I weaned myself off very slowly. Over about 2 months, even though I was only taking 100mg. It worked, but I discovered that the topamax was helping me with pain all over my body, not just headaches. Every day was a struggle. After 2-3 months off the drug, I decided to go back on it. Sure, I am less laid back, but I have a lot less pain.",
                    "Began Topamax in 2005 after suffering from migraines that would last for weeks. The litany of side effects is true, and its nickname, \"Stupamax\" is honestly earned. Word recall, memory, trouble focusing, hand numbness, fatigue, insomnia, the works. But number of days with headaches went from 21 to 9 the very first month. Now, after years of taking it, my body has been depleted of vitamin B12, and I have been suffering from horrible GI troubles. However, none of my doctors seemed to link Topamax to the B12 depletion. It took Google to figure that one out. But thank you to Google and B12 supplements. I hope this helps someone else relieve any issues they've been experiencing. ",

It helped me quit drinking, it keeps my migraines at bay and it is part of my prescription and supplement regimine for a bi-polor disorder and fibromyalgia. I did have some of the mentioned side effects at first...the first 6 months...but my body adjusted to the medicine and the side effects went away.

NO COKES. but I suppose in the long run that is not a bad thing. if you haven't tried it please do so. my neurologist called it dopamax for a reason. for the first 2 weeks I was loopy and sort of confused but I believe that was my body getting used to the med. but after that no problem. try it I think you will be migraine free.

I developed a 9mm kidney stone when I had no prior history. I developed a blood disorder (something acidosis, was told this was a rare side effect, but that was why I stopped taking it.

I had bad withdrawals after weaning off, no seizures thankfully. Migraines have been daily again for last 18 months. Tried to go back on topamax but I can't tolerate it any more.

It brought my migraines down from 3-4 a week to 2-3 a month, which is great, however after having been in and out of hospitals with horrific abdominal pain my doctor cycled me off of it. I had also lost 20lbs in a 3 week period, but had not noticed a change in my appetite. I am very fit and eat 5-6 times a day to keep up with my metabolism and workouts, so the weight loss was extremely irritating, considering it was nothing but lean tissue. I also could not drink carbonated beverages, and was extremely depressed and emotional (which is very out of character). I did not think the side effects I experienced were worth the benefit.",

They are weight loss, kidney stones, tingling in hands & feet & frequent urination. I found that other medications din't help (Depakote). I also take this with Inderal(B/P Med) and Catapres TTS Patch(B/P Med) cause I also suffer high Blood Pressure and these two medications also are good migraine fighting meds.

I was started at 25mg at night and moved up 25mg every week until now, three weeks in, when Im currently on 75mg and have lost 10lbs already! At 3+lbs a week!

On top of that I was nauseous and couldn't eat. Then finally when I did get an appetite and did eat I was extremely nauseous afterwards.

I couldn't focus on command at all. Then my bottom lip wouldn't stop tingling with a numb feeling. I got extremely dizzy, felt out of it. So I thought let me lay down. Feel asleep 15 min.. Woke up thought an hour passed was completely out of it. Whole left side of face felt palsy completely numb. Tingling/numbness arms, hands, legs + feet. Next day visual less but symptoms still there.

I became very weak and became ill from fatigue due to no appetite and weight loss. It did lessen my migraines, however I still had them about once a week or so. The weight loss, fatigue and overall effectiveness of the medication caused me to discontinue its usage.",

I felt so foggy and \"in and out\" of ability the abilty to concentrate in the mornings (100mg nightly dosage). ok after 4 hrs. My mouth was literally so dry and my tongue so thick feeling, I could not get 3 syllable words out. Also, I had to grasp for words.

Because I am tired of taking 6 Advil and every other over the counter drug there is everyday and wondering what is happening to my body from doing that over time and having the headaches day after day after day.

At first was seemed very tired, but now I seem adjusted to the medication. I take 75 mg at night before bed. Sleep better than I ever have. Appetite simply isn't there. Sodas don't taste the same; kind of like they have been sitting out for several days. I am remain very hopeful this will work for the long term. I have approximately 100 pounds to lose.",

I also had the fairly common side effect of just feeling confused, though this wasn't all that severe and I was still able to do well in school. I also experienced tingling in my hands and feet, and though this was irritating, it was bearable. The real kicker for why I quit taking this medicine was when I began to have what felt like panic attacks and severe confusion, along with elevated heartbeat and dizziness. Also my fingers would move on their own and seem to get stuck sticking straight out and I had no control over it. ",
                    "I started out at 75mg, had to decrease at first because it made me super emotional and had really bad tingling in hands/feet, so I ended up going back down to 50mg, then I slowly increased by 25mg until I got up to 100mg and I'm doing OK now. I do feel emotionally sensitive at times and do get occasional tingling in my fingers and toes if I don't eat for awhile, which the Topamax also decreases my appetite and I have lost weight on. I still have ocular migraines if I stay up too late or don't get enough sleep. If I have even a small glass of wine the evening before I will wake up with an awful migraine the next morning, so I see why they say not to drink while on the medication. Overall it has really significantly decreased migraines.",

I have been on propranolol 160 mg daily for 2 years now, and have had good results from that with not too many side effects. I take rizatriptan when I do get a migraine and it stops it usually.

I felt like I had the Flu without the runny/stuffy nose. It also causes constipation. I had read several reviews and saw a couple comments about how the side effects would die down after a few weeks. I was determined to push through Now my head isn't as foggy. I'm no where near as tired during the day. I take one melatonin gummy at night just to be sure I get a good nights rest.

Then along came Topiramate!!! It took around 3 weeks to start working and has been a godsend. The only side effects I've had have been the tingling in my mouth, hands and feet, which, yes, is annoying but nothing compared to the pain I had from the migraines.

I can take much lower doses of the brand name to achieve the same effect with the generic; but my insurance won't cover the brand name.

I lost so much hair that when I try to braid it it's like braiding tiny strands of dental floss. It looks so ridiculous long I had to chop it all off just to conceal how grossly thin it is. People call it dopamax for a reason. It made my memory Swiss cheese and when I had to process information it felt like fighting through seaweed. The worst side effect was the depression. This stuff makes me downright suicidal.  It helped me lose about 80 pounds by starvation. I never wanted to eat. I became anemic.

My migraines significantly reduced, though I did get most of the common side effects: slight tingling in my fingers, carbonated beverages tasted gross, and weight loss.  My main warning about this medicine is weight loss. It seems to be paraded as a benefit, and to some it may be, but if you are already naturally slim, pay very close attention. I wound up dropping to an unhealthy weight despite all attempts to counter it, and it's ultimately why I had to stop Topamax. I was unwillingly wasting away.

He did not go on to tell me specifically what those symptoms would be like and I had no idea what this could entail. He said the drug had/has been known to cause these episodes. Just telling me to watch for symptoms though...by the time I starting having the symptoms, I was too paranoid to be able to do anything about it or even realize what was happening since I had never had such an episode. It was the scariest thing I've ever experienced in my life and I still have nightmares and anxiety about the things experienced in my head and thoughts during the time of the episode that lasted for 2 weeks, even while in the hospital. I would love to sue the pants off the makers and that doctor, who, by the way, when my mother called my doctor for help, he stated \"Since she won't talk to me, I am not her doctor anymore as of this moment.\" I wouldn't get on the phone because I was in the middle of a psychotic episode and thought everyone was trying to kill me.

If this works for you and you are on a smaller dosage great. It's made me suffer the entire time I have been on it, granted I do take a higher dosage than probably most of you. I do have to admit, as far as migraines go, I haven't had as many and I normally do.",
                    "I got migraines nearly everyday for around 6 months, I tried lots of different drugs, monitoring blood sugars and cutting out certain foods. One day I was prescribed this to take twice a day. I read lots of reviews about side effects the only ones i got were tingly hands/feet and for diarrhea. But I could cope with that and have not had a Migraine ever since best thing I was prescribed and would recommend.",
                    "I went from 1 or 2 migraines a year to about 9 a month. After a year or so of this my doctor had me try Topamax. I've been on 25 mg., once a day, for the past three weeks and I'm very happy with it. I've only had the beginnings of 3 migraines (immediately took my Relpax) and they went immediately away. I feel like I've got my life back. My only side effects are a slight loss of appetite (which I'm not unhappy about) and a little tingling in my feet. Well worth it.",
                    "I been on Topiramate 25mg once in the morning and once at night been taking it for four days now with no changes in appetite at all. I am at the same weight. I am taking it for the side effect to lose weight, but I do suffer from depression. I will update you all if any weight loss does occur. I will be going to see if my primary care doctor will prescribe me the new weight loss pill Qsymia next, because it has topiramate in it. I Just need a jump start to getting this weight off of me. I have been reading accounts where people have been losing off of 50mg of topiramate, but not for me hoping maybe in a week I may see results. I have a 30 day supply. Let's hope",
                    "I had been Honorably discharged from active duty, and from the time I got out I had experienced Migraines on almost a daily basis's. I went to a neurologist after trying home remidies and using Exedrin Migraine, and he put me on Topiramate 50mg twice daily, but my body metabolized it to fast, causing my head to be very painful. Also the first day I took it, I had a pain in my head that woke me from REM sleep, my wife said I was screaming in pain while sleeping. He recommended Trokendi XR 100mg Extended Release. Since I have been on Trokendi, my head hurts daily a little with a slight tingling pain which my neurologist says is normal. I have migraines on a rare occassion.",
                    "Make sure to start with low dosage, or it will make you sick. Had less stiffness right away. Still some pain, but nothing like before. Somehow, it helped reduce my asthma symptoms. First time I slept 7 hours in a row since my car accident 5 years prior. Lost 20 lbs easily, but I had to stop taking it due to side effects. It makes certain foods taste terrible; gave me a constant pins/needles/numbness feeling in my hands and feet; dropped things more often; handfuls of hair fell out; sweat turned orange; dumb as box of rocks. All this yet it worked better than anything else I'd taken.",
                    "Update from \"Chickadee\"- been on med for five weeks, down ten lbs without exercising. My eating habits have been better although this week They changed considerably for about four days, I ate a whole lot of rubbish but still managed to lose two pounds. I've been consistently losing two lbs a week and weigh myself every Monday. Still taking 50 mg at night..only noticeable side effects now are tingling in feet and hands intermittently, and fatigue at times otherwise nothing noticeable. I am thinking about increasing dosage. I would like to see quicker results but maybe I'm just being greedy. Two lbs a week is a safe, maintainable weight loss. Hope it keeps up. Currently at 230#",
                    "I take 50mg at night because of drowsiness. The medication did help me with my migraines , I've only had a few since I started the medication. My side effects include, tingling in hands and feet, Red eyes, But the worst is the brain fog, trying to remember the simplest things are tough. I have also noticed that I get angry about stuff more than I used to.",
                    "I was on Topamax for about a year. I didn't notice any major side effects at first. I was loving the weight loss (didn't consider that a bad one). It did help decrease the frequency of my migraines. Unfortunately I started noticing that I was having trouble remembering things. I was feeling like an idiot and was back in school so it was not a good combination. I wasn't in school when I started on this medication so I didn't realize how much it was affecting me.",
                    "I just started taking Topamax. So far it's not too bad. The headaches are getting a little better and the side effects aren't bad. The only thing I'm having trouble with is differentiating between dreams and reality. my dreams seem so real, like it happened. I hope it gets better with time.",
                    "In 2 days I've lost 4 more pounds on this drug! I couldn't be happier.",
                    "I have chronic daily migraines, and have tried several medications for migraine prevention, including Depakote, Elavil (amitriptyline), nortriptyline, and propranolol. The Depakote, amitriptyline and nortriptyline were too sedating. The propranolol worked well, but I had too increase the dosage over time to the point where my blood pressure became too low. Right now a combination of Topamax at 50 mg and propranolol extended release at 60 mg works best for me. There are few adverse effects. The Topamax does cause some frustrating cognitive difficulties but I think I can live with them, considering the relief it gives me from the migraines.",
                    "I have epilepsy and chronic migraines due to a head injury. I have had this condition for 3 years now. It wasn't until Topamax was added to my regimen that I was seizure free. I do still have occasional migraines but I personally feel Topamax gave me my life back. 6 months ago I got my drivers licence back after 3 years. I attribute that to Topamax.",
                    "I believe a lot of the negative side effects can be attributed to lack of food and water. Once I started to eat and drink (even though I didn't feel like it) the foggy brain, dry eyes and other side effects went away (I am still loosing weight though :) ) and still no migraines. I also split my dosage 50 mg morning and night and this has also help minimized side effects.",
                    "Confusion, forget, tingling, lights in the corner of eye shining, drops of water dripping on head at times, but the weight loss was good, but its not worth it for me. ",
                    "Reluctantly started due to reviews to prevent migraines and clear up severe blurry vision...50mg...caused facial tightness, made headaches worse, tiredness, slowness, about to think ok, bouts of tingling, vision somewhat cleared, will be reducing dose to 25mg...we will see how this works out",
                    "I was prescribed this medication as propranolol, amitryptiline and nortryptiline failed to work. Topirimate was a god send for the headaches, and my migraines were near enough gone by the second dose. But the side effects were unbearable, I went to see my gp who told me to stop immediately and referred my to my nearest a&e.The tingly fingers and toes literally started after the first dose and only got worse to the point where my both arms were tingling from my finger tips to my elbows and my lips and face were tingling. I lost my thoughts, and felt like I had been knocked over by a truck. This drug is by far the worst experience I've had, if you want to lose confrol of your motor skills then by all means this drug will allow you to do that.",
                    "I fell four feet backwards off of a straight truck and whacked the back if my head off of a concrete parking lot and gave my self a concussion. Long story short, I have had a rough go at the post concussion symptoms and the migraine/cluster like headaches have played a MAJOR role. Theres days where I just lay around in the dark and do nothing. The pounding just takes over and that's all that matters. You are not even you anymore. I was prescribed Topamax on Nov.18th and started one week on 25mg. Nothing changed. Then two weeks on 50mg, again nothing changed. This is my third week on 100mg and I am FINALLY migraine free. The side effects do wear off after time. You just have to give this medicine time. Worth it.",
                    "I have been on Topamax for a little less than a month and already lost 16 pounds! My doctor gave it to me for the weight loss effects and I have had no adverse side effects that I know of so far. It rates a 10 in my book!",
                    "Topamax is the only medicine that works for me, I am willing to live with the side effects to keep from going up and down. The worst side effect for me has been trouble comprehending, and mild memory loss. When I lowered the dose from 400 to 100 I don't have comprehending or memory problems now. The great part about Topamax is weight loss, and not gaining weight.",
                    "It has been 1 year and I'm still suffering from the side effects of this awful medicine. I was put on this because of severe migraines that was shutting down the left side of my body top to bottom. I was only taking 1/2 a pill for 2 weeks which in turn gave me kidney stones. The stones in turn tore my ureter so now I have had 1 blockage from scar tissue and the scar tissue is growing back again. My Ureter has narrowed and now going through all the blood work to see how much my kidney is damaged and different procedures for my tube. I take no meds for migraines now I have been seeing an acupuncturist. As far as migraines I have none as long as I have acupuncture.",
                    "I used it for migraines. My side effects were: depression, dehydration, impaired thinking, confusion, drowsiness, memory problems, nervousness, trouble in concentrating, weakness, loss of appetite, vertigo, and SEVERE ANXIETY. After stopping this medication, I still suffer from severe anxiety and vertigo.",
                    "Topamax has significantly reduced my migraines from 1 a month to 1 every 18 months. I have also found that it helps you - to not over eat or drink alcohol. I am very happy being on Topamax for all these reasons. I initially did have tingly feet, a small price to pay, but rarely get that sympton now. I am on 50 mg a day.",
                    "I started taking this medication for migraines yesterday although I was prescribed it about a month ago. I was very hesitant to start it because of the side affects, but Monday I had the worst migraine with aura I have had in about 6 months. I am taking 25 mg twice a day. My provider wants me slowly elevating by 25 mg per week until I reach 150. I feel very cloudy today, but it might be because I am still recovering from my migraine. I will update in a month.",
                    "Amazing. I've been on Topamax/Topiramate probably 6 plus years. Granted it's not the most cost effective medication. For me it has been a true blessing. It has allowed me to get and maintain a full time job, get a drivers license. And I have a beautiful understanding girlfriend who knows what I deal with. Thankfully I have wonderful insurance that I only pay $20 a month for my Topiramate. Prior to not having insurance. I was in a real pickle. I found a program through Johnson & Johnson where they paid for my Topamax for two years. Saved me about $890 a month. But honestly, great medicine if your doctor gets you on the correct dosage. I'm on 300 mg a day. And I feel great.",
                    "I was put on Topamax 2 months ago after a serious car accident that left me in a flare up of my fibromyalgia. I have not reacted well to medications in the past and have had serious reactions which lead to serious consequences to the other meds I was on. Topamax has been the only medication that I have been able to tolerate well. It does take a while for it to start working though and I have had a few side effects but none that I'm not willing to put up with and 2 of them have gone away since I have started the Topamax.",
                    "I have suffered from migraines for about 14 years. Took Topamax for 8 weeks. At 100mg a day I was having moderate headaches every single day, but no migraines. BUT the side effects were just too much: terrible anxiety, irritability, diarrhea, complete brain fog, intense tingling in fingers, numbness in feet, extreme sensitivity to cold, very frequent urination, changes in taste leading to disinterest in food. I also would not recommend this medication if you are also on birth control pills to alleviate menstrual cramps. That was one of the worst side effects for me - daily cramps for over 3 weeks. If it weren't for that and the anxiety, I may have tried to wait it out.",
                    "I was just started on this medicine on February 13th, 2009. 25mg a day then after one week to increase to 50mg. Read some of the side effects here figured they must surely be on someone who is definitely on a higher dose. Anyway, I am a person who is highly addicted to drinking coca cola. I drink like a 2 liter bottle a day. Well, not any more. This medicine has cured me of that in 2 days. All carbonated beverages taste flat like Robitussin cough medicine. Good side is that'll help me lose weight and the better side is I have yet to have my headache.",
                    "I have suffered hormonal migraines since my early 20's (now early 40's). I had tried most everything for migraines and they were still coming and starting to cluster. I was put onto Topirmirate by my GP at the recommendation of the specialist I saw after plan A stopped working after 6 months. I had some extremity tingling for about 6 weeks when I first started (I was slowly built up to 100mg daily dose). In the interest of full disclosure I am also a type 1 diabetic so I am monitored pretty closely for sight and kidney function and I have had no issues around this. I have also started taking an anti depressant to combat a hormone imbalance issue so I don't get the mood swings either.",
                    "At first it seemed to make the migraines not so unbearable. The weight loss was nice too! It did make me drowsy at first. I also couldn't think straight and find the right words. I saw light trails esp at night. But I struggled through for a few years thinking I would get over the side effects. Ultimately I didn't think the benefits were worth the side effects. Everyone is different.",
                    "Topamax made my migraines worse - more often, more pain, more nausea, stronger auras, and longer lasting.",
                    "1st week - I took 25mg bedtime. now week 2, I'm on 50mg numbness and tingling on my toes and fingers are interesting. I hope its not permanent nerve damage.  weight loss? just 2 lbs so far. (10 days) I'm also walking outside regularly, everyday. Appetite...well.... yes and no... better than before, I still want to eat tho.  I'm taking it cuz my back pain is too bad to do vigorous work out. once I drop some weight I will definitely do some work out together to build up strength.",
                    "Started on Tuesday of this week so excited to try something different since I had been on bupap for years. I took it around 230pm right after my yearly visit. Around 630pm I couldn't see in my left eye it was so blurry I had to close one eye to read. I was also confused felt like a child on ritalin. I was slow pace doing things. I didn't eat, soda tasted flat. Wednesday I woke up with stomach pains blurry vision diarrhea and nausea..what a day to start. No motivation, ringing in my ears, light sensitivity I'm just plan through with this meditation..Thursday today I'm off but still have the side effects I don't know how long it will wear off. But I'm going back to bupap. Screw this that medication is for people one flew over the cuckoos nest!",
                    "I've been taking Topamax for two months and the weight loss is great, but that's because everything taste's gross. I'm tired a lot and have to work hard to focus. But I can finally sleep at night and feel rested. After reading some of the other comments I now understand why my fingertips sometimes feel numb or weird. I'm still not sure if the weight loss, better sleep are worth the disgusting taste in my mouth and the feeling sometimes that I just want to burst into tears (although that could be just because I work so hard and I'm still broke).",
                    "I was diagnosed with trauma induced neuropathy in my left heel following an injury that became infected, developed cellulitis and an ulcer. It took 2 months of intensive treatment for my foot to heal but about 3 weeks after I returned to work, I started experiencing sharp, electrical type pain in my heel. It was excruciating. My doctor prescribed Neurontin at first but I was not able to tolerate it. I was switched to Topamax and within a day, I had full relief and since then, I have been pain free. Yes, I am a juvenile diabetic but I had never had problems with my feet until this happened. The neuropathy is confined to my left heel only. Topamax is the best. The side effects are minimal but even if they weren't, it's worth it to be pain free.",
                    "I have tried a lot of different medications for fibromyalgia. Some work but cause significant weight gain. This one works significantly well. I actually stopped taking it for 3 months because my I didn't have insurance, and my body felt HORRIBLE. It became WORSE AND WORSE. I started taking it again and I felt SO much better. For those of you that truly experience the extreme fatigue and pain from fibromyalgia, I strongly recommend trying Topiramate.",
                    "While on Topamax, I lost my ability to think straight. I couldn't process things the same way. I couldn't even finish my sentences. I would start talking and would forget the words that came next. My friends and family would have to help me finish my sentences. After getting off the medicine, I could finally finish my thoughts again. However, I feel like I still cannot learn as easily as I did before I got on the medicine. I think it changed my brain processing capability. I have talked to a friend who had the exact same problem on this medicine. I would not recommend it unless you actually cannot live without it.",
                    "I was for about a year on gen Bupropion 300mg (Wellbutrin), gen Lexapro 20/10mg & Clonazepam (0.5 mg).These kept me functioning for some time and pulled out of a very debilitating depression that kept me at home for a month. During this year, I still suffered from a lot of ups and downs, my anxiety was getting worse and worse, so my mood swings. I kept pushing my psychiatrist, she was skeptical about my mood swings but I knew there was more going on. I am now on 50mg of generic Topamax (it's definitely controlled my mood swings and a bit my anxiety), it's only been 2 months but I definitely feel a change. Planning on stop taking Lexapro. My Side effects: Weird tasting on (black sodas) and dizziness. A new one is phantom smells.",
                    "I started taking this for a while to help with my migraines. The first two weeks it worked and then the doctor upped my dose to use it as my seizure medication as well. When he upped the dose apparently my body did not like that and my migraines came back, just going back down didn't do the trick. After about a year of being off of it and trying 6 other prescriptions, my new doctor said she didn't understand why they had come back when the dose was upped and maybe that it was totally out of my system we could try again. I went back on it and my migraines have decreased from one every day meaning literally 7 days a week to about 3 or 4 a week, but no soda like others stated and this time I had to quit smoking cigarettes because they tasted stale.",
                    "My five year old was prescribed this medicine after he started having breakout seizures on his other medicines. After about two weeks the seizures had not decreased and he started complaining of severe eye pain. A visit to the eye doctor confirmed very high pressure in his eyes. It did not work well for him.",
                    "I started having menopause migraines in June 2014. My doctor started me on 25 mg daily. At first, this medicine helped me but my migraines started to get more frequent. Over the course of 2 years, I was bumped up to 400 mg daily, the max dosage. I always felt that my head was foggy, memory was shot, problems speaking, losing sleep, no appetite and more & more intense migraines. This medicine quit working too. I finally stopped this medicine in March 2017. I immediately noticed a difference in my head. To say this medicine is evil is putting it mildly. Your migraines can get worse while taking Topirimate and unless you pay attention to your body, you won't realize it is the medicine making them worse. Beware when taking this medicine",
                    "If you cannot tolerate Topamax/Trokendi (topamirate), please consider Zonegran (zonisamide). It is in the same class of drug as topamax, and does many of the same things. Its labeled use is an anti-convulsant, but the psychiatric and pain management clinic I go to uses it off-label for a number of uses, such as: weight loss, mood stabilization, migraine prevention, mild pain reduction properties. I took Zonegran successfully at 200 mg for 5 years and DID NOT experience tingling, numbness, dry mouth or flat-tasting carbonated beverages. Memory/recall did degrade unacceptably for me above 200 mg, but therapeutic dose is considered 300 mg.",
                    "I have been taking this medication for about 5 weeks now. Regarding the migraines, I have only had one and this is because I was over tired (not a trigger but felt terrible and it was more a bad headache). I suffer from cluster headaches/migraines and have done since about the age of 12 for about 25 years (now 38). Pretty healthy otherwise, normal weight, would like to lose 7lbs (like most) but had Xmas weight to shift. I was put on 25mg a day - at night. Wow, did I experience the crazy side effects! But, these were to be expected. Appetite reduced, about 7lb lost, until Easter...5 day binge! But, hope to get back on track. Will report back soon",
                    "The main issue I had with this is the side effects. It caused my hands and feet to tingle and feel numb for hours on end. It made me drowsy and extremely moody due to it.

I've found A daily multivitamin helps with that, and believe it or not, prenatal vitamins take it completely away. I hope this helps!",

I did take it for Migraines and boy did it do its job, I was having them every day and now I get them maybe once a month. I started at 25mg went up to 50 twice a day and in the beginning of September went to 100mg where I will stay at and stabilize. Weight loss! Well where do I begin! It has been amazing! I weighed in on May 15 at 167.5lbs, I am only 5' tall, no inches there lol, and I weighed in September 2nd at 141.8lbs. It is amazing to me that I have lost 26lbs without diet or exercise. I have always done yoga and meditation, but not the hardcore kind, the gentle kind. I really haven't changed a thing except for taking Topamax.",

My doctor said I would lose weight and I definitely have but I'm afraid to get on the scale. I feel great as far energy goes. Memory loss, wrong words, etc is real. Just look at that sentence formation... This is the best writing I can do on topirimate. Anyway, when I get enough courage to get on the scale, I'll let y'all know...how much or how little success I've had, thus far!!",

I felt very tired and couldn't speak clearly and couldn't finish a sentence. I would NOT recommend this medicine to anyone. IT WAS A BAD EXPERIENCE.",
                    "I took Topamax a few years ago and regret it. It has changed my life for the worse. Even after stopping the meds several years ago, I still have bad brain fog, loss of vision, memory loss especially short term, lost the ability to comprehend things and lost ability to do simple functions such as basic math. Prior to taking this medicine I was at the top of my game. Now I feel helpless and the doctors were no help. My vision changed after it, mind you I had lasik eye surgery and could see perfectly fine prior to this. It's frustrating because I have to do things differently now and it's embarrassing because people look at you like something wrong since you can't do simple things a 2 year old can do!",

I was prescribed this medication for mainly migraines, but I also have restless leg syndrome which disrupts my sleep schedule. So far the only side effects I have noticed is that it makes my hands tingle (compare to hitting your funny bone). This medication makes me really sleepy so I only take it at night (helps with my sleep schedule). I also have noticed that I don't eat as much, which is fine with me! I haven't had any migraines since I started taking Topomax which is wonderful given the fact that I usually suffer from one atleast daily!",

Due to severe migraines this was the only medication to prevent what had been dabilitating headaches, nausea & vomiting, sensitivity to light, smell, sound, movement, and dizziness. After several years, my insurance refused to continue payment of the brand until I tried the generic tablets. After 3 days, the original symptoms returned. They finally approved continued payment of brand and now two years later they again have refused to cover (pay) for medication although it falls under the plan. For three months, my neurologist and I have issued appeals with no clear explanation of the denial. I would just like to again take meds to rid myself of this pain.",

I've been fighting these now for over 25 years and I've gone as far as having sinus sx and dentures to replace my top teeth to reduce the triggers of these monstrous headaches. I've come to believe there's no magic pill to take it all away but topamax reduces the severity greatly. The little tingling sensation will go away and saltiness are great when you have to take meds and don't have a full stomach. It helps with the nausea. Whether topamax is the drug for you- don't lose hope. Just keep trying to find the right combination of diet change, sleep, trigger reduction, and meds until you find what works for you.",

                    "A little over 2 years ago I was involved in a MVA, and sustained a traumatic brain injury. My neurologist put me on Trokendi XR for 2 reasons - to prevent seizures and migraines. Prior to the accident, I had always been a fairly healthy 5'7 160 pounds and worked out almost daily, and generally are very healthy. After the accident I became almost sedentary, depressed and suicidal. I had gained over 35 pounds but I honestly didn't much care. The Trikendi XR and the Adderall (prescribed to assist with the severe ADD caused by the brain injury) has helped me lose weight along with proper diet and minimum exercise. My seizures have gone from major, grandmal to pseudo-seizures to seldom, and my migraines have gone from daily to about 4 per week.",
                    "My VA Dr. prescribed Topiramate (Topamax) to me for my Migraines and not only has my appetite decreased, so has my Migraines and my weight. He also added Magnesium and the combination has been nothing short of amazing. Topamax has really been great and I've had no side effects at all, I take 1-50MG tab in the morning and 2 at night and I've been dropping weight, migraines gone and getting back to my old self.",
                    "I have taken it for 1 and 1/2 years for migraine. Also, after developing chronic lower back pain from degenerative discs it has really helped me cope with the pain.",
                    "Currently taking with phentermine. At night. I wake up without the need to binge. I feel like I get a good nights rest also. Went from 172lb to 137lb. 170 days. No adverse effects to report.",
                    "Absolutely the worst drug I have ever taken. Caused me to feel like I had taken acid or was on an LSD trip. Strong lingering effects even 4 days after taking one dose. Significant issues with cognitive ability, change in taste, balance, drowsiness, disorientation, nausea, tingling in hands and legs, numb lips. Inability to think and caused hallucinations. Hospitalized 4 days post medication to administer DHE to counteract this drug. DO NOT TAKE this medication. No warnings on the prescription. Asked pharmacist if this would cause drowsiness, slow my mental function or have any adverse effects and he informed me that 200 mg was low dose and I would have no adverse side effects. Based on my research since taking the drug, this is NOT accurate",
                    "I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder since I was 16 and now that I'm 25. I feel good to have found a medication that helps me. The only problem I have is the fatige. I could sleep alot on this medication. I guess thats still better than being depressed and irritable.",
                    "I've been taking this medication for a little under two weeks. To give you a background, I'll be 20 in a week, and have had migraines with auras since I was about 10. I've had numerous prescription meds, from injections to triptans to hydrocodone, etc, I think topomax makes #13? Anyways, over the last year my migraines have increased in frequency, I'm guessing because of the stress of college, but I get them every week, about twice a week, one right after another( triptans for me usually trigger another migraine) I've been dreading starting this medication, but finally decided to give it ago, as I'm on winter break and quite frankly this is all I have left to try. Literally half of my life has been consumed by this. Right now my right foot is tingling, and my chest hurts, I'm rather dizzy and have been forgetting things all week. I've felt super anxious and down all week, but I haven't had a migraine in 20 days. Sprite tastes flat but I don't really drink soda apart from that so I don't mind, so far this is bearable. I noticed when I went up to 50mg the side effects increased so I'm worried about when I inc to 75 and 100mg, but we shall see. :)",
                    "When I took 50mg of topamax the first time for migraine prevention it worked wonders and I lost 20lbs in a few short months! I stopped it when I got pregnant with my daughter. Once she stopped nursing I restarted it again to help with my migraines and hopefully drop the extra weight I couldn't lose from the pregnancy. It helps with my migraines the second time around but there is no decrease in appetite and no weight loss. Very disappointing.",
                    "I suffer bi-lateral migraines and have been on Topamax for several years off and on now. I have mixed reviews. I LOVE Topamax, because nothing else works for me. In fact I was given Maxalt and Propranolol together and wound up in the hospital almost dead. You can NOT take those two together. All medicines have side effects, so does Topamax. I liked the weight loss in the beginning, but be careful with it. I lost 80 lbs and couldn't stop. I forgot to eat. Topamax makes me just not hungry. I have it fixed now and watch out for it, but it was very scary. The memory loss has been a problem at times, but has been funny too. I have not experienced the HOT they spoke of...I FREEZE ALL THE TIME!",
                    "I have been on this medicine for about a week now. I was on it before for about 3-4 years. After the inital side effects which lasted probably about a month the only one that lasted was that I had a lot of energy, which always isn't so bad. Everyone reacts to medicines differently though. I didn't have such a bad experience with this one.",
                    "I have struggled with weight loss for years. Food cravings are one of my \"symptoms.\" Topamax really did help with this, however my energy and memory are not what they use to be. Originally I thought it was a trade off I could adjust to but the fuzzy memory for me is frustrating. I sometimes say words that I am thinking about and don't even realize it. Then argue that I didn't say it, only to find out I did. Silly, but worth revisitng my physician about. I struggle with the same 10-20 lbs but won't give up. I would recommend trying it to people who are serious about weight loss. It helps you push your plate away and not obsess about food. That was an experience I had never had before, but I need my memory.",
                    "I have been off and on Topamax for about 5 years now and I must say that it works better for bipolar mood stabilization than any other one out there. The one thing I love the most about this medicine is that it is helping me lose weight. They need to put in the time to verify that this drug is in fact a mood stabilizer because it certainly does help with bipolar disorder.",
                    "I was taking 400mg daily for chronic migraines, depression, and weight loss. It's very important to build up slowly otherwise the side effects can be extreme. I lost around maybe 50lbs while on it. When I got up to 300 - 400mg I started to have memory problems and sleep issues. After a while I felt like it had stopped working and dropped it, but that could have been from me forgetting to take it (memory issues remember). It takes a few weeks to a few months for the side  effects to fully wear off. I started at 235 or 245, and went down to 185. I'm now back up to 200. I haven't exercised in years, and I didn't change my diet (I probably don't eat as healthy as I should).",
                    "Topamax worked great to relieve my daily headaches and migraines. Taking it twice daily, it didn't take long to start enjoying life again without headaches, but as time went on, the side effects just kept getting more and more intense. I could deal with the tingling in my fingers, hands, and feet, but waking up completely disoriented, not being able to think straight or concentrate, not being able to form sentences or find the right words finally got to me after about a year/year and a half and I weened off of it. It's unfortunate because it felt amazing not to have headaches everyday. I am also small to begin with and I lost about 15 pounds on it, I usually had to force myself to eat due to having absolutely no appetite.",
                    "With side effects of many other meds being a problem I went on this as it worked well for my mom. Dr. explained that genetics play a part in medicine effectiveness as well as diseases. It had an immediate effect on my severe depression. It also helps with mild psychotic episodes during mania for me. (Voices, hearing noises that aren't there) There is a slight tapering of appetite for me that stabilizes after prolonged use. I also have to search for common words sometimes. Pins and needles in my hands and feet, especially when I'm driving or it's really cold outside. Extreme thirst and I rarely sweat, even when working out. ALL tolerable and SO much better compared to laying in bed all day long.",
                    "First week ok. Dizzy first day. Overwhelming sense of wellness for the first week, minus dizzy feeling. I thought this is great.  When I increased the dose as prescribed the second week I developed a headache the next day. Had pains in my abdomen, all throughout my back. Continued for 2 more weeks then my body shut down, had the worst migraine that lasted 2 days. I slept for 4 days. Then muscle weekness, nausea, and persistent headache. My bladder was painful and felt like I could not empty it. Three days off them, I can finally stand up straight, but I lost a week of work. Might have been ok if dose was not increased.",
                    "Works extremely well to prevent my migraines.",
                    "This is a fantastic medication. The day I was prescribed it and started taking it was nothing short of a miracle. I had never heard of anything like it before. I had been on and off trials of anti-depressants like Zoloft, Wellbutrin, Zypreza, etc for years and none of them did anything for me. This was an entirely different class of medication and the new psychopharmacologist I had told me so before he gave it to me. When it kicked in after several weeks I literally felt it one day while riding the bus. I was trying to have one of those negative, anxiety-ridden feelings and a flush just came over me that downgraded that sensation. The only drawback is that this medication completely stopped working for me after one and a half years.",
                    "I've been taking this 100g for about 4months now; completely made a difference to my life I no longer have worry of waking up or been at work with migraines. I've had maybe a couple bad headaches but a migraine maybe once since taking these tablets. Although I'm finding the side effects difficult; memory loss is seeming to be tricky especially as I'm 24 and I'm forgetting the most simplest things. I've had a few anxiety attacks. Can't stomach coco cola taste flat. Mood swings seem to be a change in behaviour, feeling frustrated , and impatient And I'm extremely paranoid since I've been taking them don't like been alone etc.",
                    "I've been on Topamax (topiramate) for 6 years, and loved it at first. My migraines decreased dramatically, I had weight loss from the appetite suppression, and I overall felt better. But I had pretty bad tingling in my hands and all over my face for the whole time I've taken it. Also more recently, I've made the connection with my severe memory loss to the medication. I used to be able to retain information and facts like an elephant, but I can hardly recall simple words some days. I'm planning on going off the Topamax (with the direction of my neuro) because the memory loss issue is so disturbing to me.",
                    "Good",
                    "I was very excited when I started taking this medication. And then.... I had read the side effects and was like oh this is crazy. I will say I was on no other medication. I have never had hair loss like this. It was gobs of hair in my shower. The previous posters that refer to brain fog - yep that too.",
                    "I was prescribed Topamax many years ago... before they even offered a generic version and before they could legally prescribe it for obesity! So, my doctor prescribed it to me for migraines because I had a slight history of migraines but she said it would cause weight loss. Oh boy, did it! I was over 200lbs and in a size 18 pants, within 6 months I was in a size 8 pants! By the time a year rolled around, I was 103lbs and in a 00!!! No exercise! This is a wonder drug. I felt great! I had quit smoking, cut out all sugars and red meat, minimal alcohol. This medicine effects the addiction part of the brain as well as other areas. It's just amazing! I did warn my friends that I would forget sentences halfway thru; in 4 weeks no side effects.",
                    "I've been on Topamax before and it worked and went off I don't know why. I recently went back on it and it has made a world of difference. It's like night and day. I take it with Abilify and Xanax because I have really bad anxiety also. I am 24 and was so depressed I wasn't leaving my apartment but now I feel like a new person like I want to go out and do things again. I'm not held back. I like that this medicine doesn't make me gain weight too because I've had that problem in the past, I lost 10 pound since I went back on it 4 weeks ago. The only thing I will say that is not great is it slows down my thought process sometimes and it gives me tingles in my hands and face but not all the time. The benefits outweigh those side effects greatly.",
                    "Terrible side effects.",
                    "Absolutely horrible!! It wasn't until a yr of several tests, scans and a colonoscopy that made me go to another Dr and beg him to find out what was wrong with me. I never dreamed it was this medicine. I had lost 30 lbs but I had diarreha, funny taste in mouth, weak, hair loss, foggy, memory was bad, felt like my muscle mass was going down to nothing...my daughter said I was looking frail all the time. It started getting hard to get out of bed...this went on for a yr and a half.I was getting older and taking care of my elderly folks so I didn't read into it much. I'm so glad I switched drs...he noticed immediately what it was and told me to wean myself off of it.",
                    "Placed on Topamax for severe migraine and trigeminal neuralgia. 3 days later became disorientated with rash and soreness all over body then skin became scaley. Numbness in both hands and feet. Ceased Topamax.",
                    "This is the worst drug I've ever taken. It gave me horrible tremors, anxiety, & a guilt complex.",
                    "I took this medication for nearly two months before seeking a second opinion about my hormonal migraines. I was only having 1-2 migraines a month; however they would last 4-5 days at a time. When the pain medications didn't help, my doctor started me on Topamax. I do a great deal of technical writing and crisis management in my job, and my migraines really got in the way. I was able to deal with the weight loss and taste changes, but the difficulty in concentrating became a serious issue. When I started losing hair, that was the last straw. If my migraines became worse I may return to Topamax though.",
                    "Note that everyone's experience with medication is different. I feel like it's important for others to know the risks as well as the benefits of a medication and then decide for themselves if it's worth a try. That being said, this is my experience. I started this medication for migraines caused by different medication that I'm taking for depression. So far, my anxiety is horrible and I'm extremely paranoid about everything, also I'm very depressed with suicidal thoughts. I haven't had weight loss but rather, weight gain! I become delusional and lose touch with reality, I'm very agitated and my body feels like it's made of bruises. Anyway, I've become a completely different person but not in a good way. It's not worth all the suffering!",
                    "if you have anxiety or depression DO NOT i repeat Do NOT take this medication i was only on it a couple weeks but for two weeks it made me so anxious and so depressed i wanted to kill myself. this drug made me suicidal luckily there was no self harm but i would strongly advise against it!",
                    "I have been taking 25MG of Topamax before bed daily for the prevention of my migraines with aura. Been taking it for almost 2 months. I haven't had an aura or a migraine since I started taking it. I love this medicine! Only side effect I have noticed so far is tingling in my feet sometimes, but so far not bad. The one thing that is bothersome about this medicine is that birth control bills are less effective and its recommended to use a different form of birth control. IUD is what I think I'm going to try. ",
                    "I was on Topamax for 6 years and it worked very well until this past winter when I realized the migraines were starting to increase in frequency again, so my doctor has switched me to Bystolic and I'm tapering off the Topamax. But for a long time Topamax was wonderful. The first 3 months were hell and my boyfriend almost left me but I started taking a small amount of antidepressants and that seemed to calm me down. Or maybe it was a coincidence. Anyway all of the side effects did go away except for the difficulty remembering words. I am looking forward to not having to fumble for words any more, but it was a small price to pay for no migraines.",
                    "My neurologist added Topamax to my tricyclic and beta-blocker in hopes that it would control my vestibular migraines (total balance loss). It failed completely, but its side effects included immediate impotence, decreased libido, and substantial difficulty finding words. My vocabulary for 3 syllable words dropped 50%. I sounded drunk.",
                    "I've been on Topamax for quite a few months now, and I love it for the most part! I have only had the occasional minor headache, but the side effects are good/bad. The good ones in my book are the weight loss and carbonated beverages and other sweet things tasting horrible. The bad side effects are tingling, usually in my fingers and confusion/'blonde moments\" but those are usually more pronounced the more tired I am. I can live with the bad side effects so much easier than I can a migraine everyday!",
                    "This medication has been a life saver for me. After the initial side effects of tingling hands and feet, funny tasting carbonated drinks, loss of words, which lasted only a couple of weeks and a massive weight loss of 30kg (60lb approximately) everything settled down nicely. I have been taking Topamax for over two years now with no problems whatsoever and in those two years have only had one migraine that was not nearly as bad as what I used to experience. For me, this is the best medicine I've ever been prescribed.",
                    "I got put on Topamax about 3 years ago, I felt it wasn't helping with my migraines so I took myself off. Then I had a seizure because I didn't have it. So I started back on it and had no luck with migraines. I quit taking it again and more seizures. Ever since I've been on it I have had seizures and they are not in my family at all.",
                    "I was given this medication several years ago in an attempt to reduce migraines. I began using the lowest prescribed dose, as instructed by my physician. On the 3rd night, 3-4 hours after taking my 3rd dose, I woke out of a sound sleep with tachycardia (fast heart rate). I didn't know what was up. To \"calm down\" I took a shower. By afternoon of that day, I knew that it was the medication. I had pressure in my head, tachycardia, nausea. This is about the worst I have ever felt. Needless to say, I had to discontinue Topamax immediately. I long for the day when medications can be chosen based on genetic coding information. For many people, Topamax is a God-send; but not for me.",
                    "Started this as a mood stabilizer for my bipolar. I've been on it almost 30 days now, it has stabilized my moods for sure! Usually before my period I'm a monster. A crazy hormonal mess. I feel normal, not \"flat\". It's a double win for my constant headaches and hormonal migraines that are now gone too. Only side effects, minor pins and needle tingles in my toes and fingers which last seconds off and on and aren't even bothersome too me. It seems to happen with each increase I do.",
                    "I take this as a mood stabalizer it has really helped level out my moods",
                    "I believe alot of the negative side effects are caused from not eating or drinking. Once I started to eat and drink water foggy brain and unpleasant side effects went away (I am still loosing weight though :) ) and still no migraines. I also split my dosage 50 mg morning 50 mg at night, this has helped minimize side effects.",
                    "I've been taking Topiramate, 50mg twice a day, for several years. At first, it worked great and I was recommending it to all my migraine sufferer friends, but gradually, week by week, I seem to have built up a resistance to it and recently, the migraines are back with a vengeance. I have a condition that causes the migraines and I get them most days now. Also, I can only take paracetamol as I take blood thinning medication and it doesn't work for me at all as a painkiller. The side effects I personally get with Topiramate are negligible compared to the pain of migraine, I have 'brain fog' now and then, temporarily forget words, peoples names, etc. But it's back to the Dr. again now to ask for an alternative preventative - if there is one",
                    "Female. 19. I had sinus surgery then started getting headaches after surgery because of nerve damage. I was taking 25mg once every night for a week and every next week would up the dose. My experience was awful! I had the usual side affects people had- tingling in lips/hands, and weight loss. Main one for me was, I was so extremely fatigued and weak. I'm a young healthy girl who eats healthy, is a healthy weight, and before my surgery worked out 4 X a week. I would have physically to force myself out of bed. And as far as the headaches it reduced the intensity of the migraines, but did nothing for the frequency. ",
                    "I suffered a stroke in '04 and my neurologist prescribed Neurontin to deal with the resulting numbness and tingling on the right side. A year later, and after emergency gall bladder surgery, he put me on a low dose of Topamax instead. It worked well, but I've had to eventually increase the dosage. The side effects were minimal; I needed to lose the 35 lbs I lost (and my wardrobe needed updating :0), and the additional tingling is nothing compared to what I feel when I don't take it. Expensive!",
                    "I've been taking Topamax for about 2 years now, 100 mg a day. I have severe chronic migraines due to my spinal cord. So my doctor put me on this medication. The only side effect I've had was the tingling but I get that anyways even before this medication so who knows if it was a side effect. But it works ok for me when I take it regularly but I also have focal seizures so this medication is for both of my problems. But I always take it with my hydrocodone so my migraines are fine.",
                    "Topamax is very good at helping me with keeping my seizures away. My main problem though, is sometimes anywhere between 3:00 and 5:00 in the afternoon I have a \"nap crash\". Meaning my eyes want to close because I feel drowsy no matter how much I try to fight it and within a few minutes after my eyes close I'm completely unconscious.",
                    "Well I was on Topamax for approximately 6mos. My doctor hoped that he would be able to get me to the medicinal dosage of about 25mg twice daily. However I could not stand the way the medicine made me fall asleep. If I took it at 8pm, I passed out by 8:15. I can say that I was getting the BEST sleep of my life. I was afraid to take it in the morning before/during or after work, so I only took it once I got home. I only got to the 5mg dosage before I stopped taking it.",
                    "I love this medication. I have chronic migraines. It was nothing for me to have 5 in 3 days. I started this medicine and I have only have two migraines and it was nothing compared to what they used to be like. I only had one side effect my soda tasted funny. I don't drink soda any more... Easy fix. I've been on it for 4 months now. I would highly recommend it.",
                    "I really hated taking this medicine . At only 25 mg I was feeling like a zombie all day , very dizzy , confused , had a hard time putting sentences together . Very embarrassing I couldn't drive cause I was almost always crashing due to the. Lack of concentration. Also I was always angry . I didn't even want my kids to come near me :( that's when I decided to stop taking it. It really did help me loose weight but I rather loose weight on my own than to have to go through that nightmare again.",
                    "I have suffered from migraines for the past three years. I would wake up with a headache almost every single day and have a headache at least 27 days out of every month. I started taking just about a week ago and have only had one headache. I could not be any happier. I have had one strange side effect (a yeast infection), but that's a small price to pay for being headache free. I could not be happier.",
                    "I went on topiramate January 2012 for migraines with positive results. By the end of of 2012 I had lost 85lbs. I had also lost the ability to form sentences because I couldn't find words and was constantly in a fog. That is not good if you're a nurse. Also my short term memory was non existent also not good for an acute care medical nurse. By the time the side effects became debilitating, I had to take a short leave of absence to sort out my situation. In the end, the medication was discontinued and I gained 23lbs of the weight back. I'm not upset because now I have my short term memory back, plus I've returned to work migraine free. I'm still better off because I'm still thinner than before I started with topiramate.",

Thank you.",
                    "I weighed 230 pounds and felt like a cow.. I started off on 25 mg 1x a day and noticed no change. So asked doc to change me to 100 mg twice a day. I just take the 200mg at once. That's when I finally noticed a change. I've lost 45 pounds in 6 months! I'm continuing to lose and my goal weight is 160 since I'm tall so only 25 more pounds to go. I noticed at first pop tasted different but now it tastes fine. I used to love beer but now I don't want it..which is fine since it's so fattening lol. I only eat once or twice a day and the carb cravings are gone. I don't exercise much at all. I have no side effects at all. I'm so glad I found this medication it really has been a miracle. :)",

Took only 30 for days worked great but my blood pressure went from 128/78 before starting to 178/116 the day I stopped it . My Doctor told me it probably wasn't the Trokendi XR because there is no listing of raising blood pressure in the list of side effects, but 1 week after stopping it my BP is back to normal . USERS BEWARE !!!",

Next day was completely out of sorts, depth perception was off, felt outside myself, brain fog, headache, shaky, numbness in hands, burning in heals, no appetite, nothing tasted right, pop had no sweetness, next day same symptoms to a lessor extent with a constant tremor, overheating with movement, confusion, mood swings and horrible mental fog, then a headache hitting about 9 out of 10, worse than my average. I decided to discontinue that evening. The next day felt hungover, had light sensitivity, diarrhea and an upset stomach. Next day, the cloud slowly has lifted, my taste buds have not returned yet and pretty fatigued.",
                    "As I type this it is hard to relay it understandably because of the Topamax. I researched Topamax and heard it suppressed eating and stabilized mood which I figured would helped my bulimia, which I have been getting help for and am in recovery for. The Topamax definitely suppresses the desire to eat and have cravings which is great. You do lose weight. However, it created other problems. I didn't realize it but I was increasingly having a harder time talking to people. I can't do homework, write papers, and my relationship with my boyfriend- we ended breaking up. My hair falls out. I had bad anxiety, I thought I was going insane. I then researched side effects of Topamax and now realized this is what I am experiencing. I'm getting off.",
                    "I have Tourette's Syndrome and ADHD. Tried different kinds of medicines for my TS. Depending on my day, I could have some to a lot of tics. Topamax did wonders for my tics, but it can have side effects that are similar to ADHD symptoms - different remembering some words/names when asked, unable to concentrate, etc. I also experienced that my thought-pattern were kind of limited to a certain degree, as I would sometimes have difficulties thinking further ahead. This medicine however, was much better than other kinds I've tried. ",
                    "I was prescribed this medicine to treat my petite mal seizures. I was never warned of any potential side-effects, and never thought to ask, seeing as I had never taken a medicine before. After I began taking this, my seizures graduated to full out grand mal seizures. I couldn't speak, I couldn't understand others' speech, and I couldn't sleep more than a few hours most nights. Everything came to a heads about four months after I began taking the medicine, when I couldn't remember how to say \"Bye\" to my dad. I would have rather had seizures EVERY day than stay on Topamax! I got off of the medicine, and am now on Lamictal, under which I haven't had any seizures or side-effects in the two years I've been taking it.",
                    "After 2 years of terrible 3 days disabling migraines I did have a break from the migraines with this medicine. It took 2 months to decrease pain from 8 to 2. I do have to follow a very strict diet , I use the pre-diabetic diet even though I'm not have diabetes.",
                    "I was prescribed Topamax as a preventative migraine med. It was effective in significantly reducing migraine. However it gave me insanely severe sinus/hayfever symptoms. I couldn't leave the house because my nose was running like a tap. I was sneezing all the time and totally stuffed up. I got all the other usual digestive upset side effects, but I could live with those as they seemed to reduce as time went on whereas the sinus problems intensified.",
                    "I was suffering from migraine, 10 times a month on average during late 2014. I have been always suffering from Migraine for years, but it was more frequently than before. I consulted a doctor in Dubai, educated in Sweden and Canada, a very successful doctor. He prescribed Topamax, for 6 months. In 2 months, I ended up going into depression, first time in my life! I had to quit the medicine as I was travelling to UK, and forgot taking the medicine with me and they don't sell this without prescription. After quitting, depression gone. I thought this is coincidence. Until I saw the doctor again, again prescribed Topamax. Again, after 2 months - depression. Mood swings, almost suicidal thoughts - I quit, depression gone. NOT RECOMMENDED!!",
                    "This medication has been probably the best one I've been on for my seizures.. As long as I take it as prescribed it's worked wonders for me...",
                    "This drug isn't for everyone. The side effects are completely crazy. I have been on it for almost 12 months now. It has provided relief from migraines by almost 95% of the time. This has been a big deal for me. Side effects I've experienced: hands and feet tingle periodically (some days are worse than others), hair loss started 3 months after taking it but began to cease 6 months later, definite brain fog (some days I feel like I'm losing my mind), grogginess (I can only take my dose at night otherwise I'm a zombie during the day), changes in vision, loss of appetite, fatigue, irritability. At first I convinced myself the side effects were worth tolerating compared to having a migraine. But as time goes on, I'm beginning to think im wrong",
                    "This pretty much saved my life. I've been on EVERYTHING (or so it seems) for major depressive disorder and when I was about 32 something wasn't adding up and I was diagnosed BP2. I tried Lamictal and I couldn't handle the headaches. The other BP medications all seem to cause weight gain so I'd stop taking them. I got a new doctor who said if I tried lithium she would give me a little Topiramate to help offset the hunger the lithium caused. Well, the topiramate seemed to help the BP2. So I've slowly worked up to 150/day topiramate along with wellbutrin and Lexapro. It's a GODSEND. Side effects: when titrating up at any point, tingly fingers or feet for a week but then goes away. Take at night because can make you sleepy. Hope FDA approves!",
                    "I was placed on this for Miragine prevention. The weight loss was cool, but the resulting High Blood Pressure not cool. So much so that I was not able to be put on birth control medication. I am no longer on this medication and still am suffering from HBP. I do not smoke or drink and my blood pressure was perfect before starting this medication.",
                    "I started this medication at the suggestion of my neurologist in June 2016. I was overweight and having frequent migraines. I started on 25mg and increased by 25 mg every week until I was at 100 mg. I started to notice slow weight loss at first, and my migraines were instantly better. The weight loss definitely increased once I got to 100mg. After the one month mark the doctor increased me to 125mg and the wight loss slowly continued. As of now I am down 27lbs and still going! As some have said the side effects of \"word soup\" and tingling in my hands and feet have all happened, but they have all worn off once I have become used to the increased dosage (which is a good and bad thing). I'll be talking with the dr soon! Good luck everyone!",
                    "I still get slight headaches once in a while, and use Excedrin Migraine with the Topamax, but its nothing compared to what I had. The side effects go away and the ones that don't, you get used to. I still have memory problems, so I had to lower the dose.",
                    "I was given Topiramate for a list of conditions including Fibromyalgia, Migraines, Weight Loss, and tremors. I was prescribed only 25 mg 1 X a day. As for side effects, I have found that many foods do not taste the same including yogurt and cottage cheese. They tasted old or out dated. I don't usually drink carbonated beverages, but those I have, tasted fine. I had a decrease in appetite beginning the first month, but only realized it upon looking back after a weigh in at my doctors office where I had lost 20 lbs. I had no migraine episodes during that first month, my Fibromyalgia had improved only slightly and my tremors improved also slightly. After 6 months, I had lost a total of 30 lbs with out trying as my appetite had decreased.",
                    "I can't believe I happened to read an article in my Dr office on topirimate today about weight loss. 3 years ago I took it for migraines and it worked . I also lost 100 lbs with very little exercise . I thought it was due to my not eating carbs.. Lolol. I stopped the topirimate and immediately put on 30 lbs. Well you can bet I pulled those pills back out of my meds box qjd am now going to take them !!! And maybe my migraines will let up a little. I stopped the pills because I was cutting down on all the meds and thought I could go without .. No more of that !!",
                    "I have MS and often shake. I have a full time job and often had to listen to people ask me \"had a little to much coffee?\" or \"are you cold?\". Since I started taking two doses of Topamax - one in the morning and one in the evening my shaking has greatly diminished.",
                    "After suffering with migraines for over 10 years Topamax has been a life saver. I had tried several other medicines but they would only work for a while and then stop working for me all together. I have been on Topamax for over a year now and went from 4 or 5 migraines a month to one every couple of months. I am currently taking 200mg/day (100mg in the morning and evening). Side effects are minimal compared to the agony of having migraines all the time.",
                    "I am triating up to a dose of 300mg for PTSD. I've had no fuzziness or other issues, I'm sharp as ever and I've lost about 15 lbs so far, I was a muscular 140 lbs at 5'1\", about a size 8 and now I'm about 126, still losing and down to a 6. I'm about to make the step up to 200mg. I went up in weekly steps of 25mg. My doctor told me this was best and that there is a serious skin condition and an eye disease that can result from jumping up to a high dose too quickly, so I suggest asking your doctors about a slow triation to achieve maximum benefit and avoid fogginess.",
                    "After menopause, migraines soared to three per week. Top ax 50 mgs daily has been a miracle drug. Not one headache in 18 months. One side effect is dry eyes and dry mouth. Easy to live with that in lieu of disabling migraines that eroded my life.",
                    "I've been taking this medicine for 3 months. Before I got headaches nearly 3 to 4 times a day, not to mention I'm a full time mom. But being on this medicine I've noticed no pain. No hair loss but do have tingling in mouth. ",
                    "I started getting migraines when I was about 12 years old. I had terrible migraines on and off for about 3 years. I finally went to the doctor and he put me on Topamax. I have been taking it for about a year now and the only time I get migraines is when I don't refill my prescription right away. Even though I get the occasional migraine, it is nothing compared to what it was before I started taking the medicine. Also, I have not noticed any side effects. Topamax is a miracle!",
                    "First- there is absolutely no difference between brand and generic. There can't be legally. It is the same active ingredient and the same strength. It's just the name and cost and inactive ingredinets.  This being said... I don't understand where negative remarks come from. This medicine is amazing. I took it a while ago then asked to be changed to something else. I gained 20lbs and the other med didn't so anything. So I asked to be changed back. My leg muscles hurt and I have a few word issues but it's an amazing medicine.",
                    "Been on the medicine since 2010 and lost 20 pounds. It doesn't work for everyone. I watched what I ate did a lot of walking and it didn't help. I take 100mg 2x a day. Not happy!",
                    "I like others have found a great medicine in Topamax. I am 45 and have had headaches/migraines since I was a kid. Been on it about 4 months and gone are the daily headaches, shooting head pains, and many days of debilitating migraines. I am just starting to lose weight. I have the head fog and the loss for words. My tongue tingling has gone and mostly I just have the \"falling asleep\" of my fingers and toes, which is annoying, but manageable. I am on 100mg a day. I am hoping that this will take me through menopause.",

                    "I started having migraines a week after starting the birth control pill as a teen. Over the years (I'm now 55) I have tried many drugs for the treatment of or prevention of migraines. I get the classic vascular migraine with an aura each time I get a migraine. I finally was prescribed Topamax as a preventative, the final dose that worked was 75mg in am and 75mg in pm. My migraines went from daily to MAYBE once a month. I took this for 3 years at least. I was just at the point of quitting it when I lost my job so I had no choice. The reason I was quitting it was that I lost SO MUCH WEIGHT that I looked anorexic! And soon realized that my memory was HORRIBLE!",
                    "Great for migraine prevention, but NOT WORTH THE SIDE EFFECTS. Constant anxiety, panic attacks, insomnia, nerve zaps, tingling, numbness, visual disturbances, memory loss, brain fog, you name it. Ruined my life for a good month and I was only on 50 mg. Currently tapering off and already feeling better!",
                    "After taking 300mgs (100mg AM/200mg PM) for three years, it's no longer working. When I first went on it, it worked great for both mood stabilization and weight control. I lost all the weight that I gained after being on Zyprexa and Depakote, and my moods were controlled well for about two and a half years. I had minimal negative side effects that seemed to fade after a few months' use. For the last six months I've been struggling with dosage adjustments and adding new drugs to my cocktail while trying to keep Topamax. Finally I'm giving up and going off Topamax because it's not doing anything anymore. ",
                    "Started Tomamax at 25 mg Sept 2nd. Had constant dizziness right away all day and night. Stuck to it as it was slightly decreasing my migraines. Had to cancel a follow up apt with Neurologist due to an emergency and would take about a month to get back in so I was now on it for 6 weeks at the 25 mgs. A week before my apt while at work I started stuttering really bad and just couldn't put my sentences together and was very out of it. My supervisor took me to the ER thinking I was having a stroke. They did both a CT scan and a brain MRI but they were clean. I continued for another week same symptoms. Stopped the Topamax and it has all gone away.",
                    "I have had good success with weight loss with 50mg Topiramate & a therapist for stress eating. I went from 265lb to 195lb with watching diet in 12 months, walking 2-3 miles/day. Topiramate makes you less hungry, the rest is up to you. (I did get some brain fog.) I took magnesium and biotin, as the reduced appetite can cause nutritional deficiencies in some that can give you hair loss if you aren't careful and the magnesium helps you \"go\"! If you're taking that Topiramate at night, a small dose of melatonin every few days (if you take melatonin consistently every night your own pineal gland will stop producing it and you'll have more sleep probs!)",

                    "Had taken this medication for a short while, it did alleviate my migraines, unfortunately it caused such severe insomnia I was lucky to get 4 hours of sleep a night. I lost 10 lbs within 14 days which was nice but dropping the weight that fast caused major stomach issues. I never had the tingling others have had though. If it wasn't for the weight loss and insomnia it could have been a miracle migraine medicine!",
                    "I was put on topiramate for my chronic migraines. I have been taking it for 3.5 years and this was the third preventative medicine I tried. It works! I used to get at least 15 migraines in a month and now I don't even get 15 migraines a year. Some side effects that I have noticed are a decreased appetite and it makes me forget words. When I started it I weighed 165 (which I gained 35 pounds from amitriptyline) and now I am down to 115. A lot of that weight was lost from healthy eating and exercising, but it curbs my appetite a lot and I don't feel the need to impulsively eat in between meals or snack. I also have noticed that it makes my brain foggy and it makes me forget words mid-sentence. Other than that, it saved my life!!",
                    "I cannot recommend this medication. Yes it did prevent migraines but the side-effects far outweighed the benefit. My doctor put me on a gradual increase in dosage and I was unable to get past the first week. After a couple of days I lost control of my own thoughts and focused on every negative I my mind could come up with. My work was impacted. I work in an accounting office and lost my ability to count and remember the alphabet. Not to mention I would stop talking in mid-sentence quite often. I knew what I needed to say but my mouth just wouldn't do it. My short term memory was non-existent and I decided to stop taking this medication after I forgot where I was driving to on my way to work; the same place I've been to for the last 9 years.",

I even lost a job because of my migraines. I had to plan my life around them. Now at 35, I've been on Topamax for 6 years and it's changed my world. It's given me a life back. I'll still get an occasional headache that requires me to break out the Imitrex, but nothing serious. I haven't had too many problems with side effects other then having a little less quick recall/memory, but not enough to really matter. Potassium seems to help with the side effects. My main side effect is getting rash/hives from overheating. ",

I did experience the brain fog at first, but I found that after about a month or two, I was mostly back to normal. I have experienced the weight loss and loss of appetite, and I'm also lactose intolerant, so I'm trying to work on eating a healthy amount. I have found that drinking a lot of water really helps with the tingly feeling in my feet and hands!",

With the brand name, I felt like it worked better, but it gave me horrible problems with confusion. I would drive home from work and sometimes not even remember the drive home. I felt completely drugged. When the generic came out, I was switched to it. It didn't make me loopy like the brand name did, but I didn't think it worked as well either. I get more migraines on it by a lot than I got on brand name Topamax and I think I'm on the highest dose. I take one 200 mg pill in the morning and one 200 mg pill at night.",
                    "I was on topamax for a month and lost 6lbs. I could handle the tingling in my hands and feet but I stopped taking it because my period never stopped! It started the day after my first dose and ended three days after I stopped taking topamax. I do have the birth control Implanon implanted in my arm. So maybe those drugs combined doesn't work well. I still had migraines but they weren't intense.",

The first time was before I was diagnosed and I got severely depressed and had a suicide attempt. Within a week of getting taken off of it I was better. The second time I was put on it was after I was diagnosed and put on mood stabilizers and my doctor wanted to try it again because he thought my depression may have been from my bpd not the meds and it really did help my migraines. Same exact thing happened. Within a few weeks of being on it my mild bipolar disorder was uncontrollable. I wish I could be on it because it really helped my head and counteracted weight gain from my other meds but my body just cannot handle it.",

My mind is a bit cloudy but it too is also a bit better by the end of the week. On the positive I have had no tingling in my fingers and toes like many reviews I have read. Carbonated drinks taste terrible. I was a Diet Pepsi ahololic , and should stop drinking it anyway. And without out any other dietary changes I went from 210 to 206 this week! So, now I am going to eat healthier this week and see what happens. Rating a 9 only because of the fatigue. Good luck in your journey!",

I had never had one before using this awful drug,which also made me feel constantly tired & forgetful. The worst part is that once you kidney stones your body is more susceptible to getting them again & you most certainly will. For anyone unfamiliar with the pain from kidney stoned I can assure you it is sheer agony. And even worse is the hellacious migraine that lasts for days that comes along with it. It's so bad that even medicines like imitrex won't work on it. There are blogs & websites which tell of the awful experiences people have had with this drug. Beware.",

I did experience side effects such as tingling in heels, constantly tired, diarrhea, weight loss and change in taste (specifically with carbonated beverages). I was recently hospitalized for a separate issue and the doctor's would not let me take topiramate. I ended up discontinuing it all together to see how I would adapt. I noticed that the diarrhea I was experiencing was not IBS like I had thought, but because of topiramate. It was terrible and I had  previously been taking an anti-diarrheal about 5 days a week. I feel like I've got my life back since discontinuing.",

I'll take forgetting words rather than having 20 or more migraines a month. The first month of taking the med is the absolute worst, but your doctor should strongly warn you and advise you that this will happen and encourage you to work through it. I kept remembering her words and am glad I did. started slowly, with 25 mg in the morning, working up to 25 mg twice a day, then 50 mg at night with 25 in the morning, then up to 50 mg twice a day by the end of the month. Never ever start bing bang boom all at once, or you won't want to continue. Maybe for those who quit, you could try again.",

As of now I have no solution to my chronic migraines but what else is new, this is the story of my life. Topamax surly isn't the solution. I have no clue if topamax would have worked if taken longer but the side effects are not worth it. Even their website says they are unclear as to how it works. Wtf. I basically felt like I was moving around with no destination.. I couldn't focus, I felt lost, I kept doing things on repeat. I can't live like that. My driving was off. My sight was blury.

Some effects - mild paranoia, visual and auditory hallucinations, cry at drop if a hat, intense sense of insecurity, inadequacy, fear of loss of self-control. 3 months later, still smoking about 25% less and 10lbs loss. Other side effects I can't recall, except acne and weird skin rash.",

My dr took me off my medication I've been on for 18 years suddenly, which has worked for my heaches, and switched me to Topimax.

I had all the side effects - tingling, weight loss (very happy about it too), forgetting certain words and the nasty taste of soda. That was okay because I only drink it very rarely anyway.

I felt like I had a million bugs crawling through my skin and I couldn't see clearly. I have friends who this has worked for but for me it did not",
                    "I've been taking Topamax for about a year now. I started at 25 mg twice a day and I currently take 100 mg twice a day. IT IS WONDERFUL. I have had only 2-3 migraines since my Dr upped my dosage 3 months ago. I still get \"regular\" headaches 4-5 times a day but I can handle those. I was gearing 5--6 migraines a week before Topamax. The side effects are all there but I don't care as long as the migraine pain stays away.",
                    "This medicine is horrible. I last 2 days on only 25 mgs. The side effects are not worth it.",
                    "WEIGHT LOSS GREAT but hair loss is not worth it",
                    "My migraines are primarily abdominal, but I get daily 'tension\" type headaches as well.  But my nausea \"attacks\" are totally debilitating and the headaches get more so every day. I took Topamax starting at 25 mgs then increased. I noticed it really helping my symptoms, way less nausea, headaches stopped and I could sleep well.  Unfortunately, I am one of the people who react with a rare side effect of an acute onset closed angle glaucoma attack and my vision got very blurry and got so bad I could not see anything but blobs if it was more that 12 inches from my face. If you get blurred vision go to the ER and show them the letter from the Topamax website, because ER had never heard of that reaction. I gave it a 5 because it worked until then.",
                    "I love the weight loss attribute to this drug. When at a dosage of 50 or 75 mg per day, I have felt happier. One day, I doubled the 50 mg dosage in the late afternoon. Note: This doubled dosage was done 4 MONTHS after initially being prescribed the medicine. 100 mg of generic Topiramate made me feel wired. An hour later, I could be found with a full cart at the grocery store.The manic in me had returned. This was not a coincidence. I took the dosage at 75 mg the following day out of curiosity.. The compulsive cleaner had returned. My b/f at the time watched me scrub away at an already squeaky clean countertop.  This medicine eventually will also begin to make you stutter. You can fix this predicament by reading more. All in all, B rating",
                    "Topamax saved my life. I am 43 years old and have suffered from migraines since I was 18. I found Topamax this past June. Now it has been 7 months and life without migraines is wonderful. No more fear of when the Big One will hit. The weight loss (20lbs) was nice too. My worst side effect is the stumbling and grasping for words. My kids die laughing. So do I. My husband doesn't understand that part but it's ok. As long as the headaches don't come. I still have small, treatable headaches (part of another problem that I hope soon goes away). Topamax is my hero. Take away my car, my clothes, my house...but don't take away my Topamax.",
                    "I have been taking topamax for three years (75mg daily). I lost 25 lbs and I get maybe a few headaches a month. I also take Imitrex. I used to get fifteen headaches a month. I also take neurontin now for nerve pain and muscle pain and head pain. Topamax is worth trying for migraines. The side went away after a month.",
                    "I was prescribed this medication about 2 years ago for my cyclic vomiting syndrome. This first I took it, I had a bad experience and had to stop but after a year my doctor suggested that we try again. It has been a full year now. Since then I didn't have any weight change however; in October - she added another management pill to my list in addition to the topiramate and I have lost almost 30 lbs. I started at 199 lbs and as of today, I am down to 175 lbs. I was a size 16 Jean and bought a size 10 Jean today. I have been very unhappy about my weight since my daughter was born but recently, I am finding myself quite happier. I am averaging 1-3 lbs weight loss every 2 weeks",
                    "I did not even know how bad my headache was for years and the ringing in my ears, I've started Topomax recently and I never realized how much pain I was in until the headache and the ringing was finally totally gone, I drink lots of water and less caffeine to prevent kidney stones. I have never had one but that was the only side effect that I'm worried about. I feel like a new person.",
                    "I was prescribed phentermine and lost 20 pounds in my first month with that, a crap ton of vitamins, diet and exercise. On my 30 day follow up the doc decided to add 25mg Topomax into the mix. Only lasted a week on it.I found myself experiencing extreme emotions . I took it before bed as instructed, however I did not sleep at all for the duration of taking the pill. My nose would run randomly-like mid conversation with clients at work. I felt high, lethargic, irritable, and when not working laid around like a bump on a log. Not possible to function on this stuff with anything or anyone that required my undivided attention. Thanks to this pill I lost a week of exercise and my to-do things are through the roof.",
                    "I'm still new to this medicine but i'm still on it. I'm still in high school so I get migraines due to stress a lot. Every morning I'm starting to wake up super early ready to go and super hyper. So hyper that i'm shaking like crazy to the point it looks like i have a tremor. I'm more outgoing on this medication. I am losing little bit of my hair but i'm okay with it. at least i don't have migraines.",
                    "I started taking 50 mg of Topomax for the first month and went up to 100mg for the next three months. Lost 40 pounds.... For the next year and a half I have kept off the weight but have not lost any more. I still need to lose 30 more pounds, but have seemed to plateaued. And I am at 200 mg now... dont know what to do.",
                    "Worked like a dream! I went off of it because I didn't like some of the side effects, and my Fibro symptoms came back with a vengeance, crippling pain... bedridden most of the time, etc. I'm going back on next week. If you take this drug DO drink a lot of water as instructed to avoid kidney stones. I didn't drink hardly any water and got a stone. Also, I didn't have ins when on it so had to get a card from manufacturer (free). As for effectiveness.. it worked for me!",
                    "After taking 100mg daily, it took me roughly 3 months for my migraines to dramatically stop. I went from having approximately 12 migraines monthly to having maybe two. The side effects of this medication for me: for 3 weeks I could not focus, extreme fatigue, restlessness. I cannot drink anything carbonated, as a result, I lost 20 pounds in the first month. Serious appetite loss. I've been on this medication for 9 months and lost a total of 43 pounds. I have to take in the morning otherwise I cannot sleep. It also helps with my OCD tendencies. If you can make it through 3 weeks of outter space, this medication is worth it!!",
                    "I was on Lithium Carbonate for 15 years and never felt like a \"normal\" human being. I felt like a zombie. When I was told by a new psychiatrist to pick out a new medicine for my bipolar illness, I chose Topamax even though it is an off-label treatment for bipolar disorder, it seemed to have the least amount of side affects and I feel WHOLE again. I have been on Topamax for 15 years (I think) and the only adverse effect I have is decreased sweating in hot weather.",
                    "I have suffered from migraines since age 15. I have taken topamax since 2007. The first 2 weeks I lost 15 lbs, and it was very scary so I stopped. I've always been very active and ate well because I suffer from hypertension so the weigh was easy to manage. But now at age 34, and off the meds for 3 months and 20lns heavier I'm back taking 100mg a day. After only being on them for 8 hrs I feel the immediate effects. I'm back in the gym and my migraine went away in one hour. I won't neglect my health again. Stay healthy everyone!",
                    "Hi it's Reea again I wanted to update you guys on my progress thus far with this medication. Like I said in my previous post I started using it on September 4th 2015 weighting 230lbs and 3 days later I am weighing 222.8lbs. I still have a lot of my appetite so I have been making a conscious effort not to eat a lot and to make healthy choices so that has been a bit of a struggle. I am very hopeful with this medication but I planned to ask my doctor writhin the next week to increase my dose so the cravings can be under control do I wouldn't have such a struggle.",
                    "Worked wonderful to get rid of my headaches! For the first time in nine years I didn't have daily headaches. The side effects were awful though!! Ringing in the ears, dizziness, flushing, numb face/hands/arms/feet, the list goes on and on. My doctor had to wean me off of it.",
                    "I began taking Topamax about a year ago after suffering from weekly migraines since age 15. I increased the dose to 200mg a day before it seemed to be a therapeutic dose for me. My migraines reduced a lot for a long time but I also do not drink alcohol, caffeine, or eat chocolate, cheese. The last few weeks my migraines are back with great intensity. One lasted 4 days. So I will be going back to my doctor. Topamax did not affect my appetite at all. I get occasional tingling.",
                    "Although this medicine helps you fall asleep, you will not stay asleep. I would get a migraine an hour into my slumber then toss & turn all night and of course the cranky morning ensues. This med caused more migraines for me, stomach pain, and less sleep and that hardly outweighs my regular migraine schedule of pain three days in a row. More pain does not equal beneficial.",
                    "Topamax is an uncertainty at this time. I took it decades ago and because no med or mixture of meds controls seizures sufficiently for me I'm circling back. I've noticed major neurological feelings (e.g., tingling) transmitting down my legs to the point that it keeps me awake for many hours, which results in sleep deprivation and then seizure activity. It's not good at night. One reason I stopped the med years ago is because it can cause kidney stones. Not anything I want on top of seizures plus the tingling, foginess, and fatigue caused by Topamax.",
                    "I've had migraines since I was 25 (am now 68) and my life was hell until I discovered Topomax 18 months ago. I must be one of the lucky ones because I didn't have any horrible side effects, just some mild finger tingling. I lost a little appetite but made no difference (I'm slim anyway and probably lost 5 pounds), otherwise... it has been a miracle!! I started with 25mg, increased to 50, then to 100, didn't like it, went back to 50 and am now on 25 again and feel great. Sometimes I also take the generic and have no problem at all.",
                    "Was rx'd for migraine control and prevention. Worked. But the painful tingling in my hands and feet was so extreme, I couldn't handle it. It also messed me up with some outrageous severe insomnia, and that's one thing that I can't have any more out of control. Even with Lunesta and other hefty sleep aids I was a mess, no sleep at all. I'm just now hearing how it helps with weight loss, which Id love to get advantages from, but the side effects weren't worth it at all.",
                    "We tried this for my daughter when she suddenly started getting migraines every day. Migraines down to 2 per week and less severe but when we tried increasing the dose side effects became intolerable: doesn't help her sleep at night yet makes her very tired all day, have to force her to eat, her legs tingle all the way up to her hip. She also has nightmares, and vivid dreams, even during the day. That was the last straw and we'll be trying something else. Real shame because we think it was helping.",
                    "I take 25mg in the morning and 50 at night. Within the first two weeks of taking it, I tried to commit suicide, I was fighting major depression at the time too. By week four the feeling went away. Took 2-3 months for the fingers and toes to stop tingling but I had that in the toes any ways from nerve damage in the back. They increased my evening dose and within two weeks again I tried to commit suicide again. This time twice in one week and within a month I stabilized again. My doctor will not raise it anymore even though I just begged her to, it's only day 7-21 that I need to be watched and the last time, I called my sister to take me to the hospital the second attempt.I didn't lose weight on it.",
                    "After so many years of trying I finally start to function as a ( almost) normal human being. Topamax is my lifesaver.",
                    "I get more than 9 migraines a month. I know it's 9 because I was first given sumatriptan for them and only 9 every 30 days... I just started my first dose an hour ago doing 50mg total half a day then other half at night. Going to try it that way instead of morning because I'm terrified of the fog and driving confusion since I work full time an hour away from home... Anyways I weigh 184lbs... Weighed 100-107 from age 14-23 maybe even younger than I got addicted painkillers and when I got sober I gained a good 80 lbs! I feel so gross I can't see my damn girl parts haha so after hearing this migraine pill can make me lose weight I'm super excited and hope to get back to 120lb ... I will def. update! -Steph",
                    "I have took Lyrica and it did not help but trokendi xr has helped my fibro more than any med the Dr. Has ever given me. It needs to be used more often, because it really helps.",
                    "I've been on Topiramate for 3 weeks now and my migraines have stopped. I had them everyday. And I lost weight 5 pounds in this 3 weeks. Coke taste weird too not the same taste. I've notice I eat less junk food as well. So I'm happy with it.",
                    "I just started taking Topamax a little over 2 weeks ago. I am up to 100 mg a day. I am starting to really notice some short term memory issues, however I have not had a migraine, let alone a single headache since starting the medicines. Everything has started tasting weird since starting the 100mg dose. I used to drink at least 4 cups of coffee a day and can't stand to drink it at all. The bonus is that it has helped with the caffeine withdrawal. I am also a smoker and it has helped reduce my craving for tobacco! I have read a lot of the posts on here and am seriously concerned about many of the side effects such as hair loss. However the weight loss aspect is really appealing. I haven't lost anything yet though.",
                    "I hate this med. it is super cruel and I don't recommend it to ANYONE. I have been taking it for a few months, and it hasn't helped much with my headaches. The side effects are brutal. I have no appetite, and I am basically forcing myself to eat. I've almost passed out 5 times this week from not eating enough, and lost 30 pounds thanks to it. It also causes severe gum irritation which SUCKS with braces, and it makes you really foggy and hard to concentrate. I will say Qudexy helps with seizures, but nothing else.",
                    "I have been on Topiramate for several years in combination with gabapentin for seizures and migraines. Then my neurologist put me on 400mg topiramate to stop the breakthrough seizures. It works great. I lost 60 pounds. But I do have side effects of tingling, confusion, loss of words. However all that is better than seizures.",
                    "I've been on 50 mg of Topamax for a month now and it's changed everything for me. I went from having a headache every day for the past 2 years to not having a single one. I was skeptical at first because of the possibility of weight loss, as I am already very small. So far I have had no side effects. It truly has been a life saver.",
                    "LOVE ! Honestly. In the beginning, I did want to get off this medication. Some of the side effects for the first couple months are just annoying, but I was able to push through them. I was overweight at the time of starting this too for my migraines, and my migraines/headaches were SO BAD. But I was able to lose some weight from it too, which is nice. The most annoying side effect in my opinion would be the tingling in the tips of the fingers and toes, only lasted maybe 2-3 months for me. After that they faded and they're gone. After about a month a half of using this drug my headaches subsided quickly, now I'm migraine and headache free completely. I will forever take this medication as long as my Neuro says its okay too.",
                    "I took this medicine off and on for years. And I can honestly say it has helped my migraines tremendously. I suffer from migraines with the aura, and while off Topamax they come in weekly clusters. About once every couple of months I will have a week from hell. On Topamax I have one attack every couple of months. BUT, the side effects are unbearable.",
                    "This medicine changed my life. I went from bedridden to active. I still get flare ups, but I can function in them now. My pain is greatly reduced. I no longer have constant flu like symptoms or muscle spasms. My pain has been reduced to a dull ache and I can manage without narcotics. I unfortunately did show the rare side effect of hair loss. I solved that by cutting it short and dying it purple! Topamax is also sold as a diet pill, so I also lost about 40 pounds, which is helpful for a lot of fibromyalgia patients since we tend to gain weight from lack of activity or taking meds like Lyrica . In fact, I ended up on Topamax because my insurance wouldn't cover Lyrica. Best thing to ever happen to me since I became ill!"

                    "//What is it?//Headache and migraine are different entities. Migraine is one of the most common and well characterized, but there are 14 broad categories that can be subdivided into more than 200 different forms. Migraine itself has about 20 different genres. In general, headaches are divided into two large groups: primary and secondary. Primary illnesses correspond to a disease, not reflecting other health problems and represent around 90% of the total. Secondary symptoms are symptoms of diseases of the nervous system or other organs of the human body. They can occur in cases of flu, alcohol poisoning or withdrawal, minor head trauma, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels) or a high blood pressure crisis. Migraine is a primary headache in which very intense episodes of pain occur interspersed with periods without symptoms. In general, it begins between the ages of 15 and 40, but it can appear in childhood or shortly after the first menstruation. If it appears for the first time after the age of 45, other causes must be excluded. Some of its characteristics are closely associated with the female reproductive cycle: higher prevalence after the first menstruation or during the menstrual period; occasional worsening due to taking birth control pills or hormone therapy; attenuation or disappearance during pregnancy or menopause. Before adolescence, migraines affect boys and girls equally. From then on, it is two to three times more common in females. It is estimated that 8% to 15% of individuals living in Western countries (including Portugal) suffer from this problem. The fact of reaching people in the productive phase implies large economic, social and family costs.//Symptoms//It appears recurrently, several times throughout life, but always with completely free intervals. If it occurs every day, it is probably overuse of painkillers or other medications. Drug abuse can convert a migraine into a chronic daily headache. There are people who preferably appear on the weekend. These crises can be precipitated by changes in sleep schedule, failure to eat breakfast, reduced stress or alcohol abuse. In these cases, it is important to consider a lifestyle change over the weekend. The symptoms are intense and often prevent work or study. The pain tends to be throbbing, worsening with physical exertion or head movements. In general, it affects only one side of the head, and is accompanied by nausea, vomiting, intolerance to light, noise and some smells. It is not mandatory that all of these elements are present simultaneously. And they can occur twice a week or just a few throughout a lifetime. During attacks, people seek a dark, quiet place to rest or fall asleep. An episode can last from a few hours to three days. Between attacks, there are usually no complaints. Some types of migraines may have more complex symptoms (with aura). These forms are less common, affecting around 15% of people with this problem, and include transient neurological symptoms, originating attributable to certain areas of the brain. The other signs are identical to those of migraine without aura. The most common auras are temporary vision disorders, in the form of loss of vision on one side of the visual field, blurred images, perception of bright points, geometric figures or bright zigzags. Other auras can be translated as tingling or numbness on one side of the face or one of the hands. There are people who have difficulty speaking or even temporary paralysis of their limbs, usually only on one side of the body. These changes last about 10 to 30 minutes and precede the pain. In children, migraines tend to be bilateral, less intense and of shorter duration. Vomiting and dark circles can be exuberant. Disturbances in sleep and meal schedules are common precipitating factors. Treating these crises is easier than in adults. Sleep usually gives good results. At these ages, the occipital location is not normal and, when present, requires a medical consultation. Likewise, the presence of headaches with morning vomiting or other unusual symptoms in very young children should be seen by a healthcare professional.//Causes//It is caused by a combination of brain processes: excitation/depression of cells, dilation of arteries and release of chemicals. People with migraine are more sensitive to certain stimuli, environmental or from their own body, that can trigger these brain processes. It is also thought that there is some genetic susceptibility. Some individuals can identify the signs of their attacks. The most common are cheese, chocolate, strawberries, seafood, wine, artificial sauces, changes in sleep patterns, stress, menstruation, fasting, physical exercise, and minor trauma. Others cannot identify them at all. People who drink coffee regularly may experience headaches when they stop this habit.//Diagnosis//The key to diagnosis lies in the clinical history, physical and neurological examination. Observation of the fundus is a very important part of these procedures. In some cases, it may be necessary to resort to computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to exclude other diseases.//Treatment//Migraines have no cure but can be controlled. There are medications and behaviors that can reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks. Symptomatic treatment, during acute periods, involves resting in a quiet, dark place. Pressure or cold can be applied to the area of \u200b\u200bpain. At this stage, analgesics, anti-inflammatories, antiemetics and triptans are very useful.//Prevention//People with migraines should create calendars that allow them to identify their symptoms and assess their impact on their quality of life. The first step in prevention is to identify and eliminate precipitating factors, whenever possible. In some cases, it is necessary to use daily medication to reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks, but there are no drugs specifically developed for their prevention. However, there are some drugs used in other contexts that have proven to be effective, such as beta-blockers, antidepressants or antiepileptics, and these should always be prescribed by a doctor.

                    "//What is it?//It is a neurological disease that involves the nervous system. Epilepsy is defined as the occurrence of at least two episodes of seizures that are not related to alcohol withdrawal, hypoglycemia, heart problems or other conditions. In some cases, one seizure is enough to diagnose epilepsy, provided there is a high risk of more occurring. Seizures result from a change in the electrical activity of the brain and may result from trauma, familial tendencies, or have no identifiable cause. This activity or discharge has an unpredictable onset and is, in general, of short duration (seconds to minutes, rarely exceeding 15 minutes) with normal brain functioning maintained between attacks. These tend to recur over time, with frequency varying between patients. Epilepsy affects several mental and physical functions and is a very common condition, occurring in around 65 million people worldwide. In the United States, it is the fourth most common neurological disease, surpassed only by migraine, stroke and Alzheimer's disease. In Portugal, it is estimated that it affects four to seven thousand inhabitants. However, the number of individuals who, although not epileptic, may have a seizure during their lifetime is approximately one in every 20. It is more common in very young or elderly people, but can occur at any age. Although treatment allows many patients to live with this condition, for others the seizures are uncontrollable and affect their quality of life in all its aspects.//Symptoms//Epilepsy does not manifest itself in the same way in all patients, and can occur in simple or complex seizures. Furthermore, they depend on the location of the discharge focus in the brain, and can affect gait, face, specific activities, or cause various types of alteration in the state of consciousness, often accompanied by automatic, unplanned movements (getting dressed or undressed, walking, chewing or swallowing). They can occur during sleep and the patient may be conscious or not remember anything after the seizure ends. Seizures themselves can be of different types, with muscles being relaxed, contracted or showing spasmodic movements. Some exhibit signs that precede them (aura) while others occur without warning.//Causes//In a large number of cases it is not possible to determine a cause. But any injury that reaches the brain can leave a \"scar\" that is a potential starting point for epileptic seizures.//Diagnosis//Diagnosis is a complex process that involves several steps. The clinical history, neurological examination and laboratory tests are generally the first steps, as they allow the occurrence of seizures unrelated to the disease to be ruled out. Electroencephalogram, magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography scans allow the exploration of possible causes. Finding the origin of epilepsy is very important because it allows the selection of the most appropriate treatment.//Treatment//Treatment must be highly personalized, taking into account the patient's own risks and the dangers of further seizures. It is therefore important to consider the patient's age, the characteristics of the seizures, associated factors and the patient's social and professional context. Many antiepileptic drugs have significant side effects and this risk requires careful consideration. In some cases, one type of medication is sufficient, but for other patients, it may be necessary to combine several. As a rule, treatment is started with a reduced dose of the selected medication, with a gradual adjustment based on the clinical response. The goal is not to cure epilepsy but to control the occurrence of seizures. For this to be successful, good cooperation from the patient is essential, since in some cases, the patient may have to stop the treatment after a period of time without seizures. When medications are not effective, alternatives such as a ketogenic diet or surgery may be considered: The ketogenic diet uses a high percentage of fat, few proteins and carbohydrates and a total suppression of sugar.

                    "I have been on this medication almost two weeks, started out on 25mg and working my way up to 100mg, currently at 50mg. No headaches at all so far and I was having 2-3 crippling migraines a week. I have lost 5.2lbs so far but note I am really paying close attention to what I am eating, I have a lot of weight to lose and if weight loss is a side effect I want to help it along as much as I can. Now, other side effects, they are there the word recall issues exist, the memory issues, the worst of it seems to be the vision disturbances, there have been times I have just not driven because I'm sure it would not have been safe. The good news is it seems to be wearing off...I have tons of energy and I am in a great mood.",
                    "I didn't like Topamax. I became very paranoid, anxious and since I have been off of it I still have mild side effects from it. Not a good experience. Glad it works for some.",
                    "I have been taking 75mg topamax one a day for about 10 years now. I have gone as far as taking 100mg until I started not being able to get the words out that I was thinking of. That side effect has not completely gone away but is better. When I first started I did have the tingling in my hands and feet but it was no more than like having carpal tunnel, I also have the weird taste where soda tasted flat and tomatos tastes weird. I did loose a little weight. The tingeling went away, I adjusted to just not drinking soda. And tomatos started to taste fine. I also take Sumatriptan for when I still do get a headache. However the headaches are much fewer and further beteeen. I will get a cluster of them about every six mths but still better.",
                    "Topamax is amazing. I originally took it 6 years ago to prevent migraines and lost 80 lbs as a bonus. At that time my doctor and I speculated that it would some day be approved for weight loss because I was not his only patient to report changes in the taste of carbonated beverages and chocolate while taking the medication. I also noticed that I did not dream about food while taking the medication, but within 3 months of changing medications food reentered my dream content. I am now back on the medication to address chronic pain issues and have already found the same results in weight loss, taste changes, and dream content.",
                    "Definitely takes away my hunger.",
                    "I like this medicine. I don't have many of the other problems that others have had. I was on Dilantin for years and was up to 1000MG per day until my body had gotten used to it and was still giving me grand maul seizures. My Neurologist after trying many other medicines (a certain combination he gave just made me stumble around like I was a drunk and made the police in my area look like a bunch of monkeys after I had a blood alcohol level of 0.0. Anyway I still have bright flashes and small dark spots and little halo's but not full blown grand mals. Just remember to drink lots of Water.",
                    "I am currently taking it for intense migranes. It is the only thing that I have found that has helped. I do have breakthrough migraines but the medication does keep the majority of them at bay. I do get many of the side effects. I get the tingling in the hands and feet. I occasionally get tingling on my tongue and a weird burning/taste when I drink soda. I get a slight dizziness when I first take it. I am more sensitive to cold and I get diarrhea. All of these side effects I can either live with or treat and are worth the freedom of the migraines. If you live with migraines everyday your willing to put up with a lot of side effects just to be pain free for a while. This medication is totally worth it.",
                    "Been on Topamax for 3 months I have recently gone up on the dose to 75 mg at bedtime. I've been all right dealing with the tingling. I have quit smoking and drinking which is great. I started working out alot since I've been so anxious. Possible side effect? The worst for me is the sleep issues and the mood swings. Since the dose went up I am having terrible night sweats and am waking up all night long. I'm exhausted all day with little to no motivation. My mood swings quickly and dramatically from happy to annoyed. Just trying to wait it out. I'm still having headaches everyday. Just not migraines.",
                    "I've been taking this drug since the end of Sept 2014. On 100mg per day, taken 25mg 4 times a day as I find them so strong. They've been working really well up until about a month ago, but the migraines have returned, so wondering whether I need to increase the dose or to request to try botox - anyone tried this for migraine treatment? Side effects-these have been tough and ongoing. Pins and needles in hands&feet, severe nausea, dizziness, memory loss, lack of concentration, reduced heart rate (normal 70 bpm to 48 - I'm a 35 year old female), find it hard to sleep. Have lost 2.5 stone so far, have real trouble eating as feel so sick-dietician scored me with a high risk of malnutrition. Concerned about the damage this drug is doing.",
                    "I have been migraine free for 6 months (previously I had 3-4 migraines per month). I also lost 25lbs and look great.",
                    "Wow, what a roller coaster ride! Started on 25mg, no effect, then 50, 200 finally 400. It did stop the cluster headaches, but Extreme confusion, serious loss of hearing, forgetfulness, couldn't remember my phone number! My wife wouldn't let me drive at 400mg, I was dangerous, parking became very difficult, once I had to get out of the car and let her park. Frustrating and humiliating. In the end, I was down to 50mg a day, Doc said that wasn't causing any side effects at that low dose. WRONG! When I finally stopped, it took a couple of weeks to become me again. I was shocked at the difference it made being off of it. Some of my hearing came back thankfully. I did lose 30 pounds that did not come back.",
                    "I am on a two week trial. I have been on the medication for 5 days. I have noticed that soda taste disgusting. Which is a good thing for me. I don't feel or look as bloated. I have not lost any weight as of yet. I hope that comes soon. I do notice that I am more thirsty and not as hungry. I try to eat at least three times a day so that I don't \"binge\". I have noticed that I am more constipated than normal even with drinking more water. I hope to see weight loss soon. I have been \"obese\" for some time and very unhappy with myself. This puts a huge wedge into my married life. I also would love to loose weight to take the pressure off my knee, my back, and to reduce my asthma some. I hope this medicine is the key to a new life for me.",
                    "I started out slowly at 25mg. on Topiramate for migraine prevention since I was getting 2-4 a week. The morning after I took my first dose my diet coke tasted flat, and I opened 3 other cans thinking there must be something wrong with the case of soda I bought, refusing to believe that the side effect of making carbonated drinks taste flat could start after just one dose, but it did. Within 72 hours I began having eye pressure and weird eye pain, I was concerned and saw an ophthalmologist, one of the adverse effects of the med. is glaucoma, but everything was fine. When I increased to 50 mg./day I was so THIRSTY all the time. At 150mg. Migraines were decreased, but I was cognitively impaired with hair loss. Lost 8 lbs. after starting 150 mg",
                    "This medication worked for me for a while, however, my body became accustomed to it, and it stopped working. I also experienced the majority of side effects. Mainly weight loss, but also decreased cognition and spelling abilities. I discontinued this medication specifically because losing my ability to think and communicate was horrible. Before I started this medication, my migraines were never affected by food (caffeine, sugar, etc), however, since discontinuing the medication I can no longer drink coffee/soda and have sugary desserts and foods. I also feel like my speech and communication skills (verbal) have been affected. ",
                    "I took this for my chronic central pain state and it was a very effective pain killer as long as Tapentodol not taken simultaneously, then skin itch develops at low dose of EXTENDED RELEASE (capsule) 100mg nocte and 50mg morning. The itch was severe by time dose increased to 200mg am and nocte but no,other side effects except possible responsible for my delayed circadian Rythm disorder. Waking constantly before 4am sleeping 4-11am so very inconvenient, but others side effect free and a good pain killer. Remember to check if you have been prescribed the normal tablets or extended release capsules and that pharmacy has given you the correct kind.",
                    "I started this medication for weight lose, bipolar, migraines. Seems like it may just be perfect...hopefully. I just finished my first week and lost 3 pounds! I workout 5-6 days a week but due to antidepressants making me gain so much weight, regardless of my diet and exercise I am fat. So today stepping on that scale and seeing 3 POUNDS LIGHGTER! I am a very moody person but the medicine seems to be making it right, moods seem to be very level. And haven't had one migraine! No side effects other than weight loss and loss of appetite..can't complain about that!",
                    "The first month was great, started on 25mg and upped to 100mg within 4 weeks. Totally migraine free except when I came to my period. Then I started to have a visual aura which I never previously experienced and had a 3-day intense migraine. My usual vertigo and severe travel sickness completely disappeared. After that, I stayed headache free mostly for a couple of months, apart from my time of month and ovulation. I continue to get the visual auras almost daily. They're not painful so don't bother me. Last month, the headaches came back almost daily with the auras. My doctor increased dose, going to 200mg and headaches are gone already. I'm hoping this will also help with back pain from disk degeneration. Lost 33lbs",
                    "I was just diagnosed with epilepsy about 2 weeks ago and I am now taking 50 mg of topamax 2 times a day and I have to say this is the best thing ever! I don't know how much I have lost because I did not know what I was when I started and I need to get a new set of scales. I was around 240 lbs so I needed. I noticed right away that my diet Dr pepper tasted flat and just thought that I had a bad batch till the next case tasted worse. I also noticed that food tasted \"off\" too, now my appetite is down and I took a deeper look at the info on topamax and know this is the drug I have been needing the last 10 years!",
                    "Topamax has helped my diabetic nerve damage more than any other drug that my doctor has prescribed for me, and it does not have all the other nasty side effects, including the weight gain. I get enough of that from the insulin. I love taking the Topamax. I'm on a low dose (25 mg) but it sure has helped me.",
                    "At 42 and suffering migraine attacks with aura from a young age I have tried lots of meds,acupuncture with no real success,I started of on 25mg of topamax then increased a month later to 50 mg which made me like a ticking time bomb towards my family so dropped back to 25mg at night no more and been having excellent results,when I do get a migraine the pain is very minimal if any and can continue working which would never happen before I would be out for days ,just stay on low dose ,I find once well in your system works well.",
                    "The drug would get a 10 as it worked miraculously for me.  In my case -- and this probably won't happen to you -- the medication caused me kidney stones, the first of which was agonizing and led me to stop using the medication. Then the headaches resumed. I was willing to take an occasional Kidney Stone attack as a tradeoff for frequent migraine so I went back on the drug knowing the risks. Unfortunately, I peed gravel constantly, oddly without pain, but it was a warning. I'm now off the drug. If it did not cause me that side effect, I would have remained on the medication as it was, again, close to 100 percent effective. Not everyone responds the same way; your experience will probably be different.",
                    "The MOST ridiculous packaging I have ever had to deal with. I finally got a pair of scissors and cut them out one at a time, the put them in container. A total pain.",
                    "I was prescribed Topamax after experiencing 2 seizures from extreme stress, anxiety, and insomnia for an extended period of time. I have a history of anxiety/mood issues, and have tried several SSRI's and other medications with no success over many years. I had given up hope until I tried topamax. Within the first few days I knew something was different. My anxiety was erased for the first time in 15 years. I was happy again, and was looking forward to spending time with people. This medication completely turned my life around. If you are stuck in a anxiety/depression hole with very little hope, please be patient. There is something out there for you. Topamax has side effects, but you get used to them within a month, its well worth it.",
                    "This drug is a game changer ! I'm coping daily much better... I was a mess, suicidal a roller coaster of instability and terrible migraines, so far so good. I'm in a place where Dialectical behavior therapy (dbt) can at least sink in .... I'm hoping not to much weight loss cause I'm tiny to begin with. But no side effects so far.",
                    "I was on a 7 day sample pack and I had my first week free of migraines in over 5 years. Magic!",
                    "I'm a 19 year old female who has now been on Topamax for 6 weeks, 150mg daily. I have a daily headache that ranges from pain threshold of 1 to 5, plus nausea, with a haze over my brain which slows down capability and causes general fatigue. Every 3 weeks this works its way up until a major migraine attack of a 9. But with Topamax the daily headache so far has reduced to a 1/2. ",
                    "I've only been on this medication for 2 weeks now but it has changed my life. I have lived with chronic migraines since my entire life..since I was 18 months old. I have lived with daily headaches and almost daily migraines for the past 10 years and it has taken over my life. Since starting Topamax, I have had 2-3 manageable headaches and I have my life back! It has even taken away chronic fibromyalgia and arthritis pain, given me back my ability to sleep soundly for hours at a time, and has gotten me out of a daily triptan habit that almost caused a stroke a few weeks ago. The side effects (brain fog, drowsiness, etc) are nothing new for me given I have fibromyalgia. A life without pain is worth it to me! What a miracle!!",
                    "I started taking 25 mg about a year and a half ago I got up 200 mg once a day I found in the beginning my hands would tingle I had bitter a taste in my mouth but overtime that went away it did help with weight loss I lost about 10 pounds. I didn't experience any hair loss in the beginning I had trouble remembering things but it eventually fades away and you're back to normal at least for me . I believe this drug does work specially if you have migraines.",
                    "I have taken topiramate since June 23, 2015 for weight lose and to help with my type 2 diabetes, I have now lost 25 lbs as of Oct 15 I have also joined Weight Watchers in August because I found that the pills alone were not a miracle pill they do help with not having the carb cravings but you do need to eat well to lose weight. I currently take 50mg in the morning and 50mg at dinner time and do not see any side affects. At first I did have the tingling in the hands and feet but after a few weeks that went away. I plan on staying on it and staying with the weight watchers and hopefully making my goal weight for the first time I am 50 years old and have been overweight since age 20",
                    "Although it did work for reducing my migraines, I found that the side effects outweighed the treatment. I had almost all of the side effects mentioned: confusion, irritability, diarrhea, tingling hands and feet, vision changes, loss of appetite and weight, change in sex drive and worst of all hives. The people around me were glad I stopped taking it, as it made me act differently than I would normally.",
                    "I'm on day 4 of 50 mg of Topamax, and am supposed to up it to 100mg on the 7th day. I've not had a migraine but the side effects are draining me. I have headaches almost everyday and they usually turn into a migraine. But so far in the 4 days on Topamax I've only had to take one triptan and it worked ASAP. I hope I can hang in there. I'd like to lose some weight too!",
                    "Update I started Topamax a week ago tomorrow 50mg at night and I have lost 5 lbs I'm 5'3\" and started at 157lbs I am at the Dr.s now stepped on the scale and I'm at 152 so I couldn't be happier...I have very minimal side effects taking them at night helps with those I sleep very well and I have had some tingling fingers but nothing unbearable...all in all I am very happy with the 5 lbs lost in 6 days looking forward to more weight loss in one more week I do increase my dosage to 100 mg so we shall see about those side effects...but if things keep going the way then I might stay on them for a while",
                    "Started 100mg at bedtime (in case of drowsiness) because I was waking up with 3 migraines/week. Later we added 25mg in the morning to prevent afternoon migraines. My headaches have gradually improved, not just in frequency but also in intensity. Only side effects have been weight loss (about 10-15 lb, and it seems to have levelled out there, which is fine; I'm a relatively small person) and paresthesia/tingles in my hands & face. Tingling is more frequent in cold weather, but it's not bad enough to make me quit, especially not with the benefits I'm experiencing. There's been a bit of research into its use for mood disorders, which I have. I'm on other meds for that, but I wonder if the topiramate is having any extra little benefit there.",
                    "I have been on Topamax for about 4 years. I have a brain tumor and migraines with seizures. I was on Divalproax and had gained weight (178lbs). I am 5'3\". When my doctor put me on Topamax, my hands and feet tingled, everything tasted like metal, for about a month or so I also felt like I was on \"speed\". After the first month or so and some dosage alterations, I am very happy. No seizures, headaches gone, I am now a size 3, yeah, and will be very upset if someone takes my Topamax away.",
                    "I have been on Topamax for around two months. I decided to go on them because I weighed around 105 kgs, I was feeling depressed and I couldn't stop binge eating. Through Topamax, I have lost 10 kgs in one month (that would be around 22 pounds). I feel so much better. My urge to binge eat is gone. I feel human again. I don't feel any side effects. I sleep better than before, I drink more water than before (as much as I should drink, before I didn't drink at all and had problems with my kidneys). When I first started topiramate, I got double vision. I read that this was a common side effect and saw my eye doctor about it. She said that it was because my vision improved a great deal. So, thank you Topamax, My health greatly improved.",

I had a sever break down 15 yrs ago and I believe something in my brain actually disconnected or fizzeled out! unrecoverable! i have tryied many meds for many symtoms. I have been on Toparimate for atleast 10 yrs i have not had weightloss from it, i was put on it for my borderline to controll my rage. I take Many different meds I beleive they are all fighting one another! Toparimate has effected my vision, motor skills, slowed down my thought process! blurred my desicion making and my ability to recognize reality from my on disorted thoughts!",
                    "I only used this drug once because I had such a negative experience. I was prescribed this to prevent migraines and headaches, I took my dose at night. It immediately made me drowsy which I didn't mind because I also have severe insomnia, but when I woke up I was still drowsy and continued to be throughout the day. I was also the hungriest I have ever been in my life and I had a headache. It took 2-3 weeks to fix my appetite after taking this drug only once.",
                    "I am a 50 yr old male who has suffered from migraines for nearly 40 yrs. The toughest yrs (about 25 of them) consisted of migraines in excess of 300 days in any given yr. Then I found Topamax and asked my Neurologist if we could give it a shot for me. That was 6 yrs ago and now I have less than 50 headaches (not migraines), headaches in any given year. My dose is 200mg in the morning and 200mg in the evening, and yes like most of you I have had to deal with the numbing in the extremities but you get over it in time. The memory thing, well, how good was my memory anyway when I had a migraine that lasted for 6 months and I was blacking out at times, tunnel vision and puking almost daily. This medication gave me my life back. Thanks!",
                    "I've been taking the Topamax for over a year now for migraines was on 50mg twice a day now was put on 100mg twice a day helps with the migraines I do have on side effect and that's the drowsiness but as far as a weight medication it has not help me one bit actually I have gained weight on this medication.",

                    "I tried the 25mg dosage for atypical facial pain after being unable to tolerate several other anticonvulsants. No side effects and it calmed the pain - but the relief only lasted 6 hours at the most per day then the pain returned with increased intensity until the next dose the following day. One week of that was enough. The Extended Release (XR) did not work for me but changing to topiramate twice a day has, thus far, been a significant improvement!",

But my seizures were debilitating, & I was having migraines 3x a month, so I can deal with the side effects. My biggest problem is the lack of appetite. Because of my insomnia, my doc switched me to Qudexy, which is topiramate in a time release capsule. When I was taking regular Topiramate I did lose weight, approx 60lbs in 2 yrs & then the weight loss stopped. I went from 200 lbs-140 lbs. & I very happy with that. Since I switched to Qudexy 2 months ago, I've lost close to 20 lbs & have no desire to eat. I feel like I'm force feeding myself. I dont know what to do.",
                    "I was placed on Topamax (aka Topiramate) several years ago for Migraines. For the most part (during that time), it seems to have worked with minimal adverse effects like slight tingling. In late 2016 while I was asleep, I experienced the most awful leg pain (as if my thigh muscle did a flip flop or wanted to rip out of my leg). After various conversative methods which included Vitamin D 5000mg, it was suggested that I cease the Topiramate as a process of eliminating things.

Mainly due to diarrhea & lack of appetite. I almost gave up on taking it because of the stomach cramps I was getting but they subsided after the 1st week. I have changed a lot about my lifestyle since taking topamax so I don't know how much of my weight loss can be attributed to the drug itself but I definitely have lost weight 12 lbs & don't crave sugar. I stopped drinking soda over a yr ago so I don't know if it tastes different now. I do want water more than anything, which is fine. It does make you drowsy/foggy but I take my dose at bedtime, I do get weird tingles a few times a day in hands",

My doctor recommended topiramate and after a few trials of different mg it's a game changer. I honestly never get headaches anymore and had not a single side effect from this medication (which I was concerned about). It really does help and gave me a feeling of normalcy back in my life.",
                    "I've been on topiramate for about 9 months and I've had really weird side-effects. I have the usual tingling, numbness, and weight-loss/loss of appetite that most everyone seems to have, but I've also gotten really bad heartburn. It gets to the point where it feels like I'm gonna throw up, and an episode might last anywhere from 2 hours to the whole day. It's not when I eat certain foods either. I also still get really horrible migraines, just not as often. I can't go on imitrex anymore because I have \"complex\" migraines, but sometimes no medicine helps. Does anyone else have these problems too?",
                    "I've been on Topamax for about 5 months now (100 am/100 pm) and finally giving up faith. The negative side effects outweigh the slight change in my migraines. Carbonated beverages taste terrible, I have to force myself to eat, I stutter constantly, I can never find the right words and often switch up words in a sentence. My memory is horrid, and I always see tracers, which is enough to drive anyone crazy. The only pluses are the slight decrease in consistency of my migraines and the weight loss.",

I was on Trokenid XR for a total of eight months and just got off the medication this week. I had a lot of the severe side effects. After the first 3 weeks of being on this medicine it caused a drastic change in my mood, depression, thoughts of suicide, dramatic increase in memory loss, tingling in the hands, legs and feet, could never get enough sleep, and was very aggressive and irritable. I did not have a seizure while on Trokendi XR, but the side effects I was having with this medication was not worth it for me. However it could work great for someone else, and you might not have any of them!",

I've been extremely dizzy before and after taking this, so not sure I can include that as a side effect but the rest...well, I could not stop crying, had extreme thirst, \"pins and needles\" feeling in my hands, feet, and lips, and was confused. I guess the plus side of this medicine is that it works right away. I've stopped taking it today on the advice of my Doctor and am starting to feel better. I hope this helps someone out there. Good luck everyone!",

I am so glad I went ahead and gave it a try for myself I think it's a miracle drug ! It's helped stabilize my mood, taken away my migraines and even helped me lose a few pounds !!! I haven't had any negative side effects at all from it ! I know it's effects everyone differently and for me personally it's been great I love it!",

I just started today on twice a day some of these reviews scare me to the point that I'm not sure if I want to continue taking this.

Positive is that I finally have a break in the migraine of 8 plus days, no tingling in extremities as others mentioned. No additional mental fog. Cola taste flat and that is a plus to me as I need to drink more water. Negative is the nausea that occurs after I take the pill and it is horrible but I counter it with a suppository of phenegrin(sp). Of course that knocks me out for hours. I was to increase dosage to 50mg but doctor gave okay to wait another week. This is a promising option for me after 16 yrs of suffering. And I have tried numerous meds over that time.",

I will have late onset asthma with the generics and other unpleasant side effects. I tried more than once to use generics but it won't work. So , give it a try if you can afford the brand name. IT makes a big difference. I also found that all my migraines disappeared while taking this. What a relief that was. ",

I am currently 23 years old, and I started having these migraines when I was 15. I didn't know that this would be a lifelong thing that would eventually lead me to be on daily medication. The frequency that I would get them,would be more than six times a month. Anyway, I went on propannalol? (Beta blocker), NO SUCESS. & then doctors prescribed me topamax. I didn't have any side effects. At all. No tingling. Nothing. And GUESS WHAT, I didn't have a migraine for 3 years!!!! NOT ONE. but I got off of it, thinking they were \"gone\" & now I'm suffering with new hormonal migraines. Going back on topamax & hoping for same results!!!!",
                    "I only took Topamax for a short time, but the side effects were so bad I had to stop. Primarily, it made me feel goofy. I was in a cloud and had trouble remembering how to get places I went to frequently. I lost the ability to taste bubbles in beverages, and beer or soda without carbonation just wasn't the same. In short, the nickname \"dopamax\" seemed well earned to me.",

Thought I was stressed out and overwhelmed with small kiddos and hubby deployed, my dermatologist didn't see anything very serious, like alopecia, so I continued. I began taking biotin and vitamins, but hair still kept coming out and scalp was starting to show more. I stopped completely and only lasted 4 days before a migraine wanted to come on. Luckily I took a rizatriptan in time to fight it off. Topamax worked beside the side effects of hair loss, forgetfulness, some leg cramps. Has anyone had any luck with another migraine preventative?",

When I started Topamax, I could attend lunches at work and can honestly say I haven't binged at work this year (I am a teacher). In previous years, I binged and purged, 3-4 times a day. I know socialize and have friends. I do admit though that the meds have made me very, very, tired. I sleep in until about 1 or 2 pm on the weekends which brothers me a lot but I think its a small price to pay for the huge changes I've made.",

I am 65 year old female obese all my life. Had experimental Lap band surgery in 1979. Gained all weight back. Tried everything and gained back all weight every time. Can't take diet pills make me too jittery. After three years stopped topamax because of minor memory loss which I thought was embarrassing. Stayed on Prozac 30mg and gained all weight back and more up to 291. Now I am really depressed. Came off Prozac and am back on topamax 25 mg in morning and 25 mg at night only. Have lost 3 lbs in one week. So happy. Would rather walk and feel better physically than remember someones name,",

Oh, I drove? Wow. I don't remember. Ever rode on the gravitron? That's how bad my vertigo was, I could not lift my head up off my pillow. I actually ate more on this medicine because I felt shaky, like you would get if you hadn't eaten all day, for me the only thing that kinda tastes close to normal was sugary foods. Heartburn. Nausea. Dry heaving. Motion sickness from waking, standing, sitting, and existing. Light sensitivity. Tremors. I'm sure I'm forgetting things but the memory fog is too real. I felt drunk over all.",
                    "I was getting 10-12 migraines a month when I was prescribed Topamax. I took it for a little over a month but had to quit because it made me extremely depressed and suicidal. After I stopped taking it, I felt fine again.",
                    "At first I did not like it at all - I started off on 50mg (recommended) and found it wasn't working. I also was super spaced out, unfocused and constantly feeling like my brain was going but my body wasn't (It was WEIRD). This went on for about a week, then it worked perfectly and I was completely normal. However the migraines started coming back so I am now on 100mg a day and the same thing happened when I upped the dosage. It's working now though! I didn't notice any difference in tasting things but I did get tingles in my fingers and toes! Otherwise all round amazing medicine!!",

However, at around the four month mark, both came back to haunt me with a vengeance, seemingly doubling pain and severity. I also began experiencing tingling in my hands and numbness in my face, a totally unpleasant and unforeseen side effect that I only discovered by exploring online forums reviewing the medication. Additionally, this medication severely affected my anxiety and also led me to have extreme suicidal ideation, so much so that I had to stop altogether. I lost 15% of my total body weight whilst on this medication. If possible, avoid if you have a history of anxiety or depression.",

So that tingling that many have an issue with, my Brain Rehabilitation Specialist said bananas. You need potassium if you are experiencing that.

Recently I decided to give Topamax one more try. Within 2 weeks I have felt better than I have in two years. I still have small but manageable headaches and expect them to get better because I am slowly upping dose to 4/day. Good luck to all of you with migraines, if you haven't tried Topamax you should give it a try.",

After the initial few weeks of disorientation, halo vision, & tingling/numbness, my body adjusted to the meds & I had almost 10 years of maybe two headaches per year. A miracle! When menopause hit, my migraines came roaring back with a vengeance. But I stayed on Topamax & my neurologist added other meds to supplement. Things are better now; Topamax has been a lifesaver for me. But it takes some time to let the side effects settle out & for your doctor to tweak the dosages.",

I got up to 340 and was like ok this is enough. I started my vegan diet I did back when I fought mma went to the doctor I was down 10 lbs. I needed new med so she put me on the topomax. From day 1 zero appetite none whatsoever. Like I have to make an effort to eat. When I do eat it is just cut up raw veggies in a bowl of vinegar that is it for the day. Now I am on top of my supplements so my body has what it needs. I'm shredding lbs like mad",

My knees prevented me from working out and my weight caused my knee issue. I sat down with my primary care physician and she ultimately suggested the use of topamax. In July 2015 i started with 25 milligrams and evolved to 125 miligrams. It is now December 8 and I weigh 221 pounds. Here is how I would describe the experience. It stops the need to impulse eat, so you don't feel deprived, so...your not crying when the scale isn't moving quickly. Its not quick, because I am post menopausal...but its not painful. Appetite is down, I can now walk 45 minutes...and for the first time in my life..I know I will reach a goal weight.",

I had to go get it cut to my shoulders in hopes it would look better but if doesn't. I began taking topamax to help with my migraines and I dropped a lot of weight. I lost 20 lbs over the course of 8 months. I now weigh 136lbs and sort of want to continue because I love the fact that I'm losing all this weight but I know it's bad for me as I am now getting addicted. I've been off the medication for about 2 months and my migraines are returning. I don't want to continue taking it because of my hair loss but I am not sure what to do.

I use to weigh 125lb over the years I've gotten to were I can't do very much walking or exercise I'm so thankful my Dr put me on this I can't believe it the Topiramate at nite what really made the difference I was up and down during the nite eating now I eat jello and a little whipping cream that's it.

However I am intolerate to temperatures above 68 degrees and I am a healthy 23 year old female who did not have this problem prior to this medication. Even with ice pressed to my neck I will overheat in a house set on 70 & I puke and get a migraine instantly. Apparently that's one of the side affects of the medication. Two other side effects are I am rarely hungry and caffeinated beverages taste terrible but that price is a small price to pay to be migraine free. And take in morning!! Will keep you awake at night!!!",

Yes, I've had the tingles and some facial twitches, I've lost about 20 lbs. and have trouble with word retrieval & memory... but is it worth it? Absolutely! I currently take 250 mg/day -- all at night to help minimize the noticeability of the side effects. A good option, IMO.",

When I got up to 75mg per day my brain fog was BAD, my anxiety sky rocketed, and I seemed to have more headaches. I've started to have panic attacks and have been scared to drive lately or even go to the store which is so unusual for me. I am also sleeping hours upon hours at a time and I am also getting tingling sensation in face and arm which is scaring the heck out of me. Going to stop taking without consulting doctor.",

I stopped taking it about two months ago because I was having kidney stone problems and thinking this medicine could be the reason why. In the two months I have gained 25lbs, I'm in so much pain I can't wrap my head around it, and my smoking is got in out of control. I had no idea this medicine could or was helping all my other issues so I'm going back on it to see if I loose the weigh, control my pain, stop smoking, Although kidney stones can be the most excruciating pain ever! I'd rather have that pain once a year than suffer every day in my other pain.",

I started 25mg/day at night for 7 days, moved up to 75mg after 3 weeks and remained there. Within 48 hours I was didn't have a headache at all, but was experiencing side effects of tingling fingers, no appetite and change in taste of foods/carbonated beverages. I did have a hard time concentrating, I'd get confused and would randomly slur words. I weighted 120-ish when I started and within a few months, was 110 or less. I did work out and noticed no matter how hard I pushed, I didn't sweat and randomly got dizzy. Side effects are no joke, but you adjust after a few weeks.",

My neurologist bumped me up to 75 mg to try to get rid of the last of my migraines, and then a few months later I noticed my hair was falling out just like it did each time when I was postpartum. I'll have to go back down on my dosage to see if that will make my hair come back or if I need to go off it altogether, but it will take years to grow my long hair out again. ;(",

After reading everyone's reviews I think I was put on way too much. I weighed about 125 and I got down to 108! I thought I looked great although many people said I looked too skinny. The con is that it made me feel very slow and I couldn't concentrate well. As I started to ween myself off of it, the headaches went away. I now weigh 135 and gained about 30 lbs since being off of it. I am considering going back on to lose weight.",

I started out on 50mg a night on Dec.21, 2014 and at that time I weighed in at 227 lbs per Doc scales. At my last check up on March 31st I weighed 203. And my migraines were reduced greatly. The thing was my body was starting to get use to the medication so they did have to up the dosage to help my migraines; I'm now on 100mg a night. The side effects subsided after about two months of taking the medication (slightly tingling in the fingers and feet from time to time, little foggy/forgetful).

The all over tingling is not as bad anymore but not have headaches every day, you have to weigh you options.",

This medicine worked in the beginning but slowly BAD side effects appeared, I became so depressed, I was angry and sexually numb. I lost my sense of taste all sodas starting tasting flat. I also lost 15 pounds very quickly and I am now underweight do to this medication. I would never recommend it but only as a last resort. There are far better options out there. After failed topamax I then was prescribed the extended release version of it \"Trokendi XR\" and it was a little better but again over time side effects started appearing. Beware because it seems good in the beggining then side effects! Withdrawals from this med are terrible! Migraines x10!",

We in the healthcare field call it \"Dopamax\" due to the side effects of forgetting things and making you dopey . I lost my insurance and had to stop it abruptly, which is oh-so-wrong. It should be tapered. The enormous downside to this drug--even generic--it its outrageous cost. Needless to say, I am suffering as much as I was before having taken it. I was titrated up to 400 mg/day, which is the maximum does recommended. On the other hand, my memory has returned.",

Over the last 6 years I've been titrated up to 300 mg and can tell you that this drug has helped tremendously. Initially I had common side effects, difficulty finding words, I lost weight about 20 pounds, and found that I had some tingling in my hands and feet. These issues generally resolved in time or I have just grown accustomed to them. For anyone who initially has issues with the side effects try and stick with the medicine for a little bit unless totally intolerable, it gets better.",

Finally I fired my pain doctor after he told me just to go \"cold turkey\" off of morphine (I wanted to stop taking it, but not exactly that way!). Life is so much better without daily pain medicines and I found a neurologist who took me all the way up to 400mg/day on Topamax. I did start to have some more weight loss and taste issues and sleepiness, but my migraines became much more manageable with Imitrex and much less frequent. That is down to maybe once a week from near daily.",
                    "Now in my late 50's, I have been a lifelong migraine sufferer. My new neurologist recommended Topamax (FDA approved for migraine therapy). I am going on week 3 with promising results...for the first time in years I am waking up to no headaches and am not getting headaches as the day wears on. I'm sleeping better. I am experiencing a slight problem with focus/concentration but am told that this side effect should subside over time. Providing the side effects are minimal and non-intrusive, I can see staying on this medication-I'm hopeful.",
                    "I'm taking Topamax 200mg daily for Bipolar Disorder and I love this medication. It's changed my life and made me able to function again where other medications for bipolar disorder has not! The only reason I did not give it a ten is because sometimes it still makes my face and lips go numb and I get a twitch on the left side of my face, but honestly, I'll take it compared to how horrible my life was before.",
                    "I do not recommend Topamax as a solution to migranes. Although it did help keep the frequency of the headaches down at first, in the long run, I had just as many migranes as usual and there were too many side effects to make it worthwhile. My short term memory was practically shot, my hands would tremor and go numb as some points, and i experienced irregular heartbeat, trouble focusing, and sleep issues.",
                    "I have been taking Topamax for about 2 full months now. I had a sudden onset of massive Migraine's.In one month alone I went 27 days with Migraine's, I was a nonfunctioning person. I ended up in the hospital for 2 days finally,I started taking this wonder drug!I have only had 2 bad Migraine's in 2 months.I am able to go to work and most of all function at home.I do find however that I have memory issues, and speech issues, ThankGod everyone around me is very understanding and we laugh about it.",

                    "Hi. I took the time to read every review and register. I have been on Topamax since May of '09 it is Dec.5th '09. I was put on Topamax after being taken to the Hospital for a TIA(mini stroke)due to complicated migraines. I don't really know how I feel about Topamax. I still get migraines a lot, and most of the side effects. I've lost 70 pounds. I am weak. But the banana tip is very helpful. My math is shot. And I stumble on my words. Short term memory is a loss. But I will give the medicine more time and try the banana's to help with the side effects. I take 150mg 2x's daily. I started at 25mg's. But I have other illness's that factor in. No one has mentioned TIA's. No one has this from their migraine's? Thanks for the info. It's all helpful.",
                    "I took Topamax for approximately 5 years with little trouble. I did have the metallic taste, and could not drink carbonated beverages. In July 2009, I had to quit Topamax due to a little published side effect, kidney stones. I was on a pretty large dose (600 mg). I had a 9mm Kidney stone and many many small stones. I take Keppra XR now. It prevents the seizures, but I have gained all the weight plus some that I had lost on Topamax, but no seizures or kidney stones.",
                    "I love Topamax! I can finally sit through school without getting a migraine. It might make concentrating a little more difficult, but no harder than trying to concentrate with a migraine! The only side effect I can complain about is the tingling in my hands and feet, but that usually only lasts about 15 min. I haven't experienced any hair loss (thank god)and I also can't complain about the appetite loss.",
                    "I was in a car accident with a head injury. I had intractable migraine and other headaches that came and went daily on top of that and three months after the accident my neurologist offered Topamax. It's been 9 months. I lost a lot of hair; I have the soda is flat thing; the pins and needles; and I have lost weight. I think the brain fog was not noticable because of the brain injury. It took care of my headaches immediately. I didn't mind the side effects. I ran out of it once and on day two had a seizure. I tried to titrate off recently and the migraine returned with a vengeance so I am still going to be taking it. I don't mind the side effects in comparison to the headache. Also-I use hypnosis for some of the side effects.",
                    "My neurologists prescribed me Topamax to prevent migraines 4 days ago. The first night I took the the pill I had HORRIBLE side effects (tingling and numbness for hours). The following night I decided to take my vitamins (which I didn't do the night before) and I didn't experience the same side effects. Not sure if it helped, but I make sure I take them every single day!! The only side effect that I get is slight tingling in my hands occasionally.",
                    "It helps a lot",
                    "I've been taking this medication for almost 2 years now and still get headaches. My doctor just keeps upping the dose apparently it's suppose to be one of the best medications in headache/migraine prevention out there. I also take blood pressure medication as well, so taking this with a fairly high dose should take them away completely, correct? Not completely.",
                    "I've been on topomax for 6 weeks now along with walking at least 2 to 3 miles a day sometimes skipping a day or two depending on the weather I'm 40lbs down. Appetite gone, smoothies are enough for me and no snacks. No side effects by the way. 50mg twice daily",
                    "Began taking Topamax in 2006. Before starting on Topamax migraines were lasting 4-5 days after onset; and frequency of approximately 3 times per month. I experienced some diarrhea which subsided after breaking dosage up throughout the day (200mg daily). Additionally, I have experienced weight loss (a significant amount 50lbs) I could not afford to lose. However, the weight loss has subsided as well. Upon beginning the medication I had trouble with recalling words and memory loss. At this juncture the side effects have since passed and so have the migraines. I experience 1-2 migraines quarterly. Topamax has been a life-saver for me. I had tried many other migraine preventatives to no avail.",
                    "This was prescribed for binge eating as I have mood disorder and I need to lose weight. The binge eating was causing me to go over my calorie plan. I have taken it for over 6 months. I have worked up to 200 mg a day. Never had any side effects and no help with appetite either.",
                    "I was diagnosed with bipolar depression about a year ago. I have been on topamax for that as well as migraine headaches for 8 to 9ish months now. The migraines went away, and I have lost about 40 pounds since taking Topamax! The only downfall is hair loss. I highly warn anybody taking this drug not to miss a dose or try weaning yourself off, because I have done both and ended up with very bad mood swings and will be crying on the floor one minute, then raging and angry, then it will be as if nothing happened.",
                    "I've found that Topimax has worked for me, I've lost 73 pounds still struggle with food consumption from time to time but I do find that it has a definite affect.",
                    "I only took Topamax 25mg 2x daily for 10 days before I could no longer take the side effects. I have suffered from almost daily migraines since I was 6 years old and have always resorted to OTC medicines to \"attempt\" to ease the pain. I have taken Imitrex to combat the pain and even resorted to Valium to knock myself out and sleep through it. When I heard about Topamax I was elated and it really does work at preventing migraines. However, within a few days I developed some side effects ranging from annoying to considering whether I should go to the ER: burning/stinging sensation when drinking soda, tingling feet, nausea, weight loss, memory loss, irregular heartbeat and passing out. I can't function like that. ",
                    "I was diagnosed bipolar 2 about 3 years ago. I am a 36 yr old female. I was originally given topamax 50mgs at night with seroquel 50mgs, as well as a variety of antidepressants and klonopin for anxiety. That worked great for awhile until it didn't and I weened myself off everything. DON'T DO THAT!! I had a horrible hypomanic episode followed by a 4 month depressive crash. I'm now on Latuda, Celexa, Klonopin, and my good buddy Topamax. I have had no serious side effects from Topamax. A little hair loss (more like extra hair in the brush) but it's only noticeable to me. Not bad. No word loss, no memory problems. I'm in grad school with a near 4.0 GPA. It helps me maintain my weight so the other meds don't affect me.",
                    "I have been taking Topamax now for ten years. I love it. It has controlled my seizures and the side effects are minimal. I still get tired but not as bad as the other drugs I have been on.",
                    "I'm giving it a 10 for the decrease of nerve pain and it saved my life truly. However, the weight loss? The only weight I lost was 17lbs walking my dog and Nutra System 2 years ago and gained back 5lbs of that when he got injured 3 months ago. This didn't help me lose one pound. I'm on 75mgs a day, started at 50. It did change my taste, I no longer like orange but does zero for weight loss which I was looking forward to since I have a good 30lbs to lose :) So big ups for the nerve pain and I had no idea it worked on migraines no wonder I hadn't had to have my migraine prescription filled in 2 years! So it has great benefits and I would highly recommend it for other issues but not weight loss. Good luck and happy new year all!",
                    "I started Topamax on August 18th and my life has changed! Today is September 2nd, two weeks without a migraine is a miracle. I'm on 50mg. At first I was having a hard time at work. Brain fog is an understatement. But I would say it's gone now. Within the first week my sensitivity to light disappeared. I actually started crying tears of joy while driving because I could finally see in the day time without migraine. And same thing at night. I don't have to turn the mirror up anymore. I can see! I occasionally get some tingling in my hands and feet but not bad at all. I will update again on my progress/side effect in a month or two. Good luck to everyone. This has been such a blessing for me.",
                    "My doctor prescribed me Topamax as a preventative measure for my common migraines. It helped with my headaches really well. I used to get migraines at least a dozen times a month and this medicine allowed me to only have 2 headaches in the month that I took it.  I stopped taking it, however, because I felt so out of it. I felt like a space cadet. It also made me very moody. Everything irritated and bothered me. I didn't think those feelings were worth continuing with the prescription.  I would suggest trying it, as those effects, from what I understand, are rare. And, I have to say that I didn't get migraines for a few months after I stopped taking it. So that was a bonus.  As a side note, it does make soft drinks taste 'flat'.",
                    "To be honest, I can't tell you if it helped with the prevention of migraines or not. I have had chronic migraines for 15 years now. They are accompanied by loss of feeling in my hands, aura, and sometimes my words come out as gibberish. I have tried just about everything from medications to natural remedies for my migraines. When my new neurologist suggested I take Topamax I thought that I would finally be rid of my migraines. I didn't even last a week on this medication though. I couldn't stand for more than thirty seconds without being dizzy and having shortness of breath. My stomach ached and I had a tingling sensation in my hands. I also had a slight fever. My doctor wanted to attribute all of these things to the start of a cold.",

My doctor started me on 25mg for the first week, Friday I ate breakfast at 8:30am and didn't eat again until 6:30pm! Even then I couldn't finish my meal. My soda tasted like dirt! No joke! Saturday I made peach cobbler I love cobbler! I ate four bites and threw the plate it tasted like dirt! I notice if I force myself to over eat I need a bathroom very fast! I did a one week weigh in this morning I started at 229.9 and today I weight 223.3! Total of 6.6 pounds! I take mine for headaches and migraines.. Today I start 25mg twice a day! Then move to 50mg twice a day next week! I'm excited about losing weight!!!!",

I will probably stick with the one pill because I am losing the weight. I do exercise 5 days a week also so this helps. This pill alone is not going to work you need to get moving just a little. Treadmill 20 minutes is all I do. You can do it!!!! Good luck...",

Dr has me at 50 mg once daily and I take it in the evening. I literally eat half of what I previously did. I lost about three pounds over the course of a week..no excercise involved. Im not counting calories; just not interested in junk food. I read a poster on another forum to take extra B complex and Biotin to avoid any hair loss as the drug seems to deplete that nutrient in the body. Will post again in another few weeks with more information. I was at the point where I was considering surgery because I had tried everything.",

I am able to eat very small portions and have full control over myself. I have changed to healthy eating. Less bread and pasta. More brown rice, veggies, sweet potatoes. I still fry veggies in olive oil. Still eat a baked potato sometimes. But cut way back on portions and added snacks between meals. Then every 3 days I be sure to eat something a little more fattening and it makes me lose weight. For salad dressing, oil and vinegar with seasoning packet. No sweet tea etc. Lots of water.

At first I would get a tingling feeling in my fingers and toes (like soda fizz), but it went away once my body was used to the drug. Recently, my pharmacy switched me to the generic version and I hated it. Immediately that first day, I would get crazy headaches, feel dizzy, sick to my stomach and I couldn't concentrate on anything. I went back to my neurologist and got a new prescription for brand name only and have not had any problems since.

Struggled to breathe (had to breathe deeply with each breath and even took an inhaler to see if that would help). I felt disoriented, dizzy, and like I was walking under water with blurry vision. I was extremely lethargic and had trouble climbing a flight of stairs without getting winded. I was having sharp pains throughout my body (breasts, stomach & back). My heart felt like it was beating really hard (not fast, just through my chest). My face and arms were tingling. I had a really bad taste at the back of my mouth and everything I ate/drank tasted weird. I'd prefer the migraine.",

I suffer from PTSD, Anxiety/Panic, & Mood Disorder. Although it doesn't do a thing for my anxiety or panic the difference in my mood is like night and day. I can not believe how calm and patient I have become already taking this medication. It has saved my life & the people around me!!",

I also have generalized anxiety with panic attacks for which I take Lexapro for over 10 years. My psychiatrist suggested that I may have something similar to \"The Kindling Effect\" rather than explosive disorder. He asked me if I'd like to give Topamax a try. I said sure why not! He started me on 25 mg twice a day. Within five days I noticed a difference for the better. I can handle my mood much better, I can handle situations much better, and I have not had any explosive episodes at all in five months! To me this drug is a miracle. To finally find something that keeps me balanced and able to regulate my emotions without going to extremes is an absolute miracle! I love it!",

The last time I took Topamax it stopped the cluster within a week. I continued working up to the full dose and the side effects gradually decreased (confusion, hard to concentrate, difficulty with finding the words to express my thoughts). I found that a lower dose kept the headaches away so I dropped down for a few months then came off the drug completely. Last week a new cluster started so I am back on the Topamax and have had a couple of headache free days already. This medication works well for me at a lower dose and limits the side effects.",

Over time I got used to it & couldn't find something to help w/my binge eating disorder. I gained all the weight I lost & more over a 5yr period of trying to lose it/find the right meds to help. 2012 17 y/o tried topamax & had bad anxiety so that didn't last long. 2015 20 y/o I weighed 248lbs, the biggest I've been.

Decided to try topamax again (50mg 2x a day) along w/vyvanse (ADHD/binge eating, 70mg) & lexapro (depression, 20mg). Currently 160lbs.

I ate less but I was still eating close to what I ate before being on the medicine. I think it must speed up your metobolism. I had some mood changes and I did have a little memory loss. I would forget words and things like that. I work with people so I noticed it more because people would point it out. My hands/feet tingled. I noticed less side effects when I took the medicine at night. I only take 50mg at night, that's all I ever have taken and it works for me.

Literally! Because I was contemplating suicide, the pain was that bad and nothing else was working for me. I have lost a little weight in the first couple of months and I also have some trouble finding common words while speaking, but otherwise I did not experience any other side effects so far.

In case that I do binge on Topamax, my binges consists of less food when. And I eat slower, defeated by the situation.",

When I first started on Topiramate I couldn't think straight and couldn't remember some words so I immediately started taking it at night only instead (with my dr's approval) and that got rid of all of those problems. I was EXTREMELY hyper on 50mg per day. I'm talking EXTREMELY!!! But as soon as I switched to 75mg the hyperactivity stopped. Moving to 100mg tonight.",
                    "I have been battling my weight since I was pregnant with my first son, who just turned 2. I was 165 when I got pregnant with him, and on the day I went in to have my second son (who is 5 months old today) I weighed 270. I just took my first 25 mg dose of Topamax last night. I am addicted to Diet Dr. Pepper and can't even stand the taste. Not hungry either, so I'm hopeful that this medicine will work. I also take Celexa and Tenuate. I don't know if it's the combination, or just the Topamax, but I am feeling kind of \"floaty\" today, in a sense. Maybe this will improve with time.",
                    "I originally started on Topamax for Migraines and found it to be a 10 for that. I went from 4-5 monthly to maybe 2-3 per year. Life changing! It was difficult for my body to adapt to at first and I had to build up VERY slowly using 12.5mg for a few weeks in the morning and then adding an evening dose, etc. It made me feel horrible, tired, breathless, out of sorts and dopey overall but over time all that wore off and in addition to the absence of migraines I enjoyed a more even keel mood, more control over my decision making including less desire for alcohol. This made staying sober easier than at previous attempts. I also struggled less with eating issues. I've had to increase over time and take breaks/restart to manage the dosage amount vs tolerance.",
                    "There are a few ways to get rid of one of the most annoying side effects, the tingling hands and feet. Potassium- I used to eat a banana or drink fruit juice high in potassium. All of my side effects went away after 2 yrs on Topamax. It is hard to ween off of. I have not taken a pill for 2 mths and have far less headaches than before Topamax!! Great drug! I lost almost 30lb but once we found the right dosage I leveled out and stayed that weight for a yr before weening off.",
                    "I have ADD and with that I have no self control over food, I've battled weight my entire adult life. My psychiatrists prescribed me topiramate, it's been 5 days today and I'm down 8.5 pds. Side effects are I feel pretty weak doing everything, fatigue, I've been getting hot a lot and I work outside. I just hope and pray these issues go away because the topiramate really works great controlling the cravings. I'm never hungry I love it.",
                    "I started on Topiramate originally due to headaches and as a extra incentive, help with my eating/ weight loss. The product helped with both but I was left always forgetting stuff, feeling out of focus all the time, and had a constant tingle (like when you move your foot when its been asleep for a loooong time) in my hands and feet. I've thought about giving it another go due to my weight gain but just don't feel its worth those side effects because it interfered in my every day function and work.",
                    "This is the 2nd time in 10 yrs a neurologist has put me on Topomax. I am on 125 mg a day. The side effects are horrible and the migraines are worse than ever. Neuro refuses to take me off it after I have told him I do not like this drug or its many side effects. I was told I was a lost cause.",
                    "Had cognitive thought and short term memory loss issues. ",
                    "Until three months ago I thought I had tried it all. My doctor mentioned Topamax in a follow-up and asked if I'd be willing to try one more time. (I'd about given up) I had just happened to be recovering from a horrific migraine from the night before that had me down with my ice packs and my trusty bucket for nine hours. So I said, \"Yes, gimme!\" I'm still trying to decide if it was the best decision... My goal was 100mg a day, I haven't made it beyond 50mg yet. My side effects are tingling hands/feet, brain fog, thirsty ALL THE TIME, hot flashes, and forgetfulness. I went from 2-3 migraines weekly to about that monthly. So it DOES help, but the side effects are ridiculous and they aren't going away. It's choosing the lesser of two evils.",
                    "I'm going into my third week on Topamax. For the twelve years previous to this medication, I was treated vigorously for clinical depression. (Clearly, to no avail.) My 'mood spikes' as my husband and I lovingly call them are already beginning to subside. My toes, fingers and nose do tingle, and now that my dose is doubled (third week, time to titrate up), I'm definitely losing my appetite. (I have a few pounds to spare, so I'm not mad about it!) I hope to update this page again in a month or so to let you know how the medication is going then. After being on every anti-depressant the market has ever seen, it's a God-send to have FINALLY been pointed in the right direction. (I'm 30 years old, married with a 2 year old).",
                    "I've been on Topamax since 2010. I started taking 50 mg but I was given the generic and had a really bad allergic reaction to it. My skin broke out and I had to see a dermatologist. I was eventually given Topamax (the brand name) and I no longer had the allergic reaction. The 50 mg wasn't strong enough and eventually I ramped up to 200 mg. I had weight loss in the beginning (close to 90 lbs, which I could afford). I've gained about 20 of it back but I've not lost any since. I do feel that I get somewhat spacey and suffer from some memory loss. I've asked my doctor if I can come off of the medication beginning next year. I've been on it too long and I am concerned with the memory side effects.",
                    "I've been on 50 mg of brand Topamax for two years and the cognitive impairment is significant. I often forget how to spell my last name, I don't remember events of just yesterday, and I can't spell anything anymore for the life of me. I take it for Rapid Cycling Bipolar I & went off it for two weeks to attempt to get my cognition back - by about the 6th day I started to show signs of mania and by day 8 I was full blown manic with psychosis. I'd do anything to get off this brain mush of a drug but it serves a purpose. Oddly, I never went into psychosis until this drug. Oh, and the days that passed without Topamax lead to the worst headaches ever. Buyer beware.",
                    "Great and also losing the weight from the previous medicines I was on. Love it.",
                    "Hi I have been taking these pills for 5 weeks now for weight loss I do struggle . Specialist trying to see if it's my metabolism... I'm On 25mg he has not mentioned anything about higher dose but I have not been able to sleep !!! It's driving me crazy now . Was wondering if any of you had the same experience? I do feel so tired and lethargic but it's so late before I get any sleep then I'm waking up mid afternoon missing my days I've tried getting up early going out walking etc like today still no luck . I suffer with mental health problems and was dubious about taking them at first but read a lot on your feedback that it's helped some people.I just hope this depression is through my sleep pattern and not the med .",
                    "I was diagnosed with bipolar seven years ago and have basically been on Topamax along with Welbutrin the whole time. I have not really experienced the weight loss. I do feel fatigued and have been feeling very angry lately. I also feel sort of zombied out.",
                    "I was diagnosed with ocular migraines. I could not drive without getting sick and see correctly. I was prescribed topamax 2 weeks ago. I am a taking 25 mg in am/pm and and I am down 4.5 lbs. I did not know this was a weight loss drug too until I saw I lost weight. For me, it's a bonus. I just want to be able to drive and not be sick.  At work, I have to be careful what I type in emails because I have a dopey effect but I can deal with that as long as I function in other areas of my life. I have noticed beer does not taste good so I cannot drink that any longer. I thought it was bad beer until I read something about how our brains are functioning differently on topamax .",

                    "Topamax is by far the best migraine preventative I have ever tried. I take 100mg at night and have even been on 200mg - 1 100mg in the AM and 1 100mg in the PM. My neurologist and I discussed Topamax and figured it was worth a shot since my chronic, daily migraines were uncontrollable and I was getting Imitrex injections almost every week and could no longer take Toradol. Unlike other people, I have very few side effects. I weaned off Topamax once to try Gabapentin but it by itself wasn't enough and my migraines returned full force. Very few side effects: trouble finding words, thirst, and weight lose (not that I mind). Topamax is a wonderful drug and a LIFESAVER. It and my Gabapentin together is my divine combo!",
                    "After my first pill I felt like I was going to die on this medicine. My mind blacked out. I could not think clearly. I collapsed. I could not remember anything. I could not feel my body. I could not walk. It was terrifying. I was home alone. It was not a good experience!",
                    "I've tried in twice. First time about 7 years ago and lost a modest amount of weight easily. I can't remember how much. It made me thirst, so I drank a lot of water and it took away my craving for junk food.  Send time was end of May, 2016. 100mg at night. I lost 10 pounds in about 5-6 weeks easily. No desire to snack or eat emotionally. Only downside was that I was anxious a lot. I've now plateaud but at least I'm not gaining weight. I should try to up the dose. At least the anxiety has largely decreased.",

I finally seen a psychiatrist for my ADD symptoms and while he was modifying my medication he diagnosed me with binge eating disorder. To my surprise he was right. I had no control. I had always bounced on diets. He started me on Topamax 25mg and I knew instantly it will work. It has a calming affect. I feel so full and I am going to bed without eating for the first time in years. I am very thankful. Not every medication is for everyone. I am pleased with this one so far.",
                    "I took this medicine because I was having severe headaches every day and tried everything my Doctor put me on Topamax it will take your headaches away and remove the weight I never felt bad but I had a hard time remembering simple things as coworkers names, what measuring cup to use for wet and dry items I could never remember the words I needed to carry on a conversation. I stop taking this medication because I could not function at my place of employment not to mention the short term memory loss & loosing my hair was crazy. I truly think that so many people get caught up with being able to stay so thin that they keep taking it. I took 50mg morning and 50mg @ night. Not worth it.",
                    "I love this medicine. My Dr originally gave it to me for weight loss but it got rid of all my joint pains. I had it everywhere. It was a miracle drug for me. I am noticing some memory loss, and difficulty concentrating but I'm 52 so it could be age. I'm going to cut back on the dosage and see if I notice changes.",
                    "I'm ultra-ultra rapid cycling bipolar II and bul. been thru 6 mood stabilizers / APs / AAPs. My experience on those was disastrous.Lithium made me more suicidal, lamictal made me binge, destroyed my memory, didn't help my mood, seroquel put 20 #s on me and made me a zombie, didn't help my mood, latuda and abilify made me shake. I was terrified of weight gain on depakote/valproate/risperdal. I was at my wit's end, suicidal, and terrified that I wasn't going to live to my 33rd birthday, then I found NIH considers Topamax to be a mood stabilizer so I asked my pdoc about it. Within a week at 50 mgs I had a full day where I didn't cycle at all. I woke up feeling okay and stayed that way all day. I didn't cycle at all. Things are looking good!",

I started when I was 18 it was the first drug my Dr tried...I am almost 28 and I am so upset looking back that I didn't ask more q's or realize that this was the issue. I started at a min dose but I was eventually up to 300mg/day. I thought nothing of this because if the Dr wasn't worried, why should I be? I had been to 3 different Dr that never asked me if at that dose I was having memory problems, etc. I don't remember anyone telling me the major side effect was memory problems, brain fog, etc no kids... I went through college thinking there was something wrong with me My new Dr has put me on something else that is safe if my husband and I get pregnant. She also was in shock that for migraine prevention I was taking such a big dose.",

Now trileptal makes me drowsy enough and I have never had an issue with caffeine and stress before; but out of now where I got a horrible under eye twitch that lasted for (3-4) DAYS. It happened every week through out the 6 months. So I new it was related to the medication. Next was the trouble in speech, not being able to find the right word, stuttering or repeating myself. My short term memory was gone. I would have random pins and needles through out my legs which was probably the only tolerable side effect of the symptoms I had.",

Side effects=food tastes yucky, expecially my beloved sodas and rockstar energy drinks. Im loosing too much weight (Ive always struggled w being too skinny). But i feel better than i can ever remember feeling in 20yrs. i hope it continues, the side effects are worth it.",
                    "I have used Topamax off and on for the past 5 years. Off (due to pregnancies.) I am once again on and love the drug. Although the side effects are something to get used to, tingling in the hands, etc., those can be corrected with the correct dosage. The best side effect is the weight loss which certainly helps. My migraines have completely gone away. I have been a migraine sufferer since I was 5 years old (some 27 years). Topamax is a wonder drug!!",
                    "I took Topamax for 2 months until I finally threw in the towel and could take no more. It did stop the migraines but the other side effects were horrible. I did have the tingling in my hands, feet, and lips and food did taste way different. I was so depressed I could barely even get out of the bed. I actually GAINED about 5 lbs. while I notice most everyone else lost weight. I cried everyday for a week straight and I'm not like that. My house was a wreck and I could barely help my son with his homework. ",

It stopped the ultradian mood cycling that occurred when they upped my lamotrigine up to 200mg, and it stopped the self-harming urge. It did, in combination with other things, cause kidney stones, but alone did not. It helped quite a bit in stabilizing moods, and I'm just upping to 100mg/night. It did a lot for me, and I'm glad my psych put me on it. I don't want to come off. No weight gain. Even some weight loss. I wasn't expecting it, but I am certainly not sad about it. I'd recommend it, but of course, everyone has different brain chemistry, as noted with my experience with Abilify. <== Nope.",

Doc started me on 50 mg. Slowly working up to maximum dose over 30 days. I didn't like the 1st 3 days. Feel disoriented, dingy, irritable. I've lost 8 lbs in 3 weeks which is fine since my weight contributes to my hypertension which contributes to my migraines. My doc & I plan to take me off Topiramate as I lose weight & get healthier. Right now I can tolerate the negatives.",

Its also helped me as a mood stabilizer too, I would recommend this medication if over the counter drugs aren't working for your migraines it really does wonders",

Almost all of these disappeared after 3ish months. I am left with a somewhat reduced appetite, occasional pins & needles and I can't drink fizzy drinks. Weight loss was short lived. Effect on migraines was instant and measurable - reduced severity/frequency. Not to zero, but to a more manageable level. I am left with regular headaches, which I now think are Medication Overuse Headaches which will pass as I reduce painkiller use. I still get menstrual migraines which can be tricky to shift, but with sumatriptan I can usually cope.",

Then I began to notice side-effects that made me anxious to get off of it. My fingernails became really thin, I was depressed and my hair was really was falling. I was taking 600 mg of Topamax which sounds like more than a lot of people but I found out online that many other people experienced the same symptoms on lower doses. I had to ween myself off Topamax and am starting Elavil. ",

For one year I had constant vertigo and I honestly thought I would become housebound. I could not go to theatres, malls, stores, or any areas with lots of people because crowds would make me dizzy. My work was in jeopardy. I tried Topamax and it gave me my life back. The initial side effects were awful but my body slowly adjusted to them. Eventually, the dizziness went away. I now take 225 mg daily. I have some word finding and concentration problems but that sure beats 24/7 vertigo.",

I have to watch this because as being in the medical field I know there are different side effects but the main two are diarrhea and anorexia. The diarrhea I maybe can deal with but I'm not made to be anorexic. I like a little meat on my bones. So just watch your weight side effects",

I ended up staying on it for about 2 years before my weight was stuck between 125 lbs and 128 lbs (I am a 6ft tall woman!), my morning 5-8 mile run had completely disappeared and I would have liked nothing more than to curl up and die.

I became socially anxious/awkward and still am. I developed a strange curry-like smell to me. I stopped when I fell pregnant and put on 24kg's, still holding on to 9kg's.

I have never not been able to finish anything seriously I love food.

The tingling goes away after a week. hot flashes - too young for this! Mentally in a better place-I was in a depressive funk before taking it. Cleared my head a bit - I actually want to get better now and am walking/making an effort b/c I'm able to b/c my pain is manageable. I still get random shooting pains, but not as harsh.

He is taking me off of it because it's doing nothing for the migraines. I gave it a 3 more for the lack of help for the migraines versus the side effects, since I'm not sure if it's the drugs, the Lupus, or something else.

                    "I've been taking Topamax since 1/2015 for Migraines suggested from my Doctor. She said it was a little pricey. If you don't have insurance I would recommend websites where you print out coupons and take them to the pharmacy they saved me $188.00 for Topamax ! No kidding. Anyways. Topamax works good. I did loss 7 lbs my 1st week, I ended up losing a total of 20 lbs in 3 mos. been steady since. I'm still taking Topamax 6mos later. I'm looking into other options as I can not take the Side effects, loss of hair, tingling of my Feet, hands, legs,, face, odd places on my body, mood swings, I'm very irritable, I don't recognize myself. I need a change.",
                    "Having migraines since grade 7, I became desperate after trying almost everything else. My experience was as follows: -insomnia (literally didn't sleep for almost 40 hours after Day 1) -eye pressure & leaking eyes -tingling in arm, foot & nose -restlessness -urinating up to 60 times a day -overheating/heat surges -face & neck hives -mechanically/cognitively not ok In the end, I wound up in the emergency room and was told to get off of this medication immediately after only 3 days!!! It's 3 days since my last dose and I am still not ok! Very dangerous and not recommended at all!",

I guess I am one of the few that do but I did therefore, I am seeking other drugs. As most have stated, my taste changed and anything with carbonation was terrible for the longest time. I eventually pushed through the changes and now everything pretty much tastes the way it should be on the medicine. I have allergies so the headaches I experience are mostly caused by that (which is why I think I have been pushed up to 200mg a day). Just a forewarning to everyone... When they say drink water DRINK!",

So far I have had the numb/tingling extremities and what seems to be a bit of a brain fog (trouble focusing,recalling words) I also noticed that soda doesn't taste the same. I drank one today and it was HORRIBLE! I also feel really lightheaded. I am determined to ride this one out for as long as possible, though. I've tried most other medications without success so this really is my last hope.",

I was in a treatment center when I was younger for a while, nothing really helped my bulimia. Therapy, nutritionists etc. All the work, DBT everything..honestly it wasn't until I started slowly on this medication. Now on 100mg and taking it with Wellbutrin XL 150mg (I also suffer from other issues) I find myself doing ALOT better..I'm seeing a nutritionist too along with therapy but really my medication has helped. Its great.",

Started in June now it's sept and I weigh 170. After 2 and 1/2 months the doc raised it to 100mg. And now it doesn't seem to be working as well. She raised it again to 150mg so I'll see how that works out . I still want to lose 20 more pounds. My insurance didn't pay for it but I did find a coupon on line and it saved me aot.",

She put me on Trokendi XR and told me it would help with the binge eating and OMG has it! Not only has it changed the taste of foods, where before foods I would normally eat all of in one sitting, I now only eat a literal serving size of and don't physically want anymore, and most times don't even want to eat unless I'm physically hungry. I HIGHLY recommend trying this instead of surgery or letting them put you in a hospital if you an overeating problem. Surgery should be a LAST resort! Good luck to all! <3",

No major side effects, slight tingles, slight off balance, slightly more sensitive to light overall, slightly slowed thinking once in a while, feel slightly twitchy. No hair loss, no weight loss. 6 weeks in, went from 2-3-4 headaches a week to 3 in 6 weeks. So far, so good. Do I like it? Well, yes and no.

The side effects I had were horrible, I couldn't even force my self to eat more than a few bites of food for the whole day, I was in a constant fog, it was like I had smoked a bunch of weed, I was tired all the time, my speech was like I was drunk, I couldn't remember anything and I had severe mood swings I would go from perfect happy to wanting to beat the living daylights out of someone for no reason, after a few months of it I had had enough and my primary took me off of it but I had to slowly decrease the dosage so it took about 6 weeks,",

This medication did not get rid of the headaches but I experienced some of the worst headaches ever while on this drug. I felt alright during the day, but once evening time rolled around I was so grouchy, so moody, tired, and my head was throbbing. I kept taking the medication because I just thought it needed time to \"make its way into my body.\" Finally, I said enough is enough and asked my doctor if I could stop taking it. I have not taken a pill in two days and am still experiencing the awful migraines. I am so miserable and have not felt like myself for a week and a half.",

I started for one week taking 25 mg in the morning and 25 mg in the evening. Now I take 50mg in the morning and 50 in the evening. Im also eating right veggies and fruits and snacks. This medication is making me lose at least 13 lbs since Jan. 5, 15 and today I'm 276.0 and its Jan. 19, 2015. in that short amount of time that's a good amount of weight to drop.

I am now up to 75 in the morning and at bedtime and I still have the tingling but the fog has been lifted the headaches are SO much less BUT I have only lost 3 pounds.

I had not read any of these reviews, and after my very first dose, I had a carbonated drink and it tasted flat on the front of my tongue, but burned the back! I thought it was a fluke, but, it happened today, too. This will definitely help me drink more water! I have started having tingly fingers and toes, but no other symptoms, yet. I already have brain fog due to menopause, so I'm a little worried about that! I have been having 4 or 5 migraines per week lately and I take sumitriptan for them which usually works.

The pain had finally gotten so bad that even those weren't working. I work in Pre-K and didn't want to give up my job to become a disabled person living at home on pain killers. I found an awesome Doctor who understood that I didn't want to live on those types of medications.

Tried to give this a chance and it gave me nothing but a terrible time, almost like being unmedicated with a constant dead leg&arm, UGH.

I do experience the metal taste, some tingling in my hands and feet, tiredness, blurred vision, some diarrhea but these are few and far between, my weight is stabilized and not many problems with sleep.

I had boundless energy, no appetite, and was always in a good mood. After two years, I decided to stop taking it because my skin was breaking out and I think I felt a little too confident in myself. I drove a little faster, said really odd things to people (no filter) and seemed to be turning into a show off about how skinny I was. Not my best personality!

The first side effect you will experience is sleepiness, don't fight it. Let your body get a nap between 1-3, which I found to be the best time. I sleep for 1 hour and still can fall asleep at night. I am 21 now. Some advice to you, whenever you don't feel like eating I found that sweet tea gets me hungry, find that X factor in you. The weight loss is insane. I lost 40 pounds in 6 months just by breathing. Now, sleep patterns are important. If an average person needs 8 hours you and I need 9-10 MINIMUM also try to take the dose at the same time every day, you will fall asleep faster. Hang out to see sunrise.",

I'm a nurse and for the one or two out of control migraines per year I use injectable Toradol. That is a miracle medicine. No more Emergency department for me.

I became face blind, could not navigate my way around even with a map, memory difficulties. issues doing simple math, became asexual & had no motivation to interact with people. Towards the end of my time on topamax I was so depressed that I would just sit despondently. I switched doctors and she immediately stopped it.

By 7pm I could not see my children's faces, by 9pm I was in ER /A&E with almost total loss of vision.  Topamax can cause Acute Angle Closure.

Hasn't helped my migraines at all either. It does though not make me hungry at all. I have to force myself to eat because I know I have too. I don't see myself taking this medication long term.

I was shocked I had gotten back down to numbers I haven't seen since I was a teen. 119-123. I'm 5'2\" so to me that's perfect. Food is never on my mind unless my stomach starts growling. I forget to eat. This drug is great for people who have problems with weight. I don't get any other side effects. It doesn't make me a zombie. I take 50mg near bed time. I know it's for seizures & migraine. Sometimes mood. NEEDS TO BE FOR WEIGHT LOSS TOO. highly recommended!!",
                    "After my second baby I had an increase in hormonal migraines and tension headaches and my neurologist put me on topomax starting @ 25 per night until I got a final dose of 100mg split between am /pm. Initially I noticed a lot of tingling in hands, feet & face, in week 2 a very tense jaw, I still feel like myself, but I feel more tired. I dont need to nap or anything during the day but at night i have NO trouble sleeping .All of the pain in my head disappered I thought it was amazing but I did get 2 hormonal headaches (not migraine strength) all in all not bad. I eat a dinner meal only and drink water all day long this med just makes me not want food. Weightloss:10kgs in 3 months.. I have no depression just tiredness its not fixed by naps",
                    "I took this medication for about 2 weeks hoping it would help my hypo mania . Some members of my family said it helped them. NOPE! Complete DISASTER for me. I could not stay on this thing for a month! The loss of appetite really sucked but I expected that I thought maybe I could look past that. But l went from 120 to 117 in 5 days. It did not help my mood it only made me dizzy and gave me uncontrollable jerky movements. I was forgetting words. I could not concentrate in school (senior in high school) Everything felt like a dream. I basically became really stupid. I was seeing flashing lights. It was bad. Once I got off of it everything I felt much smarter and better. I had many adverse effects to this medication.",
                    "Had migraines for 7 years. Take Fioricet for pain, which works well, but I wanted to try prevention. My doctor had already tried Gabapentin, Sumatriptan, and Propranolol, all of which had side effects but did nothing for migraines. Next came Topamax. Side effects were: Slight change of taste (sodas tasted flat, bread tasted sweeter), and gradual loss of memory and concentration, such that it was hard to read or study an issue at work and be able to understand it. It did not affect my eating habits or energy levels, did not affect my weight at all. It also did nothing for my migraines. It severely impeded my ability to think and thus my ability to work in the tech field, so I stopped taking it, and my work performance improved drastically.",
                    "Following on from previous comment, I forgot to mention this medication is working wonders for my alcohol dependency. I used to drink an entire bottle of wine a night, now I have one or two very small glasses! It's incredible for someone with a long documented history of alcohol abuse. Marvellous stuff!",
                    "I was taking 3- 25mg in the morning and 3 in the afternoon for about a year , after I started taking the pills I started to lose weight. In a year I went from 172 to 152lbs and I started to have problems remembering things, I stop talking them and now the doctor is switching me to botox and I'm thinking about it. but the pills did worked, I was getting less headaches",
                    "Minimal side effects, some tingling in hands and feet, some \"topamax moments\"...trouble finding words to complete sentences, etc. Did experience a 30 lb. weight loss, which I didn't mind. But most of all it drastically decreased the migraines!! And if I do have one, it is very managable.",
                    "This is one of the medicines I cycle through for my migraine control. My body gets \"used\" to them, so about every 4-6 months I have to change drugs. Fortunately I can rotate back after about a year off. This is one of my favorites, because the side effects don't interfere too much with my day-to-day life. Tingling in the hands and feet, decreased appetite, and a bit of increased anxiety (but manageable). For me, the benefits of having my migraines under control (ones that went on for days and weeks, 7-9 scale pain on a regular basis), far outweigh the cost of the side effects.",
                    "I switched from generic topiramate 50mg. TID (three times a day) to brand Trokendi XR 200mg (once daily) because I and my psychiatrist believed plasma levels would remain comparable to TID dosing due to Microtrol technology. My PDOC decided that a 50mg increase was fine. It sure was! I am indicated for topiramate for the following reasons: A. Bipolar Disorder; topiramate acts as a mood stabilizer. B. Drug Cravings; topiramate reduces my urge to use drugs, studies are directed at its propensity to reduce alcohol and stimulant cravings C. Anxiety: topiramate is a GABA agonist and slightly anxiolytic D. Weight loss Trokendi XR is far superior and smoother than generic topiramate when it comes to amelioration of symptoms. 10/10.",
                    "Once I got past the side effects while titrating up to my standard dosage, I love it! The side effects were rough, but you MUST start with a low dose and work up gradually, I would suggest not more than 50mg a week, until you reach your target dose. I loved that it took also away my over- stitmulated appitete and I was able to reduce my BMI to 24.",

When Imitex came out I thought that was a lifesaver and it was, I used to get a migraine and have to go home and hide under the covers for a day or two but Imitex isn't a preventive like Topamax. The only side effects were in the first 2 weeks with subtle numbness and tingles and loss of short term memory. The longer side effect has been the weight loss but I had been overweight by 20 lbs anyway so this has been a blessing! I look great and have only had a few minimal headaches since June.",
                    "I started taking this medicine several weeks ago with a combination of Celexa for my depression. The side effects are unwelcome and welcome all in the same time. I have memory loss and can't find the the right words when I'm speaking to people. I feel tired during the day, but at night I'm wide awake. My nails have become thinner, so has my waist line. I've struggled with my weight since I was young, [I'm 17 and I started these pills at 260lbs. I'm now at 231lbs]. These pills make me feel like food is the enemy. I'm also having decreased sensitivity during sex.",

The side effects from this one wore off for me after about 2 months..you gotta stick through it to get used to it, once you do it's totally worth it. I went from having almost daily headaches and weekly severe migraines to maybe 1 migraine every couple of months that even then it was very minimal. Totally worth trying!",
                    "I've been taking Topamax for a little over a year. When I first started taking it I experienced terrible side effects for about three to six months. They killed me especially with my grades. I couldn't focus in school, but it worked wonders with my migraines. I will get one every once in a while but hardly ever, plus I lost like twenty pounds. Totally worth it to be migraine free.",
                    "I took topiramate for approx 3 months before I refused to continue with the therapy. The side effects (peripheral neuropathy, inability to remember anything, altered taste of just about everything, insomnia were not worth suffering through. So I'm still going through an adjustment. As of right now, I have been taking propranolol for a month and have not had a migraine (was getting 1-2 a week previously).",
                    "Took my first dose of 25mg on a Wednesday evening, that Thursday morning I woke up with nausea and diarrhea that only became more severe as the day went on. Had to leave work due to the severe nausea. Went to sleep around 2 p.m. and didn't wake up until 1 p.m. Friday. The only benefits I can say I had were the loss of weight (159lbs at appointment on Thursday/ 155.5lbs on Sunday) and I was able to quit smoking as I didn't have the urge to.",
                    "I take Topamax for my hemiplegic migraines, suppressed appetite is just an added bonus. I have noticed a tingle in my finger tips and cheeks on and off but it doesn't bother me enough to stop taking. My headaches are down from waking up with one everyday, to maybe one once a week and one migraine a month. I'm take 100 mg at night, I was tired for the first few weeks but built a tolerance to it. Carbonated beverages do taste flat to me now, I'm glad to read this has happened to others as well, I thought I was going crazy. Hoping now that I'm up to 100mg that I will begin to lose more weight, I have noticed a surpressed appetite, eating much less of my meals, and have less of a \"sweet tooth\" which is a big deal for me",
                    "I've been struggling with an eating disorder and weight loss for years! Not eating all day, binging, and getting rid of it all. I was put on topamax to attempt to get rid of these urges. The first week in topomax I was on 25mg in the morning and 25mg at night and had minimal side effects and no effect on my appetite and no weight loss . I did however have bad diarrhea and was a bit 'slow' I bumped it up to 50mg morning and 50mg night the next week with the same results, but no side effects ( felt like I was taking sugar pills) Feeling annoyed.... the next week I bumped it up to 100mg am and 100mg pm and I was amazed!! Immediately my cravings for sweets went away completely! I did not want to binge! Now I'm eating small healthy meals and losing weight! Love it",

I switched from amitriptyline to topamax for my migraines due to the previous medicine not doing it's job as well. Within the week of taking the new medicine I became completely unable to sleep at night, upset stomach 24/7 and an a horrible level of unquenchable thirst. The no sleep was the worst part; I'm usually a pretty great sleeper, so going from 7-8 hours of sleep a night to maybe 3-4 hours a night was rough on my physical and emotional self. I was advised to stop the medicine tonight by my doctor and cannot wait to return to myself. I even still had migraines while on this medicine. Would not recommend.",

If there was any cognitive difficulty, memory loss, difficulty remembering words, etc., I didn't notice, as it was worse when I was experiencing a migraine. Before taking Topamax I would have a headache for months, with no relief. After I started taking Topamax the migraines were down to 3 month. My Dr. started me on a dose of 25mg, 2 X day and titrated me to 100mg 2 X day. Unfortunately, the Topamax no longer seems to be effective and on my next visit I will ask my Dr. to either increase the dosage or to prescribe a different medicine. Also, I have to agree with another post I saw, I am always freezing!",

But I work my ass off and do my wifely/motherly/grandma duties. So I didn't realize how truly bad off I was till for some reason decided to try it when offered it . I'm actually a lil more comfortable in social atmospheres now than I ever have! I can get up with a plan and actually get stuff done! There was an invisible wall blocking me. I have a lot of pain that I can't afford to look into further tho. So far so good. The pins and needles suck.",

I've dropped the 25mg tablet from my original 75mg dose (now on 50mg morning and 75mg evening) and I cannot believe how much the \"fog\" has lifted. I am just so happy, I could cry. I already feel like some of the confusion has started to clear and for the first time in ages, I can see and think clearly. My aim is come off this medicine completely and find another way to tackle the migraines. Here's hoping! Best wishes to you all.",

I went through many different trials of treatment & nothing worked, so finally the headache specialist gave me Vicodin. It worked and I was able to begin living life again. Then a new MD took the Vicodin away and gave me Topamax. MY LIFE WAS HELL. I live alone in a 2 story house and I had to scoot up/down on my butt. I am 66 & disabled (from strokes) and I was terrified. I could barely form sentences, I had terrible brain fog, I couldn't cook a meal as I was so confused I kept burning things. It was horrible. The doc told me to keep taking it but I refused, I felt the side effects were too dangerous for me.",

I only take 50mg and have side effects, word retrieval issues, sleepiness, balance issues, etc. But it is the only one I can take that my stomach can tolerate!

Started on topamax 25mg in am and pm on July 30. I am now 178. Coke tastes flat so I drink more water I do have tingling in hands and feet but I am glad not to have migraines. The sleep is a problem so I think I will ask for something to help with that. I just wanted help with migraines now I'm losing weight, I got help for both. I couldn't be happier",
                    "5/1/2017 - I was on Bystolic for BP treatment and it caused me to gain 30lbs. I suspect the high blood pressure was due to use of e-cigarette. I put the e-cig and the bystolic down!! Dr. put me on Topamax 100mg and Wellbuterin 300mg help with the headaches and weight loss. As I ramped up from 25mg to 50mg of Topamax I noticed significant changes in my behavior as did others. I cried continuously and at the most ridiculous things. I was short tempered and wanted to be left alone (to cry). Side notes..it made my face feel numb, carbonated drinks tasted funny, vision was funky and did zero for weightloss. As a mom of 4, I can't continue this medication. 30-40lb weight loss is not worth living this way.  ",
                    "Everyones comments have been extremely helpful for me. I am on day two of Topamax and am starting with 25mg daily at bed time. First side effect I noticed was the change in taste buds. I am a big DR. Pepper drinker and went to drink one yesterday and it tasted horrible. Not too happy about that. Sleep last night was strange. It felt very restless and I woke up a lot and was confused. I feel good this morning however. I am determined to try this medicine for a couple of months. I need a solution for my migraines and it seems this has helped a lot of people. I am only concerned about the weight loss. I am already very little and definitely do not need to lose any weight.",

To think that I lived so many years never being diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder. I am so happy that life is so wonderful because of Topamax. Only side effect has been weight loss but, that really is a good thing. It is wonderful to be back at my true weight because the bipolar disorder is now managed.",

EVERYTHING has only been temporary. My new doctor has recommended Topamax. I currently weigh 282.6. I have started out on 25 in the morning and 25 at night. In 1 month I will go in for my follow up. Has anyone else tried everything else and completely fail? My doctor says it could be my genetic makeup. But anyway I plan on keeping a record on here of my journey for myself and others to follow. Thank you for your support.",
                    "Okay, up front and to be fair, I have a very sensitive reaction too many medications. I was on this medication for just over 36 hours and I think it made me more sick than any medication I had ever been on. My neurologist gave it to me as an anti-seizure medication. With in just a few hours of taking it I was feeling quite sick but was not entirely sure that that was the reason. After well under 24 hours of being on it I felt nearly catatonic very ill and ultimately had to stop taking it altogether. I ended up falling in the bathroom because I was so uneasy on my feet. The upper part of my legs went numb and at one point I was having difficulty even speaking. I was afraid I was going to end up in the ER.",
                    "I have been using Topamax for 7 months now and it has nearly eliminated my headaches. I read about the side effects prior to taking the drug and I was committed to taking the medication for at least a month to see what would happen. I had the typical side effects of tingling, change of taste but over the course of time all of these have pretty much gone away along with my headaches. The drug is expensive but it is well worth it for me.",

Got the weight loss side effect, & eventually managed to drop the 70 lbs. that I'd gained from other mental meds (karma!). Starting side effects were hard: Was nauseous 1st week & felt like someone had kicked my butt; the successive titrations over the next few months were the same, minus the nausea, lasting a week or less. Side effects afterwards: I'll occasionally get pins & needles in fingers, slight name/word recall issues but no serious case of the stupids unless I go above 150mg, & constant thirst/ dry mouth. Only 8 stars cuz I'm not sure it's working anymore (possibly cuz pharmacy switched brands).",

I was so hopeful when the neurologist mentioned this tablet because he said I would also lose weight with it which I have lost 4lb's with so far but I would rather be fat and happy then skinny and angry if that's the choice I have with these tablets",

I was initially annoyed because I wanted it to work immediately, but I still had migraines. You have to titrate the dose up 25 mg a week. I initially went up to the recommended 100 mg, but I hated the \"loss of words\" feeling I had, and found that I had about 1-2 migraines a month. So I decided to go back to 75 mg and see what happened. I had less loss of words and finger tingling, and yet my amount of migraines stayed at 1-2/month. This has been a lifesaver for me. I don't know what I would do without it.",

Inches everywhere, food taste good just eat very little of i.t I'm never ever hungry but I enjoy cooking! I have energy, not bogged down with lots of medicines anymore and not one full migraine! I'm excited to lose weight it's actually very easy to eat healthy. Its all you crave and I was a sweet addict. No ugly side effects as described, not on this dosage. So I hope this has helped someone.",

I thought it would go away with time but here I am 2 years later and it is still happening. This medication also prevented my migraines at first, then I had to be put in the hospital for 5 days to get treatment about 6 months ago, and now they are back again. If you miss even one dose you get a whole new set of side effects as if you started the medicine that day! Before I took this medicine my hair was so thick, and I never really noticed the hair loss side effect until now because my hair is falling out in chunks. Topamax also caused me to get kidney stones and be hospitalized for a month. The only good thing is I lost 50lbs",

I have always been healthy (no high blood pressure, no diabetes, no High Cholesterol) however I've always been obese and worked towards trying to rid myself of the weight in efforts to prevent myself from getting those diseases in the future. This has given me the kick start I need. It reduced my cravings for sweets and carbs as well as suppressed my appetite. I do eat 3 meals a day (or at least I try to when I can remember) but for the most part, I have the same amount of energy, I sleep AMAZINGLY, and haven't had any major side effects as others have mentioned.

I experienced numbness and tingling in my extremities, severe problems with word retrieval, a complete inability to focus or concentrate, anxiety, agitation, severe mood issues (I became very angry and upset at the smallest of things). But what finally did me in was severe epigastric pain, nausea, dizziness and disorientation that came about suddenly and was persistent until I titrated myself off the medication after a visit to the urgent care. As soon as I got off Topamax, the migraines were back every day and I question which was worse - the migraines or the side effects. ",
                    "I have not had good luck with this medicine. The side effects were horrible at first but they did settle down and mostly disappeared after 4 or 5 months on the medication.

I keep feeling freezing cold all the time, I also have a serious stomach condition making my life miserable since taking these tabs, 3 days ago I Googled topiramate and realized why I am ill, now coming off it. It really helped reduce migraine frequency and severity but side effects I cannot cope with right now, such a shame.",

Otherwise the more negative side effects will be more pronounced. I am on this medication for migraines, and the weight loss is a \"side effect.\" It took about 6 months before I saw any weight loss at all, so I was frustrated at first, though the migraines did start to subside a bit. Now, I've been on it a year, and I've gone from 235 lbs. to 205 lbs. without trying at all. Like, I'm not exercising any more than I was, I haven't been dieting at all that I'm aware of - I just don't crave food like I used to. Headaches better too.",

As i increased the dose, i started having hair loss, dizziness and \"white outs\" where i would not be able to see at all for up to 20-30 seconds at a time. I also started having the memory issues. I started seeing a new neuro and we dropped me down to 100 mg. The hair loss stopped but I still get the vertigo. I am now down to 50 mg. I suffer from eye pain in my left eye and still the random dizziness- which is horrible. Weaning off of this - I do Botox injections now for preventative with some relief",

My number of headaches has gone down to 1-2 a week, and I think it will continue to improve. Very happy, very pleased not having to depend on tylenol to function, or having to miss class.

Advised from a pharmacist to have my doctor create the same thing which is 2 scripts the topiramate and low dose of phentermine. I just started so I'm on day 2 and it cost me 30.00.

                    "Personally this drug helped my mood swings greatly, however I was quite disturbed that it agitated my diet as much as it did. I have a co-morbid eating disorder which was agitated by the med. The Topirimate made it so I HAD to eat my food a very specific way. Something soft, yet crunchy at the same time. Normally I wouldnt complain, however it was always on my mind.I think the hardest thing about the med was the appetite suppression for me. I was down to eating one meal a day, which ultimately let to me not loosing any weight which I can say was very difficult for me. I had increased irritability, and I felt overly fatigued. I am also on Citalopram, which is a terrible combination if you're prone to fatigue.",
                    "I had started taking this medication quite a few years ago. About 4 to be exact and it wasn't until about 1 year ago that I started to see a HUGE difference in my skin. I have extremely unbareble dry skin now that just flakes off and flakes off and flakes off. I moisturize everyday constantly but it just gets worse and there's nothing that helps it. Does anyone else experience this problem? I just want to know if it is the medication because I have not had dry skin my whole life and want to make sure that it will go away when I get off of it..",

I've been on it for over 4 years and no more migraines. Yes, there was some tingling for the first few months, but it was not a big deal, just felt like my toes had fallen asleep and were \"waking up\". Since I was already on a weight loss plan, I don't know if it helped in that area or not. I can't say that I had any other side affects. I've always stumbled with my words and this hasn't increased that issue. I certainly didn't notice it changing the way things taste!",

All day everyday, constant migraines. I had to stop working out, got fat and lost all my gains. I started 25 mg topamax at the same time with chiropractic care (found in neck x-ray abnormal lordotic curve) and started treatment every week. A week later of both of these combined, the migraines are finally gone! but my head still throbs except with no pain.. I am just happy I can finally exercise again, and stop hating life. (Got CT Scan and MRI of head before X-ray of neck, was clear {checked neck because it got stiffer a month into migraines} ) NO SIDE EFFECTS! :-)",

                    "I have had a good experience after trying to find the right cocktail for several years. I have a very high-stress job and my anxiety is put to the test daily. It is not clinically significant at this point and I can only attribute that to finally having my medicines right. I am taking Wellbutrin, Lamictal, Topamax and Zoloft at pretty low dosages for each. I did lose about 70 pounds. After over a year on the Topamax, my normal appetite has started to return and I have gained back about 10 pounds, but I still have self control that I lacked when I was fighting depression which is now at bay.",
                    "The 2 weeks I was taking topamax ended up being the worst 2 weeks of my life. I was started on this med on Wednesday. By Monday, I was half-way through my day at work when I got lightheaded, dizzy, a terrible headache and started experiencing left sided numbness/tingling. Nearly wrecked and ended up in the ER where they diagnosed migraines. Was sent home to have a headache with left side weakness/numbness, confusion, foggy feeling for the next 2 weeks. 5 doctors appts, 2 ER visits, 1 outpatient infusion for migraines, and 1 admission to the hospital later. I finally figured out on MY OWN that when I stopped taking topamax, my symptoms got better. Although they are still not gone. My vision has changed as well as other long term effects.",
                    "I have been using Topamax since February 2008 (this is August 2008) until recent stress reached an all time high Topamax had been working great. But with added stress of the death of my husband's father, my bipolar son going off to residental treatment, my other bipolar son having to come off of his Lithium due to his kidneys...well I am sure you can guess I have had several break through migranes.  Still, overall I have been pleased. I have lost about 40 pounds. I went from 228 down to 189. For a 39 year old, 5'3\" woman. that'a a big difference. ",
                    "This is an early review as I just started it on 10/16/16 but the food cravings are gone, it takes less food to satisfy me, soda tastes terrible, cigarettes taste different and bad (which is a surprising good side effect!) and I just feel better with less food in me. I have tried phentermine with no luck and usually had good success with natural weight loss until being diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and needing a knee replacement that keeps me from working out too much. So so far, I am impressed. I'll be back in a few weeks for a weigh in review. No side effects like others have had with mental fogginess or tingling. 25mg 2x day. Here's hoping my 235 can become 155 again!",

Although I haven't had a seizure ever since I began to take the medication (which is good because the meds are working) the side effects were horrible. I would often feel very disoriented and saw a great amount of weight loss. This may not apply to everyone because everyone is different, but that was my experience with this medication.",
                    "Miracle drug! The side effects can be daunting at first, like tingling/numbness in extremities that won't stop for hours, but if you increase your water intake substantially and power through, it's totally worth it. My daily tension headaches are 90% gone, which is huge for me. It didn't do much in terms of overall muscle pain reduction or the daily body aches, but I did lose over 30 pounds in four months. I stopped drinking all carbonated drinks (because it makes them all taste super flat weirdly) and definitely am not as hungry as I used to be, so that's just a bonus.",
                    "I do not tolerate Neurontin or steroids well. They blow me up like a balloon. Topamax, along with Cymbalta has given me excellent relief with little side effectcs. Yeah to no more invasive injections and cankles!",
                    "I am stopping Topamax after 3 months. Initially I lost 13lb pretty fast, within a couple weeks. I was laid up with an injured back and sick so I wasn't moving, but then I wasn't really eating either. Since then I've played with the same 5ib. I am taking 100mg 2x day. After about 6wks I got some of the common side effects (vision, memory, taste, exhaustion), I stopped losing weight. But I'm fairly certain it is the source of some pretty severe depression that didn't exist prior to taking it. I'm glad I lost 13lb, but the depression is too much to handle and I'm throwing in the towel. Wish it had been more effective, but really it stopped working after about 3 weeks anyhow.",

I have so many and I know it is not doing much for my pain so today I am going to have to go on yet another different med, have been on so many. The one good thing , I lost 60 lbs. but I sure suffered so bad for it. I have to go to a Pathtologist for the blisters on my tongue that the doctors figure are not caused by the medicine and yet it is listed twice as a side effect. Thanks for listening to me.",
                    "This has been a life saver for me as far as migraines go. At first I had a few of the side effects, brain fog, forgetfulness, but that went away after a month or so. Without this drug, I get at least 2-3 headaches a week ranging from dull to severe. I rarely have a migraine while on it.",

I will do that for 7 nights, then up to 50mg for 7 nights, then 75 mg for 7 nights, then 100 mg for 7 nights, and so on until I reach a mg my Dr. and I are comfortable with. So far I have not had any side effects except- not being hungry. In the last 3 days I have hardly eaten anything. I've been very thirsty for water, soda taste like crap- and I was very addicted to diet coke. I haven't weighed yet... been meaning to. Last I weighed was a month or so ago, and I was at 180 ish. Today is July 10th 2017. I will weigh after work and see where I am so I have a better idea who this will effect me! I've gone from 120 to 180 ish in the past year - with different meds..",

The VA (my neurologist) had me try this drug to see if it would help me with the migraines. After about a month I noticed that I couldn't concentrate, and I'd began to effect my studies badly. My anxiety was the worst it had ever been and I was slipping into a depression. I had no idea what was wrong g with me. The VA gave me (a person who suffers from anxiety) a medication that makes you stupid, and wrecked havoc on my mind without warning me about any potential side effects. I had to process the change on my own, figure out what was wrong with me, and ween myself off the pills. Use with extreme caution!",

I am much more mobile, less irritable, and overall happier. I've been on the medicine for about a month though, and have seen a slight return of symptoms. I used to live off of over the counter pain killers, but this medicine has really helped to repair the damage to my brain after tbi.

                    "Side effects can be bad. The weight loss was great at first, but with it causing crippling anxiety I had to add an antidepressant, which put all the weight back on even though I was still on the topamax. I tried going off of it twice. The first time, almost cold turkey. This was a disaster. I didn't have any seizures, but my headache was 24/7 until I got back on it. The second time I weaned myself off very slowly. Over about 2 months, even though I was only taking 100mg. It worked, but I discovered that the topamax was helping me with pain all over my body, not just headaches. Every day was a struggle. After 2-3 months off the drug, I decided to go back on it. Sure, I am less laid back, but I have a lot less pain.",

Word recall, memory, trouble focusing, hand numbness, fatigue, insomnia, the works. But number of days with headaches went from 21 to 9 the very first month. Now, after years of taking it, my body has been depleted of vitamin B12, and I have been suffering from horrible GI troubles. However, none of my doctors seemed to link Topamax to the B12 depletion. It took Google to figure that one out. But thank you to Google and B12 supplements. I hope this helps someone else relieve any issues they've been experiencing. ",

It helped me quit drinking, it keeps my migraines at bay and it is part of my prescription and supplement regimine for a bi-polor disorder and fibromyalgia. I did have some of the mentioned side effects at first...the first 6 months...but my body adjusted to the medicine and the side effects went away.

NO COKES. but I suppose in the long run that is not a bad thing. if you haven't tried it please do so. my neurologist called it dopamax for a reason. for the first 2 weeks I was loopy and sort of confused but I believe that was my body getting used to the med. but after that no problem. try it I think you will be migraine free.

I developed a 9mm kidney stone when I had no prior history. I developed a blood disorder (something acidosis, was told this was a rare side effect, but that was why I stopped taking it.

And I still got migraines even while taking it...and now I have to take eye medication on top of wheezing, felt like puking, dizzy, edgy and wanting to kill myself. Throw this one in the waste basket and try the alternatives before touching this stuff.",
                    "I found that topiramate was reasonably effective in preventing my migraines, however it completely rid me of any and all appetite. Within the first week I lost about 7 lbs, and within 3 weeks I had lost a total of 20 lbs. I'm not a big guy (5'6\", 160 lbs) so it was a very significant weight loss. I became very weak and became ill from fatigue due to no appetite and weight loss. It did lessen my migraines, however I still had them about once a week or so. The weight loss, fatigue and overall effectiveness of the medication caused me to discontinue its usage.",
                    "This drug is horrible. Pros: yes, it destroys your appetite and you lose weight bc of that. You also don't enjoy food, which made me less inclined to want to cook for others (note: I am a foodie and love to cook). Cons: This drug did zero for my migraines. I take Amerge; works! I felt so foggy and \"in and out\" of ability the abilty to concentrate in the mornings (100mg nightly dosage). ok after 4 hrs. My mouth was literally so dry and my tongue so thick feeling, I could not get 3 syllable words out. Also, I had to grasp for words. I was losing confidence in my own performance and others commented on my lack of \"snap.\" This was after a YEAR! Short term memory was shot, perhaps bc of \"in and out\" concentration. Hair! Had to get extensions!",
                    "Acute depression for the 1st 4 weeks on this medication, then it tappered off. Other side effects: upset stomach, tingling in fingers and toes - daily, altered taste. The good side was it reduced the intensity of the migraines, but did nothing for the frequency of them. Getting off of it now, tying Keppra. Have had migraines since I was 8 and they have progressed in intensity and frequency as I got older, now 60. I expected to grow out of them - who knows!",
                    "I took for a week 100mg and had massive amounts of bleeding in my stools any urine. Doctors first thought cancer but then saw I had just started this drug an took me off it straight-a-way. Within 4 days, everything went back to normal and all my tests came back clear. Frightened me something terrible. Doctors say only happens in less then 1% but can cause major hemorrhaging. Lost 10kg in one week. Took me two month to recover properly with weekly follow up blood tests.",
                    "When I first started taking Topamax it was prescribed to me for the prevention of migraine headaches. A couple of years later I now take 200mg in the morning and 200mg at bedtime and since February I have lost 51 lbs... 282 down to 232 and still loosing more!!!!",

                    "I've been taking 25mg daily for the past 5 days and already lost 3.8kg or 8.3lbs. It's also been acting as a great mood stabiliser which is awesome because I have bipolar and Seroquel alone wasn't doing enough. Very happy with Topamax so far.",
                    "I took Topamax as much as 300mg/day for 15 years and my last dose was 150mg at night. I recently changed to Lyrica which is also an anti-convulsant and am taking 100mg/day and find it more effective than Topamax without the memory and lost word problems. I discontinued Topamax because it slowly got to the point where I could not remember something for an hour. Topamax also was causing erectile dysfunction problems for the last 3 years. I do not have this problem with Lyrica. In the end I was getting 5 or more migraines a week and now get 2 or 3 a week and expect to increase Lyrica to 300mg/day.",
                    "Does it work? Yeah! For everyone - NO! Let me explain. Do you have a job that you have to be alert and stay on your toes? Then you need to be careful on this because it will cause you to all the negative experiences you read about. I was on top as I call it 6 years ago and took a break from it and now have got back on it again. Why? Because I am tired of taking 6 Advil and every other over the counter drug there is everyday and wondering what is happening to my body from doing that over time and having the headaches day after day after day. So simply put you get to a point of asking yourself - do the side effects of taking it out weigh not taking it, and if you read everything the answer is an overwhelming YES! ",
                    "Topiramate has been my saving grace. I've suffered from migraines for as long as I can remember, since before age 5. I had one or more everyday and nothing would get of them. I had gone to the neurologist and even given up gluten. After trying topiramate for only a few days my life had changed drastically, I almost never get migraines and if I do they are very very minor and nothing a dose of Excedrin can't fix.",
                    "Update on my experience.....I have been on it now for 21 days and have lost 15 pounds. First weigh in at the doctors office. I feel great. No side effects. At first was seemed very tired, but now I seem adjusted to the medication. I take 75 mg at night before bed. Sleep better than I ever have. Appetite simply isn't there. Sodas don't taste the same; kind of like they have been sitting out for several days. I am remain very hopeful this will work for the long term. I have approximately 100 pounds to lose.",
                    "I was prepared for the basic side effects: Carbonated beverages not tasting right, and also some loss of appetite. I was put on 100mg from the get go. I also had the fairly common side effect of just feeling confused, though this wasn't all that severe and I was still able to do well in school. I also experienced tingling in my hands and feet, and though this was irritating, it was bearable. The real kicker for why I quit taking this medicine was when I began to have what felt like panic attacks and severe confusion, along with elevated heartbeat and dizziness. Also my fingers would move on their own and seem to get stuck sticking straight out and I had no control over it. ",
                    "I started out at 75mg, had to decrease at first because it made me super emotional and had really bad tingling in hands/feet, so I ended up going back down to 50mg, then I slowly increased by 25mg until I got up to 100mg and I'm doing OK now. I do feel emotionally sensitive at times and do get occasional tingling in my fingers and toes if I don't eat for awhile, which the Topamax also decreases my appetite and I have lost weight on. I still have ocular migraines if I stay up too late or don't get enough sleep. If I have even a small glass of wine the evening before I will wake up with an awful migraine the next morning, so I see why they say not to drink while on the medication. Overall it has really significantly decreased migraines.",

My hair was falling out by the handfuls every day, and the concentration and memory loss were preventing me from working as I am a translator. I have been on propranolol 160 mg daily for 2 years now, and have had good results from that with not too many side effects. I take rizatriptan when I do get a migraine and it stops it usually. If it doesn't I take Fioricet as well and that works.",

Started taking topiramate at 20 with the dosage of 25mg while increasing by 25mg every two weeks for 8 weeks to 100mg. A pill every morning/night. While going from a casual of 5-20 seizures a day to 0-5 seizures a day I shouldn't be complaining regrading the medicine itself actually being effective, although the side effects are noticeable. Especially the memory/studying related ones all the sudden. Not sure I would recommend a student to take this while going to college or high school.",
                    "It worked, but the side effects were terrible, lasting and possibly permanent. The worst of the side effects I experienced were lack of taste and short-term memory loss. Over two years after taking this medication, I have still having issues with my short-term memory.",
                    "I've been on this medicine almost a month. In the beginning the side effects were absolutely horrible! I couldn't sleep at night and I could barely hold my head up during the day. My head was foggy and I had trouble finding the words I needed sometimes. I felt like I had the Flu without the runny/stuffy nose. It also causes constipation. I had read several reviews and saw a couple comments about how the side effects would die down after a few weeks. I was determined to push through Now my head isn't as foggy. I'm no where near as tired during the day. I take one melatonin gummy at night just to be sure I get a good nights rest. The constipation hasn't went away but I am only eating half of what I was.",

I was having around 3 horrendous headaches a day, I'd been prescribed 3 different triptans, verapamil, pizotofen, nortryptaline amongst other medications and was taking naproxen like smarties!! Then along came Topiramate!!! It took around 3 weeks to start working and has been a godsend. The only side effects I've had have been the tingling in my mouth, hands and feet, which, yes, is annoying but nothing compared to the pain I had from the migraines. I could do to shed a few pounds, so if weight loss is a \"side effect\" I'm waiting with open arms!!!",

Haven't experienced any bad side effects. The one side effect (which seems to be the most common) is appetite suppression, change in sense of taste, and constant thirst. I haven't lost much weight in three weeks, but I have a feeling the longer I'm on this medicine, the more I will lose. I guess it's a good thing.",

No other good side effect. Gained back weight and stay depressed and anxious. Phcy. says it is the binders in the Rx.",

It seemed to be working great and yes the bathroom trips at first seemed to be never ending but after a while it seemed to calm down. I have been on it for 6 months now but after upping my dose to 150mg, after the pain started to come through with a vengeance, I started having twitching in my eyes and mouth and other side effects happened as well. So I have to stop taking it now and start a new regimen. I did however lose 20lbs so that was a great thing because I was needing that!",

I have minimal to no side effects, a little drier mouth perhaps, plus my 15/20 vision reduces to 20/20. I feel less anxious and less \"pressure/need\" to tic. I can take much lower doses of the brand name to achieve the same effect with the generic; but my insurance won't cover the brand name. It's 100mg twice/day generic versus half that amount brand version. It's still worth it!! I feel so much more in control and \"almost normal\".",

I am cautious as I have been 6 months relapse free on 60 mg fluoxetine before the effects wore off. Will give an update. I have been on all other kinds of SSRIs or SNRIs, which had no effect.

I lost so much hair that when I try to braid it it's like braiding tiny strands of dental floss. It looks so ridiculous long I had to chop it all off just to conceal how grossly thin it is. People call it dopamax for a reason. It made my memory Swiss cheese and when I had to process information it felt like fighting through seaweed. The worst side effect was the depression. This stuff makes me downright suicidal.  It helped me lose about 80 pounds by starvation. I never wanted to eat. I became anemic.

My migraines significantly reduced, though I did get most of the common side effects: slight tingling in my fingers, carbonated beverages tasted gross, and weight loss.  My main warning about this medicine is weight loss. It seems to be paraded as a benefit, and to some it may be, but if you are already naturally slim, pay very close attention. I wound up dropping to an unhealthy weight despite all attempts to counter it, and it's ultimately why I had to stop Topamax. I was unwillingly wasting away. When I stopped, my migraines returned in short order, and I'm still looking for an alternative that works.",

I was only on it for a couple of months before I stopped. It has been about 5 months since I stopped taking and I still constantly feel foggy, dizzy, off balance like I'm drunk. I do not feel like myself at all and I'm nervous that this medication has caused permanent damage.",

My Dr. warned me, also, when he gave me the Rx, to watch for symptoms of such an episode. He did not go on to tell me specifically what those symptoms would be like and I had no idea what this could entail. He said the drug had/has been known to cause these episodes. Just telling me to watch for symptoms though...by the time I starting having the symptoms, I was too paranoid to be able to do anything about it or even realize what was happening since I had never had such an episode. It was the scariest thing I've ever experienced in my life and I still have nightmares and anxiety about the things experienced in my head and thoughts during the time of the episode that lasted for 2 weeks, even while in the hospital. I would love to sue the pants off the makers and that doctor, who, by the way, when my mother called my doctor for help, he stated \"Since she won't talk to me, I am not her doctor anymore as of this moment.\" I wouldn't get on the phone because I was in the middle of a psychotic episode and thought everyone was trying to kill me. Great doctor, huh?! DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

I am quite used to the cognitive changes, they do not make you stupid. Misconception. Intellectual level is unchanging. However, I had to learn to compensate for word find instances, word pronunciation and some fatigue. I should probably take half in day, but I have days fatigue but would rather not due an extra klonipin added to night dose. But this may be needed.

If this works for you and you are on a smaller dosage great. It's made me suffer the entire time I have been on it, granted I do take a higher dosage than probably most of you. I do have to admit, as far as migraines go, I haven't had as many and I normally do.",

I went to a neurologist after trying home remidies and using Exedrin Migraine, and he put me on Topiramate 50mg twice daily, but my body metabolized it to fast, causing my head to be very painful. Also the first day I took it, I had a pain in my head that woke me from REM sleep, my wife said I was screaming in pain while sleeping. He recommended Trokendi XR 100mg Extended Release.

It makes certain foods taste terrible; gave me a constant pins/needles/numbness feeling in my hands and feet; dropped things more often; handfuls of hair fell out; sweat turned orange; dumb as box of rocks.

Still taking 50 mg at night..only noticeable side effects now are tingling in feet and hands intermittently, and fatigue at times otherwise nothing noticeable. I am thinking about increasing dosage.

Right now a combination of Topamax at 50 mg and propranolol extended release at 60 mg works best for me. There are few adverse effects. The Topamax does cause some frustrating cognitive difficulties but I think I can live with them, considering the relief it gives me from the migraines.",

I was put on this because of severe migraines that was shutting down the left side of my body top to bottom. I was only taking 1/2 a pill for 2 weeks which in turn gave me kidney stones. The stones in turn tore my ureter so now I have had 1 blockage from scar tissue and the scar tissue is growing back again. My Ureter has narrowed and now going through all the blood work to see how much my kidney is damaged and different procedures for my tube. I take no meds for migraines now I have been seeing an acupuncturist. As far as migraines I have none as long as I have acupuncture.",
                    "I used it for migraines. My side effects were: depression, dehydration, impaired thinking, confusion, drowsiness, memory problems, nervousness, trouble in concentrating, weakness, loss of appetite, vertigo, and SEVERE ANXIETY. After stopping this medication, I still suffer from severe anxiety and vertigo.",
                    "Topamax has significantly reduced my migraines from 1 a month to 1 every 18 months. I have also found that it helps you - to not over eat or drink alcohol. I am very happy being on Topamax for all these reasons. I initially did have tingly feet, a small price to pay, but rarely get that sympton now. I am on 50 mg a day.",
                    "I started taking this medication for migraines yesterday although I was prescribed it about a month ago. I was very hesitant to start it because of the side affects, but Monday I had the worst migraine with aura I have had in about 6 months. I am taking 25 mg twice a day. My provider wants me slowly elevating by 25 mg per week until I reach 150. I feel very cloudy today, but it might be because I am still recovering from my migraine. I will update in a month.",
                    "Amazing. I've been on Topamax/Topiramate probably 6 plus years. Granted it's not the most cost effective medication. For me it has been a true blessing. It has allowed me to get and maintain a full time job, get a drivers license. And I have a beautiful understanding girlfriend who knows what I deal with. Thankfully I have wonderful insurance that I only pay $20 a month for my Topiramate. Prior to not having insurance. I was in a real pickle. I found a program through Johnson & Johnson where they paid for my Topamax for two years. Saved me about $890 a month. But honestly, great medicine if your doctor gets you on the correct dosage. I'm on 300 mg a day. And I feel great.",
                    "I was put on Topamax 2 months ago after a serious car accident that left me in a flare up of my fibromyalgia. I have not reacted well to medications in the past and have had serious reactions which lead to serious consequences to the other meds I was on. Topamax has been the only medication that I have been able to tolerate well. It does take a while for it to start working though and I have had a few side effects but none that I'm not willing to put up with and 2 of them have gone away since I have started the Topamax.",
                    "I have suffered from migraines for about 14 years. Took Topamax for 8 weeks. At 100mg a day I was having moderate headaches every single day, but no migraines. BUT the side effects were just too much: terrible anxiety, irritability, diarrhea, complete brain fog, intense tingling in fingers, numbness in feet, extreme sensitivity to cold, very frequent urination, changes in taste leading to disinterest in food. I also would not recommend this medication if you are also on birth control pills to alleviate menstrual cramps. That was one of the worst side effects for me - daily cramps for over 3 weeks. If it weren't for that and the anxiety, I may have tried to wait it out.",
                    "I was just started on this medicine on February 13th, 2009. 25mg a day then after one week to increase to 50mg. Read some of the side effects here figured they must surely be on someone who is definitely on a higher dose. Anyway, I am a person who is highly addicted to drinking coca cola. I drink like a 2 liter bottle a day. Well, not any more. This medicine has cured me of that in 2 days. All carbonated beverages taste flat like Robitussin cough medicine. Good side is that'll help me lose weight and the better side is I have yet to have my headache.",
                    "I have suffered hormonal migraines since my early 20's (now early 40's). I had tried most everything for migraines and they were still coming and starting to cluster. I was put onto Topirmirate by my GP at the recommendation of the specialist I saw after plan A stopped working after 6 months. I had some extremity tingling for about 6 weeks when I first started (I was slowly built up to 100mg daily dose). In the interest of full disclosure I am also a type 1 diabetic so I am monitored pretty closely for sight and kidney function and I have had no issues around this. I have also started taking an anti depressant to combat a hormone imbalance issue so I don't get the mood swings either.",
                    "At first it seemed to make the migraines not so unbearable. The weight loss was nice too! It did make me drowsy at first. I also couldn't think straight and find the right words. I saw light trails esp at night. But I struggled through for a few years thinking I would get over the side effects. Ultimately I didn't think the benefits were worth the side effects. Everyone is different.",
                    "Topamax made my migraines worse - more often, more pain, more nausea, stronger auras, and longer lasting.",
                    "1st week - I took 25mg bedtime. now week 2, I'm on 50mg numbness and tingling on my toes and fingers are interesting. I hope its not permanent nerve damage.  weight loss? just 2 lbs so far. (10 days) I'm also walking outside regularly, everyday. Appetite...well.... yes and no... better than before, I still want to eat tho.  I'm taking it cuz my back pain is too bad to do vigorous work out. once I drop some weight I will definitely do some work out together to build up strength.",
                    "Started on Tuesday of this week so excited to try something different since I had been on bupap for years. I took it around 230pm right after my yearly visit. Around 630pm I couldn't see in my left eye it was so blurry I had to close one eye to read. I was also confused felt like a child on ritalin. I was slow pace doing things. I didn't eat, soda tasted flat. Wednesday I woke up with stomach pains blurry vision diarrhea and nausea..what a day to start. No motivation, ringing in my ears, light sensitivity I'm just plan through with this meditation..Thursday today I'm off but still have the side effects I don't know how long it will wear off. But I'm going back to bupap. Screw this that medication is for people one flew over the cuckoos nest!",
                    "I've been taking Topamax for two months and the weight loss is great, but that's because everything taste's gross. I'm tired a lot and have to work hard to focus. But I can finally sleep at night and feel rested. After reading some of the other comments I now understand why my fingertips sometimes feel numb or weird. I'm still not sure if the weight loss, better sleep are worth the disgusting taste in my mouth and the feeling sometimes that I just want to burst into tears (although that could be just because I work so hard and I'm still broke).",
                    "I was diagnosed with trauma induced neuropathy in my left heel following an injury that became infected, developed cellulitis and an ulcer. It took 2 months of intensive treatment for my foot to heal but about 3 weeks after I returned to work, I started experiencing sharp, electrical type pain in my heel. It was excruciating. My doctor prescribed Neurontin at first but I was not able to tolerate it. I was switched to Topamax and within a day, I had full relief and since then, I have been pain free. Yes, I am a juvenile diabetic but I had never had problems with my feet until this happened. The neuropathy is confined to my left heel only. Topamax is the best. The side effects are minimal but even if they weren't, it's worth it to be pain free.",
                    "I have tried a lot of different medications for fibromyalgia. Some work but cause significant weight gain. This one works significantly well. I actually stopped taking it for 3 months because my I didn't have insurance, and my body felt HORRIBLE. It became WORSE AND WORSE. I started taking it again and I felt SO much better. For those of you that truly experience the extreme fatigue and pain from fibromyalgia, I strongly recommend trying Topiramate.",
                    "While on Topamax, I lost my ability to think straight. I couldn't process things the same way. I couldn't even finish my sentences. I would start talking and would forget the words that came next. My friends and family would have to help me finish my sentences. After getting off the medicine, I could finally finish my thoughts again. However, I feel like I still cannot learn as easily as I did before I got on the medicine. I think it changed my brain processing capability. I have talked to a friend who had the exact same problem on this medicine. I would not recommend it unless you actually cannot live without it.",
                    "I was for about a year on gen Bupropion 300mg (Wellbutrin), gen Lexapro 20/10mg & Clonazepam (0.5 mg).These kept me functioning for some time and pulled out of a very debilitating depression that kept me at home for a month. During this year, I still suffered from a lot of ups and downs, my anxiety was getting worse and worse, so my mood swings. I kept pushing my psychiatrist, she was skeptical about my mood swings but I knew there was more going on. I am now on 50mg of generic Topamax (it's definitely controlled my mood swings and a bit my anxiety), it's only been 2 months but I definitely feel a change. Planning on stop taking Lexapro. My Side effects: Weird tasting on (black sodas) and dizziness. A new one is phantom smells.",
                    "I started taking this for a while to help with my migraines. The first two weeks it worked and then the doctor upped my dose to use it as my seizure medication as well. When he upped the dose apparently my body did not like that and my migraines came back, just going back down didn't do the trick. After about a year of being off of it and trying 6 other prescriptions, my new doctor said she didn't understand why they had come back when the dose was upped and maybe that it was totally out of my system we could try again. I went back on it and my migraines have decreased from one every day meaning literally 7 days a week to about 3 or 4 a week, but no soda like others stated and this time I had to quit smoking cigarettes because they tasted stale.",
                    "My five year old was prescribed this medicine after he started having breakout seizures on his other medicines. After about two weeks the seizures had not decreased and he started complaining of severe eye pain. A visit to the eye doctor confirmed very high pressure in his eyes. It did not work well for him.",
                    "I started having menopause migraines in June 2014. My doctor started me on 25 mg daily. At first, this medicine helped me but my migraines started to get more frequent. Over the course of 2 years, I was bumped up to 400 mg daily, the max dosage. I always felt that my head was foggy, memory was shot, problems speaking, losing sleep, no appetite and more & more intense migraines. This medicine quit working too. I finally stopped this medicine in March 2017. I immediately noticed a difference in my head. To say this medicine is evil is putting it mildly. Your migraines can get worse while taking Topirimate and unless you pay attention to your body, you won't realize it is the medicine making them worse. Beware when taking this medicine",
                    "If you cannot tolerate Topamax/Trokendi (topamirate), please consider Zonegran (zonisamide). It is in the same class of drug as topamax, and does many of the same things. Its labeled use is an anti-convulsant, but the psychiatric and pain management clinic I go to uses it off-label for a number of uses, such as: weight loss, mood stabilization, migraine prevention, mild pain reduction properties. I took Zonegran successfully at 200 mg for 5 years and DID NOT experience tingling, numbness, dry mouth or flat-tasting carbonated beverages. Memory/recall did degrade unacceptably for me above 200 mg, but therapeutic dose is considered 300 mg.",
                    "I have been taking this medication for about 5 weeks now. Regarding the migraines, I have only had one and this is because I was over tired (not a trigger but felt terrible and it was more a bad headache). I suffer from cluster headaches/migraines and have done since about the age of 12 for about 25 years (now 38). Pretty healthy otherwise, normal weight, would like to lose 7lbs (like most) but had Xmas weight to shift. I was put on 25mg a day - at night. Wow, did I experience the crazy side effects! But, these were to be expected. Appetite reduced, about 7lb lost, until Easter...5 day binge! But, hope to get back on track. Will report back soon",
                    "The main issue I had with this is the side effects. It caused my hands and feet to tingle and feel numb for hours on end. It made me drowsy and extremely moody due to it. I'm not sure if it really worked because after two weeks I stopped taking Topamax because the side effects were so intense.",

I've found A daily multivitamin helps with that, and believe it or not, prenatal vitamins take it completely away. I hope this helps!",

I did take it for Migraines and boy did it do its job, I was having them every day and now I get them maybe once a month. I started at 25mg went up to 50 twice a day and in the beginning of September went to 100mg where I will stay at and stabilize. Weight loss! Well where do I begin! It has been amazing! I weighed in on May 15 at 167.5lbs, I am only 5' tall, no inches there lol, and I weighed in September 2nd at 141.8lbs. It is amazing to me that I have lost 26lbs without diet or exercise. I have always done yoga and meditation, but not the hardcore kind, the gentle kind. I really haven't changed a thing except for taking Topamax.",
                    "Hello all I'm new!! Over the last few years I went from 125lb to 184lb. I've been taking topirimate and Effexor for about 2 months. My doctor said I would lose weight and I definitely have but I'm afraid to get on the scale. I feel great as far energy goes. Memory loss, wrong words, etc is real. Just look at that sentence formation... This is the best writing I can do on topirimate. Anyway, when I get enough courage to get on the scale, I'll let y'all know...how much or how little success I've had, thus far!!",
                    "My doctor put me on Topamax for my migraine headaches, I was on that medication for about 3 weeks, took 2-25 mg a day. During that time I had one huge migraine and 6 headaches. I felt very tired and couldn't speak clearly and couldn't finish a sentence. I would NOT recommend this medicine to anyone. IT WAS A BAD EXPERIENCE.",
                    "I took Topamax a few years ago and regret it. It has changed my life for the worse. Even after stopping the meds several years ago, I still have bad brain fog, loss of vision, memory loss especially short term, lost the ability to comprehend things and lost ability to do simple functions such as basic math. Prior to taking this medicine I was at the top of my game. Now I feel helpless and the doctors were no help. My vision changed after it, mind you I had lasik eye surgery and could see perfectly fine prior to this. It's frustrating because I have to do things differently now and it's embarrassing because people look at you like something wrong since you can't do simple things a 2 year old can do!",

I was prescribed this medication for mainly migraines, but I also have restless leg syndrome which disrupts my sleep schedule. So far the only side effects I have noticed is that it makes my hands tingle (compare to hitting your funny bone). This medication makes me really sleepy so I only take it at night (helps with my sleep schedule). I also have noticed that I don't eat as much, which is fine with me! I haven't had any migraines since I started taking Topomax which is wonderful given the fact that I usually suffer from one atleast daily!",
                    "I've been taking Topamax (brand) for approximately ten years. Due to severe migraines this was the only medication to prevent what had been dabilitating headaches, nausea & vomiting, sensitivity to light, smell, sound, movement, and dizziness. After several years, my insurance refused to continue payment of the brand until I tried the generic tablets. After 3 days, the original symptoms returned. They finally approved continued payment of brand and now two years later they again have refused to cover (pay) for medication although it falls under the plan. For three months, my neurologist and I have issued appeals with no clear explanation of the denial. I would just like to again take meds to rid myself of this pain.",
                    "I've found topamax to be a useful tool in migraine prevention. I've been fighting these now for over 25 years and I've gone as far as having sinus sx and dentures to replace my top teeth to reduce the triggers of these monstrous headaches. I've come to believe there's no magic pill to take it all away but topamax reduces the severity greatly. The little tingling sensation will go away and saltiness are great when you have to take meds and don't have a full stomach. It helps with the nausea. Whether topamax is the drug for you- don't lose hope. Just keep trying to find the right combination of diet change, sleep, trigger reduction, and meds until you find what works for you.",

Prior to the accident, I had always been a fairly healthy 5'7 160 pounds and worked out almost daily, and generally are very healthy. After the accident I became almost sedentary, depressed and suicidal. I had gained over 35 pounds but I honestly didn't much care. The Trikendi XR and the Adderall (prescribed to assist with the severe ADD caused by the brain injury) has helped me lose weight along with proper diet and minimum exercise. My seizures have gone from major, grandmal to pseudo-seizures to seldom, and my migraines have gone from daily to about 4 per week.",

He also added Magnesium and the combination has been nothing short of amazing. Topamax has really been great and I've had no side effects at all, I take 1-50MG tab in the morning and 2 at night and I've been dropping weight, migraines gone and getting back to my old self.",

Significant issues with cognitive ability, change in taste, balance, drowsiness, disorientation, nausea, tingling in hands and legs, numb lips. Inability to think and caused hallucinations. Hospitalized 4 days post medication to administer DHE to counteract this drug. DO NOT TAKE this medication. No warnings on the prescription. Asked pharmacist if this would cause drowsiness, slow my mental function or have any adverse effects and he informed me that 200 mg was low dose and I would have no adverse side effects. Based on my research since taking the drug, this is NOT accurate",

I've had numerous prescription meds, from injections to triptans to hydrocodone, etc, I think topomax makes #13? Anyways, over the last year my migraines have increased in frequency, I'm guessing because of the stress of college, but I get them every week, about twice a week, one right after another( triptans for me usually trigger another migraine) I've been dreading starting this medication, but finally decided to give it ago, as I'm on winter break and quite frankly this is all I have left to try. Literally half of my life has been consumed by this. Right now my right foot is tingling, and my chest hurts, I'm rather dizzy and have been forgetting things all week. I've felt super anxious and down all week, but I haven't had a migraine in 20 days. Sprite tastes flat but I don't really drink soda apart from that so I don't mind, so far this is bearable. I noticed when I went up to 50mg the side effects increased so I'm worried about when I inc to 75 and 100mg, but we shall see. :)",
                    "When I took 50mg of topamax the first time for migraine prevention it worked wonders and I lost 20lbs in a few short months! I stopped it when I got pregnant with my daughter. Once she stopped nursing I restarted it again to help with my migraines and hopefully drop the extra weight I couldn't lose from the pregnancy. It helps with my migraines the second time around but there is no decrease in appetite and no weight loss. Very disappointing.",
                    "I suffer bi-lateral migraines and have been on Topamax for several years off and on now. I have mixed reviews. I LOVE Topamax, because nothing else works for me. In fact I was given Maxalt and Propranolol together and wound up in the hospital almost dead. You can NOT take those two together. All medicines have side effects, so does Topamax. I liked the weight loss in the beginning, but be careful with it. I lost 80 lbs and couldn't stop. I forgot to eat. Topamax makes me just not hungry. I have it fixed now and watch out for it, but it was very scary. The memory loss has been a problem at times, but has been funny too. I have not experienced the HOT they spoke of...I FREEZE ALL THE TIME!",
                    "I have been on this medicine for about a week now. I was on it before for about 3-4 years. After the inital side effects which lasted probably about a month the only one that lasted was that I had a lot of energy, which always isn't so bad. Everyone reacts to medicines differently though. I didn't have such a bad experience with this one.",
                    "I have struggled with weight loss for years. Food cravings are one of my \"symptoms.\" Topamax really did help with this, however my energy and memory are not what they use to be. Originally I thought it was a trade off I could adjust to but the fuzzy memory for me is frustrating. I sometimes say words that I am thinking about and don't even realize it. Then argue that I didn't say it, only to find out I did. Silly, but worth revisitng my physician about. I struggle with the same 10-20 lbs but won't give up. I would recommend trying it to people who are serious about weight loss. It helps you push your plate away and not obsess about food. That was an experience I had never had before, but I need my memory.",
                    "I have been off and on Topamax for about 5 years now and I must say that it works better for bipolar mood stabilization than any other one out there. The one thing I love the most about this medicine is that it is helping me lose weight. They need to put in the time to verify that this drug is in fact a mood stabilizer because it certainly does help with bipolar disorder.",
                    "I was taking 400mg daily for chronic migraines, depression, and weight loss. It's very important to build up slowly otherwise the side effects can be extreme. I lost around maybe 50lbs while on it. When I got up to 300 - 400mg I started to have memory problems and sleep issues. After a while I felt like it had stopped working and dropped it, but that could have been from me forgetting to take it (memory issues remember). It takes a few weeks to a few months for the side  effects to fully wear off. I started at 235 or 245, and went down to 185. I'm now back up to 200. I haven't exercised in years, and I didn't change my diet (I probably don't eat as healthy as I should).",
                    "Topamax worked great to relieve my daily headaches and migraines. Taking it twice daily, it didn't take long to start enjoying life again without headaches, but as time went on, the side effects just kept getting more and more intense. I could deal with the tingling in my fingers, hands, and feet, but waking up completely disoriented, not being able to think straight or concentrate, not being able to form sentences or find the right words finally got to me after about a year/year and a half and I weened off of it. It's unfortunate because it felt amazing not to have headaches everyday. I am also small to begin with and I lost about 15 pounds on it, I usually had to force myself to eat due to having absolutely no appetite.",
                    "With side effects of many other meds being a problem I went on this as it worked well for my mom. Dr. explained that genetics play a part in medicine effectiveness as well as diseases. It had an immediate effect on my severe depression. It also helps with mild psychotic episodes during mania for me. (Voices, hearing noises that aren't there) There is a slight tapering of appetite for me that stabilizes after prolonged use. I also have to search for common words sometimes. Pins and needles in my hands and feet, especially when I'm driving or it's really cold outside. Extreme thirst and I rarely sweat, even when working out. ALL tolerable and SO much better compared to laying in bed all day long.",
                    "First week ok. Dizzy first day. Overwhelming sense of wellness for the first week, minus dizzy feeling. I thought this is great.  When I increased the dose as prescribed the second week I developed a headache the next day. Had pains in my abdomen, all throughout my back. Continued for 2 more weeks then my body shut down, had the worst migraine that lasted 2 days. I slept for 4 days. Then muscle weekness, nausea, and persistent headache. My bladder was painful and felt like I could not empty it. Three days off them, I can finally stand up straight, but I lost a week of work. Might have been ok if dose was not increased.",

I had been on and off trials of anti-depressants like Zoloft, Wellbutrin, Zypreza, etc for years and none of them did anything for me. This was an entirely different class of medication and the new psychopharmacologist I had told me so before he gave it to me. When it kicked in after several weeks I literally felt it one day while riding the bus. I was trying to have one of those negative, anxiety-ridden feelings and a flush just came over me that downgraded that sensation. The only drawback is that this medication completely stopped working for me after one and a half years.",
                    "I've been taking this 100g for about 4months now; completely made a difference to my life I no longer have worry of waking up or been at work with migraines. I've had maybe a couple bad headaches but a migraine maybe once since taking these tablets. Although I'm finding the side effects difficult; memory loss is seeming to be tricky especially as I'm 24 and I'm forgetting the most simplest things. I've had a few anxiety attacks. Can't stomach coco cola taste flat. Mood swings seem to be a change in behaviour, feeling frustrated , and impatient And I'm extremely paranoid since I've been taking them don't like been alone etc.",
                    "I've been on Topamax (topiramate) for 6 years, and loved it at first. My migraines decreased dramatically, I had weight loss from the appetite suppression, and I overall felt better. But I had pretty bad tingling in my hands and all over my face for the whole time I've taken it. Also more recently, I've made the connection with my severe memory loss to the medication. I used to be able to retain information and facts like an elephant, but I can hardly recall simple words some days. I'm planning on going off the Topamax (with the direction of my neuro) because the memory loss issue is so disturbing to me.",
                    "Good",
                    "I was very excited when I started taking this medication. And then.... I had read the side effects and was like oh this is crazy. I will say I was on no other medication. I have never had hair loss like this. It was gobs of hair in my shower. The previous posters that refer to brain fog - yep that too.",
                    "I was prescribed Topamax many years ago... before they even offered a generic version and before they could legally prescribe it for obesity! So, my doctor prescribed it to me for migraines because I had a slight history of migraines but she said it would cause weight loss. Oh boy, did it! I was over 200lbs and in a size 18 pants, within 6 months I was in a size 8 pants! By the time a year rolled around, I was 103lbs and in a 00!!! No exercise! This is a wonder drug. I felt great! I had quit smoking, cut out all sugars and red meat, minimal alcohol. This medicine effects the addiction part of the brain as well as other areas. It's just amazing! I did warn my friends that I would forget sentences halfway thru; in 4 weeks no side effects.",
                    "I've been on Topamax before and it worked and went off I don't know why. I recently went back on it and it has made a world of difference. It's like night and day. I take it with Abilify and Xanax because I have really bad anxiety also. I am 24 and was so depressed I wasn't leaving my apartment but now I feel like a new person like I want to go out and do things again. I'm not held back. I like that this medicine doesn't make me gain weight too because I've had that problem in the past, I lost 10 pound since I went back on it 4 weeks ago. The only thing I will say that is not great is it slows down my thought process sometimes and it gives me tingles in my hands and face but not all the time. The benefits outweigh those side effects greatly.",
                    "Terrible side effects.",
                    "Absolutely horrible!! It wasn't until a yr of several tests, scans and a colonoscopy that made me go to another Dr and beg him to find out what was wrong with me. I never dreamed it was this medicine. I had lost 30 lbs but I had diarreha, funny taste in mouth, weak, hair loss, foggy, memory was bad, felt like my muscle mass was going down to nothing...my daughter said I was looking frail all the time. It started getting hard to get out of bed...this went on for a yr and a half.I was getting older and taking care of my elderly folks so I didn't read into it much. I'm so glad I switched drs...he noticed immediately what it was and told me to wean myself off of it.",
                    "Placed on Topamax for severe migraine and trigeminal neuralgia. 3 days later became disorientated with rash and soreness all over body then skin became scaley. Numbness in both hands and feet. Ceased Topamax.",
                    "This is the worst drug I've ever taken. It gave me horrible tremors, anxiety, & a guilt complex.",
                    "I took this medication for nearly two months before seeking a second opinion about my hormonal migraines. I was only having 1-2 migraines a month; however they would last 4-5 days at a time. When the pain medications didn't help, my doctor started me on Topamax. I do a great deal of technical writing and crisis management in my job, and my migraines really got in the way. I was able to deal with the weight loss and taste changes, but the difficulty in concentrating became a serious issue. When I started losing hair, that was the last straw. If my migraines became worse I may return to Topamax though.",
                    "Note that everyone's experience with medication is different. I feel like it's important for others to know the risks as well as the benefits of a medication and then decide for themselves if it's worth a try. That being said, this is my experience. I started this medication for migraines caused by different medication that I'm taking for depression. So far, my anxiety is horrible and I'm extremely paranoid about everything, also I'm very depressed with suicidal thoughts. I haven't had weight loss but rather, weight gain! I become delusional and lose touch with reality, I'm very agitated and my body feels like it's made of bruises. Anyway, I've become a completely different person but not in a good way. It's not worth all the suffering!",
                    "if you have anxiety or depression DO NOT i repeat Do NOT take this medication i was only on it a couple weeks but for two weeks it made me so anxious and so depressed i wanted to kill myself. this drug made me suicidal luckily there was no self harm but i would strongly advise against it!",
                    "I have been taking 25MG of Topamax before bed daily for the prevention of my migraines with aura. Been taking it for almost 2 months. I haven't had an aura or a migraine since I started taking it. I love this medicine! Only side effect I have noticed so far is tingling in my feet sometimes, but so far not bad. The one thing that is bothersome about this medicine is that birth control bills are less effective and its recommended to use a different form of birth control. IUD is what I think I'm going to try. ",
                    "I was on Topamax for 6 years and it worked very well until this past winter when I realized the migraines were starting to increase in frequency again, so my doctor has switched me to Bystolic and I'm tapering off the Topamax. But for a long time Topamax was wonderful. The first 3 months were hell and my boyfriend almost left me but I started taking a small amount of antidepressants and that seemed to calm me down. Or maybe it was a coincidence. Anyway all of the side effects did go away except for the difficulty remembering words. I am looking forward to not having to fumble for words any more, but it was a small price to pay for no migraines.",
                    "My neurologist added Topamax to my tricyclic and beta-blocker in hopes that it would control my vestibular migraines (total balance loss). It failed completely, but its side effects included immediate impotence, decreased libido, and substantial difficulty finding words. My vocabulary for 3 syllable words dropped 50%. I sounded drunk.",
                    "I've been on Topamax for quite a few months now, and I love it for the most part! I have only had the occasional minor headache, but the side effects are good/bad. The good ones in my book are the weight loss and carbonated beverages and other sweet things tasting horrible. The bad side effects are tingling, usually in my fingers and confusion/'blonde moments\" but those are usually more pronounced the more tired I am. I can live with the bad side effects so much easier than I can a migraine everyday!",
                    "This medication has been a life saver for me. After the initial side effects of tingling hands and feet, funny tasting carbonated drinks, loss of words, which lasted only a couple of weeks and a massive weight loss of 30kg (60lb approximately) everything settled down nicely. I have been taking Topamax for over two years now with no problems whatsoever and in those two years have only had one migraine that was not nearly as bad as what I used to experience. For me, this is the best medicine I've ever been prescribed.",
                    "I got put on Topamax about 3 years ago, I felt it wasn't helping with my migraines so I took myself off. Then I had a seizure because I didn't have it. So I started back on it and had no luck with migraines. I quit taking it again and more seizures. Ever since I've been on it I have had seizures and they are not in my family at all.",
                    "I was given this medication several years ago in an attempt to reduce migraines. I began using the lowest prescribed dose, as instructed by my physician. On the 3rd night, 3-4 hours after taking my 3rd dose, I woke out of a sound sleep with tachycardia (fast heart rate). I didn't know what was up. To \"calm down\" I took a shower. By afternoon of that day, I knew that it was the medication. I had pressure in my head, tachycardia, nausea. This is about the worst I have ever felt. Needless to say, I had to discontinue Topamax immediately. I long for the day when medications can be chosen based on genetic coding information. For many people, Topamax is a God-send; but not for me.",
                    "Started this as a mood stabilizer for my bipolar. I've been on it almost 30 days now, it has stabilized my moods for sure! Usually before my period I'm a monster. A crazy hormonal mess. I feel normal, not \"flat\". It's a double win for my constant headaches and hormonal migraines that are now gone too. Only side effects, minor pins and needle tingles in my toes and fingers which last seconds off and on and aren't even bothersome too me. It seems to happen with each increase I do.",
                    "I take this as a mood stabalizer it has really helped level out my moods",
                    "I believe alot of the negative side effects are caused from not eating or drinking. Once I started to eat and drink water foggy brain and unpleasant side effects went away (I am still loosing weight though :) ) and still no migraines. I also split my dosage 50 mg morning 50 mg at night, this has helped minimize side effects.",
                    "I've been taking Topiramate, 50mg twice a day, for several years. At first, it worked great and I was recommending it to all my migraine sufferer friends, but gradually, week by week, I seem to have built up a resistance to it and recently, the migraines are back with a vengeance. I have a condition that causes the migraines and I get them most days now. Also, I can only take paracetamol as I take blood thinning medication and it doesn't work for me at all as a painkiller. The side effects I personally get with Topiramate are negligible compared to the pain of migraine, I have 'brain fog' now and then, temporarily forget words, peoples names, etc. But it's back to the Dr. again now to ask for an alternative preventative - if there is one",
                    "Female. 19. I had sinus surgery then started getting headaches after surgery because of nerve damage. I was taking 25mg once every night for a week and every next week would up the dose. My experience was awful! I had the usual side affects people had- tingling in lips/hands, and weight loss. Main one for me was, I was so extremely fatigued and weak. I'm a young healthy girl who eats healthy, is a healthy weight, and before my surgery worked out 4 X a week. I would have physically to force myself out of bed. And as far as the headaches it reduced the intensity of the migraines, but did nothing for the frequency. ",
                    "I suffered a stroke in '04 and my neurologist prescribed Neurontin to deal with the resulting numbness and tingling on the right side. A year later, and after emergency gall bladder surgery, he put me on a low dose of Topamax instead. It worked well, but I've had to eventually increase the dosage. The side effects were minimal; I needed to lose the 35 lbs I lost (and my wardrobe needed updating :0), and the additional tingling is nothing compared to what I feel when I don't take it. Expensive!",
                    "I've been taking Topamax for about 2 years now, 100 mg a day. I have severe chronic migraines due to my spinal cord. So my doctor put me on this medication. The only side effect I've had was the tingling but I get that anyways even before this medication so who knows if it was a side effect. But it works ok for me when I take it regularly but I also have focal seizures so this medication is for both of my problems. But I always take it with my hydrocodone so my migraines are fine.",
                    "Topamax is very good at helping me with keeping my seizures away. My main problem though, is sometimes anywhere between 3:00 and 5:00 in the afternoon I have a \"nap crash\". Meaning my eyes want to close because I feel drowsy no matter how much I try to fight it and within a few minutes after my eyes close I'm completely unconscious.",
                    "Well I was on Topamax for approximately 6mos. My doctor hoped that he would be able to get me to the medicinal dosage of about 25mg twice daily. However I could not stand the way the medicine made me fall asleep. If I took it at 8pm, I passed out by 8:15. I can say that I was getting the BEST sleep of my life. I was afraid to take it in the morning before/during or after work, so I only took it once I got home. I only got to the 5mg dosage before I stopped taking it.",
                    "I love this medication. I have chronic migraines. It was nothing for me to have 5 in 3 days. I started this medicine and I have only have two migraines and it was nothing compared to what they used to be like. I only had one side effect my soda tasted funny. I don't drink soda any more... Easy fix. I've been on it for 4 months now. I would highly recommend it.",
                    "I really hated taking this medicine . At only 25 mg I was feeling like a zombie all day , very dizzy , confused , had a hard time putting sentences together . Very embarrassing I couldn't drive cause I was almost always crashing due to the. Lack of concentration. Also I was always angry . I didn't even want my kids to come near me :( that's when I decided to stop taking it. It really did help me loose weight but I rather loose weight on my own than to have to go through that nightmare again.",
                    "I have suffered from migraines for the past three years. I would wake up with a headache almost every single day and have a headache at least 27 days out of every month. I started taking just about a week ago and have only had one headache. I could not be any happier. I have had one strange side effect (a yeast infection), but that's a small price to pay for being headache free. I could not be happier.",
                    "I went on topiramate January 2012 for migraines with positive results. By the end of of 2012 I had lost 85lbs. I had also lost the ability to form sentences because I couldn't find words and was constantly in a fog. That is not good if you're a nurse. Also my short term memory was non existent also not good for an acute care medical nurse. By the time the side effects became debilitating, I had to take a short leave of absence to sort out my situation. In the end, the medication was discontinued and I gained 23lbs of the weight back. I'm not upset because now I have my short term memory back, plus I've returned to work migraine free. I'm still better off because I'm still thinner than before I started with topiramate.",
                    "I AM BACK......6 months gone! I'm at 162 pounds and I just started taking 200 mg, still no side effects my migraines are gone...am happy!!!....Good luck to all of you.>>>>\"I started this medication August 1st at that time I weighed 208 pounds today is the August 17 and I weigh 200 pnds and I'm only taking 50 mg I am supposed to go up to a 100 mg...I would say it's working for me, no side effect yet!...I will keep you informed!!! Thank you.",
                    "I weighed 230 pounds and felt like a cow.. I started off on 25 mg 1x a day and noticed no change. So asked doc to change me to 100 mg twice a day. I just take the 200mg at once. That's when I finally noticed a change. I've lost 45 pounds in 6 months! I'm continuing to lose and my goal weight is 160 since I'm tall so only 25 more pounds to go. I noticed at first pop tasted different but now it tastes fine. I used to love beer but now I don't want it..which is fine since it's so fattening lol. I only eat once or twice a day and the carb cravings are gone. I don't exercise much at all. I have no side effects at all. I'm so glad I found this medication it really has been a miracle. :)",

Took only 30 for days worked great but my blood pressure went from 128/78 before starting to 178/116 the day I stopped it . My Doctor told me it probably wasn't the Trokendi XR because there is no listing of raising blood pressure in the list of side effects, but 1 week after stopping it my BP is back to normal . USERS BEWARE !!!",

I do have some weight loss a plus for me and some tingerling in my feet but if you eat at least 2 bananas a fm day this really helps and make multi vitermins",

Next day was completely out of sorts, depth perception was off, felt outside myself, brain fog, headache, shaky, numbness in hands, burning in heals, no appetite, nothing tasted right, pop had no sweetness, next day same symptoms to a lessor extent with a constant tremor, overheating with movement, confusion, mood swings and horrible mental fog, then a headache hitting about 9 out of 10, worse than my average. I decided to discontinue that evening. The next day felt hungover, had light sensitivity, diarrhea and an upset stomach. Next day, the cloud slowly has lifted, my taste buds have not returned yet and pretty fatigued.",
                    "As I type this it is hard to relay it understandably because of the Topamax. I researched Topamax and heard it suppressed eating and stabilized mood which I figured would helped my bulimia, which I have been getting help for and am in recovery for. The Topamax definitely suppresses the desire to eat and have cravings which is great. You do lose weight. However, it created other problems. I didn't realize it but I was increasingly having a harder time talking to people. I can't do homework, write papers, and my relationship with my boyfriend- we ended breaking up. My hair falls out. I had bad anxiety, I thought I was going insane. I then researched side effects of Topamax and now realized this is what I am experiencing. I'm getting off.",
                    "I have Tourette's Syndrome and ADHD. Tried different kinds of medicines for my TS. Depending on my day, I could have some to a lot of tics. Topamax did wonders for my tics, but it can have side effects that are similar to ADHD symptoms - different remembering some words/names when asked, unable to concentrate, etc. I also experienced that my thought-pattern were kind of limited to a certain degree, as I would sometimes have difficulties thinking further ahead. This medicine however, was much better than other kinds I've tried. ",
                    "I was prescribed this medicine to treat my petite mal seizures. I was never warned of any potential side-effects, and never thought to ask, seeing as I had never taken a medicine before. After I began taking this, my seizures graduated to full out grand mal seizures. I couldn't speak, I couldn't understand others' speech, and I couldn't sleep more than a few hours most nights. Everything came to a heads about four months after I began taking the medicine, when I couldn't remember how to say \"Bye\" to my dad. I would have rather had seizures EVERY day than stay on Topamax! I got off of the medicine, and am now on Lamictal, under which I haven't had any seizures or side-effects in the two years I've been taking it.",
                    "After 2 years of terrible 3 days disabling migraines I did have a break from the migraines with this medicine. It took 2 months to decrease pain from 8 to 2. I do have to follow a very strict diet , I use the pre-diabetic diet even though I'm not have diabetes.",
                    "I was prescribed Topamax as a preventative migraine med. It was effective in significantly reducing migraine. However it gave me insanely severe sinus/hayfever symptoms. I couldn't leave the house because my nose was running like a tap. I was sneezing all the time and totally stuffed up. I got all the other usual digestive upset side effects, but I could live with those as they seemed to reduce as time went on whereas the sinus problems intensified.",
                    "I was suffering from migraine, 10 times a month on average during late 2014. I have been always suffering from Migraine for years, but it was more frequently than before. I consulted a doctor in Dubai, educated in Sweden and Canada, a very successful doctor. He prescribed Topamax, for 6 months. In 2 months, I ended up going into depression, first time in my life! I had to quit the medicine as I was travelling to UK, and forgot taking the medicine with me and they don't sell this without prescription. After quitting, depression gone. I thought this is coincidence. Until I saw the doctor again, again prescribed Topamax. Again, after 2 months - depression. Mood swings, almost suicidal thoughts - I quit, depression gone. NOT RECOMMENDED!!",

                    "This drug isn't for everyone. The side effects are completely crazy. I have been on it for almost 12 months now. It has provided relief from migraines by almost 95% of the time. This has been a big deal for me. Side effects I've experienced: hands and feet tingle periodically (some days are worse than others), hair loss started 3 months after taking it but began to cease 6 months later, definite brain fog (some days I feel like I'm losing my mind), grogginess (I can only take my dose at night otherwise I'm a zombie during the day), changes in vision, loss of appetite, fatigue, irritability. At first I convinced myself the side effects were worth tolerating compared to having a migraine. But as time goes on, I'm beginning to think im wrong",
                    "This pretty much saved my life. I've been on EVERYTHING (or so it seems) for major depressive disorder and when I was about 32 something wasn't adding up and I was diagnosed BP2. I tried Lamictal and I couldn't handle the headaches. The other BP medications all seem to cause weight gain so I'd stop taking them. I got a new doctor who said if I tried lithium she would give me a little Topiramate to help offset the hunger the lithium caused. Well, the topiramate seemed to help the BP2. So I've slowly worked up to 150/day topiramate along with wellbutrin and Lexapro. It's a GODSEND. Side effects: when titrating up at any point, tingly fingers or feet for a week but then goes away. Take at night because can make you sleepy. Hope FDA approves!",
                    "I was placed on this for Miragine prevention. The weight loss was cool, but the resulting High Blood Pressure not cool. So much so that I was not able to be put on birth control medication. I am no longer on this medication and still am suffering from HBP. I do not smoke or drink and my blood pressure was perfect before starting this medication.",
                    "I started this medication at the suggestion of my neurologist in June 2016. I was overweight and having frequent migraines. I started on 25mg and increased by 25 mg every week until I was at 100 mg. I started to notice slow weight loss at first, and my migraines were instantly better. The weight loss definitely increased once I got to 100mg. After the one month mark the doctor increased me to 125mg and the wight loss slowly continued. As of now I am down 27lbs and still going! As some have said the side effects of \"word soup\" and tingling in my hands and feet have all happened, but they have all worn off once I have become used to the increased dosage (which is a good and bad thing). I'll be talking with the dr soon! Good luck everyone!",
                    "I still get slight headaches once in a while, and use Excedrin Migraine with the Topamax, but its nothing compared to what I had. The side effects go away and the ones that don't, you get used to. I still have memory problems, so I had to lower the dose.",
                    "I was given Topiramate for a list of conditions including Fibromyalgia, Migraines, Weight Loss, and tremors. I was prescribed only 25 mg 1 X a day. As for side effects, I have found that many foods do not taste the same including yogurt and cottage cheese. They tasted old or out dated. I don't usually drink carbonated beverages, but those I have, tasted fine. I had a decrease in appetite beginning the first month, but only realized it upon looking back after a weigh in at my doctors office where I had lost 20 lbs. I had no migraine episodes during that first month, my Fibromyalgia had improved only slightly and my tremors improved also slightly. After 6 months, I had lost a total of 30 lbs with out trying as my appetite had decreased.",

I also lost 100 lbs with very little exercise . I thought it was due to my not eating carbs.. Lolol. I stopped the topirimate and immediately put on 30 lbs. Well you can bet I pulled those pills back out of my meds box qjd am now going to take them !!! And maybe my migraines will let up a little. I stopped the pills because I was cutting down on all the meds and thought I could go without .. No more of that !!",

                    "After suffering with migraines for over 10 years Topamax has been a life saver. I had tried several other medicines but they would only work for a while and then stop working for me all together. I have been on Topamax for over a year now and went from 4 or 5 migraines a month to one every couple of months. I am currently taking 200mg/day (100mg in the morning and evening).

I'm about to make the step up to 200mg. I went up in weekly steps of 25mg. My doctor told me this was best and that there is a serious skin condition and an eye disease that can result from jumping up to a high dose too quickly, so I suggest asking your doctors about a slow triation to achieve maximum benefit and avoid fogginess.",
                    "After menopause, migraines soared to three per week. Top ax 50 mgs daily has been a miracle drug. Not one headache in 18 months. One side effect is dry eyes and dry mouth. Easy to live with that in lieu of disabling migraines that eroded my life.",

                    "I started getting migraines when I was about 12 years old. I had terrible migraines on and off for about 3 years. I finally went to the doctor and he put me on Topamax. I have been taking it for about a year now and the only time I get migraines is when I don't refill my prescription right away. Even though I get the occasional migraine, it is nothing compared to what it was before I started taking the medicine. Also, I have not noticed any side effects. Topamax is a miracle!",
                    "First- there is absolutely no difference between brand and generic. There can't be legally. It is the same active ingredient and the same strength. It's just the name and cost and inactive ingredinets.  This being said... I don't understand where negative remarks come from. This medicine is amazing. I took it a while ago then asked to be changed to something else. I gained 20lbs and the other med didn't so anything. So I asked to be changed back. My leg muscles hurt and I have a few word issues but it's an amazing medicine.",
                    "Been on the medicine since 2010 and lost 20 pounds. It doesn't work for everyone. I watched what I ate did a lot of walking and it didn't help. I take 100mg 2x a day. Not happy!",
                    "I like others have found a great medicine in Topamax. I am 45 and have had headaches/migraines since I was a kid. Been on it about 4 months and gone are the daily headaches, shooting head pains, and many days of debilitating migraines. I am just starting to lose weight. I have the head fog and the loss for words. My tongue tingling has gone and mostly I just have the \"falling asleep\" of my fingers and toes, which is annoying, but manageable. I am on 100mg a day. I am hoping that this will take me through menopause.",

Over the years (I'm now 55) I have tried many drugs for the treatment of or prevention of migraines. I get the classic vascular migraine with an aura each time I get a migraine. I finally was prescribed Topamax as a preventative, the final dose that worked was 75mg in am and 75mg in pm. My migraines went from daily to MAYBE once a month. I took this for 3 years at least. I was just at the point of quitting it when I lost my job so I had no choice. The reason I was quitting it was that I lost SO MUCH WEIGHT that I looked anorexic! And soon realized that my memory was HORRIBLE!",
                    "Great for migraine prevention, but NOT WORTH THE SIDE EFFECTS. Constant anxiety, panic attacks, insomnia, nerve zaps, tingling, numbness, visual disturbances, memory loss, brain fog, you name it. Ruined my life for a good month and I was only on 50 mg. Currently tapering off and already feeling better!",
                    "After taking 300mgs (100mg AM/200mg PM) for three years, it's no longer working. When I first went on it, it worked great for both mood stabilization and weight control. I lost all the weight that I gained after being on Zyprexa and Depakote, and my moods were controlled well for about two and a half years. I had minimal negative side effects that seemed to fade after a few months' use. For the last six months I've been struggling with dosage adjustments and adding new drugs to my cocktail while trying to keep Topamax. Finally I'm giving up and going off Topamax because it's not doing anything anymore. ",
                    "Started Tomamax at 25 mg Sept 2nd. Had constant dizziness right away all day and night. Stuck to it as it was slightly decreasing my migraines. Had to cancel a follow up apt with Neurologist due to an emergency and would take about a month to get back in so I was now on it for 6 weeks at the 25 mgs. A week before my apt while at work I started stuttering really bad and just couldn't put my sentences together and was very out of it. My supervisor took me to the ER thinking I was having a stroke. They did both a CT scan and a brain MRI but they were clean. I continued for another week same symptoms. Stopped the Topamax and it has all gone away.",

Topiramate makes you less hungry, the rest is up to you. (I did get some brain fog.) I took magnesium and biotin, as the reduced appetite can cause nutritional deficiencies in some that can give you hair loss if you aren't careful and the magnesium helps you \"go\"! If you're taking that Topiramate at night, a small dose of melatonin every few days (if you take melatonin consistently every night your own pineal gland will stop producing it and you'll have more sleep probs!)",

                    "Had taken this medication for a short while, it did alleviate my migraines, unfortunately it caused such severe insomnia I was lucky to get 4 hours of sleep a night. I lost 10 lbs within 14 days which was nice but dropping the weight that fast caused major stomach issues. I never had the tingling others have had though. If it wasn't for the weight loss and insomnia it could have been a miracle migraine medicine!",
                    "I was put on topiramate for my chronic migraines. I have been taking it for 3.5 years and this was the third preventative medicine I tried. It works! I used to get at least 15 migraines in a month and now I don't even get 15 migraines a year. Some side effects that I have noticed are a decreased appetite and it makes me forget words. When I started it I weighed 165 (which I gained 35 pounds from amitriptyline) and now I am down to 115. A lot of that weight was lost from healthy eating and exercising, but it curbs my appetite a lot and I don't feel the need to impulsively eat in between meals or snack. I also have noticed that it makes my brain foggy and it makes me forget words mid-sentence. Other than that, it saved my life!!",
                    "I cannot recommend this medication. Yes it did prevent migraines but the side-effects far outweighed the benefit. My doctor put me on a gradual increase in dosage and I was unable to get past the first week. After a couple of days I lost control of my own thoughts and focused on every negative I my mind could come up with. My work was impacted. I work in an accounting office and lost my ability to count and remember the alphabet. Not to mention I would stop talking in mid-sentence quite often. I knew what I needed to say but my mouth just wouldn't do it. My short term memory was non-existent and I decided to stop taking this medication after I forgot where I was driving to on my way to work; the same place I've been to for the last 9 years.",
                    "Like many of you, I've suffered since I was a teenager with migraines 3-5 times a week. Some would be so serious I would end up in the hospital a few times a year. I even lost a job because of my migraines. I had to plan my life around them. Now at 35, I've been on Topamax for 6 years and it's changed my world. It's given me a life back. I'll still get an occasional headache that requires me to break out the Imitrex, but nothing serious. I haven't had too many problems with side effects other then having a little less quick recall/memory, but not enough to really matter. Potassium seems to help with the side effects. My main side effect is getting rash/hives from overheating. ",
                    "I started taking Topamax in January of 2012 for migraines, I was getting one a day. I did experience the brain fog at first, but I found that after about a month or two, I was mostly back to normal. I have experienced the weight loss and loss of appetite, and I'm also lactose intolerant, so I'm trying to work on eating a healthy amount. I have found that drinking a lot of water really helps with the tingly feeling in my feet and hands!",
                    "I used to be on this when it was brand-name, and now I'm on it as a generic. I've found pros and cons with each. With the brand name, I felt like it worked better, but it gave me horrible problems with confusion. I would drive home from work and sometimes not even remember the drive home. I felt completely drugged. When the generic came out, I was switched to it. It didn't make me loopy like the brand name did, but I didn't think it worked as well either. I get more migraines on it by a lot than I got on brand name Topamax and I think I'm on the highest dose. I take one 200 mg pill in the morning and one 200 mg pill at night.",
                    "I was on topamax for a month and lost 6lbs. I could handle the tingling in my hands and feet but I stopped taking it because my period never stopped! It started the day after my first dose and ended three days after I stopped taking topamax. I do have the birth control Implanon implanted in my arm. So maybe those drugs combined doesn't work well. I still had migraines but they weren't intense.",
                    "I am bipolar ii with anxiety and depression but was put on topomax because I suffer from migraines. The first time was before I was diagnosed and I got severely depressed and had a suicide attempt. Within a week of getting taken off of it I was better. The second time I was put on it was after I was diagnosed and put on mood stabilizers and my doctor wanted to try it again because he thought my depression may have been from my bpd not the meds and it really did help my migraines. Same exact thing happened. Within a few weeks of being on it my mild bipolar disorder was uncontrollable. I wish I could be on it because it really helped my head and counteracted weight gain from my other meds but my body just cannot handle it.",

My mind is a bit cloudy but it too is also a bit better by the end of the week. On the positive I have had no tingling in my fingers and toes like many reviews I have read. Carbonated drinks taste terrible. I was a Diet Pepsi ahololic , and should stop drinking it anyway. And without out any other dietary changes I went from 210 to 206 this week! So, now I am going to eat healthier this week and see what happens. Rating a 9 only because of the fatigue. Good luck in your journey!",
                    "I was prescribed topamax as a migraine preventative & had a terrible experience from it. Not only did it fail to prevent migraines, it made me develop kidney stones. I had never had one before using this awful drug,which also made me feel constantly tired & forgetful. The worst part is that once you kidney stones your body is more susceptible to getting them again & you most certainly will. For anyone unfamiliar with the pain from kidney stoned I can assure you it is sheer agony. And even worse is the hellacious migraine that lasts for days that comes along with it. It's so bad that even medicines like imitrex won't work on it. There are blogs & websites which tell of the awful experiences people have had with this drug. Beware.",

I did experience side effects such as tingling in heels, constantly tired, diarrhea, weight loss and change in taste (specifically with carbonated beverages). I was recently hospitalized for a separate issue and the doctor's would not let me take topiramate. I ended up discontinuing it all together to see how I would adapt. I noticed that the diarrhea I was experiencing was not IBS like I had thought, but because of topiramate. It was terrible and I had  previously been taking an anti-diarrheal about 5 days a week. I feel like I've got my life back since discontinuing.",

Now I can't even stand the taste, just after one dose. My mouth has also been tingling all day and I ate just one pop tart and got extremely full. Reading every one else's reviews is comforting. I am also still on propranolol because my migraines were coming back.",

                    "I have to say that the side effects are pretty harsh, but you have to remember that migraines are pretty debilitating and make life unbearable. I'll take forgetting words rather than having 20 or more migraines a month. The first month of taking the med is the absolute worst, but your doctor should strongly warn you and advise you that this will happen and encourage you to work through it. I kept remembering her words and am glad I did. started slowly, with 25 mg in the morning, working up to 25 mg twice a day, then 50 mg at night with 25 in the morning, then up to 50 mg twice a day by the end of the month. Never ever start bing bang boom all at once, or you won't want to continue. Maybe for those who quit, you could try again.",
                    "I wish I would have read these reviews before I started taking topamax instead of wandering around like a clueless zombie wondering what the hell was wrong with me. As of now I have no solution to my chronic migraines but what else is new, this is the story of my life. Topamax surly isn't the solution. I have no clue if topamax would have worked if taken longer but the side effects are not worth it. Even their website says they are unclear as to how it works. Wtf. I basically felt like I was moving around with no destination.. I couldn't focus, I felt lost, I kept doing things on repeat. I can't live like that. My driving was off. My sight was blury. The pins and needles feeling's in my hands and feet was just awkward and inconvenient.",

Piece of cake to reduce by half, in a matter of days, with zero effort. 46 year smoker. Had to stop before ever reached full dosage. Almost went to ER, to have myself admitted for psych treatment. (Also lost 20lbs., in one month, with no effort.) Trust me - I would have loved to have stayed on it. Some effects - mild paranoia, visual and auditory hallucinations, cry at drop if a hat, intense sense of insecurity, inadequacy, fear of loss of self-control. 3 months later, still smoking about 25% less and 10lbs loss. Other side effects I can't recall, except acne and weird skin rash.",

This led to my GPA plummeting after years of hard work to keep myself on the Dean's List, severely decreased my scores on the GRE, and decreased my chances of getting into graduate school. I'm off the pills now and looking for a different option; there is no way I can keep my job in tech support if I start the pills again. ",

I had a very difficult time comprehending very basic stuff. I was put on it for my headaches I've dealt with for near 2 decades. My dr took me off my medication I've been on for 18 years suddenly, which has worked for my heaches, and switched me to Topimax. I decided to push through because I was no longer getting my medication that worked for me and I kept being told that the brain fog would get better wich it has the past 2 weeks.

My migraines all but stopped after a month of being on the medication and at the lowest dose. I had all the side effects - tingling, weight loss (very happy about it too), forgetting certain words and the nasty taste of soda. That was okay because I only drink it very rarely anyway. I was getting 1-2 migraines a week and now, I may have 1-2 a year. Most of the side effect seemed to have faded with time as well. Very, very pleased with this medication.",

We took her completely off every other drug, and started her on Topamax as a solitary treatment and within 30 days she was a new person, and has been stable on Topamax now for over 5 years.

I felt like I had a million bugs crawling through my skin and I couldn't see clearly. I have friends who this has worked for but for me it did not",

But my nausea \"attacks\" are totally debilitating and the headaches get more so every day. I took Topamax starting at 25 mgs then increased. I noticed it really helping my symptoms, way less nausea, headaches stopped and I could sleep well.  Unfortunately, I am one of the people who react with a rare side effect of an acute onset closed angle glaucoma attack and my vision got very blurry and got so bad I could not see anything but blobs if it was more that 12 inches from my face. If you get blurred vision go to the ER and show them the letter from the Topamax website, because ER had never heard of that reaction. I gave it a 5 because it worked until then.",

Note: This doubled dosage was done 4 MONTHS after initially being prescribed the medicine. 100 mg of generic Topiramate made me feel wired. An hour later, I could be found with a full cart at the grocery store.The manic in me had returned. This was not a coincidence. I took the dosage at 75 mg the following day out of curiosity.. The compulsive cleaner had returned. My b/f at the time watched me scrub away at an already squeaky clean countertop.  This medicine eventually will also begin to make you stutter.

My worst side effect is the stumbling and grasping for words. My kids die laughing. So do I. My husband doesn't understand that part but it's ok. As long as the headaches don't come. I still have small, treatable headaches (part of another problem that I hope soon goes away). Topamax is my hero. Take away my car, my clothes, my house...but don't take away my Topamax.",

I took it before bed as instructed, however I did not sleep at all for the duration of taking the pill. My nose would run randomly-like mid conversation with clients at work. I felt high, lethargic, irritable, and when not working laid around like a bump on a log. Not possible to function on this stuff with anything or anyone that required my undivided attention.

Serious appetite loss. I've been on this medication for 9 months and lost a total of 43 pounds. I have to take in the morning otherwise I cannot sleep. It also helps with my OCD tendencies.

                    "Worked wonderful to get rid of my headaches! For the first time in nine years I didn't have daily headaches. The side effects were awful though!! Ringing in the ears, dizziness, flushing, numb face/hands/arms/feet, the list goes on and on. My doctor had to wean me off of it.",
                    "I began taking Topamax about a year ago after suffering from weekly migraines since age 15. I increased the dose to 200mg a day before it seemed to be a therapeutic dose for me. My migraines reduced a lot for a long time but I also do not drink alcohol, caffeine, or eat chocolate, cheese. The last few weeks my migraines are back with great intensity. One lasted 4 days. So I will be going back to my doctor. Topamax did not affect my appetite at all. I get occasional tingling.",
                    "Although this medicine helps you fall asleep, you will not stay asleep. I would get a migraine an hour into my slumber then toss & turn all night and of course the cranky morning ensues. This med caused more migraines for me, stomach pain, and less sleep and that hardly outweighs my regular migraine schedule of pain three days in a row. More pain does not equal beneficial.",
                    "Topamax is an uncertainty at this time. I took it decades ago and because no med or mixture of meds controls seizures sufficiently for me I'm circling back. I've noticed major neurological feelings (e.g., tingling) transmitting down my legs to the point that it keeps me awake for many hours, which results in sleep deprivation and then seizure activity. It's not good at night. One reason I stopped the med years ago is because it can cause kidney stones. Not anything I want on top of seizures plus the tingling, foginess, and fatigue caused by Topamax.",
                    "I've had migraines since I was 25 (am now 68) and my life was hell until I discovered Topomax 18 months ago. I must be one of the lucky ones because I didn't have any horrible side effects, just some mild finger tingling. I lost a little appetite but made no difference (I'm slim anyway and probably lost 5 pounds), otherwise... it has been a miracle!! I started with 25mg, increased to 50, then to 100, didn't like it, went back to 50 and am now on 25 again and feel great. Sometimes I also take the generic and have no problem at all.",
                    "Was rx'd for migraine control and prevention. Worked. But the painful tingling in my hands and feet was so extreme, I couldn't handle it. It also messed me up with some outrageous severe insomnia, and that's one thing that I can't have any more out of control. Even with Lunesta and other hefty sleep aids I was a mess, no sleep at all. I'm just now hearing how it helps with weight loss, which Id love to get advantages from, but the side effects weren't worth it at all.",
                    "We tried this for my daughter when she suddenly started getting migraines every day. Migraines down to 2 per week and less severe but when we tried increasing the dose side effects became intolerable: doesn't help her sleep at night yet makes her very tired all day, have to force her to eat, her legs tingle all the way up to her hip. She also has nightmares, and vivid dreams, even during the day. That was the last straw and we'll be trying something else. Real shame because we think it was helping.",
                    "I take 25mg in the morning and 50 at night. Within the first two weeks of taking it, I tried to commit suicide, I was fighting major depression at the time too. By week four the feeling went away. Took 2-3 months for the fingers and toes to stop tingling but I had that in the toes any ways from nerve damage in the back. They increased my evening dose and within two weeks again I tried to commit suicide again. This time twice in one week and within a month I stabilized again. My doctor will not raise it anymore even though I just begged her to, it's only day 7-21 that I need to be watched and the last time, I called my sister to take me to the hospital the second attempt.I didn't lose weight on it.",
                    "After so many years of trying I finally start to function as a ( almost) normal human being. Topamax is my lifesaver.",
                    "I get more than 9 migraines a month. I know it's 9 because I was first given sumatriptan for them and only 9 every 30 days... I just started my first dose an hour ago doing 50mg total half a day then other half at night. Going to try it that way instead of morning because I'm terrified of the fog and driving confusion since I work full time an hour away from home... Anyways I weigh 184lbs... Weighed 100-107 from age 14-23 maybe even younger than I got addicted painkillers and when I got sober I gained a good 80 lbs! I feel so gross I can't see my damn girl parts haha so after hearing this migraine pill can make me lose weight I'm super excited and hope to get back to 120lb ... I will def. update! -Steph",
                    "I have took Lyrica and it did not help but trokendi xr has helped my fibro more than any med the Dr. Has ever given me. It needs to be used more often, because it really helps.",
                    "I've been on Topiramate for 3 weeks now and my migraines have stopped. I had them everyday. And I lost weight 5 pounds in this 3 weeks. Coke taste weird too not the same taste. I've notice I eat less junk food as well. So I'm happy with it.",
                    "I just started taking Topamax a little over 2 weeks ago. I am up to 100 mg a day. I am starting to really notice some short term memory issues, however I have not had a migraine, let alone a single headache since starting the medicines. Everything has started tasting weird since starting the 100mg dose. I used to drink at least 4 cups of coffee a day and can't stand to drink it at all. The bonus is that it has helped with the caffeine withdrawal. I am also a smoker and it has helped reduce my craving for tobacco! I have read a lot of the posts on here and am seriously concerned about many of the side effects such as hair loss. However the weight loss aspect is really appealing. I haven't lost anything yet though.",
                    "I hate this med. it is super cruel and I don't recommend it to ANYONE. I have been taking it for a few months, and it hasn't helped much with my headaches. The side effects are brutal. I have no appetite, and I am basically forcing myself to eat. I've almost passed out 5 times this week from not eating enough, and lost 30 pounds thanks to it. It also causes severe gum irritation which SUCKS with braces, and it makes you really foggy and hard to concentrate. I will say Qudexy helps with seizures, but nothing else.",
                    "I have been on Topiramate for several years in combination with gabapentin for seizures and migraines. Then my neurologist put me on 400mg topiramate to stop the breakthrough seizures. It works great. I lost 60 pounds. But I do have side effects of tingling, confusion, loss of words. However all that is better than seizures.",
                    "I've been on 50 mg of Topamax for a month now and it's changed everything for me. I went from having a headache every day for the past 2 years to not having a single one. I was skeptical at first because of the possibility of weight loss, as I am already very small. So far I have had no side effects. It truly has been a life saver.",
                    "LOVE ! Honestly. In the beginning, I did want to get off this medication. Some of the side effects for the first couple months are just annoying, but I was able to push through them. I was overweight at the time of starting this too for my migraines, and my migraines/headaches were SO BAD. But I was able to lose some weight from it too, which is nice. The most annoying side effect in my opinion would be the tingling in the tips of the fingers and toes, only lasted maybe 2-3 months for me. After that they faded and they're gone. After about a month a half of using this drug my headaches subsided quickly, now I'm migraine and headache free completely. I will forever take this medication as long as my Neuro says its okay too.",
                    "I took this medicine off and on for years. And I can honestly say it has helped my migraines tremendously. I suffer from migraines with the aura, and while off Topamax they come in weekly clusters. About once every couple of months I will have a week from hell. On Topamax I have one attack every couple of months. BUT, the side effects are unbearable.",
                    "This medicine changed my life. I went from bedridden to active. I still get flare ups, but I can function in them now. My pain is greatly reduced. I no longer have constant flu like symptoms or muscle spasms. My pain has been reduced to a dull ache and I can manage without narcotics. I unfortunately did show the rare side effect of hair loss. I solved that by cutting it short and dying it purple! Topamax is also sold as a diet pill, so I also lost about 40 pounds, which is helpful for a lot of fibromyalgia patients since we tend to gain weight from lack of activity or taking meds like Lyrica . In fact, I ended up on Topamax because my insurance wouldn't cover Lyrica. Best thing to ever happen to me since I became ill!"

                    "//What is it?//Headache and migraine are different entities. Migraine is one of the most common and well characterized, but there are 14 broad categories that can be subdivided into more than 200 different forms. Migraine itself has about 20 different genres. In general, headaches are divided into two large groups: primary and secondary. Primary illnesses correspond to a disease, not reflecting other health problems and represent around 90% of the total. Secondary symptoms are symptoms of diseases of the nervous system or other organs of the human body. They can occur in cases of flu, alcohol poisoning or withdrawal, minor head trauma, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels) or a high blood pressure crisis. Migraine is a primary headache in which very intense episodes of pain occur interspersed with periods without symptoms. In general, it begins between the ages of 15 and 40, but it can appear in childhood or shortly after the first menstruation. If it appears for the first time after the age of 45, other causes must be excluded. Some of its characteristics are closely associated with the female reproductive cycle: higher prevalence after the first menstruation or during the menstrual period; occasional worsening due to taking birth control pills or hormone therapy; attenuation or disappearance during pregnancy or menopause. Before adolescence, migraines affect boys and girls equally. From then on, it is two to three times more common in females. It is estimated that 8% to 15% of individuals living in Western countries (including Portugal) suffer from this problem. The fact of reaching people in the productive phase implies large economic, social and family costs.//Symptoms//It appears recurrently, several times throughout life, but always with completely free intervals. If it occurs every day, it is probably overuse of painkillers or other medications. Drug abuse can convert a migraine into a chronic daily headache. There are people who preferably appear on the weekend. These crises can be precipitated by changes in sleep schedule, failure to eat breakfast, reduced stress or alcohol abuse. In these cases, it is important to consider a lifestyle change over the weekend. The symptoms are intense and often prevent work or study. The pain tends to be throbbing, worsening with physical exertion or head movements. In general, it affects only one side of the head, and is accompanied by nausea, vomiting, intolerance to light, noise and some smells. It is not mandatory that all of these elements are present simultaneously. And they can occur twice a week or just a few throughout a lifetime. During attacks, people seek a dark, quiet place to rest or fall asleep. An episode can last from a few hours to three days. Between attacks, there are usually no complaints. Some types of migraines may have more complex symptoms (with aura). These forms are less common, affecting around 15% of people with this problem, and include transient neurological symptoms, originating attributable to certain areas of the brain. The other signs are identical to those of migraine without aura. The most common auras are temporary vision disorders, in the form of loss of vision on one side of the visual field, blurred images, perception of bright points, geometric figures or bright zigzags. Other auras can be translated as tingling or numbness on one side of the face or one of the hands. There are people who have difficulty speaking or even temporary paralysis of their limbs, usually only on one side of the body. These changes last about 10 to 30 minutes and precede the pain. In children, migraines tend to be bilateral, less intense and of shorter duration. Vomiting and dark circles can be exuberant. Disturbances in sleep and meal schedules are common precipitating factors. Treating these crises is easier than in adults. Sleep usually gives good results. At these ages, the occipital location is not normal and, when present, requires a medical consultation. Likewise, the presence of headaches with morning vomiting or other unusual symptoms in very young children should be seen by a healthcare professional.//Causes//It is caused by a combination of brain processes: excitation/depression of cells, dilation of arteries and release of chemicals. People with migraine are more sensitive to certain stimuli, environmental or from their own body, that can trigger these brain processes. It is also thought that there is some genetic susceptibility. Some individuals can identify the signs of their attacks. The most common are cheese, chocolate, strawberries, seafood, wine, artificial sauces, changes in sleep patterns, stress, menstruation, fasting, physical exercise, and minor trauma. Others cannot identify them at all. People who drink coffee regularly may experience headaches when they stop this habit.//Diagnosis//The key to diagnosis lies in the clinical history, physical and neurological examination. Observation of the fundus is a very important part of these procedures. In some cases, it may be necessary to resort to computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to exclude other diseases.//Treatment//Migraines have no cure but can be controlled. There are medications and behaviors that can reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks. Symptomatic treatment, during acute periods, involves resting in a quiet, dark place. Pressure or cold can be applied to the area of \u200b\u200bpain. At this stage, analgesics, anti-inflammatories, antiemetics and triptans are very useful.//Prevention//People with migraines should create calendars that allow them to identify their symptoms and assess their impact on their quality of life. The first step in prevention is to identify and eliminate precipitating factors, whenever possible. In some cases, it is necessary to use daily medication to reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks, but there are no drugs specifically developed for their prevention. However, there are some drugs used in other contexts that have proven to be effective, such as beta-blockers, antidepressants or antiepileptics, and these should always be prescribed by a doctor.

                    "//What is it?//It is a neurological disease that involves the nervous system. Epilepsy is defined as the occurrence of at least two episodes of seizures that are not related to alcohol withdrawal, hypoglycemia, heart problems or other conditions. In some cases, one seizure is enough to diagnose epilepsy, provided there is a high risk of more occurring. Seizures result from a change in the electrical activity of the brain and may result from trauma, familial tendencies, or have no identifiable cause. This activity or discharge has an unpredictable onset and is, in general, of short duration (seconds to minutes, rarely exceeding 15 minutes) with normal brain functioning maintained between attacks. These tend to recur over time, with frequency varying between patients. Epilepsy affects several mental and physical functions and is a very common condition, occurring in around 65 million people worldwide. In the United States, it is the fourth most common neurological disease, surpassed only by migraine, stroke and Alzheimer's disease. In Portugal, it is estimated that it affects four to seven thousand inhabitants. However, the number of individuals who, although not epileptic, may have a seizure during their lifetime is approximately one in every 20. It is more common in very young or elderly people, but can occur at any age. Although treatment allows many patients to live with this condition, for others the seizures are uncontrollable and affect their quality of life in all its aspects.//Symptoms//Epilepsy does not manifest itself in the same way in all patients, and can occur in simple or complex seizures. Furthermore, they depend on the location of the discharge focus in the brain, and can affect gait, face, specific activities, or cause various types of alteration in the state of consciousness, often accompanied by automatic, unplanned movements (getting dressed or undressed, walking, chewing or swallowing). They can occur during sleep and the patient may be conscious or not remember anything after the seizure ends. Seizures themselves can be of different types, with muscles being relaxed, contracted or showing spasmodic movements. Some exhibit signs that precede them (aura) while others occur without warning.//Causes//In a large number of cases it is not possible to determine a cause. But any injury that reaches the brain can leave a \"scar\" that is a potential starting point for epileptic seizures.//Diagnosis//Diagnosis is a complex process that involves several steps. The clinical history, neurological examination and laboratory tests are generally the first steps, as they allow the occurrence of seizures unrelated to the disease to be ruled out. Electroencephalogram, magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography scans allow the exploration of possible causes. Finding the origin of epilepsy is very important because it allows the selection of the most appropriate treatment.//Treatment//Treatment must be highly personalized, taking into account the patient's own risks and the dangers of further seizures. It is therefore important to consider the patient's age, the characteristics of the seizures, associated factors and the patient's social and professional context. Many antiepileptic drugs have significant side effects and this risk requires careful consideration. In some cases, one type of medication is sufficient, but for other patients, it may be necessary to combine several. As a rule, treatment is started with a reduced dose of the selected medication, with a gradual adjustment based on the clinical response. The goal is not to cure epilepsy but to control the occurrence of seizures. For this to be successful, good cooperation from the patient is essential, since in some cases, the patient may have to stop the treatment after a period of time without seizures. When medications are not effective, alternatives such as a ketogenic diet or surgery may be considered: The ketogenic diet uses a high percentage of fat, few proteins and carbohydrates and a total suppression of sugar. Creates a metabolic state called \u201cketosis\u201d, which appears to reduce epilepsy seizures;;/ The surgery aims to remove the areas of the brain responsible for the electrical discharges or to interrupt the transmission of the electrical signal. Stimulation of the vagus nerve is performed using a small device surgically implanted under the skin, just below the collarbone, and allows the desynchronization of convulsive activity in the brain.;/ For each case, the neurologist decides which path to follow.//Prevention//Seizures are often associated with specific triggers or changes in daily routines, such as: Stress;/ Anxiety;/ Excessive alcohol consumption;/ Tobacco;/ Changes in sleep rhythm;/ Tiredness;/ Changes in ongoing medication;/ Very intense stimuli (bright lights, television, video, computer);/ Hormonal changes in women;/ Some of them can be avoided.

But most people can live a normal life if the disease is properly controlled. There are several types of epilepsy, so treatment varies from case to case.

The first month was great then on October 21st my resting heart rate went from 61 to 70 and when I walk it suddenly goes to 140 for no reason. I work out 6 days a week and it doesn't make any sence to me. Going back to my doctor tomorrow to figure it out. I just don't see why all of a sudden it would make things 10x worse. I didn't take it today to see if it would help. I was able to exersice without my heart rate sky rocketing to ridiculous numbers. This is the first medication like this I have ever taken. Plus the weight gain is ridiculous. I lost 15 lbs before starting this medication and less then 2 months I gained it all back.",

I take 25mg. in the morning, and 25mg. about 11 hours later. The medicine has stopped my PVC's, and also slows down my heart rate.

He sent me home to suffer with it. A couple of weeks ago I made an appt. with the clinic and the most wonderful nurse practioner started me on Metoprolol 25 mg/2x daily and \"I FEEL GREAT!\" I couldn't believe how my heart calmed down, my anxiety was relieved, I SLEPT BETTER b/c it stopped the night time AFIB attacks which constantly woke me up in the middle of the night and i just feel much more comfortable in my own skin...I actually cleaned the house without any huffing, puffing or the usual AFIB attack.

However, @ 25mg I still have bouts of high readings, so when I see my PCP this week, she might raise it to 50mg. I will say that I prefer to see a Cardiologist for this because I am terrified of exercising. Yes, I know exercise and weight loss can lower my bp to healthy levels, but I can't understand I can exert myself while having high bp. Shouldn't it first be controlled with meds first before exercising?",

                    "I have been on some form of metoprolol for seven years. It was actually my first prescribed medication at 28. I never even thought about side effects as being the problems I was experiencing; thought there was always something else that the Doctor's was overlooking. Now that I have read these comments, I suffer from most of the common ones; tiredness, weakness, trouble losing weight, strange dreams, increased sweating, difficulty breathing, etc. Have had numerous tests off and on for the last two years, and nothing is ever found. I have also since then started taking clonidine and amlodipine. Some of these symptoms are probably drug interactions. I noticed a chaotic heartbeat when clonidine was added to the medicines. It has gotten worse for the past two years.",

At times though I have spells that usually run less than a few minutes with a heart rate of around 190 plus and pain. My worst battle with this level lasted about 15 minutes. I take 50mg of Metoprolol 2 times a day on a regular basis but add another 50 if I have the biggies and that settles the heart rate down quickly. Luckily I have no side affects but would love to find something else that quickly slows the heart rate ... mainly to avoid the pain and spooky stuff that goes a;long with it.

I take blood pressure and pulse 2times/ day and it is averaging 107/71, pulse 63- working well. It took me a good 4 weeks to adapt to the tough side effects though. I felt very tired to the point of falling asleep during the day, was worn out if I walked to far or even stood too long, felt lightheadedness, nauseated, was afraid to drive. I'm glad I stuck it out, the side effects finally abated. Hang in there, the bad side effects can go away. For the record I'm a 69 year old woman, 5`4\" 128 lbs. I take the pill at night.",

My BP is very high in the morning, like 167/110, before I take my daily dosage of valsartan. Within 2 hours of taking it my BP hasn't improved, then at about 5 hours after I take my BP med my BP plummets to like 71/54, sometimes lower. I fall asleep without even realizing it when it happens & sleep for about half hour. BP readings, about 4 times daily, shows PVCs at all times with an infrequent no PVC reading.

I had no side effects at ALL from this until the first week of June. Today is July 22nd. The first week of June, I was recovering from a sore throat and cough and then three weeks later, I realized that I was STILL hoarse and my voice was cracking. It is STILL like that as of today.

I still feel a little of that about 12 hours after I take it- I figure that is a slight \" withdrawal\" effect, it lasts about 30-45 min. & I don't have it every day. When I took the generic ( manufacturer, PAR) I felt on a roller coaster, up & down all day. The time release delivery feels to be much smoother with the brand name, toprol- I recommend it.

Cardiologist found source of my chest pain is a narrowed subclavian artery.  The chest pain completely stopped within 24 hours. The only real side effect is difficulty sleeping if instructed to take it at night. I switched to taking it first thing in the morning and I now sleep like a baby. I give it a 9/10 solely for that side effect. I did feel very lethargic when I first took it, but that went away completely after 2 days or so once my body got used to the meds.

After this I went to a cardiologist who gave me 50 mg Metoprolol to take as needed. I am happy that i don't have to take it daily because it does make me sluggish on the very rare times that I do-I am pleased to have a solution when these events happen and my fears of dying suddenly from a heart episode have been drastically reduced.",

Halving the dose has not changed this; I am hoping to be off it, or at least on an even lower dose, after my next cardiology appointment in June. I think it is making me forgetful. That has definitely been a problem since taking it, although I was a bit of an absent-minded professor before.

The medication works great to keep my heart rate and blood pressure down to normal levels, however, for the first month on the medication I constantly fell asleep during daily activity, and even now I maintain a sense of perpetual fatigue. Hard to lose weight, and depression creeps up often. Brain fog has slowed my ability to focus and react swiftly, which is frustrating.

I got prescribed Metoprolol Tartrate twice a day at first and it was a nightmare. It actually had like a reverse reaction on me and gave me constant flutters for a whole day. The doctor told me to take Magnesium twice a day with it and it would help and it definitely did. I eventually switched to the extended release, once a day, along with Magnesium and I couldn't be happier. I feel a lot more relaxed and normal. Had few palps still with Tartrate but not with Succinate (yet). I wanted to wait to write a review because I know I relied on reviews. Hope this helps!",

I've never had a problem eating or swallowing in my life. The cardiologist I was seeing ignored me and said that's not a side effect. After two ERr trips w what felt like my throat closing was told to half the pill and wean off, because the drug was causing my issues. I took it for 3 weeks and have been off now now for 10 days but still can't eat. had an endoscopy and they found there is little to no pressure in esophagus & attribute this to the drug.

Came off the opioids and find I have diarrhoea which seems to be the medication. I also developed vertigo 10 days ago. It's reduced in severity, but is still hanging around. Again seems likely to be the medication. Off all things meant to help me sleep, Metoprolol has made for some difficult sleepless nights, not something I've ever had before. At the same time it's controlling my heart rate and BP, and so far no more AF. My first week home from rehab I also suffered the anxious feeling, which was an unpleasant, crawly feeling in my chest. It seems to work though.",

A few hours before I am to take my next dose I begin to feel depressed, very cranky and angry and generally just awful. Once I take the medicine though those feelings tend to go away. It also upsets my stomach and I have had a mild loss of appetite. I have also noticed that some foods taste different. I am also having a problem staying asleep, but I seem to fall asleep easily.

My one vice is my nightly glass of wine, which looks like I'll have to give up and replace with beer once in a while. Oh well, beats the alternative. No other side effects yet.

I would wake at about 2 am and not be able to go back to sleep for several hours. Always tired, then would want to eat. I gained 20 pounds in a couple of months.

Also it gives me terrible nightmares, very violent. I'll wake up wondering how I could even have such terrible dreams. It also makes me tired.

I checked the brands of the former medications and the new and found they were different.

It also has had an effect on my ability to have a discussion without forgetting a word or two. My doctor gave me a dosage of 100mg/2x daily. I wound up back in the hospital due to my heart rate being a low 32 beats per minute. The hospital treated it as a failure with the original stent and went back in to check the previous operation. That was over a year ago. We tweaked the prescription down to 50 mg once a day, but I never got out of the lethargic state.",

It seems to work fine, as my blood pressure is consistently around 116 over 64, and my heart rate is 54 BPM at last check-up two months ago. Before my heart attack, it was around 150 over 80, so a vast improvement there. I also am on a low dose (10 mg. daily) of Lisinopril, so that may help as well.

I don't sleep much and have insomnia so that could be why. I also have experienced crazy dreams and I sleep walk from time to time. I've always had dreams and talked in my sleep but I think the medication makes it a little worse especially if you're taking it closer to bed time.

I have only had a few minor attacks since being on this medication however I have side effects - Constantly exhausted and don't feel like myself and I have a heavy feeling in my chest which is extremely uncomfortable. Side effects have not subsided much since I started the medication 5 weeks ago. The side effects are bad enough to where I'm tempted to stop taking it and take my chances with the SVT! My doctor is recommending ablation procedure in hopes of that solving my problem and get me off the medication.",

                    "I'm a 52 YO male in fairly good shape. I started taking Metoprolol, 50mg twice a day after suffering a cardiac arrest earlier this year, in April. It has been very effective in controlling my blood pressure and keeping my heart rate low. The side effects are becoming unbearable now though. I'm tired, and have a lot of trouble focusing on my work during the day, have a lot of restless nights of tossing and turning, and have now developed a rash under my arms. I think it also contributes to erectile dysfunction. I spoke to my cardiologist about all this today, and he's cutting my dose in half. I'm hoping some of these side effects will diminish when I cut down to 25mg twice a day.",

I would go to the nurse & ask to lay down-which helped, but she thought I was faking. Next episode, 25 yr old - saw cardiologist, negative EKG, no treatment. Next 2 episodes, 30 yr old, more severe, ER - negative tests. Next 5 episodes, 40-50 yr old increasing severity, ER. During the last ER visit, I heard about a new type of Doc, an electrocardiophysiologist. I wore a monitor for 6 weeks before it finally \"caught\" the SVT. I started on Toprol 50 mg per day. But then, I had an episode of severe low BP (80/40) - back to the ER. My new Doc said to split dose, take 25 mg AM & PM. No episodes past 20 years. I'm a happy camper !",

                    "//What is it?//Headache and migraine are different entities. Migraine is one of the most common and well characterized, but there are 14 broad categories that can be subdivided into more than 200 different forms. Migraine itself has about 20 different genres. In general, headaches are divided into two large groups: primary and secondary. Primary illnesses correspond to a disease, not reflecting other health problems and represent around 90% of the total. Secondary symptoms are symptoms of diseases of the nervous system or other organs of the human body. They can occur in cases of flu, alcohol poisoning or withdrawal, minor head trauma, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels) or a high blood pressure crisis. Migraine is a primary headache in which very intense episodes of pain occur interspersed with periods without symptoms. In general, it begins between the ages of 15 and 40, but it can appear in childhood or shortly after the first menstruation. If it appears for the first time after the age of 45, other causes must be excluded. Some of its characteristics are closely associated with the female reproductive cycle: higher prevalence after the first menstruation or during the menstrual period; occasional worsening due to taking birth control pills or hormone therapy; attenuation or disappearance during pregnancy or menopause. Before adolescence, migraines affect boys and girls equally. From then on, it is two to three times more common in females. It is estimated that 8% to 15% of individuals living in Western countries (including Portugal) suffer from this problem. The fact of reaching people in the productive phase implies large economic, social and family costs.//Symptoms//It appears recurrently, several times throughout life, but always with completely free intervals. If it occurs every day, it is probably overuse of painkillers or other medications. Drug abuse can convert a migraine into a chronic daily headache. There are people who preferably appear on the weekend. These crises can be precipitated by changes in sleep schedule, failure to eat breakfast, reduced stress or alcohol abuse. In these cases, it is important to consider a lifestyle change over the weekend. The symptoms are intense and often prevent work or study. The pain tends to be throbbing, worsening with physical exertion or head movements. In general, it affects only one side of the head, and is accompanied by nausea, vomiting, intolerance to light, noise and some smells. It is not mandatory that all of these elements are present simultaneously. And they can occur twice a week or just a few throughout a lifetime. During attacks, people seek a dark, quiet place to rest or fall asleep. An episode can last from a few hours to three days. Between attacks, there are usually no complaints. Some types of migraines may have more complex symptoms (with aura). These forms are less common, affecting around 15% of people with this problem, and include transient neurological symptoms, originating attributable to certain areas of the brain. The other signs are identical to those of migraine without aura. The most common auras are temporary vision disorders, in the form of loss of vision on one side of the visual field, blurred images, perception of bright points, geometric figures or bright zigzags. Other auras can be translated as tingling or numbness on one side of the face or one of the hands. There are people who have difficulty speaking or even temporary paralysis of their limbs, usually only on one side of the body. These changes last about 10 to 30 minutes and precede the pain. In children, migraines tend to be bilateral, less intense and of shorter duration. Vomiting and dark circles can be exuberant. Disturbances in sleep and meal schedules are common precipitating factors. Treating these crises is easier than in adults. Sleep usually gives good results. At these ages, the occipital location is not normal and, when present, requires a medical consultation. Likewise, the presence of headaches with morning vomiting or other unusual symptoms in very young children should be seen by a healthcare professional.//Causes//It is caused by a combination of brain processes: excitation/depression of cells, dilation of arteries and release of chemicals. People with migraine are more sensitive to certain stimuli, environmental or from their own body, that can trigger these brain processes. It is also thought that there is some genetic susceptibility. Some individuals can identify the signs of their attacks. The most common are cheese, chocolate, strawberries, seafood, wine, artificial sauces, changes in sleep patterns, stress, menstruation, fasting, physical exercise, and minor trauma. Others cannot identify them at all. People who drink coffee regularly may experience headaches when they stop this habit.//Diagnosis//The key to diagnosis lies in the clinical history, physical and neurological examination. Observation of the fundus is a very important part of these procedures. In some cases, it may be necessary to resort to computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to exclude other diseases.//Treatment//Migraines have no cure but can be controlled. There are medications and behaviors that can reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks. Symptomatic treatment, during acute periods, involves resting in a quiet, dark place. Pressure or cold can be applied to the area of \u200b\u200bpain. At this stage, analgesics, anti-inflammatories, antiemetics and triptans are very useful.//Prevention//People with migraines should create calendars that allow them to identify their symptoms and assess their impact on their quality of life. The first step in prevention is to identify and eliminate precipitating factors, whenever possible. In some cases, it is necessary to use daily medication to reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks, but there are no drugs specifically developed for their prevention. However, there are some drugs used in other contexts that have proven to be effective, such as beta-blockers, antidepressants or antiepileptics, and these should always be prescribed by a doctor.

                    "//What is it?//This is an increase in blood pressure above values \u200b\u200bconsidered normal. It occurs when there is excessive pressure of blood on the walls of the arteries during circulation. It can increase at certain times, due to physical or emotional exertion, and it is natural that, after these situations, its values \u200b\u200breturn to normal levels. This condition is only serious and causes health problems when it remains high for months, or when it increases suddenly. It is important to know that tension tends to increase with age. However, hypertension should not be considered normal in the elderly. As a rule, arterial hypertension is considered to be present when the maximum pressure is greater than or equal to 160 mmHge/or the minimum pressure is greater than or equal to 95 mmHge. High blood pressure is associated with coronary heart disease, stroke and heart failure and is the most common modifiable cardiovascular risk factor, which is why its treatment is essential in preventing these pathologies. Cardiovascular diseases are the cause of death for at least 34.1% of the Brazilian population, mainly as a consequence of stroke and coronary disease. It is estimated that the prevalence of high blood pressure in the Portuguese adult population is 42.1%, with only 39.0% of these patients taking antihypertensive drugs and only 11.2% being under control.//Symptoms//In the first few years, it does not cause any symptoms. Over time, blood pressure ends up damaging the blood vessels and the main organs of the body, such as the brain, heart and kidneys, causing headaches, dizziness, tinnitus and increased heart rate. The main diseases associated with high blood pressure are stroke, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, heart and kidney failure.//Causes//Around 90% of cases are related to lifestyle habits. Obesity is one of the important factors. Each pound of fat requires the formation of an additional 1.5 kilometers of small blood vessels to supply the excess adipose tissue. Increased blood pressure is required to pump blood through them. Therefore, being overweight by 20% or more increases the risk of hypertension by five times;;/ Excess salt consumption. It is known that high blood pressure is less frequent in populations where its consumption is low. Our body only needs 1/8 of a teaspoon of salt per day;;/ Tobacco is another cause to consider. Even just one cigarette can increase it for about 30 minutes. A pack-a-day smoker can, through smoking alone, cause an increase in blood pressure for 24 hours;;/ Around 5% to 15% of cases may be related to moderate alcohol consumption. On the other hand, one cup of coffee a day can cause an increase in blood pressure;;/ Physical inactivity and stress are also at its origin;;/ The remaining 10% of high blood pressure cases have organic causes, such as some hormonal changes, kidney or blood vessel diseases.//Diagnosis//It is important to remember that high blood pressure cannot be felt, it must be measured. In order to obtain correct values, it is important to rest in a sitting position for at least five minutes before measuring. You should use the same device and always measure on the same arm. The diagnosis of high blood pressure requires measuring an elevated blood pressure on three separate occasions over a period of a week or more. Once its existence has been confirmed, other tests must also be carried out to help understand its origin and/or the complications associated with it.//Treatment//Treatment depends on the severity of the condition. For example, people with moderate hypertension can control it by simply changing some lifestyle habits, such as reducing salt and alcohol intake, controlling their weight, exercising regularly and stopping smoking. There are several medications available for the treatment of high blood pressure that can be used alone or in combination. It is up to the doctor to decide which is the best treatment for each situation.//Prevention//Since most cases have their origin in lifestyle, it is important that it is healthy. All the recommendations mentioned in the treatment prevent the onset of this disease.

I work out 6 days a week and it doesn't make any sence to me. Going back to my doctor tomorrow to figure it out. I just don't see why all of a sudden it would make things 10x worse. I didn't take it today to see if it would help. I was able to exersice without my heart rate sky rocketing to ridiculous numbers. This is the first medication like this I have ever taken.

I take 25mg. in the morning, and 25mg. about 11 hours later. The medicine has stopped my PVC's, and also slows down my heart rate.

A couple of weeks ago I made an appt. with the clinic and the most wonderful nurse practioner started me on Metoprolol 25 mg/2x daily and \"I FEEL GREAT!\" I couldn't believe how my heart calmed down, my anxiety was relieved, I SLEPT BETTER b/c it stopped the night time AFIB attacks which constantly woke me up in the middle of the night and i just feel much more comfortable in my own skin...I actually cleaned the house without any huffing, puffing or the usual AFIB attack.

However, @ 25mg I still have bouts of high readings, so when I see my PCP this week, she might raise it to 50mg. I will say that I prefer to see a Cardiologist for this because I am terrified of exercising. Yes, I know exercise and weight loss can lower my bp to healthy levels, but I can't understand I can exert myself while having high bp. Shouldn't it first be controlled with meds first before exercising?",

I never even thought about side effects as being the problems I was experiencing; thought there was always something else that the Doctor's was overlooking. Now that I have read these comments, I suffer from most of the common ones; tiredness, weakness, trouble losing weight, strange dreams, increased sweating, difficulty breathing, etc. Have had numerous tests off and on for the last two years, and nothing is ever found. I have also since then started taking clonidine and amlodipine. Some of these symptoms are probably drug interactions. I noticed a chaotic heartbeat when clonidine was added to the medicines. It has gotten worse for the past two years.",

At times though I have spells that usually run less than a few minutes with a heart rate of around 190 plus and pain. My worst battle with this level lasted about 15 minutes. I take 50mg of Metoprolol 2 times a day on a regular basis but add another 50 if I have the biggies and that settles the heart rate down quickly. Luckily I have no side affects but would love to find something else that quickly slows the heart rate ... mainly to avoid the pain and spooky stuff that goes a;long with it.

I take blood pressure and pulse 2times/ day and it is averaging 107/71, pulse 63- working well. It took me a good 4 weeks to adapt to the tough side effects though. I felt very tired to the point of falling asleep during the day, was worn out if I walked to far or even stood too long, felt lightheadedness, nauseated, was afraid to drive. I'm glad I stuck it out, the side effects finally abated. Hang in there, the bad side effects can go away. For the record I'm a 69 year old woman, 5`4\" 128 lbs. I take the pill at night.",

Been taking for a year now & PVCs are still as often as they were. I see/feel no improvement. Taking at night & valsartan in a.m experiencing BP drops. My BP is very high in the morning, like 167/110, before I take my daily dosage of valsartan. Within 2 hours of taking it my BP hasn't improved, then at about 5 hours after I take my BP med my BP plummets to like 71/54, sometimes lower. I fall asleep without even realizing it when it happens & sleep for about half hour. BP readings, about 4 times daily, shows PVCs at all times with an infrequent no PVC reading.

I had no side effects at ALL from this until the first week of June. Today is July 22nd. The first week of June, I was recovering from a sore throat and cough and then three weeks later, I realized that I was STILL hoarse and my voice was cracking. It is STILL like that as of today. Indeed, one of the rare side effects is hoarseness! I called my doctor today and he switched me to Amlopidine.",

This has happened to me quite a bit recently, using metroprolol succ ER 25 mg daily, for about 2 years now.

I still feel a little of that about 12 hours after I take it- I figure that is a slight \" withdrawal\" effect, it lasts about 30-45 min. & I don't have it every day. When I took the generic ( manufacturer, PAR) I felt on a roller coaster, up & down all day. The time release delivery feels to be much smoother with the brand name, toprol- I recommend it. All in all, it works well, keeps my heart in sinus rhythm, but it's a tough drug to have to take.",
                    "This drug has literally changed my life in a very short time. I was having horrible chest pains, with a mixture of general anxiety due to work/home stress. Cardiologist found source of my chest pain is a narrowed subclavian artery.  The chest pain completely stopped within 24 hours. The only real side effect is difficulty sleeping if instructed to take it at night. I switched to taking it first thing in the morning and I now sleep like a baby. I give it a 9/10 solely for that side effect. I did feel very lethargic when I first took it, but that went away completely after 2 days or so once my body got used to the meds.

I was told that this was normal after pericarditis. Metoprolol is recommended while heart recovers. ",
                    "I have hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and take metoprolol twice a day to keep my heart rate lowered and blood pressure down. It does the job well, but the side affects are rough to handle sometimes. Such as dizziness, sleepless nights, daytime drowsiness, forgetfulness, and depression but, i'm still coping after about four years and i guess on for the rest of my life. But if i can manage after three brother suicides than so can you.",
                    "Elevated blood pressure and increased heart rate due to long term undertreated high blood pressure. Metoprolol worked wonders. Been on it for a year - the side effects are strange dreams (not scary...just strange) and exercise difficulties. My doctor recommended sticking with 80% of exercise target heart rate. If you're having side effects, give this medication a couple months to work. It will get better. Make sure your doctor monitors your triglycerides and blood sugar while on any beta blocker. My triglycerides shot through the roof, but now under control with fish oil. ",
                    "My tachycardia started in my middle 30s, and though they were rare, became more severe as i entered my middle 40's and had to ER visits requiring the injection that stops the heart-no fun and scary. After this I went to a cardiologist who gave me 50 mg Metoprolol to take as needed. I am happy that i don't have to take it daily because it does make me sluggish on the very rare times that I do-I am pleased to have a solution when these events happen and my fears of dying suddenly from a heart episode have been drastically reduced.",

It lowered my b.p. by like 20 points/day, and I was fine for 2 days, but then had episodes of exhaustion to the point where I had to lie on the couch for hours to recover from simple housework like washing pots. Was also short of breath like I'd run 5 miles. Swallowing felt weird. Got disoriented while driving. It's a 9 on effectiveness, but can't tolerate the side effects. Am 63/F.",

The first month or so was tough as I had headaches, chest pains shortness of breath, etc. I think a large part of it was anxiety from a life changing surprise condition. No more headaches and anxiety is much, much better. I have a bit of shortness of breath, even when sitting at times, but I have been able to jog at the gym. Just started again this week and went 30 minute today. Overall, not sure if anything is working, but I am trying to just trust my Doctor and listen to my body.

I recommend it to anyone with my problem.",
                    "I love this medicine! It has quite literally saved my life, and has made my life much more livable. Whenever I would do anything physical, my heart would beat so fast that I would frequently faint. I went to my cardiologist, and she gave me a holter monitor. She saw what I was talking about and gave me 50mg of Toprol-XL everyday. That was over 3 years ago, still on the same dosage, and it is wonderful. For the first few months, I was a little over tired, but that side effect quickly went away.",

At first, it made me very sleepy and dizzy, but I have gotten over that. It lowered my heart rate into the low 60's and 50's, occasionally upper 40's. Halving the dose has not changed this; I am hoping to be off it, or at least on an even lower dose, after my next cardiology appointment in June. I think it is making me forgetful. That has definitely been a problem since taking it, although I was a bit of an absent-minded professor before. It may also have helped lower my blood pressure, although I have made some diet and lifestyle changes that would affect that, also.",

Over three years ago I started having increased muscle weakness, episodes of collapsing or falling without knowing why or even a warning that I was going to fall, extremely dry eyes (OTC eye drops were ineffective), severe muscle spasms, back pain, increased diarrhea, swelling in hands and feet, and pinpoint red spots on my skin. I looked up the side effects of this med and I had 24 of the adverse effects!! I had become so weak that I had to use 2 walking sticks, could hardly get in or out of bed, couldn't walk a 100 ft.

Started out at 50mg, but had breakthroughs regularly, and went up to 100mg after a year. The medication works great to keep my heart rate and blood pressure down to normal levels, however, for the first month on the medication I constantly fell asleep during daily activity, and even now I maintain a sense of perpetual fatigue. Hard to lose weight, and depression creeps up often. Brain fog has slowed my ability to focus and react swiftly, which is frustrating. Still, the medication works so well to keep the heart episodes at bay that I haven't tried switching to a new medication.",

It has helped in slowing my rapid heart beat down but the side effects have almost been unbearable. I have hardly slept, after taking the medicine I get short of breath and feel like I'm having an anxiety attack, and I take the medicine at bedtime. In the mornings when I wake for the first two to three hours I feel shaky, sweaty, nauseous, and extremely dizzy. My regular MD took me down to 25mg once daily and I still can't sleep and feel anxious. This is the first day taking 25mg so we'll see how I feel in the morning.",

I told this many times but he still thinking about the BPM..so at the end the BPM decrease but not the blood pressure so is working 50/50. PS I gained more than 10lb after using the metoprolol",

After a few days it felt like I hadn't taken the medicine. Toprol XL works great, and when i swapped back to the original I felt great again. There must be some difference in the release between the two. This med brings the BP into 120's over low to mid 70's range where I was reg 140's/90's. It also helps bpm from mid 90's down to upper 70's.",

It made me tired. I don't know if part of the problem is the doctors I have been seeing don't know what exactly is wrong with my heart and why it does this. Just yesterday I went to the ER after being in the hospital for a week and the doctor gave me propranolol 10mg 3 times a day which is helping. ",

At the end of that 3 weeks I increased metoprolol to 75 mg/day and by the end of the 6th week my systolic had climed to 134.

I am not wearing the Event Mintor to track my heart rate. It can get high, which can be scary because you don't know what could happen next. Some sleepless night and early morning wakes with anxiety.

Then PSVT was back full force was put on digoxin that was increased several times due to lack of control. Had stress test done and after just over 1 minute was stopped by Doctor put in hospital taken off digoxin and started on 50 mg of metoprolol.

At three months of taking the drug, swallowing became very difficult. Food would get stuck in my throat and I would not be able to talk or dislodge food. Then, the insomnia started. I would wake at about 2 am and not be able to go back to sleep for several hours. Always tired, then would want to eat. I gained 20 pounds in a couple of months. When I would wake in the night because my arms would be asleep, that was the last straw. I stopped taking the drug and got a different prescription.",

Also it gives me terrible nightmares, very violent. I'll wake up wondering how I could even have such terrible dreams. It also makes me tired. I've stopped it several times and each time the bad symptoms go away completely in about 2 days. I'm going to have to stop taking it for good, the nightmares are just too terrible.",

Suddenly my blood pressure jumped and my heart was beating erratically, chest pains (which I've never had), and I was constantly worn out. I checked the brands of the former medications and the new and found they were different. I switched back to the old meds at the new dosage for a couple of days and within 1 day my blood pressure dropped 20 points and I felt back to normal.

They scared me which just increased my anxiety. Finally my dr said I had slight tachycardia, my resting heart rate was usually around 100bpm and prescribed me metoprolol 50mg twice a day. The first week i hated this medicine. Swore it made me feel 'just not right'. I believe it was from reading negative reviews. After a couple weeks, palps gone, rating heart rate a around 60bpm.

I also take flecainide and it has some of the same side effects as metoprolol so it's hard to tell which medication is causing this. Sometimes a little hard to focus but together they seem to help with the Atrial fibrillation. ",
                    "I wanted to add on a couple things to my previous review. Everyone warned me about how tired I was going to be since this medication would literally be slowing my heart down but I've never experienced that. I don't sleep much and have insomnia so that could be why. I also have experienced crazy dreams and I sleep walk from time to time. I've always had dreams and talked in my sleep but I think the medication makes it a little worse especially if you're taking it closer to bed time. I do get a little light headed if I stand up quick and bend down but it's not bad. The benefit I get from this medication outweighs any of these insignificant side effects. I would recommend to push through any side effects and let the medication adapt to you!",

Even if they worked for a short time the rebound effect was awful. I have found it very difficult to get a physician to give me a one time dosage of metropolol. One small dose cures me. American doctors refuse to give me the prescription. I finally had to go to another country to obtain the prescrption.I absolutely hate the American medical system. I pay a fortune for insurance only for them to not care for me. I am discusted by our greedy, price fixed, non caring medical system. Why can we not get rid of our awful, overpriced, ineffective medical system? Big pharma bribes physicians with fancy coventions.",

After lots of tests and wearing a heart monitor for a month my cardiologist said I had Supraventricular Tachycardia and I was put on metoprolol 12.5mg twice a day. It's great! I haven't felt this calm and comfortable in years! Doctors really need to stop assuming that anxiety is the diagnosis of everyone's problems. There's a bit of drowsiness and fatigue in the beginning but that goes away as your body gets used to it. I am very happy with this medication.",

I figured out the only change I'd made was taking metoprolol so I weaned myself off of it and the depression cleared right up.

                    "//What is it?//Headache and migraine are different entities. Migraine is one of the most common and well characterized, but there are 14 broad categories that can be subdivided into more than 200 different forms. Migraine itself has about 20 different genres. In general, headaches are divided into two large groups: primary and secondary. Primary illnesses correspond to a disease, not reflecting other health problems and represent around 90% of the total. Secondary symptoms are symptoms of diseases of the nervous system or other organs of the human body. They can occur in cases of flu, alcohol poisoning or withdrawal, minor head trauma, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels) or a high blood pressure crisis. Migraine is a primary headache in which very intense episodes of pain occur interspersed with periods without symptoms. In general, it begins between the ages of 15 and 40, but it can appear in childhood or shortly after the first menstruation. If it appears for the first time after the age of 45, other causes must be excluded. Some of its characteristics are closely associated with the female reproductive cycle: higher prevalence after the first menstruation or during the menstrual period; occasional worsening due to taking birth control pills or hormone therapy; attenuation or disappearance during pregnancy or menopause. Before adolescence, migraines affect boys and girls equally. From then on, it is two to three times more common in females. It is estimated that 8% to 15% of individuals living in Western countries (including Portugal) suffer from this problem. The fact of reaching people in the productive phase implies large economic, social and family costs.//Symptoms//It appears recurrently, several times throughout life, but always with completely free intervals. If it occurs every day, it is probably overuse of painkillers or other medications. Drug abuse can convert a migraine into a chronic daily headache. There are people who preferably appear on the weekend. These crises can be precipitated by changes in sleep schedule, failure to eat breakfast, reduced stress or alcohol abuse. In these cases, it is important to consider a lifestyle change over the weekend. The symptoms are intense and often prevent work or study. The pain tends to be throbbing, worsening with physical exertion or head movements. In general, it affects only one side of the head, and is accompanied by nausea, vomiting, intolerance to light, noise and some smells. It is not mandatory that all of these elements are present simultaneously. And they can occur twice a week or just a few throughout a lifetime. During attacks, people seek a dark, quiet place to rest or fall asleep. An episode can last from a few hours to three days. Between attacks, there are usually no complaints. Some types of migraines may have more complex symptoms (with aura). These forms are less common, affecting around 15% of people with this problem, and include transient neurological symptoms, originating attributable to certain areas of the brain. The other signs are identical to those of migraine without aura. The most common auras are temporary vision disorders, in the form of loss of vision on one side of the visual field, blurred images, perception of bright points, geometric figures or bright zigzags. Other auras can be translated as tingling or numbness on one side of the face or one of the hands. There are people who have difficulty speaking or even temporary paralysis of their limbs, usually only on one side of the body. These changes last about 10 to 30 minutes and precede the pain. In children, migraines tend to be bilateral, less intense and of shorter duration. Vomiting and dark circles can be exuberant. Disturbances in sleep and meal schedules are common precipitating factors. Treating these crises is easier than in adults. Sleep usually gives good results. At these ages, the occipital location is not normal and, when present, requires a medical consultation. Likewise, the presence of headaches with morning vomiting or other unusual symptoms in very young children should be seen by a healthcare professional.//Causes//It is caused by a combination of brain processes: excitation/depression of cells, dilation of arteries and release of chemicals. People with migraine are more sensitive to certain stimuli, environmental or from their own body, that can trigger these brain processes. It is also thought that there is some genetic susceptibility. Some individuals can identify the signs of their attacks. The most common are cheese, chocolate, strawberries, seafood, wine, artificial sauces, changes in sleep patterns, stress, menstruation, fasting, physical exercise, and minor trauma. Others cannot identify them at all. People who drink coffee regularly may experience headaches when they stop this habit.//Diagnosis//The key to diagnosis lies in the clinical history, physical and neurological examination. Observation of the fundus is a very important part of these procedures. In some cases, it may be necessary to resort to computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to exclude other diseases.//Treatment//Migraines have no cure but can be controlled. There are medications and behaviors that can reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks. Symptomatic treatment, during acute periods, involves resting in a quiet, dark place. Pressure or cold can be applied to the area of \u200b\u200bpain. At this stage, analgesics, anti-inflammatories, antiemetics and triptans are very useful.//Prevention//People with migraines should create calendars that allow them to identify their symptoms and assess their impact on their quality of life. The first step in prevention is to identify and eliminate precipitating factors, whenever possible. In some cases, it is necessary to use daily medication to reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks, but there are no drugs specifically developed for their prevention. However, there are some drugs used in other contexts that have proven to be effective, such as beta-blockers, antidepressants or antiepileptics, and these should always be prescribed by a doctor.

                    "//What is it?//This is an increase in blood pressure above values \u200b\u200bconsidered normal. It occurs when there is excessive pressure of blood on the walls of the arteries during circulation. It can increase at certain times, due to physical or emotional exertion, and it is natural that, after these situations, its values \u200b\u200breturn to normal levels. This condition is only serious and causes health problems when it remains high for months, or when it increases suddenly. It is important to know that tension tends to increase with age. However, hypertension should not be considered normal in the elderly. As a rule, arterial hypertension is considered to be present when the maximum pressure is greater than or equal to 160 mmHge/or the minimum pressure is greater than or equal to 95 mmHge. High blood pressure is associated with coronary heart disease, stroke and heart failure and is the most common modifiable cardiovascular risk factor, which is why its treatment is essential in preventing these pathologies. Cardiovascular diseases are the cause of death for at least 34.1% of the Brazilian population, mainly as a consequence of stroke and coronary disease. It is estimated that the prevalence of high blood pressure in the Portuguese adult population is 42.1%, with only 39.0% of these patients taking antihypertensive drugs and only 11.2% being under control.//Symptoms//In the first few years, it does not cause any symptoms. Over time, blood pressure ends up damaging the blood vessels and the main organs of the body, such as the brain, heart and kidneys, causing headaches, dizziness, tinnitus and increased heart rate. The main diseases associated with high blood pressure are stroke, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, heart and kidney failure.//Causes//Around 90% of cases are related to lifestyle habits. Obesity is one of the important factors. Each pound of fat requires the formation of an additional 1.5 kilometers of small blood vessels to supply the excess adipose tissue. Increased blood pressure is required to pump blood through them. Therefore, being overweight by 20% or more increases the risk of hypertension by five times;;/ Excess salt consumption. It is known that high blood pressure is less frequent in populations where its consumption is low. Our body only needs 1/8 of a teaspoon of salt per day;;/ Tobacco is another cause to consider. Even just one cigarette can increase it for about 30 minutes. A pack-a-day smoker can, through smoking alone, cause an increase in blood pressure for 24 hours;;/ Around 5% to 15% of cases may be related to moderate alcohol consumption. On the other hand, one cup of coffee a day can cause an increase in blood pressure;;/ Physical inactivity and stress are also at its origin;;/ The remaining 10% of high blood pressure cases have organic causes, such as some hormonal changes, kidney or blood vessel diseases.//Diagnosis//It is important to remember that high blood pressure cannot be felt, it must be measured. In order to obtain correct values, it is important to rest in a sitting position for at least five minutes before measuring. You should use the same device and always measure on the same arm. The diagnosis of high blood pressure requires measuring an elevated blood pressure on three separate occasions over a period of a week or more. Once its existence has been confirmed, other tests must also be carried out to help understand its origin and/or the complications associated with it.//Treatment//Treatment depends on the severity of the condition. For example, people with moderate hypertension can control it by simply changing some lifestyle habits, such as reducing salt and alcohol intake, controlling their weight, exercising regularly and stopping smoking. There are several medications available for the treatment of high blood pressure that can be used alone or in combination. It is up to the doctor to decide which is the best treatment for each situation.//Prevention//Since most cases have their origin in lifestyle, it is important that it is healthy. All the recommendations mentioned in the treatment prevent the onset of this disease.

The first month was great then on October 21st my resting heart rate went from 61 to 70 and when I walk it suddenly goes to 140 for no reason. I work out 6 days a week and it doesn't make any sence to me. Going back to my doctor tomorrow to figure it out. I just don't see why all of a sudden it would make things 10x worse. I didn't take it today to see if it would help. I was able to exersice without my heart rate sky rocketing to ridiculous numbers. This is the first medication like this I have ever taken. Plus the weight gain is ridiculous. I lost 15 lbs before starting this medication and less then 2 months I gained it all back.",

I take 25mg. in the morning, and 25mg. about 11 hours later. The medicine has stopped my PVC's, and also slows down my heart rate. When I first started taking Metoprorlol Tartrate, it made me very tired, but after about 2 weeks, my body got used to it, and I was fine.",
                    "I have been taking Toprol XL for about 2 years. My doctor has now put me on 200mg twice a day, total 400mg a day, this had to be approve by my insurance company and it was. This is working for me, no side effects and my blood pressure is steady at 114/70.",
                    "I was diagnosed with AFIB in 2012 at the age of 43, long sad frustrating story cut short, the doctor said there was nothing he could do about it. He sent me home to suffer with it. A couple of weeks ago I made an appt. with the clinic and the most wonderful nurse practioner started me on Metoprolol 25 mg/2x daily and \"I FEEL GREAT!\" I couldn't believe how my heart calmed down, my anxiety was relieved, I SLEPT BETTER b/c it stopped the night time AFIB attacks which constantly woke me up in the middle of the night and i just feel much more comfortable in my own skin...I actually cleaned the house without any huffing, puffing or the usual AFIB attack. I agree that it makes me drowsy which is becoming less severe I LOVE IT! :)",
                    "I'm giving this med a 7 so far just because I haven't had any real side effects with it, like I did with another bp med (can't remember the name). However, @ 25mg I still have bouts of high readings, so when I see my PCP this week, she might raise it to 50mg. I will say that I prefer to see a Cardiologist for this because I am terrified of exercising. Yes, I know exercise and weight loss can lower my bp to healthy levels, but I can't understand I can exert myself while having high bp. Shouldn't it first be controlled with meds first before exercising?",
                    "I have been taking Metoprolol 25mg once a day for 13 days. It has lowered my heart rate by about 30 beats a minute but I am always tired, get chest pain, headache and numbness. Little to no benefit in lowering my blood pressure (140/95's).",
                    "I have been on some form of metoprolol for seven years. It was actually my first prescribed medication at 28. I never even thought about side effects as being the problems I was experiencing; thought there was always something else that the Doctor's was overlooking. Now that I have read these comments, I suffer from most of the common ones; tiredness, weakness, trouble losing weight, strange dreams, increased sweating, difficulty breathing, etc. Have had numerous tests off and on for the last two years, and nothing is ever found. I have also since then started taking clonidine and amlodipine. Some of these symptoms are probably drug interactions. I noticed a chaotic heartbeat when clonidine was added to the medicines. It has gotten worse for the past two years.",
                    "I have had constant afib for over 2 years though mostly tolerable. At times though I have spells that usually run less than a few minutes with a heart rate of around 190 plus and pain. My worst battle with this level lasted about 15 minutes. I take 50mg of Metoprolol 2 times a day on a regular basis but add another 50 if I have the biggies and that settles the heart rate down quickly. Luckily I have no side affects but would love to find something else that quickly slows the heart rate ... mainly to avoid the pain and spooky stuff that goes a;long with it. I've had 11 angioplasties and 10 stents since 1990 and am 70.",
                    "I started metaprolol 12.5 mg once a day 6 weeks ago after having an electrical cardioconversion for a rapid, irregular heartbeat. I take blood pressure and pulse 2times/ day and it is averaging 107/71, pulse 63- working well. It took me a good 4 weeks to adapt to the tough side effects though. I felt very tired to the point of falling asleep during the day, was worn out if I walked to far or even stood too long, felt lightheadedness, nauseated, was afraid to drive. I'm glad I stuck it out, the side effects finally abated. Hang in there, the bad side effects can go away. For the record I'm a 69 year old woman, 5`4\" 128 lbs. I take the pill at night.",

Been taking for a year now & PVCs are still as often as they were. I see/feel no improvement. Taking at night & valsartan in a.m experiencing BP drops. My BP is very high in the morning, like 167/110, before I take my daily dosage of valsartan. Within 2 hours of taking it my BP hasn't improved, then at about 5 hours after I take my BP med my BP plummets to like 71/54, sometimes lower. I fall asleep without even realizing it when it happens & sleep for about half hour. BP readings, about 4 times daily, shows PVCs at all times with an infrequent no PVC reading.

My doctor prescribed 25 mg of metoprolol for me and I started taking it in February of this year (2015). My blood pressure was lowered from 140/90 to 125/82, so it DOES work in that respect. I had no side effects at ALL from this until the first week of June. Today is July 22nd. The first week of June, I was recovering from a sore throat and cough and then three weeks later, I realized that I was STILL hoarse and my voice was cracking. It is STILL like that as of today. Indeed, one of the rare side effects is hoarseness! I called my doctor today and he switched me to Amlopidine.",

This has happened to me quite a bit recently, using metroprolol succ ER 25 mg daily, for about 2 years now.

I still feel a little of that about 12 hours after I take it- I figure that is a slight \" withdrawal\" effect, it lasts about 30-45 min. & I don't have it every day. When I took the generic ( manufacturer, PAR) I felt on a roller coaster, up & down all day. The time release delivery feels to be much smoother with the brand name, toprol- I recommend it. All in all, it works well, keeps my heart in sinus rhythm, but it's a tough drug to have to take.",
                    "This drug has literally changed my life in a very short time. I was having horrible chest pains, with a mixture of general anxiety due to work/home stress. Cardiologist found source of my chest pain is a narrowed subclavian artery.  The chest pain completely stopped within 24 hours. The only real side effect is difficulty sleeping if instructed to take it at night. I switched to taking it first thing in the morning and I now sleep like a baby. I give it a 9/10 solely for that side effect. I did feel very lethargic when I first took it, but that went away completely after 2 days or so once my body got used to the meds.

I feel nervous having my natural rhythm manipulated but when it comes to the heart, I'll just do what they say. Had an attack of pericarditis 3 weeks ago and then Atrial fibrillation two days ago.

After this I went to a cardiologist who gave me 50 mg Metoprolol to take as needed. I am happy that i don't have to take it daily because it does make me sluggish on the very rare times that I do-I am pleased to have a solution when these events happen and my fears of dying suddenly from a heart episode have been drastically reduced.",

It lowered my b.p. by like 20 points/day, and I was fine for 2 days, but then had episodes of exhaustion to the point where I had to lie on the couch for hours to recover from simple housework like washing pots.

The first month or so was tough as I had headaches, chest pains shortness of breath, etc. I think a large part of it was anxiety from a life changing surprise condition. No more headaches and anxiety is much, much better. I have a bit of shortness of breath, even when sitting at times, but I have been able to jog at the gym.

I recommend it to anyone with my problem.",

Whenever I would do anything physical, my heart would beat so fast that I would frequently faint. I went to my cardiologist, and she gave me a holter monitor. She saw what I was talking about and gave me 50mg of Toprol-XL everyday. That was over 3 years ago, still on the same dosage, and it is wonderful. For the first few months, I was a little over tired, but that side effect quickly went away.",

At first, it made me very sleepy and dizzy, but I have gotten over that. It lowered my heart rate into the low 60's and 50's, occasionally upper 40's. Halving the dose has not changed this; I am hoping to be off it, or at least on an even lower dose, after my next cardiology appointment in June. I think it is making me forgetful. That has definitely been a problem since taking it, although I was a bit of an absent-minded professor before. It may also have helped lower my blood pressure, although I have made some diet and lifestyle changes that would affect that, also.",

Started out at 50mg, but had breakthroughs regularly, and went up to 100mg after a year. The medication works great to keep my heart rate and blood pressure down to normal levels, however, for the first month on the medication I constantly fell asleep during daily activity, and even now I maintain a sense of perpetual fatigue. Hard to lose weight, and depression creeps up often. Brain fog has slowed my ability to focus and react swiftly, which is frustrating. Still, the medication works so well to keep the heart episodes at bay that I haven't tried switching to a new medication.",

It has helped in slowing my rapid heart beat down but the side effects have almost been unbearable. I have hardly slept, after taking the medicine I get short of breath and feel like I'm having an anxiety attack, and I take the medicine at bedtime. In the mornings when I wake for the first two to three hours I feel shaky, sweaty, nauseous, and extremely dizzy. My regular MD took me down to 25mg once daily and I still can't sleep and feel anxious. This is the first day taking 25mg so we'll see how I feel in the morning.",

There must be some difference in the release between the two. This med brings the BP into 120's over low to mid 70's range where I was reg 140's/90's.

It made me tired. I don't know if part of the problem is the doctors I have been seeing don't know what exactly is wrong with my heart and why it does this.

I feel like I'm on a merry go round when I sit up or stand. My balance is so off I wanna stop the drug. Is it too early to tell if its working?",
                    "My doctor prescribed me Metoprolol Succinate ER 25mg and advised me to take half first few days. When I did, I began to have a rush down my body and severe tremors began. My heart rate jumped to 138, it was pounding. I tried laying down, still. I even had chest pain. I usually get low blood pressure but I only felt very tired, not dizzy or fainty. I called my doctor, and he asked me to go to the ER to make sure everything is okay. I did. They did XRAY, blood work, gave me IV to flush it out. Everything was normal. My HR kept jumping from 67 to 105 suddenly. I was told to stop taking it. I am bummed out because I was looking forward to this helping me. After everything, my HR has was 54 resting and 72 active. It did afterwards!",
                    "I have been using Metoprolol for about 3 years now for high-blood pressure. Started with 50mg and now at 100mg. Before the medicines I used to have a headache from the back of my neck to the back of my head every day. Since taking it, no more headaches. Blood pressure is low too. Can't seem to lose any weight though. I think I started out at 185 lbs (still overweight), but now I'm at 192 lbs and can't seem to get below that. Am pretty gassy and have frequent diarrhea.",

Finally in 2010 when I was 38 I needed stents to fix major coranary blockages. I never had a migraine since..and I used to have them about twice per week. Some have even lasted more than a week! I figure, after reading it MUST be the metoprolol...it's been 6 years. Migraine FREE. At the very least, you should try it and see for yourself..or continue suffering.",

I get very anxious at times without this and my blood pressure and heart rate will race with the chance it could convert to AF. Lately however, my heart rate has fallen to low 40's taking only 10 mg and my doctor has taken me off it completely. I feel very shaky now. My hands visibly tremble and I notice I get more of an adrenaline rush when under pressure or fear. I need something to replace this because I don't want to experience AF again and I need something to calm me down. Any suggestions would be appreciated.",

I guess you can say that is a not so good thing. But, my symptoms are in check. Refuse to use an alternative medication. The downside to using beta blockers is the side effect. I break out with eczema and psoriasis, these are the biggest problem with this medication, but there are medications that keeps that under control as well.",

A 25 mg daily dose of Metoprolol has been life changing. I was mostly anti-medicine until I was finally talked into trying this.  I was having 10-15 severe migraines per month, causing frequent ER visits, stroke level high blood pressure and severe performance anxiety. Immediately after beginning this medicine I have few headaches and they are rarely severe. My blood pressure is down and my anxiety is significantly improved.  I have no problems exercising.

No problems getting the heart rate up in exercise (still quite the opposite actually! I can reach 180bpm after 5mins) Unfortunately it didnt stop the progression to AF. After 6yrs of SVT & metoprolol I was further diagnosed with AF. Dosage was increased from 25mg to 50-75mg per day. Starting to work a little better now in preventing rapid AF however I still get slow AF. Dry mouth, cold extremities & occasional dizzy spells have been all too common however definitely a small price to pay. 28yo fem",

After three years I had a number of concerns and stopped taking this med- sexual desire increased as did erections, urine stream strong, fewer trips to the bathroom, and I care about the future again.

Extreme hot flash and rapid heartbeat (more rapid than my usual... my pulse rate is usually around 100-105 as it is.)

I figured out the only change I'd made was taking metoprolol so I weaned myself off of it and the depression cleared right up. My doctor said he has a lot of patients on this medication and even though depression is a side effect none of them have had this issue. So I'm guessing it's not a common side effect but beware if you're just starting this.",

                    "//What is it?//Headache and migraine are different entities. Migraine is one of the most common and well characterized, but there are 14 broad categories that can be subdivided into more than 200 different forms. Migraine itself has about 20 different genres. In general, headaches are divided into two large groups: primary and secondary. Primary illnesses correspond to a disease, not reflecting other health problems and represent around 90% of the total. Secondary symptoms are symptoms of diseases of the nervous system or other organs of the human body. They can occur in cases of flu, alcohol poisoning or withdrawal, minor head trauma, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels) or a high blood pressure crisis. Migraine is a primary headache in which very intense episodes of pain occur interspersed with periods without symptoms. In general, it begins between the ages of 15 and 40, but it can appear in childhood or shortly after the first menstruation. If it appears for the first time after the age of 45, other causes must be excluded. Some of its characteristics are closely associated with the female reproductive cycle: higher prevalence after the first menstruation or during the menstrual period; occasional worsening due to taking birth control pills or hormone therapy; attenuation or disappearance during pregnancy or menopause. Before adolescence, migraines affect boys and girls equally. From then on, it is two to three times more common in females. It is estimated that 8% to 15% of individuals living in Western countries (including Portugal) suffer from this problem. The fact of reaching people in the productive phase implies large economic, social and family costs.//Symptoms//It appears recurrently, several times throughout life, but always with completely free intervals. If it occurs every day, it is probably overuse of painkillers or other medications. Drug abuse can convert a migraine into a chronic daily headache. There are people who preferably appear on the weekend. These crises can be precipitated by changes in sleep schedule, failure to eat breakfast, reduced stress or alcohol abuse. In these cases, it is important to consider a lifestyle change over the weekend. The symptoms are intense and often prevent work or study. The pain tends to be throbbing, worsening with physical exertion or head movements. In general, it affects only one side of the head, and is accompanied by nausea, vomiting, intolerance to light, noise and some smells. It is not mandatory that all of these elements are present simultaneously. And they can occur twice a week or just a few throughout a lifetime. During attacks, people seek a dark, quiet place to rest or fall asleep. An episode can last from a few hours to three days. Between attacks, there are usually no complaints. Some types of migraines may have more complex symptoms (with aura). These forms are less common, affecting around 15% of people with this problem, and include transient neurological symptoms, originating attributable to certain areas of the brain. The other signs are identical to those of migraine without aura. The most common auras are temporary vision disorders, in the form of loss of vision on one side of the visual field, blurred images, perception of bright points, geometric figures or bright zigzags. Other auras can be translated as tingling or numbness on one side of the face or one of the hands. There are people who have difficulty speaking or even temporary paralysis of their limbs, usually only on one side of the body. These changes last about 10 to 30 minutes and precede the pain. In children, migraines tend to be bilateral, less intense and of shorter duration. Vomiting and dark circles can be exuberant. Disturbances in sleep and meal schedules are common precipitating factors. Treating these crises is easier than in adults. Sleep usually gives good results. At these ages, the occipital location is not normal and, when present, requires a medical consultation. Likewise, the presence of headaches with morning vomiting or other unusual symptoms in very young children should be seen by a healthcare professional.//Causes//It is caused by a combination of brain processes: excitation/depression of cells, dilation of arteries and release of chemicals. People with migraine are more sensitive to certain stimuli, environmental or from their own body, that can trigger these brain processes. It is also thought that there is some genetic susceptibility. Some individuals can identify the signs of their attacks. The most common are cheese, chocolate, strawberries, seafood, wine, artificial sauces, changes in sleep patterns, stress, menstruation, fasting, physical exercise, and minor trauma. Others cannot identify them at all. People who drink coffee regularly may experience headaches when they stop this habit.//Diagnosis//The key to diagnosis lies in the clinical history, physical and neurological examination. Observation of the fundus is a very important part of these procedures. In some cases, it may be necessary to resort to computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to exclude other diseases.//Treatment//Migraines have no cure but can be controlled. There are medications and behaviors that can reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks. Symptomatic treatment, during acute periods, involves resting in a quiet, dark place. Pressure or cold can be applied to the area of \u200b\u200bpain. At this stage, analgesics, anti-inflammatories, antiemetics and triptans are very useful.//Prevention//People with migraines should create calendars that allow them to identify their symptoms and assess their impact on their quality of life. The first step in prevention is to identify and eliminate precipitating factors, whenever possible. In some cases, it is necessary to use daily medication to reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks, but there are no drugs specifically developed for their prevention. However, there are some drugs used in other contexts that have proven to be effective, such as beta-blockers, antidepressants or antiepileptics, and these should always be prescribed by a doctor.

                    "//What is it?//This is an increase in blood pressure above values \u200b\u200bconsidered normal. It occurs when there is excessive pressure of blood on the walls of the arteries during circulation. It can increase at certain times, due to physical or emotional exertion, and it is natural that, after these situations, its values \u200b\u200breturn to normal levels. This condition is only serious and causes health problems when it remains high for months, or when it increases suddenly. It is important to know that tension tends to increase with age. However, hypertension should not be considered normal in the elderly. As a rule, arterial hypertension is considered to be present when the maximum pressure is greater than or equal to 160 mmHge/or the minimum pressure is greater than or equal to 95 mmHge. High blood pressure is associated with coronary heart disease, stroke and heart failure and is the most common modifiable cardiovascular risk factor, which is why its treatment is essential in preventing these pathologies. Cardiovascular diseases are the cause of death for at least 34.1% of the Brazilian population, mainly as a consequence of stroke and coronary disease. It is estimated that the prevalence of high blood pressure in the Portuguese adult population is 42.1%, with only 39.0% of these patients taking antihypertensive drugs and only 11.2% being under control.//Symptoms//In the first few years, it does not cause any symptoms. Over time, blood pressure ends up damaging the blood vessels and the main organs of the body, such as the brain, heart and kidneys, causing headaches, dizziness, tinnitus and increased heart rate. The main diseases associated with high blood pressure are stroke, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, heart and kidney failure.//Causes//Around 90% of cases are related to lifestyle habits. Obesity is one of the important factors. Each pound of fat requires the formation of an additional 1.5 kilometers of small blood vessels to supply the excess adipose tissue. Increased blood pressure is required to pump blood through them. Therefore, being overweight by 20% or more increases the risk of hypertension by five times;;/ Excess salt consumption. It is known that high blood pressure is less frequent in populations where its consumption is low. Our body only needs 1/8 of a teaspoon of salt per day;;/ Tobacco is another cause to consider. Even just one cigarette can increase it for about 30 minutes. A pack-a-day smoker can, through smoking alone, cause an increase in blood pressure for 24 hours;;/ Around 5% to 15% of cases may be related to moderate alcohol consumption. On the other hand, one cup of coffee a day can cause an increase in blood pressure;;/ Physical inactivity and stress are also at its origin;;/ The remaining 10% of high blood pressure cases have organic causes, such as some hormonal changes, kidney or blood vessel diseases.//Diagnosis//It is important to remember that high blood pressure cannot be felt, it must be measured. In order to obtain correct values, it is important to rest in a sitting position for at least five minutes before measuring. You should use the same device and always measure on the same arm. The diagnosis of high blood pressure requires measuring an elevated blood pressure on three separate occasions over a period of a week or more. Once its existence has been confirmed, other tests must also be carried out to help understand its origin and/or the complications associated with it.//Treatment//Treatment depends on the severity of the condition. For example, people with moderate hypertension can control it by simply changing some lifestyle habits, such as reducing salt and alcohol intake, controlling their weight, exercising regularly and stopping smoking. There are several medications available for the treatment of high blood pressure that can be used alone or in combination. It is up to the doctor to decide which is the best treatment for each situation.//Prevention//Since most cases have their origin in lifestyle, it is important that it is healthy. All the recommendations mentioned in the treatment prevent the onset of this disease.

                    "I have been on metoprolol er 12.5mg since September 20th. The first month was great then on October 21st my resting heart rate went from 61 to 70 and when I walk it suddenly goes to 140 for no reason. I work out 6 days a week and it doesn't make any sence to me. Going back to my doctor tomorrow to figure it out. I just don't see why all of a sudden it would make things 10x worse. I didn't take it today to see if it would help. I was able to exersice without my heart rate sky rocketing to ridiculous numbers. This is the first medication like this I have ever taken. Plus the weight gain is ridiculous. I lost 15 lbs before starting this medication and less then 2 months I gained it all back.",
                    "I took Lopressor for 24 years it worked very well in lowering my blood pressure and even calming my anxiety but lately it doesn't work on me very well as before, I guess the doctor will change it.",
                    "I'm a 72 year 'young' female, and I have been taking Metoprolol Tartrate for 7 years, for PVC's Premature Ventricular Contractions of my heart, and also for Tachycardia. I take 25mg. in the morning, and 25mg. about 11 hours later. The medicine has stopped my PVC's, and also slows down my heart rate. When I first started taking Metoprorlol Tartrate, it made me very tired, but after about 2 weeks, my body got used to it, and I was fine.",
                    "I have been taking Toprol XL for about 2 years. My doctor has now put me on 200mg twice a day, total 400mg a day, this had to be approve by my insurance company and it was. This is working for me, no side effects and my blood pressure is steady at 114/70.",
                    "I was diagnosed with AFIB in 2012 at the age of 43, long sad frustrating story cut short, the doctor said there was nothing he could do about it. He sent me home to suffer with it. A couple of weeks ago I made an appt. with the clinic and the most wonderful nurse practioner started me on Metoprolol 25 mg/2x daily and \"I FEEL GREAT!\" I couldn't believe how my heart calmed down, my anxiety was relieved, I SLEPT BETTER b/c it stopped the night time AFIB attacks which constantly woke me up in the middle of the night and i just feel much more comfortable in my own skin...I actually cleaned the house without any huffing, puffing or the usual AFIB attack. I agree that it makes me drowsy which is becoming less severe I LOVE IT! :)",
                    "I'm giving this med a 7 so far just because I haven't had any real side effects with it, like I did with another bp med (can't remember the name). However, @ 25mg I still have bouts of high readings, so when I see my PCP this week, she might raise it to 50mg. I will say that I prefer to see a Cardiologist for this because I am terrified of exercising. Yes, I know exercise and weight loss can lower my bp to healthy levels, but I can't understand I can exert myself while having high bp. Shouldn't it first be controlled with meds first before exercising?",
                    "I have been taking Metoprolol 25mg once a day for 13 days. It has lowered my heart rate by about 30 beats a minute but I am always tired, get chest pain, headache and numbness. Little to no benefit in lowering my blood pressure (140/95's).",
                    "I have been on some form of metoprolol for seven years. It was actually my first prescribed medication at 28. I never even thought about side effects as being the problems I was experiencing; thought there was always something else that the Doctor's was overlooking. Now that I have read these comments, I suffer from most of the common ones; tiredness, weakness, trouble losing weight, strange dreams, increased sweating, difficulty breathing, etc. Have had numerous tests off and on for the last two years, and nothing is ever found. I have also since then started taking clonidine and amlodipine. Some of these symptoms are probably drug interactions. I noticed a chaotic heartbeat when clonidine was added to the medicines. It has gotten worse for the past two years.",
                    "I have had constant afib for over 2 years though mostly tolerable. At times though I have spells that usually run less than a few minutes with a heart rate of around 190 plus and pain. My worst battle with this level lasted about 15 minutes. I take 50mg of Metoprolol 2 times a day on a regular basis but add another 50 if I have the biggies and that settles the heart rate down quickly. Luckily I have no side affects but would love to find something else that quickly slows the heart rate ... mainly to avoid the pain and spooky stuff that goes a;long with it. I've had 11 angioplasties and 10 stents since 1990 and am 70.",
                    "I started metaprolol 12.5 mg once a day 6 weeks ago after having an electrical cardioconversion for a rapid, irregular heartbeat. I take blood pressure and pulse 2times/ day and it is averaging 107/71, pulse 63- working well. It took me a good 4 weeks to adapt to the tough side effects though. I felt very tired to the point of falling asleep during the day, was worn out if I walked to far or even stood too long, felt lightheadedness, nauseated, was afraid to drive. I'm glad I stuck it out, the side effects finally abated. Hang in there, the bad side effects can go away. For the record I'm a 69 year old woman, 5`4\" 128 lbs. I take the pill at night.",
                    "I had terrible symptoms of MVP that landed me in the hospital for 5 days. I started taking this medicine 25 mg a day and my symptoms are so much better. I used to have shortness of breath, palpitations, chest pain, and weakness but it's so much better now. I only occasionally have some palpitations but nothing like before. Metoprolol works great!",
                    "Have very frequent Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), heart testing said my heart is fine. Put me on metoprolol succinate ER. Been taking for a year now & PVCs are still as often as they were. I see/feel no improvement. Taking at night & valsartan in a.m experiencing BP drops. My BP is very high in the morning, like 167/110, before I take my daily dosage of valsartan. Within 2 hours of taking it my BP hasn't improved, then at about 5 hours after I take my BP med my BP plummets to like 71/54, sometimes lower. I fall asleep without even realizing it when it happens & sleep for about half hour. BP readings, about 4 times daily, shows PVCs at all times with an infrequent no PVC reading. Not convinced this med is doing anything for me.",

Unlike another report posted here, I am sleeping better while taking the medication. The only two side effects I've experienced are shakiness and nervousness when I miss a dose by even a few hours and vague aural hallucinations (hearing things) while on the verge of falling asleep. I've seen the hallucinations reported by other toprol users on other sites.",
                    "DRUG is very effective but I also take 3 other medicines along with this. After evening meal I take 100mg - blood pressure before taking it is 192/112 and 30 minutes after is 152/91.",

My doctor prescribed 25 mg of metoprolol for me and I started taking it in February of this year (2015). My blood pressure was lowered from 140/90 to 125/82, so it DOES work in that respect. I had no side effects at ALL from this until the first week of June. Today is July 22nd. The first week of June, I was recovering from a sore throat and cough and then three weeks later, I realized that I was STILL hoarse and my voice was cracking. It is STILL like that as of today. Indeed, one of the rare side effects is hoarseness! I called my doctor today and he switched me to Amlopidine.",
                    "Reading the mixed reviews here, the first thing that jumped out was people have problems swallowing. This has happened to me quite a bit recently, using metroprolol succ ER 25 mg daily, for about 2 years now. I did have great success in reducing my pulse (130 resting pulse for 20 years, adjust to 90 now). Overall I was happy with it, but now somewhat concerned with long term use.",
                    "I am so happy to have found a medication that prevents migraines, lowers my blood pressure and curbs anxiety. I was having 20 to 25 migraine days a month. So far I've only had two mild headaches that were easily treated with two ibuprofen. I feel like I have my life back. I highly recommend it.",
                    "Very nice, helped heart, now do sports easy, no more hard breathing",
                    "I recently switched from metaprolol, 1/2 of 25 mg/ day to brand name Toprol xl & have found the negative side effects- fatigue, too low blood pressure, dizziness, nausea- to be much less. I still feel a little of that about 12 hours after I take it- I figure that is a slight \" withdrawal\" effect, it lasts about 30-45 min. & I don't have it every day. When I took the generic ( manufacturer, PAR) I felt on a roller coaster, up & down all day. The time release delivery feels to be much smoother with the brand name, toprol- I recommend it. All in all, it works well, keeps my heart in sinus rhythm, but it's a tough drug to have to take.",
                    "This drug has literally changed my life in a very short time. I was having horrible chest pains, with a mixture of general anxiety due to work/home stress. Cardiologist found source of my chest pain is a narrowed subclavian artery.  The chest pain completely stopped within 24 hours. The only real side effect is difficulty sleeping if instructed to take it at night. I switched to taking it first thing in the morning and I now sleep like a baby. I give it a 9/10 solely for that side effect. I did feel very lethargic when I first took it, but that went away completely after 2 days or so once my body got used to the meds. I feel much more calm than I did before so this medication has really changed the way I feel. improvement is noticeable",
                    "Thoughts of never feeling normal again. It scares me a lot.",
                    "I have been on Metoprolol for 20 yrs. I was diagnosed with High Blood pressure when I was 23 yrs old, started on 100mg now I'm on 25mg. I do experience anxiety a lot and tiredness, along with dizziness at times. The medicine does work,just hoping some day my kidneys will mend themselves so I can STOP taking this medicine.",
                    "I'm on my third day of metoprolol and feel very mellow. My heart feels quiet in the way you feel when you finally hit the pavement after a dirt road. I feel nervous having my natural rhythm manipulated but when it comes to the heart, I'll just do what they say. Had an attack of pericarditis 3 weeks ago and then Atrial fibrillation two days ago. I was told that this was normal after pericarditis. Metoprolol is recommended while heart recovers. ",
                    "I have hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and take metoprolol twice a day to keep my heart rate lowered and blood pressure down. It does the job well, but the side affects are rough to handle sometimes. Such as dizziness, sleepless nights, daytime drowsiness, forgetfulness, and depression but, i'm still coping after about four years and i guess on for the rest of my life. But if i can manage after three brother suicides than so can you.",
                    "Elevated blood pressure and increased heart rate due to long term undertreated high blood pressure. Metoprolol worked wonders. Been on it for a year - the side effects are strange dreams (not scary...just strange) and exercise difficulties. My doctor recommended sticking with 80% of exercise target heart rate. If you're having side effects, give this medication a couple months to work. It will get better. Make sure your doctor monitors your triglycerides and blood sugar while on any beta blocker. My triglycerides shot through the roof, but now under control with fish oil. ",
                    "My tachycardia started in my middle 30s, and though they were rare, became more severe as i entered my middle 40's and had to ER visits requiring the injection that stops the heart-no fun and scary. After this I went to a cardiologist who gave me 50 mg Metoprolol to take as needed. I am happy that i don't have to take it daily because it does make me sluggish on the very rare times that I do-I am pleased to have a solution when these events happen and my fears of dying suddenly from a heart episode have been drastically reduced.",
                    "Went to have foot injury x-rayed at urgent care, and spiked a blood pressure of 195/110 maybe due to pain.Was given this by IV in the ER, then pills for 3-4 nights at home. It lowered my b.p. by like 20 points/day, and I was fine for 2 days, but then had episodes of exhaustion to the point where I had to lie on the couch for hours to recover from simple housework like washing pots. Was also short of breath like I'd run 5 miles. Swallowing felt weird. Got disoriented while driving. It's a 9 on effectiveness, but can't tolerate the side effects. Am 63/F.",
                    "Changed from atenolol 50mg to metropolol er succinate 25 mg not by choice. Transition very smooth. Was taking atenolol for SVTs. I added magnesium to my daily dose after some research on SVTs. Stomach bloating from atenolol reduced and my sleep improved. I'm a mid distance runner with HR in the upper 50s. Feeling very good.",
                    "Hi..I have afib...I am on a 100 mg of metoprolol ..I have had good success with this medication..a family history of heart disease with angina pains..mine began at the age of 26 with angina pains, placed on caridezem at the time..at the age of 49 had blockages of 100-99-65 ... the 100 was the widow maker..which my surgeon spent two hours to stent... ended up going back in every week for three straight weeks to get the others...the back of my heart had stopped pumping at the time...about two years ago, at the age of 60 I began with afib..now I have been on this metoprolol , along with other medication, Plavix and aspirin ..being a bad diabetic as well..I know this medication has given me more life and quality..",
                    "I am 54 and had a stent put in with 95% blockage. I was put on Metoprolol 25mg along with atorvastatin and effient. The first month or so was tough as I had headaches, chest pains shortness of breath, etc. I think a large part of it was anxiety from a life changing surprise condition. No more headaches and anxiety is much, much better. I have a bit of shortness of breath, even when sitting at times, but I have been able to jog at the gym. Just started again this week and went 30 minute today. Overall, not sure if anything is working, but I am trying to just trust my Doctor and listen to my body. Very tough emotionally, but adjusting.",
                    "I needed to take this due to another medication I was taking. Never needed to be on anything else. Very happy with results",
                    "I am 14 years old. I once had a moderate heart attack, and afterwards, my heart was constantly hammering away. Just sitting sown my pulse was 180 bpm. This led to enlarged heart and high blood pressure. I've been on this medicine for 3 years now, and it has probably saved my life from another heart attack. I recommend it to anyone with my problem.",
                    "I love this medicine! It has quite literally saved my life, and has made my life much more livable. Whenever I would do anything physical, my heart would beat so fast that I would frequently faint. I went to my cardiologist, and she gave me a holter monitor. She saw what I was talking about and gave me 50mg of Toprol-XL everyday. That was over 3 years ago, still on the same dosage, and it is wonderful. For the first few months, I was a little over tired, but that side effect quickly went away.",
                    "I had all the side effects listed after taking Lopressor for 3 days. they still persist after stopping meds 2 days ago. I was on very low dosage of 12.5 bid",
                    "I was put on 50 mg 3 X a day for rapid, arrhythmic heartbeat and high blood pressure, in November last year. At first, it made me very sleepy and dizzy, but I have gotten over that. It lowered my heart rate into the low 60's and 50's, occasionally upper 40's. Halving the dose has not changed this; I am hoping to be off it, or at least on an even lower dose, after my next cardiology appointment in June. I think it is making me forgetful. That has definitely been a problem since taking it, although I was a bit of an absent-minded professor before. It may also have helped lower my blood pressure, although I have made some diet and lifestyle changes that would affect that, also.",
                    "It stopped my PACs (Preatrial contractions ). I was on this med for 13 years. Over three years ago I started having increased muscle weakness, episodes of collapsing or falling without knowing why or even a warning that I was going to fall, extremely dry eyes (OTC eye drops were ineffective), severe muscle spasms, back pain, increased diarrhea, swelling in hands and feet, and pinpoint red spots on my skin. I looked up the side effects of this med and I had 24 of the adverse effects!! I had become so weak that I had to use 2 walking sticks, could hardly get in or out of bed, couldn't walk a 100 ft. I quit taking this med which I thoroughly believe was killing me. I have begun to feel much better regaining some of my muscle strength and have less back pain.",
                    "I have been on metropolol XL for 4 months and my hairdresser noticed 2 large alopecia (bald) spots....one on the back of my head and one that is pink and on top of my head. I have stopped it and have an appointment with a dermatologist next week. Am scared to death that more is going to fall out! Anybody else experience bald spots?",
                    "I started taking this medicine in 2006. It works to take the pressure off my heart but it has caused me arthritis in my knees, hands and feet. Now I am in pain most of the time. My hands have developed arthritis in both thumbs, my feet have it in my toes. I tried another Astra Zeneca product called Atacand and it works better but is so expensive I can't afford to buy it.",

                    "Started taking metoprolol 8 years ago when I was hospitalized with a bout of of tachycardia that wouldn't go away for hours. Diagnosed with supraventricular tachycardia. Started out at 50mg, but had breakthroughs regularly, and went up to 100mg after a year. The medication works great to keep my heart rate and blood pressure down to normal levels, however, for the first month on the medication I constantly fell asleep during daily activity, and even now I maintain a sense of perpetual fatigue. Hard to lose weight, and depression creeps up often. Brain fog has slowed my ability to focus and react swiftly, which is frustrating. Still, the medication works so well to keep the heart episodes at bay that I haven't tried switching to a new medication.",
                    "I started taking 50mg of Toprol after being admitted to the hospital 6 days ago. I was told I had Mitral Valve Proplase and that I needed to take 50mg daily. It has helped in slowing my rapid heart beat down but the side effects have almost been unbearable. I have hardly slept, after taking the medicine I get short of breath and feel like I'm having an anxiety attack, and I take the medicine at bedtime. In the mornings when I wake for the first two to three hours I feel shaky, sweaty, nauseous, and extremely dizzy. My regular MD took me down to 25mg once daily and I still can't sleep and feel anxious. This is the first day taking 25mg so we'll see how I feel in the morning.",
                    "Have been taking Toprol for about 7 years now, 50mg once a day. During a recent health fair at work, my blood pressure was really high. Made an appoinment with the Doctor that day to re-evaluate and was found to be running a little high, 145/94. Doctor added an additional 50mg a day. ",
                    "I'm supposed to take this medication for my blood pressure but a year and half later the pressure is still the same even though doctor increase the dose from 50 to 100 mg. Seems like the doctor care more about my heart rate (that is Lower than before so is working), but my blood pressure is ever the same, especially the night time is ever 8 around 85/140 (sometimes 150 or 160). I told this many times but he still thinking about the BPM..so at the end the BPM decrease but not the blood pressure so is working 50/50. PS I gained more than 10lb after using the metoprolol",
                    "I have tried the generic version (extended release) after using brand name Toprol XL. The generic did not work well for me. After a few days it felt like I hadn't taken the medicine. Toprol XL works great, and when i swapped back to the original I felt great again. There must be some difference in the release between the two. This med brings the BP into 120's over low to mid 70's range where I was reg 140's/90's. It also helps bpm from mid 90's down to upper 70's.",

The negative side effect was primarily on cognitive function plus cold hands and feet. My short term memory really became poor. i experimented by taking myself off it for a few weeks and then putting myself back on it. I was able to measure a clear difference in cognitive function. I decided to refuse to take any more Metroprolol and my doctor found me Felodipine which is fine.",
                    "this medication almost took my life. during the 6 years I was on it my cardiologist kept raising the dose. I had difficulty standing on my feet, developed severe headaches, slurred speech and dark veiled vision. over time my fingers turned dark purple like grape juice. I reached the point where I could not sit up one morning without help. my daughter discovered my back was dark purple as well. the emergency room doctor took me off immediately stating a severe reaction.",
                    "I was put on metoprolol 50mg after my heart started to race every time I would move or do anything. The 50mg helped some but didn't keep it all the way down so then they tried me on 100mg which did the trick while I was moving but then when I wasn't it was dropping between 30-40beats so then they tried just 25mg 4 times a day and I was still having problems. It made me tired. I don't know if part of the problem is the doctors I have been seeing don't know what exactly is wrong with my heart and why it does this. Just yesterday I went to the ER after being in the hospital for a week and the doctor gave me propranolol 10mg 3 times a day which is helping. ",
                    "I started on metoprolol 2 months ago at 25 mg, twice a day (plus hydrochorothiazide at 25 mg that I have been taking for 3 months). This is to treat a high systolic pressure that was originally at 145 though my diastolic was at 75. Metoprolol had no effect for 3 weeks until my systolic dropped to 127 from about 137. At the end of that 3 weeks I increased metoprolol to 75 mg/day and by the end of the 6th week my systolic had climed to 134.

I was originally put on it twice a day, but I already had bradycardia and low blood pressure at night so within a couple of days the nighttime dose was making me wake up gasping for air with an extremely low heart rate and blood pressure so low it wouldn't register on my home monitor. I called the doctor and he said to not take the bedtime dose. I haven't had any side effects that I recall.

I was constantly under stress, with my body flooded with stress hormones, strong heart-beating etc. Metoprolol helped me a lot in reducing my stress level and adjusting to a more relaxed attitude at work. It calms you down by reducing your heart beat etc. From this perspective it was helpful for getting on a healthier path. It also helped reducing the migraines, even though they stayed. Over the longer run, you need to take higher dosage to achieve a similar effect. at some stage I had the impression the drug didn't help much any longer, so stopped.",

My heart throughout the day kept going into PAT (200+ BPM) No chest pain or anything, but pounding heart/fainting. I was started on Lopressor at that time .... 100mg BID and this is an amazing drug.

Also, seemed not to care about anything- said inappropriate comments, pulled out into traffic recklessly, and damaged gardening equipment. Nothing seriously bad happened but I had to learn to concentrate differently. After three years I had a number of concerns and stopped taking this med- sexual desire increased as did erections, urine stream strong, fewer trips to the bathroom, and I care about the future again. With all that said - I think Metoprolol helped me to recover and I began taking it again, but I am going to talk to my doctor about discontinuing it.",

Approximately 20 minutes or so after I would take my dose of Lopressor, I would get symptoms similar to a panic attack. Extreme hot flash and rapid heartbeat (more rapid than my usual... my pulse rate is usually around 100-105 as it is.) When I told my doctor, he told me to quit taking the Lopressor and then he put me on another high blood pressure medicine. I only took Lopressor for a few days, because of the side effects, so I cannot comment on it's effectiveness in blood pressure reduction.",

Felt awful for weeks prior to being prescribed the medication, but once I started taking it things improved VERY quickly. Resting heart rate and blood pressure both down, no more palpitations, far less health anxiety. Doctor described it as having a \"calming effect\" and I definitely agree.

After 4 years on that I developed racing and very irregular heart beats the toprolxl did nothing. they got even worse. My doc took me off saying it was side effects of both drugs. I immediately improved. I still have them but not as bad. No cardiologist has told me what was wrong. I have a really bad back. In 2011 I got an epidural at T4-5 and that completely cured my rapid and irregular heartbeat for 3 years.

I felt like everything in my life was out of control even though mentally I knew it wasn't. I was sobbing hysterically all day and felt like I was losing my mind! I figured out the only change I'd made was taking metoprolol so I weaned myself off of it and the depression cleared right up. My doctor said he has a lot of patients on this medication and even though depression is a side effect none of them have had this issue. So I'm guessing it's not a common side effect but beware if you're just starting this.",
                    "It's hard for a patient to 'rate' a medication. I have an excellent cardiologist whose job that is. However, I know that Toprol comes with a tendency toward depression for many people, and for me, pre-existing depression has been mildly exacerbated. I also take amlodipine since May of last year, and this is a drug also known to cause/increase depression. I take several other anti-hypertensive drugs therefore it is not easy to tell which is causing what. Welcome to life post-cardiac bypass surgery--a life diminished, trust me, but at least--LIFE.",

I'm tired, and have a lot of trouble focusing on my work during the day, have a lot of restless nights of tossing and turning, and have now developed a rash under my arms.

Next 2 episodes, 30 yr old, more severe, ER - negative tests. Next 5 episodes, 40-50 yr old increasing severity, ER.

                    "//What is it?//Headache and migraine are different entities. Migraine is one of the most common and well characterized, but there are 14 broad categories that can be subdivided into more than 200 different forms. Migraine itself has about 20 different genres. In general, headaches are divided into two large groups: primary and secondary. Primary illnesses correspond to a disease, not reflecting other health problems and represent around 90% of the total. Secondary symptoms are symptoms of diseases of the nervous system or other organs of the human body. They can occur in cases of flu, alcohol poisoning or withdrawal, minor head trauma, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels) or a high blood pressure crisis. Migraine is a primary headache in which very intense episodes of pain occur interspersed with periods without symptoms. In general, it begins between the ages of 15 and 40, but it can appear in childhood or shortly after the first menstruation. If it appears for the first time after the age of 45, other causes must be excluded. Some of its characteristics are closely associated with the female reproductive cycle: higher prevalence after the first menstruation or during the menstrual period; occasional worsening due to taking birth control pills or hormone therapy; attenuation or disappearance during pregnancy or menopause. Before adolescence, migraines affect boys and girls equally. From then on, it is two to three times more common in females. It is estimated that 8% to 15% of individuals living in Western countries (including Portugal) suffer from this problem. The fact of reaching people in the productive phase implies large economic, social and family costs.//Symptoms//It appears recurrently, several times throughout life, but always with completely free intervals. If it occurs every day, it is probably overuse of painkillers or other medications. Drug abuse can convert a migraine into a chronic daily headache. There are people who preferably appear on the weekend. These crises can be precipitated by changes in sleep schedule, failure to eat breakfast, reduced stress or alcohol abuse. In these cases, it is important to consider a lifestyle change over the weekend. The symptoms are intense and often prevent work or study. The pain tends to be throbbing, worsening with physical exertion or head movements. In general, it affects only one side of the head, and is accompanied by nausea, vomiting, intolerance to light, noise and some smells. It is not mandatory that all of these elements are present simultaneously. And they can occur twice a week or just a few throughout a lifetime. During attacks, people seek a dark, quiet place to rest or fall asleep. An episode can last from a few hours to three days. Between attacks, there are usually no complaints. Some types of migraines may have more complex symptoms (with aura). These forms are less common, affecting around 15% of people with this problem, and include transient neurological symptoms, originating attributable to certain areas of the brain. The other signs are identical to those of migraine without aura. The most common auras are temporary vision disorders, in the form of loss of vision on one side of the visual field, blurred images, perception of bright points, geometric figures or bright zigzags. Other auras can be translated as tingling or numbness on one side of the face or one of the hands. There are people who have difficulty speaking or even temporary paralysis of their limbs, usually only on one side of the body. These changes last about 10 to 30 minutes and precede the pain. In children, migraines tend to be bilateral, less intense and of shorter duration. Vomiting and dark circles can be exuberant. Disturbances in sleep and meal schedules are common precipitating factors. Treating these crises is easier than in adults. Sleep usually gives good results. At these ages, the occipital location is not normal and, when present, requires a medical consultation. Likewise, the presence of headaches with morning vomiting or other unusual symptoms in very young children should be seen by a healthcare professional.//Causes//It is caused by a combination of brain processes: excitation/depression of cells, dilation of arteries and release of chemicals. People with migraine are more sensitive to certain stimuli, environmental or from their own body, that can trigger these brain processes. It is also thought that there is some genetic susceptibility. Some individuals can identify the signs of their attacks. The most common are cheese, chocolate, strawberries, seafood, wine, artificial sauces, changes in sleep patterns, stress, menstruation, fasting, physical exercise, and minor trauma. Others cannot identify them at all. People who drink coffee regularly may experience headaches when they stop this habit.//Diagnosis//The key to diagnosis lies in the clinical history, physical and neurological examination. Observation of the fundus is a very important part of these procedures. In some cases, it may be necessary to resort to computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to exclude other diseases.//Treatment//Migraines have no cure but can be controlled. There are medications and behaviors that can reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks. Symptomatic treatment, during acute periods, involves resting in a quiet, dark place. Pressure or cold can be applied to the area of \u200b\u200bpain. At this stage, analgesics, anti-inflammatories, antiemetics and triptans are very useful.//Prevention//People with migraines should create calendars that allow them to identify their symptoms and assess their impact on their quality of life. The first step in prevention is to identify and eliminate precipitating factors, whenever possible. In some cases, it is necessary to use daily medication to reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks, but there are no drugs specifically developed for their prevention. However, there are some drugs used in other contexts that have proven to be effective, such as beta-blockers, antidepressants or antiepileptics, and these should always be prescribed by a doctor.

                    "//What is it?//This is an increase in blood pressure above values \u200b\u200bconsidered normal. It occurs when there is excessive pressure of blood on the walls of the arteries during circulation. It can increase at certain times, due to physical or emotional exertion, and it is natural that, after these situations, its values \u200b\u200breturn to normal levels. This condition is only serious and causes health problems when it remains high for months, or when it increases suddenly. It is important to know that tension tends to increase with age. However, hypertension should not be considered normal in the elderly. As a rule, arterial hypertension is considered to be present when the maximum pressure is greater than or equal to 160 mmHge/or the minimum pressure is greater than or equal to 95 mmHge. High blood pressure is associated with coronary heart disease, stroke and heart failure and is the most common modifiable cardiovascular risk factor, which is why its treatment is essential in preventing these pathologies. Cardiovascular diseases are the cause of death for at least 34.1% of the Brazilian population, mainly as a consequence of stroke and coronary disease. It is estimated that the prevalence of high blood pressure in the Portuguese adult population is 42.1%, with only 39.0% of these patients taking antihypertensive drugs and only 11.2% being under control.//Symptoms//In the first few years, it does not cause any symptoms. Over time, blood pressure ends up damaging the blood vessels and the main organs of the body, such as the brain, heart and kidneys, causing headaches, dizziness, tinnitus and increased heart rate. The main diseases associated with high blood pressure are stroke, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, heart and kidney failure.//Causes//Around 90% of cases are related to lifestyle habits. Obesity is one of the important factors. Each pound of fat requires the formation of an additional 1.5 kilometers of small blood vessels to supply the excess adipose tissue. Increased blood pressure is required to pump blood through them. Therefore, being overweight by 20% or more increases the risk of hypertension by five times;;/ Excess salt consumption. It is known that high blood pressure is less frequent in populations where its consumption is low. Our body only needs 1/8 of a teaspoon of salt per day;;/ Tobacco is another cause to consider. Even just one cigarette can increase it for about 30 minutes. A pack-a-day smoker can, through smoking alone, cause an increase in blood pressure for 24 hours;;/ Around 5% to 15% of cases may be related to moderate alcohol consumption. On the other hand, one cup of coffee a day can cause an increase in blood pressure;;/ Physical inactivity and stress are also at its origin;;/ The remaining 10% of high blood pressure cases have organic causes, such as some hormonal changes, kidney or blood vessel diseases.//Diagnosis//It is important to remember that high blood pressure cannot be felt, it must be measured. In order to obtain correct values, it is important to rest in a sitting position for at least five minutes before measuring. You should use the same device and always measure on the same arm. The diagnosis of high blood pressure requires measuring an elevated blood pressure on three separate occasions over a period of a week or more. Once its existence has been confirmed, other tests must also be carried out to help understand its origin and/or the complications associated with it.//Treatment//Treatment depends on the severity of the condition. For example, people with moderate hypertension can control it by simply changing some lifestyle habits, such as reducing salt and alcohol intake, controlling their weight, exercising regularly and stopping smoking. There are several medications available for the treatment of high blood pressure that can be used alone or in combination. It is up to the doctor to decide which is the best treatment for each situation.//Prevention//Since most cases have their origin in lifestyle, it is important that it is healthy. All the recommendations mentioned in the treatment prevent the onset of this disease.

I didn't take it today to see if it would help. I was able to exersice without my heart rate sky rocketing to ridiculous numbers. This is the first medication like this I have ever taken.

                    "I have been on some form of metoprolol for seven years. It was actually my first prescribed medication at 28. I never even thought about side effects as being the problems I was experiencing; thought there was always something else that the Doctor's was overlooking. Now that I have read these comments, I suffer from most of the common ones; tiredness, weakness, trouble losing weight, strange dreams, increased sweating, difficulty breathing, etc. Have had numerous tests off and on for the last two years, and nothing is ever found. I have also since then started taking clonidine and amlodipine. Some of these symptoms are probably drug interactions. I noticed a chaotic heartbeat when clonidine was added to the medicines. It has gotten worse for the past two years.",

At times though I have spells that usually run less than a few minutes with a heart rate of around 190 plus and pain. My worst battle with this level lasted about 15 minutes. I take 50mg of Metoprolol 2 times a day on a regular basis but add another 50 if I have the biggies and that settles the heart rate down quickly. Luckily I have no side affects but would love to find something else that quickly slows the heart rate ... mainly to avoid the pain and spooky stuff that goes a;long with it. I've had 11 angioplasties and 10 stents since 1990 and am 70.",

I take blood pressure and pulse 2times/ day and it is averaging 107/71, pulse 63- working well. It took me a good 4 weeks to adapt to the tough side effects though. I felt very tired to the point of falling asleep during the day, was worn out if I walked to far or even stood too long, felt lightheadedness, nauseated, was afraid to drive. I'm glad I stuck it out, the side effects finally abated. Hang in there, the bad side effects can go away. For the record I'm a 69 year old woman, 5`4\" 128 lbs. I take the pill at night.",

My BP is very high in the morning, like 167/110, before I take my daily dosage of valsartan. Within 2 hours of taking it my BP hasn't improved, then at about 5 hours after I take my BP med my BP plummets to like 71/54, sometimes lower. I fall asleep without even realizing it when it happens & sleep for about half hour. BP readings, about 4 times daily, shows PVCs at all times with an infrequent no PVC reading.

I had no side effects at ALL from this until the first week of June. Today is July 22nd. The first week of June, I was recovering from a sore throat and cough and then three weeks later, I realized that I was STILL hoarse and my voice was cracking. It is STILL like that as of today.

I still feel a little of that about 12 hours after I take it- I figure that is a slight \" withdrawal\" effect, it lasts about 30-45 min. & I don't have it every day. When I took the generic ( manufacturer, PAR) I felt on a roller coaster, up & down all day. The time release delivery feels to be much smoother with the brand name, toprol- I recommend it. All in all, it works well, keeps my heart in sinus rhythm, but it's a tough drug to have to take.",

Cardiologist found source of my chest pain is a narrowed subclavian artery.  The chest pain completely stopped within 24 hours. The only real side effect is difficulty sleeping if instructed to take it at night. I switched to taking it first thing in the morning and I now sleep like a baby. I give it a 9/10 solely for that side effect. I did feel very lethargic when I first took it, but that went away completely after 2 days or so once my body got used to the meds.

If you're having side effects, give this medication a couple months to work. It will get better. Make sure your doctor monitors your triglycerides and blood sugar while on any beta blocker.

After this I went to a cardiologist who gave me 50 mg Metoprolol to take as needed. I am happy that i don't have to take it daily because it does make me sluggish on the very rare times that I do-I am pleased to have a solution when these events happen and my fears of dying suddenly from a heart episode have been drastically reduced.",

No more headaches and anxiety is much, much better. I have a bit of shortness of breath, even when sitting at times, but I have been able to jog at the gym.

At first, it made me very sleepy and dizzy, but I have gotten over that. It lowered my heart rate into the low 60's and 50's, occasionally upper 40's. Halving the dose has not changed this; I am hoping to be off it, or at least on an even lower dose, after my next cardiology appointment in June. I think it is making me forgetful. That has definitely been a problem since taking it, although I was a bit of an absent-minded professor before.

The medication works great to keep my heart rate and blood pressure down to normal levels, however, for the first month on the medication I constantly fell asleep during daily activity, and even now I maintain a sense of perpetual fatigue. Hard to lose weight, and depression creeps up often. Brain fog has slowed my ability to focus and react swiftly, which is frustrating.

I ended up only taking Toprol for 8 months and I had no more migraines or palpitations and of course my blood pressure was under control. It stayed that way for about a year and a half until I became pregnant and that seemed to trigger it all back. But I did the same thing and am fine now and I never experienced any side effects.",

I got prescribed Metoprolol Tartrate twice a day at first and it was a nightmare. It actually had like a reverse reaction on me and gave me constant flutters for a whole day. The doctor told me to take Magnesium twice a day with it and it would help and it definitely did. I eventually switched to the extended release, once a day, along with Magnesium and I couldn't be happier. I feel a lot more relaxed and normal. Had few palps still with Tartrate but not with Succinate (yet). I wanted to wait to write a review because I know I relied on reviews. Hope this helps!",

I've never had a problem eating or swallowing in my life. The cardiologist I was seeing ignored me and said that's not a side effect. After two ERr trips w what felt like my throat closing was told to half the pill and wean off, because the drug was causing my issues.

Came off the opioids and find I have diarrhoea which seems to be the medication. I also developed vertigo 10 days ago. It's reduced in severity, but is still hanging around. Again seems likely to be the medication. Off all things meant to help me sleep, Metoprolol has made for some difficult sleepless nights, not something I've ever had before. At the same time it's controlling my heart rate and BP, and so far no more AF. My first week home from rehab I also suffered the anxious feeling, which was an unpleasant, crawly feeling in my chest. It seems to work though.",

A few hours before I am to take my next dose I begin to feel depressed, very cranky and angry and generally just awful. Once I take the medicine though those feelings tend to go away. It also upsets my stomach and I have had a mild loss of appetite. I have also noticed that some foods taste different. I am also having a problem staying asleep, but I seem to fall asleep easily.

My one vice is my nightly glass of wine, which looks like I'll have to give up and replace with beer once in a while. Oh well, beats the alternative. No other side effects yet.

I would wake at about 2 am and not be able to go back to sleep for several hours. Always tired, then would want to eat. I gained 20 pounds in a couple of months.

Also it gives me terrible nightmares, very violent. I'll wake up wondering how I could even have such terrible dreams. It also makes me tired.

I checked the brands of the former medications and the new and found they were different.

The first week i hated this medicine. Swore it made me feel 'just not right'. I believe it was from reading negative reviews. After a couple weeks, palps gone, rating heart rate a around 60bpm.

Average BPM was 190 and upon reaching 235 BPM I would start to loose consciousness. I tried all varieties of maneuvers to trigger the SVT to stop but none worked. If it laster longer than an hour I was transported to the ER where I was given Adenosine to restart my heart. I was given an Rx for Metoprlol Tartrate a few months before my first ablation when I was 20. I was started on 25mg/day. 9 days after my ablation, I had more episodes and was bumped up to 50mg, 100mg, then 150mg/day before my second ablation when I was 21.

It also has had an effect on my ability to have a discussion without forgetting a word or two. My doctor gave me a dosage of 100mg/2x daily. I wound up back in the hospital due to my heart rate being a low 32 beats per minute. The hospital treated it as a failure with the original stent and went back in to check the previous operation. That was over a year ago. We tweaked the prescription down to 50 mg once a day, but I never got out of the lethargic state.",

It seems to work fine, as my blood pressure is consistently around 116 over 64, and my heart rate is 54 BPM at last check-up two months ago. Before my heart attack, it was around 150 over 80, so a vast improvement there. I also am on a low dose (10 mg. daily) of Lisinopril, so that may help as well.

Everyone warned me about how tired I was going to be since this medication would literally be slowing my heart down but I've never experienced that. I don't sleep much and have insomnia so that could be why. I also have experienced crazy dreams and I sleep walk from time to time. I've always had dreams and talked in my sleep but I think the medication makes it a little worse especially if you're taking it closer to bed time. I do get a little light headed if I stand up quick and bend down but it's not bad. The benefit I get from this medication outweighs any of these insignificant side effects.

I'm tired, and have a lot of trouble focusing on my work during the day, have a lot of restless nights of tossing and turning, and have now developed a rash under my arms.

Next 2 episodes, 30 yr old, more severe, ER - negative tests. Next 5 episodes, 40-50 yr old increasing severity, ER. During the last ER visit, I heard about a new type of Doc, an electrocardiophysiologist. I wore a monitor for 6 weeks before it finally \"caught\" the SVT. I started on Toprol 50 mg per day.

                    "//What is it?//Headache and migraine are different entities. Migraine is one of the most common and well characterized, but there are 14 broad categories that can be subdivided into more than 200 different forms. Migraine itself has about 20 different genres. In general, headaches are divided into two large groups: primary and secondary. Primary illnesses correspond to a disease, not reflecting other health problems and represent around 90% of the total. Secondary symptoms are symptoms of diseases of the nervous system or other organs of the human body. They can occur in cases of flu, alcohol poisoning or withdrawal, minor head trauma, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels) or a high blood pressure crisis. Migraine is a primary headache in which very intense episodes of pain occur interspersed with periods without symptoms. In general, it begins between the ages of 15 and 40, but it can appear in childhood or shortly after the first menstruation. If it appears for the first time after the age of 45, other causes must be excluded. Some of its characteristics are closely associated with the female reproductive cycle: higher prevalence after the first menstruation or during the menstrual period; occasional worsening due to taking birth control pills or hormone therapy; attenuation or disappearance during pregnancy or menopause. Before adolescence, migraines affect boys and girls equally. From then on, it is two to three times more common in females. It is estimated that 8% to 15% of individuals living in Western countries (including Portugal) suffer from this problem. The fact of reaching people in the productive phase implies large economic, social and family costs.//Symptoms//It appears recurrently, several times throughout life, but always with completely free intervals. If it occurs every day, it is probably overuse of painkillers or other medications. Drug abuse can convert a migraine into a chronic daily headache. There are people who preferably appear on the weekend. These crises can be precipitated by changes in sleep schedule, failure to eat breakfast, reduced stress or alcohol abuse. In these cases, it is important to consider a lifestyle change over the weekend. The symptoms are intense and often prevent work or study. The pain tends to be throbbing, worsening with physical exertion or head movements. In general, it affects only one side of the head, and is accompanied by nausea, vomiting, intolerance to light, noise and some smells. It is not mandatory that all of these elements are present simultaneously. And they can occur twice a week or just a few throughout a lifetime. During attacks, people seek a dark, quiet place to rest or fall asleep. An episode can last from a few hours to three days. Between attacks, there are usually no complaints. Some types of migraines may have more complex symptoms (with aura). These forms are less common, affecting around 15% of people with this problem, and include transient neurological symptoms, originating attributable to certain areas of the brain. The other signs are identical to those of migraine without aura. The most common auras are temporary vision disorders, in the form of loss of vision on one side of the visual field, blurred images, perception of bright points, geometric figures or bright zigzags. Other auras can be translated as tingling or numbness on one side of the face or one of the hands. There are people who have difficulty speaking or even temporary paralysis of their limbs, usually only on one side of the body. These changes last about 10 to 30 minutes and precede the pain. In children, migraines tend to be bilateral, less intense and of shorter duration. Vomiting and dark circles can be exuberant. Disturbances in sleep and meal schedules are common precipitating factors. Treating these crises is easier than in adults. Sleep usually gives good results. At these ages, the occipital location is not normal and, when present, requires a medical consultation. Likewise, the presence of headaches with morning vomiting or other unusual symptoms in very young children should be seen by a healthcare professional.//Causes//It is caused by a combination of brain processes: excitation/depression of cells, dilation of arteries and release of chemicals. People with migraine are more sensitive to certain stimuli, environmental or from their own body, that can trigger these brain processes. It is also thought that there is some genetic susceptibility. Some individuals can identify the signs of their attacks. The most common are cheese, chocolate, strawberries, seafood, wine, artificial sauces, changes in sleep patterns, stress, menstruation, fasting, physical exercise, and minor trauma. Others cannot identify them at all. People who drink coffee regularly may experience headaches when they stop this habit.//Diagnosis//The key to diagnosis lies in the clinical history, physical and neurological examination. Observation of the fundus is a very important part of these procedures. In some cases, it may be necessary to resort to computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to exclude other diseases.//Treatment//Migraines have no cure but can be controlled. There are medications and behaviors that can reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks. Symptomatic treatment, during acute periods, involves resting in a quiet, dark place. Pressure or cold can be applied to the area of \u200b\u200bpain. At this stage, analgesics, anti-inflammatories, antiemetics and triptans are very useful.//Prevention//People with migraines should create calendars that allow them to identify their symptoms and assess their impact on their quality of life. The first step in prevention is to identify and eliminate precipitating factors, whenever possible. In some cases, it is necessary to use daily medication to reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks, but there are no drugs specifically developed for their prevention. However, there are some drugs used in other contexts that have proven to be effective, such as beta-blockers, antidepressants or antiepileptics, and these should always be prescribed by a doctor.

                    "//What is it?//This is an increase in blood pressure above values \u200b\u200bconsidered normal. It occurs when there is excessive pressure of blood on the walls of the arteries during circulation. It can increase at certain times, due to physical or emotional exertion, and it is natural that, after these situations, its values \u200b\u200breturn to normal levels. This condition is only serious and causes health problems when it remains high for months, or when it increases suddenly. It is important to know that tension tends to increase with age. However, hypertension should not be considered normal in the elderly. As a rule, arterial hypertension is considered to be present when the maximum pressure is greater than or equal to 160 mmHge/or the minimum pressure is greater than or equal to 95 mmHge. High blood pressure is associated with coronary heart disease, stroke and heart failure and is the most common modifiable cardiovascular risk factor, which is why its treatment is essential in preventing these pathologies. Cardiovascular diseases are the cause of death for at least 34.1% of the Brazilian population, mainly as a consequence of stroke and coronary disease. It is estimated that the prevalence of high blood pressure in the Portuguese adult population is 42.1%, with only 39.0% of these patients taking antihypertensive drugs and only 11.2% being under control.//Symptoms//In the first few years, it does not cause any symptoms. Over time, blood pressure ends up damaging the blood vessels and the main organs of the body, such as the brain, heart and kidneys, causing headaches, dizziness, tinnitus and increased heart rate. The main diseases associated with high blood pressure are stroke, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, heart and kidney failure.//Causes//Around 90% of cases are related to lifestyle habits. Obesity is one of the important factors. Each pound of fat requires the formation of an additional 1.5 kilometers of small blood vessels to supply the excess adipose tissue. Increased blood pressure is required to pump blood through them. Therefore, being overweight by 20% or more increases the risk of hypertension by five times;;/ Excess salt consumption. It is known that high blood pressure is less frequent in populations where its consumption is low. Our body only needs 1/8 of a teaspoon of salt per day;;/ Tobacco is another cause to consider. Even just one cigarette can increase it for about 30 minutes. A pack-a-day smoker can, through smoking alone, cause an increase in blood pressure for 24 hours;;/ Around 5% to 15% of cases may be related to moderate alcohol consumption. On the other hand, one cup of coffee a day can cause an increase in blood pressure;;/ Physical inactivity and stress are also at its origin;;/ The remaining 10% of high blood pressure cases have organic causes, such as some hormonal changes, kidney or blood vessel diseases.//Diagnosis//It is important to remember that high blood pressure cannot be felt, it must be measured. In order to obtain correct values, it is important to rest in a sitting position for at least five minutes before measuring. You should use the same device and always measure on the same arm. The diagnosis of high blood pressure requires measuring an elevated blood pressure on three separate occasions over a period of a week or more. Once its existence has been confirmed, other tests must also be carried out to help understand its origin and/or the complications associated with it.//Treatment//Treatment depends on the severity of the condition. For example, people with moderate hypertension can control it by simply changing some lifestyle habits, such as reducing salt and alcohol intake, controlling their weight, exercising regularly and stopping smoking. There are several medications available for the treatment of high blood pressure that can be used alone or in combination. It is up to the doctor to decide which is the best treatment for each situation.//Prevention//Since most cases have their origin in lifestyle, it is important that it is healthy. All the recommendations mentioned in the treatment prevent the onset of this disease.

I work out 6 days a week and it doesn't make any sence to me. Going back to my doctor tomorrow to figure it out. I just don't see why all of a sudden it would make things 10x worse. I didn't take it today to see if it would help. I was able to exersice without my heart rate sky rocketing to ridiculous numbers. This is the first medication like this I have ever taken.

I take 25mg. in the morning, and 25mg. about 11 hours later. The medicine has stopped my PVC's, and also slows down my heart rate.

He sent me home to suffer with it. A couple of weeks ago I made an appt. with the clinic and the most wonderful nurse practioner started me on Metoprolol 25 mg/2x daily and \"I FEEL GREAT!\" I couldn't believe how my heart calmed down, my anxiety was relieved, I SLEPT BETTER b/c it stopped the night time AFIB attacks which constantly woke me up in the middle of the night and i just feel much more comfortable in my own skin...I actually cleaned the house without any huffing, puffing or the usual AFIB attack.

However, @ 25mg I still have bouts of high readings, so when I see my PCP this week, she might raise it to 50mg. I will say that I prefer to see a Cardiologist for this because I am terrified of exercising. Yes, I know exercise and weight loss can lower my bp to healthy levels, but I can't understand I can exert myself while having high bp. Shouldn't it first be controlled with meds first before exercising?",

                    "I have been on some form of metoprolol for seven years. It was actually my first prescribed medication at 28. I never even thought about side effects as being the problems I was experiencing; thought there was always something else that the Doctor's was overlooking. Now that I have read these comments, I suffer from most of the common ones; tiredness, weakness, trouble losing weight, strange dreams, increased sweating, difficulty breathing, etc. Have had numerous tests off and on for the last two years, and nothing is ever found. I have also since then started taking clonidine and amlodipine. Some of these symptoms are probably drug interactions. I noticed a chaotic heartbeat when clonidine was added to the medicines. It has gotten worse for the past two years.",

At times though I have spells that usually run less than a few minutes with a heart rate of around 190 plus and pain. My worst battle with this level lasted about 15 minutes. I take 50mg of Metoprolol 2 times a day on a regular basis but add another 50 if I have the biggies and that settles the heart rate down quickly. Luckily I have no side affects but would love to find something else that quickly slows the heart rate ... mainly to avoid the pain and spooky stuff that goes a;long with it. I've had 11 angioplasties and 10 stents since 1990 and am 70.",
                    "I started metaprolol 12.5 mg once a day 6 weeks ago after having an electrical cardioconversion for a rapid, irregular heartbeat. I take blood pressure and pulse 2times/ day and it is averaging 107/71, pulse 63- working well. It took me a good 4 weeks to adapt to the tough side effects though. I felt very tired to the point of falling asleep during the day, was worn out if I walked to far or even stood too long, felt lightheadedness, nauseated, was afraid to drive. I'm glad I stuck it out, the side effects finally abated. Hang in there, the bad side effects can go away. For the record I'm a 69 year old woman, 5`4\" 128 lbs. I take the pill at night.",

Been taking for a year now & PVCs are still as often as they were. I see/feel no improvement. Taking at night & valsartan in a.m experiencing BP drops. My BP is very high in the morning, like 167/110, before I take my daily dosage of valsartan. Within 2 hours of taking it my BP hasn't improved, then at about 5 hours after I take my BP med my BP plummets to like 71/54, sometimes lower. I fall asleep without even realizing it when it happens & sleep for about half hour. BP readings, about 4 times daily, shows PVCs at all times with an infrequent no PVC reading.

I had no side effects at ALL from this until the first week of June. Today is July 22nd. The first week of June, I was recovering from a sore throat and cough and then three weeks later, I realized that I was STILL hoarse and my voice was cracking. It is STILL like that as of today. Indeed, one of the rare side effects is hoarseness! I called my doctor today and he switched me to Amlopidine.",

This has happened to me quite a bit recently, using metroprolol succ ER 25 mg daily, for about 2 years now.

I still feel a little of that about 12 hours after I take it- I figure that is a slight \" withdrawal\" effect, it lasts about 30-45 min. & I don't have it every day. When I took the generic ( manufacturer, PAR) I felt on a roller coaster, up & down all day. The time release delivery feels to be much smoother with the brand name, toprol- I recommend it.

Cardiologist found source of my chest pain is a narrowed subclavian artery.  The chest pain completely stopped within 24 hours. The only real side effect is difficulty sleeping if instructed to take it at night. I switched to taking it first thing in the morning and I now sleep like a baby. I give it a 9/10 solely for that side effect. I did feel very lethargic when I first took it, but that went away completely after 2 days or so once my body got used to the meds. I feel much more calm than I did before so this medication has really changed the way I feel. improvement is noticeable",

I feel nervous having my natural rhythm manipulated but when it comes to the heart, I'll just do what they say. Had an attack of pericarditis 3 weeks ago and then Atrial fibrillation two days ago. I was told that this was normal after pericarditis. Metoprolol is recommended while heart recovers. ",

It does the job well, but the side affects are rough to handle sometimes. Such as dizziness, sleepless nights, daytime drowsiness, forgetfulness, and depression but, i'm still coping after about four years and i guess on for the rest of my life. But if i can manage after three brother suicides than so can you.",

Been on it for a year - the side effects are strange dreams (not scary...just strange) and exercise difficulties. My doctor recommended sticking with 80% of exercise target heart rate. If you're having side effects, give this medication a couple months to work. It will get better. Make sure your doctor monitors your triglycerides and blood sugar while on any beta blocker. My triglycerides shot through the roof, but now under control with fish oil. ",

After this I went to a cardiologist who gave me 50 mg Metoprolol to take as needed. I am happy that i don't have to take it daily because it does make me sluggish on the very rare times that I do-I am pleased to have a solution when these events happen and my fears of dying suddenly from a heart episode have been drastically reduced.",

It lowered my b.p. by like 20 points/day, and I was fine for 2 days, but then had episodes of exhaustion to the point where I had to lie on the couch for hours to recover from simple housework like washing pots. Was also short of breath like I'd run 5 miles. Swallowing felt weird. Got disoriented while driving. It's a 9 on effectiveness, but can't tolerate the side effects. Am 63/F.",

No more headaches and anxiety is much, much better. I have a bit of shortness of breath, even when sitting at times, but I have been able to jog at the gym. Just started again this week and went 30 minute today. Overall, not sure if anything is working, but I am trying to just trust my Doctor and listen to my body.

I recommend it to anyone with my problem.",

Whenever I would do anything physical, my heart would beat so fast that I would frequently faint. I went to my cardiologist, and she gave me a holter monitor. She saw what I was talking about and gave me 50mg of Toprol-XL everyday. That was over 3 years ago, still on the same dosage, and it is wonderful. For the first few months, I was a little over tired, but that side effect quickly went away.",

At first, it made me very sleepy and dizzy, but I have gotten over that. It lowered my heart rate into the low 60's and 50's, occasionally upper 40's. Halving the dose has not changed this; I am hoping to be off it, or at least on an even lower dose, after my next cardiology appointment in June. I think it is making me forgetful. That has definitely been a problem since taking it, although I was a bit of an absent-minded professor before. It may also have helped lower my blood pressure, although I have made some diet and lifestyle changes that would affect that, also.",

I looked up the side effects of this med and I had 24 of the adverse effects!! I had become so weak that I had to use 2 walking sticks, could hardly get in or out of bed, couldn't walk a 100 ft.

Started out at 50mg, but had breakthroughs regularly, and went up to 100mg after a year. The medication works great to keep my heart rate and blood pressure down to normal levels, however, for the first month on the medication I constantly fell asleep during daily activity, and even now I maintain a sense of perpetual fatigue. Hard to lose weight, and depression creeps up often. Brain fog has slowed my ability to focus and react swiftly, which is frustrating.

It has helped in slowing my rapid heart beat down but the side effects have almost been unbearable. I have hardly slept, after taking the medicine I get short of breath and feel like I'm having an anxiety attack, and I take the medicine at bedtime. In the mornings when I wake for the first two to three hours I feel shaky, sweaty, nauseous, and extremely dizzy. My regular MD took me down to 25mg once daily and I still can't sleep and feel anxious. This is the first day taking 25mg so we'll see how I feel in the morning.",

There must be some difference in the release between the two. This med brings the BP into 120's over low to mid 70's range where I was reg 140's/90's.

It made me tired. I don't know if part of the problem is the doctors I have been seeing don't know what exactly is wrong with my heart and why it does this.

I am not wearing the Event Mintor to track my heart rate. It can get high, which can be scary because you don't know what could happen next. Some sleepless night and early morning wakes with anxiety.

My one vice is my nightly glass of wine, which looks like I'll have to give up and replace with beer once in a while. Oh well, beats the alternative. No other side effects yet. Have had trouble losing any weight but I attribute that to the state they have me on. Ain't it great growin old?",

I would wake at about 2 am and not be able to go back to sleep for several hours. Always tired, then would want to eat. I gained 20 pounds in a couple of months.

I checked the brands of the former medications and the new and found they were different.

Everyone warned me about how tired I was going to be since this medication would literally be slowing my heart down but I've never experienced that. I don't sleep much and have insomnia so that could be why. I also have experienced crazy dreams and I sleep walk from time to time. I've always had dreams and talked in my sleep but I think the medication makes it a little worse especially if you're taking it closer to bed time. I do get a little light headed if I stand up quick and bend down but it's not bad. The benefit I get from this medication outweighs any of these insignificant side effects. I would recommend to push through any side effects and let the medication adapt to you!",

American doctors refuse to give me the prescription. I finally had to go to another country to obtain the prescrption.I absolutely hate the American medical system. I pay a fortune for insurance only for them to not care for me. I am discusted by our greedy, price fixed, non caring medical system.

I haven't felt this calm and comfortable in years! Doctors really need to stop assuming that anxiety is the diagnosis of everyone's problems. There's a bit of drowsiness and fatigue in the beginning but that goes away as your body gets used to it. I am very happy with this medication.",

I figured out the only change I'd made was taking metoprolol so I weaned myself off of it and the depression cleared right up.

                    "//What is it?//Headache and migraine are different entities. Migraine is one of the most common and well characterized, but there are 14 broad categories that can be subdivided into more than 200 different forms. Migraine itself has about 20 different genres. In general, headaches are divided into two large groups: primary and secondary. Primary illnesses correspond to a disease, not reflecting other health problems and represent around 90% of the total. Secondary symptoms are symptoms of diseases of the nervous system or other organs of the human body. They can occur in cases of flu, alcohol poisoning or withdrawal, minor head trauma, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels) or a high blood pressure crisis. Migraine is a primary headache in which very intense episodes of pain occur interspersed with periods without symptoms. In general, it begins between the ages of 15 and 40, but it can appear in childhood or shortly after the first menstruation. If it appears for the first time after the age of 45, other causes must be excluded. Some of its characteristics are closely associated with the female reproductive cycle: higher prevalence after the first menstruation or during the menstrual period; occasional worsening due to taking birth control pills or hormone therapy; attenuation or disappearance during pregnancy or menopause. Before adolescence, migraines affect boys and girls equally. From then on, it is two to three times more common in females. It is estimated that 8% to 15% of individuals living in Western countries (including Portugal) suffer from this problem. The fact of reaching people in the productive phase implies large economic, social and family costs.//Symptoms//It appears recurrently, several times throughout life, but always with completely free intervals. If it occurs every day, it is probably overuse of painkillers or other medications. Drug abuse can convert a migraine into a chronic daily headache. There are people who preferably appear on the weekend. These crises can be precipitated by changes in sleep schedule, failure to eat breakfast, reduced stress or alcohol abuse. In these cases, it is important to consider a lifestyle change over the weekend. The symptoms are intense and often prevent work or study. The pain tends to be throbbing, worsening with physical exertion or head movements. In general, it affects only one side of the head, and is accompanied by nausea, vomiting, intolerance to light, noise and some smells. It is not mandatory that all of these elements are present simultaneously. And they can occur twice a week or just a few throughout a lifetime. During attacks, people seek a dark, quiet place to rest or fall asleep. An episode can last from a few hours to three days. Between attacks, there are usually no complaints. Some types of migraines may have more complex symptoms (with aura). These forms are less common, affecting around 15% of people with this problem, and include transient neurological symptoms, originating attributable to certain areas of the brain. The other signs are identical to those of migraine without aura. The most common auras are temporary vision disorders, in the form of loss of vision on one side of the visual field, blurred images, perception of bright points, geometric figures or bright zigzags. Other auras can be translated as tingling or numbness on one side of the face or one of the hands. There are people who have difficulty speaking or even temporary paralysis of their limbs, usually only on one side of the body. These changes last about 10 to 30 minutes and precede the pain. In children, migraines tend to be bilateral, less intense and of shorter duration. Vomiting and dark circles can be exuberant. Disturbances in sleep and meal schedules are common precipitating factors. Treating these crises is easier than in adults. Sleep usually gives good results. At these ages, the occipital location is not normal and, when present, requires a medical consultation. Likewise, the presence of headaches with morning vomiting or other unusual symptoms in very young children should be seen by a healthcare professional.//Causes//It is caused by a combination of brain processes: excitation/depression of cells, dilation of arteries and release of chemicals. People with migraine are more sensitive to certain stimuli, environmental or from their own body, that can trigger these brain processes. It is also thought that there is some genetic susceptibility. Some individuals can identify the signs of their attacks. The most common are cheese, chocolate, strawberries, seafood, wine, artificial sauces, changes in sleep patterns, stress, menstruation, fasting, physical exercise, and minor trauma. Others cannot identify them at all. People who drink coffee regularly may experience headaches when they stop this habit.//Diagnosis//The key to diagnosis lies in the clinical history, physical and neurological examination. Observation of the fundus is a very important part of these procedures. In some cases, it may be necessary to resort to computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to exclude other diseases.//Treatment//Migraines have no cure but can be controlled. There are medications and behaviors that can reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks. Symptomatic treatment, during acute periods, involves resting in a quiet, dark place. Pressure or cold can be applied to the area of \u200b\u200bpain. At this stage, analgesics, anti-inflammatories, antiemetics and triptans are very useful.//Prevention//People with migraines should create calendars that allow them to identify their symptoms and assess their impact on their quality of life. The first step in prevention is to identify and eliminate precipitating factors, whenever possible. In some cases, it is necessary to use daily medication to reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks, but there are no drugs specifically developed for their prevention. However, there are some drugs used in other contexts that have proven to be effective, such as beta-blockers, antidepressants or antiepileptics, and these should always be prescribed by a doctor.

                    "//What is it?//This is an increase in blood pressure above values \u200b\u200bconsidered normal. It occurs when there is excessive pressure of blood on the walls of the arteries during circulation. It can increase at certain times, due to physical or emotional exertion, and it is natural that, after these situations, its values \u200b\u200breturn to normal levels. This condition is only serious and causes health problems when it remains high for months, or when it increases suddenly. It is important to know that tension tends to increase with age. However, hypertension should not be considered normal in the elderly. As a rule, arterial hypertension is considered to be present when the maximum pressure is greater than or equal to 160 mmHge/or the minimum pressure is greater than or equal to 95 mmHge. High blood pressure is associated with coronary heart disease, stroke and heart failure and is the most common modifiable cardiovascular risk factor, which is why its treatment is essential in preventing these pathologies. Cardiovascular diseases are the cause of death for at least 34.1% of the Brazilian population, mainly as a consequence of stroke and coronary disease. It is estimated that the prevalence of high blood pressure in the Portuguese adult population is 42.1%, with only 39.0% of these patients taking antihypertensive drugs and only 11.2% being under control.//Symptoms//In the first few years, it does not cause any symptoms. Over time, blood pressure ends up damaging the blood vessels and the main organs of the body, such as the brain, heart and kidneys, causing headaches, dizziness, tinnitus and increased heart rate. The main diseases associated with high blood pressure are stroke, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, heart and kidney failure.//Causes//Around 90% of cases are related to lifestyle habits. Obesity is one of the important factors. Each pound of fat requires the formation of an additional 1.5 kilometers of small blood vessels to supply the excess adipose tissue. Increased blood pressure is required to pump blood through them. Therefore, being overweight by 20% or more increases the risk of hypertension by five times;;/ Excess salt consumption. It is known that high blood pressure is less frequent in populations where its consumption is low. Our body only needs 1/8 of a teaspoon of salt per day;;/ Tobacco is another cause to consider. Even just one cigarette can increase it for about 30 minutes. A pack-a-day smoker can, through smoking alone, cause an increase in blood pressure for 24 hours;;/ Around 5% to 15% of cases may be related to moderate alcohol consumption. On the other hand, one cup of coffee a day can cause an increase in blood pressure;;/ Physical inactivity and stress are also at its origin;;/ The remaining 10% of high blood pressure cases have organic causes, such as some hormonal changes, kidney or blood vessel diseases.//Diagnosis//It is important to remember that high blood pressure cannot be felt, it must be measured. In order to obtain correct values, it is important to rest in a sitting position for at least five minutes before measuring. You should use the same device and always measure on the same arm. The diagnosis of high blood pressure requires measuring an elevated blood pressure on three separate occasions over a period of a week or more. Once its existence has been confirmed, other tests must also be carried out to help understand its origin and/or the complications associated with it.//Treatment//Treatment depends on the severity of the condition. For example, people with moderate hypertension can control it by simply changing some lifestyle habits, such as reducing salt and alcohol intake, controlling their weight, exercising regularly and stopping smoking. There are several medications available for the treatment of high blood pressure that can be used alone or in combination. It is up to the doctor to decide which is the best treatment for each situation.//Prevention//Since most cases have their origin in lifestyle, it is important that it is healthy. All the recommendations mentioned in the treatment prevent the onset of this disease.

                    "I have been on metoprolol er 12.5mg since September 20th. The first month was great then on October 21st my resting heart rate went from 61 to 70 and when I walk it suddenly goes to 140 for no reason. I work out 6 days a week and it doesn't make any sence to me. Going back to my doctor tomorrow to figure it out. I just don't see why all of a sudden it would make things 10x worse. I didn't take it today to see if it would help. I was able to exersice without my heart rate sky rocketing to ridiculous numbers. This is the first medication like this I have ever taken. Plus the weight gain is ridiculous. I lost 15 lbs before starting this medication and less then 2 months I gained it all back.",
                    "I took Lopressor for 24 years it worked very well in lowering my blood pressure and even calming my anxiety but lately it doesn't work on me very well as before, I guess the doctor will change it.",
                    "I'm a 72 year 'young' female, and I have been taking Metoprolol Tartrate for 7 years, for PVC's Premature Ventricular Contractions of my heart, and also for Tachycardia. I take 25mg. in the morning, and 25mg. about 11 hours later. The medicine has stopped my PVC's, and also slows down my heart rate. When I first started taking Metoprorlol Tartrate, it made me very tired, but after about 2 weeks, my body got used to it, and I was fine.",
                    "I have been taking Toprol XL for about 2 years. My doctor has now put me on 200mg twice a day, total 400mg a day, this had to be approve by my insurance company and it was. This is working for me, no side effects and my blood pressure is steady at 114/70.",
                    "I was diagnosed with AFIB in 2012 at the age of 43, long sad frustrating story cut short, the doctor said there was nothing he could do about it. He sent me home to suffer with it. A couple of weeks ago I made an appt. with the clinic and the most wonderful nurse practioner started me on Metoprolol 25 mg/2x daily and \"I FEEL GREAT!\" I couldn't believe how my heart calmed down, my anxiety was relieved, I SLEPT BETTER b/c it stopped the night time AFIB attacks which constantly woke me up in the middle of the night and i just feel much more comfortable in my own skin...I actually cleaned the house without any huffing, puffing or the usual AFIB attack. I agree that it makes me drowsy which is becoming less severe I LOVE IT! :)",
                    "I'm giving this med a 7 so far just because I haven't had any real side effects with it, like I did with another bp med (can't remember the name). However, @ 25mg I still have bouts of high readings, so when I see my PCP this week, she might raise it to 50mg. I will say that I prefer to see a Cardiologist for this because I am terrified of exercising. Yes, I know exercise and weight loss can lower my bp to healthy levels, but I can't understand I can exert myself while having high bp. Shouldn't it first be controlled with meds first before exercising?",
                    "I have been taking Metoprolol 25mg once a day for 13 days. It has lowered my heart rate by about 30 beats a minute but I am always tired, get chest pain, headache and numbness. Little to no benefit in lowering my blood pressure (140/95's).",
                    "I have been on some form of metoprolol for seven years. It was actually my first prescribed medication at 28. I never even thought about side effects as being the problems I was experiencing; thought there was always something else that the Doctor's was overlooking. Now that I have read these comments, I suffer from most of the common ones; tiredness, weakness, trouble losing weight, strange dreams, increased sweating, difficulty breathing, etc. Have had numerous tests off and on for the last two years, and nothing is ever found. I have also since then started taking clonidine and amlodipine. Some of these symptoms are probably drug interactions. I noticed a chaotic heartbeat when clonidine was added to the medicines. It has gotten worse for the past two years.",
                    "I have had constant afib for over 2 years though mostly tolerable. At times though I have spells that usually run less than a few minutes with a heart rate of around 190 plus and pain. My worst battle with this level lasted about 15 minutes. I take 50mg of Metoprolol 2 times a day on a regular basis but add another 50 if I have the biggies and that settles the heart rate down quickly. Luckily I have no side affects but would love to find something else that quickly slows the heart rate ... mainly to avoid the pain and spooky stuff that goes a;long with it. I've had 11 angioplasties and 10 stents since 1990 and am 70.",
                    "I started metaprolol 12.5 mg once a day 6 weeks ago after having an electrical cardioconversion for a rapid, irregular heartbeat. I take blood pressure and pulse 2times/ day and it is averaging 107/71, pulse 63- working well. It took me a good 4 weeks to adapt to the tough side effects though. I felt very tired to the point of falling asleep during the day, was worn out if I walked to far or even stood too long, felt lightheadedness, nauseated, was afraid to drive. I'm glad I stuck it out, the side effects finally abated. Hang in there, the bad side effects can go away. For the record I'm a 69 year old woman, 5`4\" 128 lbs. I take the pill at night.",
                    "I had terrible symptoms of MVP that landed me in the hospital for 5 days. I started taking this medicine 25 mg a day and my symptoms are so much better.

Been taking for a year now & PVCs are still as often as they were. I see/feel no improvement. Taking at night & valsartan in a.m experiencing BP drops. My BP is very high in the morning, like 167/110, before I take my daily dosage of valsartan. Within 2 hours of taking it my BP hasn't improved, then at about 5 hours after I take my BP med my BP plummets to like 71/54, sometimes lower. I fall asleep without even realizing it when it happens & sleep for about half hour. BP readings, about 4 times daily, shows PVCs at all times with an infrequent no PVC reading. Not convinced this med is doing anything for me.",

My doctor prescribed 25 mg of metoprolol for me and I started taking it in February of this year (2015). My blood pressure was lowered from 140/90 to 125/82, so it DOES work in that respect. I had no side effects at ALL from this until the first week of June. Today is July 22nd. The first week of June, I was recovering from a sore throat and cough and then three weeks later, I realized that I was STILL hoarse and my voice was cracking. It is STILL like that as of today. Indeed, one of the rare side effects is hoarseness! I called my doctor today and he switched me to Amlopidine.",

This has happened to me quite a bit recently, using metroprolol succ ER 25 mg daily, for about 2 years now.

I still feel a little of that about 12 hours after I take it- I figure that is a slight \" withdrawal\" effect, it lasts about 30-45 min. & I don't have it every day. When I took the generic ( manufacturer, PAR) I felt on a roller coaster, up & down all day. The time release delivery feels to be much smoother with the brand name, toprol- I recommend it. All in all, it works well, keeps my heart in sinus rhythm, but it's a tough drug to have to take.",
                    "This drug has literally changed my life in a very short time. I was having horrible chest pains, with a mixture of general anxiety due to work/home stress. Cardiologist found source of my chest pain is a narrowed subclavian artery.  The chest pain completely stopped within 24 hours. The only real side effect is difficulty sleeping if instructed to take it at night. I switched to taking it first thing in the morning and I now sleep like a baby. I give it a 9/10 solely for that side effect. I did feel very lethargic when I first took it, but that went away completely after 2 days or so once my body got used to the meds.

I feel nervous having my natural rhythm manipulated but when it comes to the heart, I'll just do what they say. Had an attack of pericarditis 3 weeks ago and then Atrial fibrillation two days ago.

After this I went to a cardiologist who gave me 50 mg Metoprolol to take as needed. I am happy that i don't have to take it daily because it does make me sluggish on the very rare times that I do-I am pleased to have a solution when these events happen and my fears of dying suddenly from a heart episode have been drastically reduced.",

It lowered my b.p. by like 20 points/day, and I was fine for 2 days, but then had episodes of exhaustion to the point where I had to lie on the couch for hours to recover from simple housework like washing pots.

The first month or so was tough as I had headaches, chest pains shortness of breath, etc. I think a large part of it was anxiety from a life changing surprise condition. No more headaches and anxiety is much, much better. I have a bit of shortness of breath, even when sitting at times, but I have been able to jog at the gym.

At first, it made me very sleepy and dizzy, but I have gotten over that. It lowered my heart rate into the low 60's and 50's, occasionally upper 40's. Halving the dose has not changed this; I am hoping to be off it, or at least on an even lower dose, after my next cardiology appointment in June. I think it is making me forgetful. That has definitely been a problem since taking it, although I was a bit of an absent-minded professor before. It may also have helped lower my blood pressure, although I have made some diet and lifestyle changes that would affect that, also.",

I looked up the side effects of this med and I had 24 of the adverse effects!! I had become so weak that I had to use 2 walking sticks, could hardly get in or out of bed, couldn't walk a 100 ft.

The medication works great to keep my heart rate and blood pressure down to normal levels, however, for the first month on the medication I constantly fell asleep during daily activity, and even now I maintain a sense of perpetual fatigue.

A year later I can say palps are rare. This medicine worked wonderful for me.",

I have been on Lopressor for 30 years. I have tried numerous other medications to control my arrhythmia, but Metroprolol is the best.

I figured out the only change I'd made was taking metoprolol so I weaned myself off of it and the depression cleared right up.

                    "//What is it?//Headache and migraine are different entities. Migraine is one of the most common and well characterized, but there are 14 broad categories that can be subdivided into more than 200 different forms. Migraine itself has about 20 different genres. In general, headaches are divided into two large groups: primary and secondary. Primary illnesses correspond to a disease, not reflecting other health problems and represent around 90% of the total. Secondary symptoms are symptoms of diseases of the nervous system or other organs of the human body. They can occur in cases of flu, alcohol poisoning or withdrawal, minor head trauma, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels) or a high blood pressure crisis. Migraine is a primary headache in which very intense episodes of pain occur interspersed with periods without symptoms. In general, it begins between the ages of 15 and 40, but it can appear in childhood or shortly after the first menstruation. If it appears for the first time after the age of 45, other causes must be excluded. Some of its characteristics are closely associated with the female reproductive cycle: higher prevalence after the first menstruation or during the menstrual period; occasional worsening due to taking birth control pills or hormone therapy; attenuation or disappearance during pregnancy or menopause. Before adolescence, migraines affect boys and girls equally. From then on, it is two to three times more common in females. It is estimated that 8% to 15% of individuals living in Western countries (including Portugal) suffer from this problem. The fact of reaching people in the productive phase implies large economic, social and family costs.//Symptoms//It appears recurrently, several times throughout life, but always with completely free intervals. If it occurs every day, it is probably overuse of painkillers or other medications. Drug abuse can convert a migraine into a chronic daily headache. There are people who preferably appear on the weekend. These crises can be precipitated by changes in sleep schedule, failure to eat breakfast, reduced stress or alcohol abuse. In these cases, it is important to consider a lifestyle change over the weekend. The symptoms are intense and often prevent work or study. The pain tends to be throbbing, worsening with physical exertion or head movements. In general, it affects only one side of the head, and is accompanied by nausea, vomiting, intolerance to light, noise and some smells. It is not mandatory that all of these elements are present simultaneously. And they can occur twice a week or just a few throughout a lifetime. During attacks, people seek a dark, quiet place to rest or fall asleep. An episode can last from a few hours to three days. Between attacks, there are usually no complaints. Some types of migraines may have more complex symptoms (with aura). These forms are less common, affecting around 15% of people with this problem, and include transient neurological symptoms, originating attributable to certain areas of the brain. The other signs are identical to those of migraine without aura. The most common auras are temporary vision disorders, in the form of loss of vision on one side of the visual field, blurred images, perception of bright points, geometric figures or bright zigzags. Other auras can be translated as tingling or numbness on one side of the face or one of the hands. There are people who have difficulty speaking or even temporary paralysis of their limbs, usually only on one side of the body. These changes last about 10 to 30 minutes and precede the pain. In children, migraines tend to be bilateral, less intense and of shorter duration. Vomiting and dark circles can be exuberant. Disturbances in sleep and meal schedules are common precipitating factors. Treating these crises is easier than in adults. Sleep usually gives good results. At these ages, the occipital location is not normal and, when present, requires a medical consultation. Likewise, the presence of headaches with morning vomiting or other unusual symptoms in very young children should be seen by a healthcare professional.//Causes//It is caused by a combination of brain processes: excitation/depression of cells, dilation of arteries and release of chemicals. People with migraine are more sensitive to certain stimuli, environmental or from their own body, that can trigger these brain processes. It is also thought that there is some genetic susceptibility. Some individuals can identify the signs of their attacks. The most common are cheese, chocolate, strawberries, seafood, wine, artificial sauces, changes in sleep patterns, stress, menstruation, fasting, physical exercise, and minor trauma. Others cannot identify them at all. People who drink coffee regularly may experience headaches when they stop this habit.//Diagnosis//The key to diagnosis lies in the clinical history, physical and neurological examination. Observation of the fundus is a very important part of these procedures. In some cases, it may be necessary to resort to computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to exclude other diseases.//Treatment//Migraines have no cure but can be controlled. There are medications and behaviors that can reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks. Symptomatic treatment, during acute periods, involves resting in a quiet, dark place. Pressure or cold can be applied to the area of \u200b\u200bpain. At this stage, analgesics, anti-inflammatories, antiemetics and triptans are very useful.//Prevention//People with migraines should create calendars that allow them to identify their symptoms and assess their impact on their quality of life. The first step in prevention is to identify and eliminate precipitating factors, whenever possible. In some cases, it is necessary to use daily medication to reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks, but there are no drugs specifically developed for their prevention. However, there are some drugs used in other contexts that have proven to be effective, such as beta-blockers, antidepressants or antiepileptics, and these should always be prescribed by a doctor.

                    "//What is it?//This is an increase in blood pressure above values \u200b\u200bconsidered normal. It occurs when there is excessive pressure of blood on the walls of the arteries during circulation. It can increase at certain times, due to physical or emotional exertion, and it is natural that, after these situations, its values \u200b\u200breturn to normal levels. This condition is only serious and causes health problems when it remains high for months, or when it increases suddenly. It is important to know that tension tends to increase with age. However, hypertension should not be considered normal in the elderly. As a rule, arterial hypertension is considered to be present when the maximum pressure is greater than or equal to 160 mmHge/or the minimum pressure is greater than or equal to 95 mmHge. High blood pressure is associated with coronary heart disease, stroke and heart failure and is the most common modifiable cardiovascular risk factor, which is why its treatment is essential in preventing these pathologies. Cardiovascular diseases are the cause of death for at least 34.1% of the Brazilian population, mainly as a consequence of stroke and coronary disease. It is estimated that the prevalence of high blood pressure in the Portuguese adult population is 42.1%, with only 39.0% of these patients taking antihypertensive drugs and only 11.2% being under control.//Symptoms//In the first few years, it does not cause any symptoms. Over time, blood pressure ends up damaging the blood vessels and the main organs of the body, such as the brain, heart and kidneys, causing headaches, dizziness, tinnitus and increased heart rate. The main diseases associated with high blood pressure are stroke, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, heart and kidney failure.//Causes//Around 90% of cases are related to lifestyle habits. Obesity is one of the important factors. Each pound of fat requires the formation of an additional 1.5 kilometers of small blood vessels to supply the excess adipose tissue. Increased blood pressure is required to pump blood through them. Therefore, being overweight by 20% or more increases the risk of hypertension by five times;;/ Excess salt consumption. It is known that high blood pressure is less frequent in populations where its consumption is low. Our body only needs 1/8 of a teaspoon of salt per day;;/ Tobacco is another cause to consider. Even just one cigarette can increase it for about 30 minutes. A pack-a-day smoker can, through smoking alone, cause an increase in blood pressure for 24 hours;;/ Around 5% to 15% of cases may be related to moderate alcohol consumption. On the other hand, one cup of coffee a day can cause an increase in blood pressure;;/ Physical inactivity and stress are also at its origin;;/ The remaining 10% of high blood pressure cases have organic causes, such as some hormonal changes, kidney or blood vessel diseases.//Diagnosis//It is important to remember that high blood pressure cannot be felt, it must be measured. In order to obtain correct values, it is important to rest in a sitting position for at least five minutes before measuring. You should use the same device and always measure on the same arm. The diagnosis of high blood pressure requires measuring an elevated blood pressure on three separate occasions over a period of a week or more. Once its existence has been confirmed, other tests must also be carried out to help understand its origin and/or the complications associated with it.//Treatment//Treatment depends on the severity of the condition. For example, people with moderate hypertension can control it by simply changing some lifestyle habits, such as reducing salt and alcohol intake, controlling their weight, exercising regularly and stopping smoking. There are several medications available for the treatment of high blood pressure that can be used alone or in combination. It is up to the doctor to decide which is the best treatment for each situation.//Prevention//Since most cases have their origin in lifestyle, it is important that it is healthy. All the recommendations mentioned in the treatment prevent the onset of this disease.

                    "I've been taking amitriptyline since January 2013 after being diagnosed with fibromyalgia. I tried cymbalta for a week and my Dr decided that since it kept me awake 24/7 that it wasn't a good fit for me even though it relieved my pain. I started with 25 mg. After 2 weeks I had some breakthrough pain, so my Dr increased my dosage to 50mg and I'm still on that dosage today. For the first full year I was on this I never had pain and felt 'cured'. As time went on, it seems to help control my pain. I do still have pain, but at a low manageable level. I take this around 7pm each evening to avoid feeling overly drowsy in the mornings. This med allows me to have a fairly normal life.",
                    "I have been on Ambien for many years and it stopped working for me. My dr. has tried some other meds, but so far nothing seems to work. I've been on Elavil for about a week now and it seems as if I'm taking a sugar pill. It's just not working for me I wish it did work as well for as it has for others.",
                    "Wanted to share this with everyone. I was given this mediation 6 years ago. I had a lot of problems like fibromyalgia, migraines, depression, insomnia, IBS -C. I was taken a lot of different meds for all these problems, but nothing worked. When I was first put on this medication at 25mg I could sleep for the first time in years. I was waking up on the morning refreshed and happy. I noticed about 6 months later my migraines were not as often as I normally would have them. As time went on I needed my meds to be increased. I now take 150mg. This drug is a life saver. My fibromyalgia pain is less, migraines less, anxiety way less and it also improved my IBS C symptoms. I would recommend this Medication to anyone with any of these problem",
                    "I was diagnosed with interstitial cystitis several months ago. The pain was so debilitating that I couldn't even see patients for about 3 days (I'm a dentist). The pain brought me to tears. I was afraid that I would have to go on disibility. My new urologist put me on amytripyline a few weeks ago. It worked almost immediately. Most days I'm almost pain-free. I got my life back.",
                    "I suffered with chronic pain for about seven years. Went to many specialist who told me either nothing was wrong or I had fibromyalgia. I tried all medications out there for pain, muscle relaxers, anti-depressants and medication for epilepsy. As well as meds for fibro.  Nothing helped. Finally I found a new Nerologist who put me on a combo of Amitriptyline and Prozac. I am on both the smallest doses. It has been a miracle for my pain. I wish I would have known about this 7 years ago. My biggest problem with it is weight gain like 13 pounds. My diet has not changed and I took up running. But no weight comes off. I guess I rather have less pain and be a little over weight then skinny and in tons of pain:)",
                    "Started at 10 mg up to 25mg. Doesn't help pain but I do sleep better. Extremely dry mouth and skin since I began 2 months ago. Not sure if the sleep is worth the sore dry mouth and skin that when I rub it, snows dead skin cells everywhere.",
                    "Scared to death of taking it but broke tabs in half to 5mg in order to increase dose slowly. I have developed a bit of chronic tooth pain so taking it for pain.  Took it at 7 pm and felt mildly sedated by 11pm. Actually didn't sleep well but I think I was on high alert for the side effects which didn't happen. A bit groggy in morning but nothing special that I can't deal with. I think the way to go is to build up if you are scared of meds like me.  I wrote this to encourage others to try the medicine because I am as scared as anyone to take drugs like this. I",
                    "Works great to control my migraines it cut the frequency in half. Before starting this medication I would suffer migraines 3-4x/week. And the days that I didn't have a migraine, I still felt \"foggy\". However after only 6 weeks on it I gained 30 lbs, had urinary retention.",
                    "After taking only one 10mg pill I keep having panic attacks. Stay away!",
                    "Improved neurological functions, less flare-ups of the autonomic system. Helps - body temperature regulation has become a little better, able to sweat a little now, able to swallow now with no problems, hand tremors a majority of the time, and about half the adrenaline rushes than before. Does not help - sleep, heart rate and blood pressure, GI problems (gastroparesis, stomach pains, or constipation), heat intolerance, brain fog (memory problems). Has had to increase medication a few times, but am still on it. I am still on this medication and would not want to go off this - I have seen improvement.",
                    "Miracle drug suffered for many years with depression and stress since prescribed I love a normal life again.",
                    "Though it certainly helped me stay asleep once I had gone to bed, it caused me to be groggy the next day and I had the hardest time just getting out of bed. That could have been tolerable, however, if it were not for the hallucinations I suffered once I would lay down. It felt as though people were pushing on the mattress and grabbing at my feet. It was so bad, in fact, that it caused me to have to sleep with the light on, and I'm a 32 year old man! This ultimately caused me to have to stop taking this.",
                    "I take 30mg at bedtime, and after only 3 days, I was able to sleep through the night (without having to pee). I couldn't be happier with the results. 80% improvement in my Interstitial Cystitis. ",
                    "I have been on Amitriptyline 75mg for a year and a half. It does amazing things for depression and even pain. I was suicidal everyday until I was prescribed this medicine. I have had only one side affect. Dry mouth! The dry mouth is terrible. I carry gum with me always lol. I recommend this medicine to ANYONE with depression, nerve pain, and insomnia. It will change your life for the better! I promise you! Give it a try!",
                    "I was one of those people who thought nothing would work for me - I was too far gone and beyond help.  Restless, sleepless nights and all the anxiety and depression were killing me. And then I found Amitriptyline.  At last.....Sleep.  That's all that mattered to begin with. You simply cannot underestimate the power of sleep. During the day I felt far less agitated and less stressed. Of course life can still throw slings and arrows your way and there are side effects for sure but none as bad as the frazzled state I was in before I took them.",
                    "I have been dealing with anxiety/ panic attacks and migraines for 10mths and have tried about everything out there (Prozac/ Buspirone/ Setraline/ Ativan) and NOTHING seemed to work but Ativan. Everything else gave me really bad reactions from burning skin to heart burn, palpitations, shortness of breath, insomnia just to name a few and even worsened my anxiety and led to more panic attacks. The only problem with Ativan was that because it is a Benzo and it is highly addictive so my doctor did not want to prescribe that anymore. My migraines got so severe that I was seen by a Neurologist last week and he prescribed AMITRIPTYLINE so far it's working wonders . I am able sleep through the whole night and my panic attacks are gone!!!!!",
                    "This medication literally is a life saver. I've had chronic migraines for 10 years. I was on 10mg for 6 months then my migraines came back. My doctor upped my dosage to 20 and now it's back to normal. But one side effect I can't seem to shake off is sleepiness. I'm sleeping close to 16 hours+ a day.",
                    "Works wonderful for insomnia. Just the side effects are terrible. Headaches, drowsiness and WEIGHT GAIN!",
                    "Keep you from wanting to kill yourself make you feel more comfortable just meadows you out keeps me from having back flashing. First time I didn't like bad side affects the Dr gave me 50mg a day but I take 50mg bed time then I cut pill in half late morning and early evening. First time taking make you sleep really good. I have know side affect. I like keeps you calm",
                    "I take this for Bipolar disoder 2, with severe depressive episodes. Helps tremendously for my depression symptoms, as well as aiding in controlling mood swings along with a mood stabilizer. Helps with insomnia tremendously. Sometimes the daytime sedation can last a long time at higher doses, and you'll probably get dry mouth, constipation, or blurry vision/dizziness, at least at first. This medication works great for a lot of people when other things fail, just be aware that the trade off is that some annoying side effects are fairly common. Myself, the benefits far outweigh the negatives.",
                    "Take for migraines not sure it does much good as I still get them twice a month it did however see off my sciatica after 3 years of constant pain!",
                    "This was a phenomenal find! I could not function everyday tasks until beginning amitriptyline. I couldn't even try to upset myself, or feel worried while on amitriptyline. I went from constant unknown fear and breathing difficulty to floating on a cloud without a fear in the world. First few weeks had some challenging side effects. Blackouts, memory loss, numbness in face, lathargic, more sleepy than usual, dry mouth and munchies. All those disappeared after a month or so. Did try to get off it to see how my anxiety could manage on its own. Withdrawals were pretty miserable. Two weeks of headaches, nausea, irritability, and dizziness. Did get back on it when anxiety came back full blown. Slowly increased up to 75mg. Hope it works for you!",
                    "After one of the worst years of my life I developed anxiety, was prescribed Endep 25mg, progressed to 50mg then 100mg. Side effects were full on and included but were not limited to dizziness, short term memory loss, black outs (momentary but scary), nightmares, indigestion, incredible tiredness (cloudy head, fuzziness), dry mouth and one of the deepest most horrible depressive states I have ever been in which included suicide thoughts , but hey, I didn't have anxiety! THIS IS A WARNING, if you develop suicidal thoughts while taking this drug see a doctor immediately!",
                    "I was prescribed Amitriptyline for insomnia after having a negative experience with taking Ambien. Ambien worked fine until its side effects kicked in then I stopped taking it because the side effects were unreasonable. Amitriptyline helped me sleep until one night I awoke to buzzing in my ears/head. From reasoning there might be lifelong buzzing in my head I discontinued the Amitriptyline. Shortly after discontinuing the buzzing went away and never returned. Bottome line: there are much better oral's to take to assist in sleeping. I feel Amitriptyline did however correct a brain imbalance that was produced by the Ambien; and I found the culprit to my insomnia: I have an adrenaline allergy, from stress, anxiety and screen-time.",
                    "This medication has been very effective for my anxiety. I've taken 75mg for the past 9yrs. No more heart palpitations or tightness in my chest. I have tried others prior to the Elavil, but found I woke up with a hangover and a out of body feeling. If Ii forget to order refill before I run out it takes a 3 days to feel the effects. ",
                    "it wasnt til last year my sophomore year i finally just couldnt take the headaches, they got soo bad i had to go to the doctor and they prescribed me amitriptyline. Let me say they started off as a miracle worker and definetely recommend it to prevent it. But it does has its side affects, i am suffering from depression , panic attacks , suicidal thoughts and makes me feel so tired and sleepy its not funny. Im a junior now in highschool , my hardest and most important year and i kinda hate that i took and am taking amitriptyline. I cant take this med anymore. My grades are so bad right now because i can never stay focus at school and feel so damm tired i dont want to do anything.cant concetrate, i act different now and i dont feel myelf.",
                    "Currently at 200mg to control insomnia and migraines. Only small side effect is occasional slight dizziness. Other than that, now that I am on correct dosage, minimal side effects and complete relief from issues.. as an aside, was unable to get refill for a week once and experienced extreme, worsening withdrawal symptoms: constant, mild headaches. Diarrhea. Vomiting. Debilitating nausea, dizziness and vertigo. Runny nose. Complete loss of appetite. Feeling dehydrated. Constant panic attacks: uncontrollable anxiety, racing heart, profuse sweating and feeling dehydrated and like I'm gasping for air. I've had remarkable success with the drug, but I caution anyone considering stopping to confer w their dr and wean off rather than cold turkey.",
                    "Caused blurred vision and left me feeling drowsy.",
                    "I was diagnosed with Interstitial Cystitis in March of this year. The first few weeks were some of the worst of my life. I changed my diet, was put on Elmiron, Zyrtec and Vesicare with zero relief in any symptoms. Was at the end of my rope when my PCP suggested Elavil. In 3 days my symptoms were nearly gone. Pain was gone. Urgency/frequency cut in half. But I immediately started gaining weight. A lot of weight, and fast. And I am diabetic and any weight gain is very bad for me. So I've had to choose to not take it and live with the pain and constant peeing because I cannot afford to gain any weight due the diabetes. I'm basically distraught. Diabetes will kill me, but the Interstitial Cystitis pain is causing major depression. I am at a loss as nothing else has worked.",
                    "I started amitriptyline about 5 or 6 years ago. It was a miracle drug. But it has stopped working in the last 2 months. I've been in the ER 5 times in 2 months. 2 episodes fell on a day I had wakes to go to, and missed them due to CVS. Has anyone had success with any other medications? I am desperate for a new med before I loose my job!!!!",
                    "I could barely function after 2pm until I went on this medicine. I was diagnosed with Interstitial Cystitis in August-it was devastating. My quality of life was horrible--pain through the roof and urgency. I could barely get my kids to school every day. After 1 day of 25 mg Amytriptiline at bedtime, my pain virtually disappeared. It saved my life.",
                    "The first time I was aware of the existence of this drug, a gastroenterologist gave it to me for sharp stomach pain. The cause was idiopathic and/or overdetermined by a variety of problems, especially some damage to the hypothalamus.  That was in 2001, and worked IMMEDIATELY. Stomach pain? Gone. Only had about a 2-week supply and stopped with no ill effects. In fact, it perked up my mood! I always remembered that this was the drug that solved a serious pain problem.  In 2015, I had severe anxiety & my appetite was completely gone. I knew what I needed. The psych. gave me Elavil, even though he was inclined toward Effexor. I ate! I felt good again. I am still on it. I am concerned re: withdrawal. Short-term use recommended if possible.",
                    "I was prescribed 50mg and the first time I took it this way WAY too high of a dosage. I felt drowsy for the entire day the next day like I was on drugs. I was prescribed this a few months go and I still have a many pills left because I only take it when I feel like I won't be able to sleep and I cut the pill in half so that it's only 25mg. I usually sleep like a baby but it is really hard to wake up. If I take it on the weekend I end up sleeping about 10 hours. I still feel pretty drowsy with 25mg but it wears off by the middle of the day.",
                    "I was very tired the first week, but after pushing through it I felt better. Headaches took about 2-3 weeks to go away, but they were gone. I had been having headaches almost daily and they were getting severe. I felt pain free, HOWEVER, I felt like my IQ had dropped about 20 points. I couldnt think of things quickly anymore and it was getting worse. My typing was getting worse and I was forgetting everyday things like family members names. I pulled backwards out of my driveway one day and with myself turned around looking out the rear window, I couldnt orient myself to figure out which side of the road to be on. I was on Elavil for almost 2 months. I took myself off 1 week ago. Headaches are coming back, but my memory is returning",
                    "I hate this medicine I think I ruined me I lost a year of my life on this pill I didn't do anything for my migraines at all, I slept for up to 16 hours a day on it and it made me stupid. I became a d average student my jr year of high school if I accidentally missed a days dose I would have to skip school because I would be puking all day because of it. I absolutely hate the medicine if you can't tell.",
                    "I've had Fibromyalgia for a long, very long time. I was diagnosed in the year of 1995, I also found out that due to the fibromyalgia that I have weak bones, and taking medicines increased my already there asthma. What worked for me was the amitriptyline 25mg 1 a day also a great medicine called Tolmetin Sodium 600mg, 3 x's a day. I've been taking these two medicines and have been able to work 40 hours a week with no side effects. I walk over 4 miles, hardly any pain and do strength training without having to take more medications. If you are having lots of pain due to fibromyalgia you might want to talk to your doctor and find out if you can take these two medicines together. All in all I was hugged and it didn't hurt for the first time in eight years.",
                    "After vomiting for 3-4 days solid, every 4/5 weeks for 6/7 months (starting at age 45), went to see consultant Doctor. Underwent brain scan etc. to rule out any other causes to the vomiting, diagnosed as cyclic vomiting syndrome and started 10mg amitriptyline a day. Cured! No vomiting for 3 months now, brilliant!",

                    "I was very recently prescribed amitriptyline at 10 mg for fibromyalgia. , which was also just recently diagnosed after complaints since the age of at least 18 ( now 38). It doesn't help me sleep, even with my low dose of Xanax that was prescribed a year ago, for sleep. Combining the two has given me a more restless sleep, BUT...... It has helped with my pain tremendously!!! Within days, I noticed I could work longer hours ( self employed, thank god), and when I do get sore, it's not as extreme as pre- amitriptyline. I've lost weight in these two weeks, as before I only ate once a day, and I think my body was holding on to any fat it could, now I graze throughout the day and think my metabolism has been kick started again.",
                    "You are extremely tired in the beginning but it goes away and you are back to your normal routine. I take 20mg at night and am and headache and migraine free. Its great.",
                    "I've tried about every medication out there for my anxiety and depression; welbutrin Zoloft Paxil , Cymbalta, Emsam, Xanax , etc.. At 75mg Elavil helped me sleep, I had more energy, I didn't feel restless, and I rarely got upset. I thought I had found the perfect cure until I started to gain weight. I decreased my calorie intake increased my exercise and the weight just kept coming. In 4 months I had gained 26 pounds. I also started to such severe dry mouth my throat was dry and my voice was hoarse, I also started to have blurred vision. I really like this medicine but know if I can handle the side effects.",
                    "I have been on quite a few different sleep meds because of my head injury. I now have \"Alpha Wave Intrusion\", so my brain won't shut down. Been this way for 16 years now. Elival is the only Med that is able to get me to sleep and let me fall me back to sleep if I wake up. I'm on 200mg and right now it seems to be okak. In a few months I'll probably have to adjust, but that's okak, I can deal with that. This is definitely an excellent choice for me.",
                    "I suffer from post concussion headaches, no other medicine helped. Seemed to make everything worse, sensitive to light headaches, pain in eye and neck. One little pill and its gone slept like a baby ....highly recommend.",
                    "I just started this medication for my fibromyalgia about 3 days ago. I'm already sleeping better, getting relief from my chronic migraines AND it has helped my irritable bowel syndrome. I know it's still too soon to tell but I really didn't expect results this soon. Hopefully things stay on the up and up. I have suffered from fibro for over 16 years now and have tried numerous meds.",
                    "I can't believe that after 3 years of severe widespread neuropathic pain of unknown origin, I am sleeping 8-10 hours and have had total pain reduction from about a 8 at worst to now a 1.5 I've only been on 10 mg at night for 3 days. I hope it's not coincidence or placebo affect. A bit drowsy and a dizzy spell today. But completely worth it. I'm falling asleep faster now. My mood seems to be more calm as well. I hope to get off of oxycodone now.",
                    "After 20 years of migraine suffering I went private and was prescribed Amitriptyline 10mg. I took these for 5 months and barely had a headache never mind migraine. I got dry mouth and my sleeping improved also. However after 5 months the migraines have started to come back so I increased the dosage to 20-25mg, again the first few weeks I noticed the dry mouth and disturbed sleeping but this has not settled down again and migraine free. It's the best medicine I've ever had and had also helped with my neck and arm pain. I couldn't recommend it enough, a lifesaver.",

I suffered from migraines from childhood and first my doctor tried a blood pressure medicine that also treats migraines. While somewhat effective, I still had headaches and migraines after 1-2 months, up to 3-5 per week. Once he put me on Amitriptyline, all headaches are gone and I have had no recurrences of either regular headache or migraine. I no longer need pain medication and I feel like I have my life back. This medicine has been wonderful!",

Best of all, Elavil has the added bonus of curbing my neuropathy which had forced me to be on fentanyl for over 4 years. Been about eight years now and it is still doing a great job. I have been on just about every drug they have for panic and other than Prozac this is one of the only drugs that has worked or worked without nasty side effects. paxil worked but TOTALLY wiped out my sex drive and ability to perform. Zoloft did nothing at all good or bad. Alcohol was good at knocking down the panic attacks but the bad there was the attacks became more frequent. Imipramine only masked the symptoms causing some nasty muscle tension that lead to migraines.",

When I started on Elavil 10mg seemed to do not do much but when my dose was increased to 30 mg I tend to have less frequent (2-3) migranes a week. My migraines are less intense and I'm able to do my studies. The dry mouth is much less when I chew gum but I tend to be tired all the time. This medication has worked the best for me, although not perfect.",

My doctor has now started me on 10mg 3 times daily and has so far been life changing I have only had one migraine attack out of each week. Hoping this keeps up.",

He said it was mandatory for him to report any symptom not listed in his book to the proper health authorities to update the handbook. However, he didn't report the side effects that I told him about because it was \"too much paperwork.\" Instead, he tried to convince me that it had nothing to do with Elavil and in a threatening demeanour tried to change my mind about my symptoms so that he would not be forced to do any paperwork. After reading this site on Elavil, I see the symptoms that I told my doctor about. I find that my doctor acted in an unsafe, unprofessional, and negligent manner.",

She first tried stretching my bladder to see if this helped. It didn't. She then suggested Endep, not for depression but it had been used for cystitis and burning mouth, which I also suffer from. It has helped my burning bladder problem 100% as long as I don't forget to take my tablets. If I forget just one, I have the pain back for about two weeks before I get back on track.

Side effects for me include grogginess, but that's wearing away the more I take it and, for sure, a huge spike in my apetite, which I've had to be careful about as I don't want to gain weight on it.

My migraine was 50% pain and 50% mood change (which was terrible or even worse than the pain). This has been deeply affecting my quality of life, my relations (mood changes) and also at work. The last neurologist I visited put me on Amitriptyline 25mg. The medicine helped a bit reducing the frequency of the migraines. However migraines came back and the last attack lasted for 3 weeks. He changed the dose to 50 mg. I am now 71 days without migraine and still counting. I am a new person and I wish my comment may help others.",

This regimen has made that one side effect tolerable and I don't mind it, considering what this medicine has done for me.

I have a couple of pills at about 8 or so and its been great. I fall asleep at the right times - start yawning around 11pm, jump into bed and get to sleep.

I tried Topamax and experienced horrible mood swings, anger and hyperactivity. Went on Amitriptyline and gradually moved up to 50mg as it wasn't fully effective at lower doses. Once I reached 50mg my migraines went down to twice a month. Even better, the Axert works much more effectively when I do have a migraine. I had dry mouth early on but this went away. The only other side effect is occasional dizziness when I stand up (but this only happens about once a week and clears after a few seconds), which is common on this medicine. It has totally changed my life.",

From moment I took it my hands stopped shaking and intrusive thoughts reduced. I was upped to 50mg and I am back to my old self. Hardly any worries at all, no shaking, feel happy. No dry mouth but I have put probably a stone of weight on and gone up 1-2 dress sizes. This side effect is worth it for the benefits it has given me.",

I took the meds for about 2 weeks but could not handle the side effects of confusion and listlessness. I quit taking it for a long time and suffered with the frequent urination. I was at my wits end (no sleep!) and found the old pill bottle of amitriptyline in my drawer. I am no longer working so I decided that I would give it another try since I didn't have a schedule to keep.

Everyone around me noticed a difference and I felt trapped but was expressing externally. I had a psychotic break on this medication however I was not suocidal.

                    "Been on Elavil 20 mg for 6 months for migraine prevention, at first felt really loopy and actually stopped taking them after first dose, did not like feeling like that. But my doc urged me to try them and my migraines are down from 6-8 a month to 1-2 a month, so far so good.",
                    "I was prescribed Amitriptyline for Odie Sphincter dysfunction, which is a spasm in the Gallbladder sphincter. The wonderful side affect is my migraines were cured by this as well. NOTE: The smallest dosage of generic amitriptyline is 10 mg. I have gotten the dose down to about 1.5 mg by breaking each 10 mg into 8ths. This has eliminated the constipation I was experiencing at the higher dose, and costs me about $10/year for prescription.",
                    "I suffered with anxiety for years and have tried many many SSRIs as well as benzos. Nothing really helped. I was put on this med for migraines and within a couple of weeks my anxiety began to melt away. My friends and family noticed a huge difference. I feel like a different person. Like I am living the life I always wanted to live, I was just always too afraid and anxious to before.",
                    "Took it for burning nerve pain - reached 50 mg (after 5 weeks). Did absolutely nothing - at the end even did not help with sleep.",
                    "Been on amitriptyline for 2 weeks for nerve pain after shingles. It has reduced discomfort from an 8 to a 3 most days. I take 10 mg at night and other than some grogginess the first 3-4 days, no side effects. I sleep well on it too.",
                    "I was diagnosed with Interstitial Cystitis, had severe baldder pain and pressure for a couple of months. I used OTC meds and even low dose hydromorphone, but it did not help. My doctor prescribed amitriptyline 25mg, however told me to cut it in half and initially use 12.5mg to see if it helps, if not, increase to 25. I took the half pill in the evening, and in the morning I woke up with no bladder pain, first time in months. During the day I still had some bladder pressure, but no pain. After 2 weeks on the amitriptyline my pain and pressure are all gone. Have not noticed any side effects, perhaps An occasional constipation, so I started taking fiber.",
                    "I have really, really bad insomnia. I'm up for 3 -4 days straight and after my doctor prescribed me a combination of zopiclone and amitriptyline I'm able to sleep 4-5 hours but your body can become tolerant after a while meaning you may have to increase your dosage. I've had to do this but what I've started to do is try to keep really busy throughout the day and IF needed at night I'll take a smaller dose than prescribed to me or try to go a few days without it then take my regular dose. ",
                    "Since being on amitriptyline my IBS symptoms are pretty much not there. I used to be in horrific pain all day everyday and would even feel hot, dizzy and in so much pain that I would actually faint off the toilet. I didn't want to leave the house and IBS literally took over my life. I never write any reviews like this but if I can help even just one IBS sufferer then it's worth it. I gradually increased my dose to 50mg per night. Seems like a lot but it's worth it in order to live a normal 21 year old girls life. For the first week I did get the side effects (tired, dry mouth, a bit faint) but after that I felt absolutely fine again. Please try this drug, I didn't think it would work but it did and I have honestly never been happier!",
                    "I'm bipolar. I've been on various medicines for almost 10 years. Well, my Dad died a few months ago. The depression and anxiety was so bad I could not function. My Doctor prescribed this along with my 40mg of Celexa. It took about a month -6 weeks before I felt any better. But I also have chronic pain from spinal arthritis. This medication has helped me get my life back! But in the process, I've gained 20lbs in 8 weeks and I was already overweight. Its helped with my chronic pain and with the depression. I love how I feel on this but not the weight gain. ",
                    "I have suffered from migraines most of my life and tried many preventive meds that did not work.I had to get a new doctor and he started me on Elavil 50 mg at bedtime.Not only did it cut down on the frequency and severity of the headaches now I sleep like a baby and that has cut now 100% on morning migraines.It is a God send.",
                    "After one year of MRI, CT scan, ultrasound exams for unexplained sharp chest pain (neuropathic, possible neuroma) I was prescribed 10 mg amytriptiline to be taken at night. After 2 months this has brought me back to normal having failed wth all other medications including tramadol. No symptoms at all now though it was necessary to persevere as it took about a month to kick in. Worth trying if you have drawn a blank with everything else...",
                    "Last night was my first dose. Half of a amitriptyline 25mg tablet. I took it at quarter to midnight, but did not finally fall asleep until around 5AM. I slept for almost twelve hours. I guess I need to take it earlier if it doesn't knock me out like I expected. The light hurts my eyes today. I can't look out my window. Artificial light isn't as bad, but still hurts. Despite these problems, I feel more clear than I have in months. Maybe even years. Any pain that I have is very slight, so I'm thinking that's why my doctor wanted me to take ibuprofen with this - because it will actually be able to help with my pain now. This is only after my first dose, but I am pretty excited. I can move around the house again like a normal person!",
                    "Have been taking 10mg for 4 & half weeks. Third week in felt fine with less pain. Now severe stomach cramps & back pain has returned. Unsure if I should continue with them.",
                    "Since my diagnosis of acute bipolar disorder I've been getting severe migraines almost constantly, or if there was a short respite, it lasted only hours. I was put on a self-titrating dose of amitripyline by my GP and at around 50-60mg daily I was getting no migraines. However, I found that several weeks after finding my 'correct' dose, I was finding myself in constant anhedonia and ennui. I'm now off the amitriptyline, and my migraines have returned, but my mood is back to normal.",
                    "Took 10 mg for the first time last night for insomnia. To my great surprise, today it seemed to help with both muscle achyness & with anxiety. I slept all day (& needed it), but I suspect that won't be a big issue once I take this med more regularly (which was the case when I was on mirtazapine/Remeron).",
                    "I was prescribed this at a low dose for various sleep problems associated with CFS/ME. Helps tremendously with remaining asleep (used to wake up 4-8 times a night) but basically completely useless aiding someone who has trouble getting to sleep - one of my main problems. Horrific and vivid nightmares frequently occurring since I've been taking it & v. dry mouth. Staying on it as GP very reluctant to give me anything stronger for my sleep unfortunately",
                    "I have tried Cymbalta, tramadol, gabapentin, Lyrica, and other but this medicine took all my pain away. This pill only took my pain away for 8 months then it wasn't as effective. Also made me gain a lot of weight. I still take it because it removes my pain after taking it last a few hours. Also the medication helps me sleep. It will knock you out.",
                    "This really has changed my life! I suffered a whole year thinking my urethral stricture was the cause, after that was sorted I still carried on with what felt like constant cystitis. My urologist finally diagnosed Interstitial Cystitis and started me on 20mg of amitriptyline. After 10-14days it worked! Have the very odd day of mild discomfort but it's changed my life. I haven't noticed side effects as yet, on my 9th week on them.",
                    "I started this medication a few weeks ago and it's already working. I don't wake up as much in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and I sleep a lot better. I haven't felt this good in awhile. I can even eat/drink things I normally wouldn't be able to (in moderation of course).",
                    "I have been very against any kind of mental health medication, and was very reluctant to try amitryptaline, but my anxiety and insomnia were eroding my quality of life. This has literally been a wonder drug for me, and on such a low dosage. 20mg at night and 10mg each morning. My anxiety is greatly reduced, and intrusive nagging thoughts have vanished. I don't know if this is because I am now sleeping well for the first time ever, or because of the mild sedating effects. But whatever, it certainly works, and I was so sure it wouldn't. Only side effect is a dry mouth, but that's easily remedied with a sip of water. A very positive experience. It really has changed my life for the better.",
                    "I've suffered from cluster tension headaches and migraines for years. My doctor prescribed me different kinds of things to deal with the pain, tramadol, codeine, diazepam and shots of voltaren, diclofenac and various other muscle relaxants.He then referred me to a psychiatrist to see if there was another cause for my headaches, as I suffer from serious anxiety problems. The psych. thought it would be a good idea to run me through a gauntlet of antidepressants (sertraline, and venlafaxine to name a couple) none of which helped. He then tried me on Amitriptyline, which didn't really help me, but did make me gain weight, and feel extremely nauseous. Mirtazipine has helped me a lot better used with Temazepam at night and Clonazepam in the day",
                    "Been taking it for 6 years initially for depression then anxiety and stress and it's one of the worst things to happen to me. Constant eczema where my skins gets very itchy and sore that I have scars all over, constipation is probably the worst as I've had periods of vomiting to stomach being sore and bloated, blurred vision, it's addictive contrary to what doctors say as I have been trying to get off it for 2 years slowly and been admitted to hospital twice in that time for substance abuse relating to endep. Doctors can't understand why I have been on it for so long. Take mine at night as you get drowsy of a day on higher than 50mg (most I taken was 75mg) now on 10mg and still get constipation.",
                    "My brother (22) and I (25) both take this for migraines or as my doctor calls ours, tension headaches. It is the greatest medication ever. I was suffering through headaches on a daily basis, and this has put a complete stop to them. It also helps me fall asleep quickly at night and wake rested. LOVE it!",

                    "I had been on this medication in the past and discontinued usage after I got pregnant. I started back a few months ago, not realizing what the side effects were. I started gaining weight incredibly fast with no change to my diet and exercise and wasn't going to the bathroom unless I used a laxative. I was stumped and depressed about it up until yesterday when I spoke with a GI doctor. FINALLY I had an answer only after many visits to my family doctor and many co-payments which added up quickly (with no solution). Needless to say, I am so relieved to finally know what is going on with me... 20 lbs later but I see the light at the end of tunnel. Hope this helps.",
                    "Only been on it a week, but a miracle so far! I've suffered from IC for years had all the tests etc, a urologist recommended this to me 5 yrs. ago... I refused on the basis that it was an anti depressant, modified my diet and went into remission with only the odd flare. 6 months ago, I had another baby and a second C Section, this resulted in a 5 month long 'twinge period' with 4 excruciating flare ups. I was in the midst of a agonising flare up when I gave in and took 10mg of Amitriptyline! Next day still had twinges but no pain. The 2nd no twinges, no pain, just some urgency. 3rd feeling totally normal!! It's brilliant!! Still feeling normal after a whole week!! No side effects as yet, but not helping me sleep like I thought it would!",
                    "I have been diagnosed with migraines since I was 9. I am 33 today. My migraines are acute and chronic. As I got older, they increased in frequency and severity. At a certaine point I was hospitalized weekly. I could no longer function as a normal person. School, excerise, relationships, friendships were impossible. It made me even more depressed that noone understood my pain and some thought I was faking it. I was finally pronounced \"disabled\" afew years ago which made getting a job nearly impossible. I wanted to end my life because of this many times. The 6 months ago, an ER doctor suggested Tryptizol. To me, it is a miracle drug. I only have migraines once a month with my period. I am proof that hope exists. I wish I used it sooner.",
                    "I used this medication in '94/'95 and in '97/'98 to treat major depressive episodes. It was the first antidepressant I ever tried, and it worked wonders the first time I used it. I could sleep and eat again, depression was gone within 2-3 weeks, no side effects. I was given amitriptyline again in '97/'98 after months of trying several newer anti-depressants which doctors were convinced would be better, even though I told them amitriptyline had worked for me previously. It worked very well then too, but I developed side effects (irregular heart rhythm.) I chose to take beta blockers along with amitriptyline so I could complete the course of treatment.",

I was having daily panic attacks and slowly, they were reduced. I gained 20 pounds in a few months and decided to stop taking it a month ago, feeling fine. This week the anixety has started coming back-dizziness, short of breath, panicky, etc. so I started back on 25mg. Other than the weight gain the other side effect was dry mouth so the trade of of being able tot live a normal life was worth it.",

After about 4 years I had to increase the dossage to 20mg as I was beginning to notice I was experiencing pain again but the increased dosage has rendered me almost pain free again. I could not cope now without it although I do worry about being so reliant on drugs for pain relief the side affects are negligible as I take dose before bedtime so do not experience undue fatigue.",

Seventeen months ago my GP gave me a prescription for 100mg to take at bedtime. The first night I slept 14 hours and woke up high as a kite. The following two nights I took a half and the next night a quarter with the same results and decided this medicine was not for me and returned to suffering. Three months ago in desperation I took another 100mg pill and had the same experience for three days on just the one dose.

I do have a few of the more common side effects ... vivid dreams, occasional dry mouth, and once in while I feel lightheaded if I stand up too quickly.

After a battery of testing it was determined that I had SIBO and IBS-C. After treatment with the antibiotics, my bloat was better but not gone. Tried linzess for the constipation but I hated it. Then doctor prescribed Amitiza for constipation and Amitriptine 25mg at night for bloat and pain. It has SAVED me. The pain is gone and the bloat is almost gone! Plus, the side effects work to my advantage. Don't get up to pee 4 times a night anymore and I have never slept better! Dry mouth is pretty bad but I will take that over the pain, any day.",

I had dry mouth so bad could hardly talk, could not remember my words I wanted to say, and lost all sex drive. I slowly removed myself off of the Elavil with the help of my doctor.

I couldn't keep a job until I went back to an employer I had prior to getting sick again that knew my worth and was willing to work with me and keep me employed thankfully.

I don't get sleepiness during the day, but I do get 9 1/2 hrs to sleep (I'm a teenager and I need that much sleep). It also helped me with social anxiety which I've dealt with all my life.

                    "Doctors could not figure out why I had pain and sleepless nights. I finally told the docs lets pretend its fibromyalgia and treat it. Doctor prescribed amitriptyline and I am 90% better. I still have occasional difficult nights but my life is much better.",

I have multiple herniated and torn discs from an accident and could not sleep. I have tried many other sleeping aid (Ambien ETC.) and none of them are even close. This medicine is amazing. I sleep through the night now(6 -9 hrs) amazing. Once in awhile a little groggy in the morning for about 20 minutes but that's it. Unbelievable. In a league of it own for sleep.",
                    "I have been on about everything you can imagine for my stress and anxiety. Nothing worked and for years I have been miserable. I was put on Elavil and didn't feel much of an effect but once the doctor bumped me up to 100mgs a day, I am a new person. It has changed my life. I wake up and feel like dancing!",

I had tried sleep clinic, hypnotherapy , meditation and other drugs - but nothing was effective. Now on 25mg initially on 125mg. The only negative is the weight gain. Initially put on 11 kg, lost 3kg but struggle to lose anymore. The sleep is worth the weight!",

A GP started me on Amitriptyline 25 mg every night for migraine prevention but she doesn't know that I also have depression (diagnosed by a psychiatrist). Now I'm able to sleep well, and only have migraines one or two times a month. Depression is more manageable now since I get enough sleep. Killing two birds with one stone, ha.",

I found it helpful, it decreased all my symptoms, but increases were needed as the effectiveness wore off in time. My physician informed me that he would not increase the dosage past 30 mg as anything over 30mg was only effective in treating the antidepressant symptoms, not nerve related symptoms. He added Gabapentin 1 month ago, but I felt no change. He would now like me to stop both of these meds, and try Lyrica. I would like to add that I too have gained 50 lbs, and crave sweets always.",

I had horrible dizziness, was lightheaded whenever I stood up, had the weirdest dreams (to the point where I did not want to go to sleep and face whatever dream/nightmare that was waiting for me) and on the last night I took them I had such terrible stomach pain that it woke me up and my mother almost took me to the ER because I nearly blacked out from the pain when I got up to go to the washroom. The meds also didn't actually help with my migraine situation. Based off of my reactions to other medications, I would say that I'm particularly prone to side effects so they may/may not happen to you.",
                    "I had migraines for 11+ years. It took probably 7 years to finally find sumatriptan for abortion of acute attack which would happen 2-6 times a week. I would react to weather, stress, lack of sleep, 3-d movies... u name it. Once I started PA school due to stress migraines became almost daily thing and it would debilitate my life and studying to the point I couldn't not stand anymore. Since I have insomnia for many years Amitryptiline sounded superior to other options and I started taking 10 mg before going to sleep. It's my week 3 with all possible triggers and absolutely zero migraines! I am so happy I cant even believe it worked so well. I only had one small headache ( which used to be often too). And I definitely fall asleep better !",

The aura was so bad I couldn't function, dizziness/vertigo, facial numbness, vomiting, light sensitivity and forgetfulness/memory fog. Although I'm not back to \"normal\" I am able to function. I still experience dizziness from time to time and my memory isn't what it used to be but overall about 85% improvement. I have experienced some weight gain from craving sweets and other junk. Also the first month I was very tired but that stopped. I'm afraid to try something else because I fear the symptoms returning.",
                    "This has worked very well for me.I Still have bouts now and then, but nothing like before the medication. I take 25 mg per day. If I am having cramps and/or frequent loose stools, I'll take an additional 12.5 mg (split a 25mg tab) during the day. I take the 25 at night, which also aids in sleep. Only negative side affect is some mild to moderate urine retention. This is in part due to also having BPH. But the goods outweigh the negatives.",

Started out with a bang and he would spend one week per month in the hospital for over a year and a half. We did finally resort to both a G and J Tube. One for nutrition and one to bypass the stomach during episodes to give medicines, fluids and nutrition. However, we use the Elavil every night and use Ativan as well as Zofran during an active cycle or right when we see one coming on to abort as well as loads of fluids. We have tried to experiment and \"see\" what happens without the Elavil and it was bad. Within a week of not having it, right on the money comes an active Episode. My son is now 13, we still have the Tubes in place and use all the medicines listed.",

After taking the second pill I got severe anxiety attack which led me down on the road of developing GAD and panic disorder. I did not know what was happening to me why I felt so hyper and kind of sick, had heart palpitations, like I had a ton of coffee. The morning I still felt severe anxiety, called the doctor, made appointments to figure it out what is wrong with me. I started loosing weight because I lost my appetite and I guess all the worry created more worries and eventually panic attacks. It may work for others but be very careful when trying it the first time.",

I ended up with peripheral neuropathy last year and was sent to a neurologist, he put me on amitriptyline for the burning and he also said it will help with insomnia and my depression. I absolutely am happy with this drug!!! Better then Prozac, I still have feelings.(lol). Anyhow if you r debating on this medication, I recommend it 100 percent. I take 100mg a couple hours before bed, unless I get upset during the day,(then ill take 25mg just to take the edge off.) Then I'll just take 75 mgs before bed,",

I came to this website to read the comments to see if I dared believe that I could be feeling like I was finally given a miracle that might cure my diagnosed \"transformed migraine\" condition!

I have a dry mouth constantly and am drowsy. I had a back tooth filled, becuz I had a cavity. It hurt last night a little but my jaw and ear was worse.

Amitripyline are so sedating for me which I like , it's better than any benzodiazepines like temazepam . The trick is take your dose for bedtime about 2 hours before you want to sleep . For me I take mine around 8pm -9pm and I'm gone by 11pm some nights it takes only an hour other nights 3 hours but they're great for sleep . I was once taken off them in hospital and nothing compared. Word of advise - do not drink alcohol unless it's hours and hours before you take your dose.

A three day migraine would loose 9 pounds for me. I had been to countless doctors and a neurologist with no triggers found. No one ever tried a preventive medication for me. Finally, four years ago, my VA doctor suggested Amitriptyline. It's been a lifesaver. He suggested building up to 30 mg per day at bedtime. I developed dry mouth, eyes and throat as well as nosebleeds. I reduced to 10 mgs with good results as far as the headache and migraine relief, but still the side effects. Cut the pills in half with good results. So, now I'm taking 5 mg per day, with virtually no side effects and NO headaches at all.",

I've noticed a significant drop in pain on many days than not. I sleep a solid eight to nine hours a night. I've noticed that I'm calmer, but I'm on a very low dose of 10mg, but will requesting an increase. I also hope to drop my narcotic pain medication intake to ZERO, if this continues to work as well as it has.

It is used to help ease the other symptoms it can cause. If you are taking it in hopes that your daily aches and pains are going to go away then I suggest you see a different doctor and try something else. I take Savella also and that has helped me a great deal. But I am using amitriptyline because I suffer from tension headaches and migraines. Out of the month, I can go every day with a headache. I have not been on it long enough to give you a full review but since I have been on it I can say that I am sleeping much better and my headaches are getting better. I have been on it for a little more than a week.",

I felt like my head would explode, and I had none of the other side effects attributed to migraines. My doctor instead now calls it \"severe head pain\". I had it every other day for about a month. I actually called \"911\" at one point because I thought I was dying the pain was so horrible. When I was first given elavil I was skeptical since it was touted as an \"anit-depressant\". I took it, and the first three days I actually had to take naps because it made me so sleepy. On the fourth day I realized that although I still felt a little sleepy, I was now officially four days head pain free. It has been a Godsend.",

I work in a fairly high stress professional office environment. It has affected my work and mood negatively. I have absolutely tried everything before I recently tried amitriptyline from acupuncture, diet, meditation, homeopath, blood pressure pills, massage therapy and 3 neurologists. (Imitrex works but I was to reliant on it). I was very groggy the next day for 1 week on 25 ml of amitriptyline at night around dinner time.

I was taking Zomig daily for a week each took 45-2hr and a good nap to cure the pain. Heard Zomig is not for daily use so I went to doctor. Doctor prescribe me with 10mg for night time. 1st day was amazing. Migraine free. 2nd day was migraine free. However today morning I had one but less severe.  Overall - so far so good. Other than I'm 1/2 asleep throughout the day and wake up in the morning with extreme dry mouth. I hope this medication will work for me.",

The deep tissue pain went away. It has never had any affect on my sleep patterns. For the first 10 years I was able to keep it to one 10 mg pill per day. The last five, I've had to double it to 20mg (headaches). Way back, about 3 years into this I was having trouble sleeping - quite a few nights I couldn't sleep at all, so I thought if I could take 1/2 a lorazepam it would help. Not wanting to combine the medications, I didn't take the amitriptyline for 3 nights. On the following day I was on the floor in agony. I've NEVER missed another dose.",

Gastro doc put me on Amitriptyline started with 5mg and worked up to 25mg over 2 months. It really works. I forgot to take it for a couple of days and all the symptoms came back. It also helps with my neck and shoulder pain and neuropathy from pinched nerves in my neck. Another bonus is this medication is very inexpensive.",

However, the one thing it did help with was my MAV (migraine associated vertigo)! Immediately after taking it, I was no longer dizzy! Every day I took this, I wasn't dizzy and could actually function normally. I would have stayed on it for this reason but the depression was too much. My sleep specialist also almost prescribed this for my insomnia but I was already on other antidepressants at the time. I'm no longer on any of those (It was PMDD the entire time) but still this wouldn't have helped anyway (like every other sleep medicine I've tried).",

It worked very well. After about 10 years, I decided to wean myself off of it and see if I could live without the medication and just watch my diet. I was good for about a month. The awful pain and urgency came back with a vengence. I was in tears. As soon as I went back on the elavil, within 1 day I was feeling almost completely normal again.

A cure for panic attacks for which I used to have 6 approx a month is : Stop drinking Coffee or Tea unless you change it to Decaffinated only and the other cure that helps is : 4 or more cups of Camomile Tea every day ,no sugar and no milk in it. I normally leave the t-bag in the cup until I have drunk it. All these things have worked for me and I have not had any Panic attacks for approx 3 years.

Amitryptiline 10mg at night was offered to me to help with sleep and pain. It's great, I sleep through no more toilet trips or lying awake all night. I have an interest in life again I had become quite house bound but I'm up and about even walked round town which I haven't done in years. It's only a small dose and it's worked brilliantly.",
                    "I started taking 10mg of amitriptyline in December of 2015 when I was diagnosed with interstitial cystitis. It takes away the constant sharp burning pain I was having along with the constant urge to urinate. Once in a while I will have a flare up of symptoms but even then my pain is very minimal. The only side effects I've noticed are that it makes me drowsy in the first few hours of taking my dose. The first month or two of taking I would experience extremely vivid nightmares, but those have subsided to simply being vivid dreams some of the time. I've also noticed that if I forget to take it one night I have difficulty falling asleep, and some anxiety similar to the feeling of drinking a little too much coffee, which is tolerable.",
                    "I have not taken this drug yet, but I will be doing in 4 hours and I'm excited but nervous. I have had shooting/pricking pains in the left side of my head for around 3 months now, and I have always put it to one side thinking that it's just normal or it's a headache / stress / pressure / apart of growing up ( I'm 22 ) and I've not looked into it. I decided to ring 111, they directed me to a walk in centre then to the GP and I've now been prescribed with Amitriptyline. After reading through all of the comments, I have been given 10mg tablets and I will be taking it whole. There are solutions for the side effects so dosage is ok. I am scared a tiny bit that I have a bloods test, if no result, I will be getting a head scan :( fingers crossed",
                    "Upped dose from 5mg to 10mg and again was scared. Still no signs of pain relief but it has only been about 6 days since starting. As for side effects - a bit of a dry mouth and slight grogginess for an hour. Nothing that I can't deal with. The dry mouth only lasts for ten minutes.  Not sure what If I will have to increase dose but so far so good.",
                    "I was given this medication to replace Toprimate. I took a pill Friday night and Saturday night (10mg). Given I was feeling well prior to taking this, I soon discovered/realized that it made me more emotional and it felt like I wanted to cry at any small thing. Combined with the feeling that it revved me up even at 3am in the morning, I have since stopped.",
                    "Worst experience I've ever had on meds. The first 3 days of taking it I was a complete zombie. No exaggeration, I did not talk for an entire weekend. It basically just turned my brain off. I had no interest in saying or doing anything. Once that wore off, the worse side effects trickled in. I started feeling weak and tingling everywhere. This got worse to the point where my husband and I had to walk out of a restaurant because of the symptoms. the tingling got so bad that I thought I was either having a stroke or entering Paralysis. Stopped the meds and all symptoms went away almost instantly. It did help my migraines but frankly I'm used to dealing/managing/living with those so I'd rather have them than than these awful side effects!",
                    "I wish I had know about amitriptyline 25 years ago.  After 20 years of taking Midrin, then Maxalt, then Imitrex, I finally found a preventative that has reduced my migraines by 95%. I took propranolol for two years, but it didn't reduce the frequency or severity of my migraines at all.  I strongly recommend that every migraine sufferer try this preventative. After much reading, I discovered that I have a serotonin deficiency. Amitriptyline works to keep serotonin levels elevated which is the root cause of migraines for many folks. If you have tried this medicine before, try it again and try a different dosage.  Amitriptyline at 25 mg only reduced my migraines by 10%.  50 mg per day has reduced them by 95%.",
                    "I had epilepsy surgery last year and I have suffered with headaches ever since. After over a year of trying different remedies my doctor prescribed Elavil. I was so tired of having headaches everyday that I was willing to try anything. I take one 25mg tablet at bedtime and my headaches have gone away. It's like I never had them. Elavil has been a blessing to me.",

                    "Unfortunately this medication had a very negative effect on me. I was supposed to take it for occasional nerve zaps that I get from having IC. When I took it, it didn't take the pain away. Instead it changed it into a CONSTANT burning pain which is way worse than the previous zaps. I stopped taking it, and although I was on a low dose 25mg a night, I got horrible withdrawal symptoms and am still dealing with panic attacks upon waking up. I know this drug has been a godsend for some people, but please be careful because it has the potential to make things way worse.",
                    "Took this for leg pain that was from unknown cause, possibly pinched nerve or peripheral neuropathy. It seemed to help some with pain, maybe 30% reduction at 25mg dose. But I was sleeping 20 hours a day, real groggy when awake, and having severe stomach pains and constipation. I stopped after 2 weeks of this. I thought it was just side effects but my doctor diagnosed it as an allergic reaction.",

                    "I went to see my Dr about restless legs at night which is quite painful. She prescribed 25mg at night before bed. It's was working well..no pain. However I fell over a couple of times which I thought was odd but didn't set any alarms off. I began to feel stiff and unable to bend over to pick things up. I was afraid I would hurt myself. Not realizing this was the drug. I figured this is what happens when you are close to 50. The worst side effect was the weight gain. I was on the drug for 3.5 months and gained 30 lbs. Once again I figured it was because I was getting older. So the drug certainly helped my leg pain...but altered my body to look like the pilsner dough girl.",
                    "I had my first episode of Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome about 3.5 years ago. It was sometime until the doctors and I figured out what it actually was. Nonstop throwing up for 2-6 days about once a month. What made them severe I guess was the amount of vomiting. A few times I had double I.V's because they could not rehydrate me as fast as the vomiting was dehydrating me. If you have CVS and are reading this I just want to say I am truly sorry. It was a miserable and emotional ride for me and the people that care about me. I can truly say I feel your pain and I pray that you find peace. I fought the doctors about taking this but when I finally gave in, IT WORKED. Not one episode since then (about 1 year and 6 months). I was skeptical at first BUT IT WORKED! 25MG.",
                    "I have been on Elavil for depression for 20 years. I did have some problem with not remembering that I had told someone something already. This has gotten better as I made a conscious effort to remember things. I still have some problems with memory in forgetting where I put things. The best thing that happened is I have not had a headache in 20 years. I used to have bad headaches 2-3 times a week so this has been well worth putting up with side-effects.",
                    "I was on 75mg of Endep & noticed 2 extreme side effects which lead to me having to stop taking the medication. The first was rapid & excessive weight gain; I gained 6 kgs (13 pounds) within 8 weeks (at 160cm, this is quite a bit of weight). I had no change in my diet, my exercise stayed the same, so the Endep was the only thing that could have caused the weight gain. The second was extreme Night Terrors. These occurred every night & were extremely frightening for myself & family, as I would wake up screaming & kicking every night. This occurred almost immediately after starting the Endep. Since stopping the Endep 2 weeks ago, the Night Terrors have ceased completely, & I have lost 1kg with no change in diet.",

                    "Be careful if you have IBS-C as this can make it worse, particularly at high doses, try and take it at a low dose if you do for anxiety which is good for numbing in IBS in general. However seeing as IBS-C is basically an issue with bowels not moving fast enough you can imagine how adding a sedative essentially isn't really the best thing to add lol made mine so much worse after a year, anyways what works for some doesn't always work for others, good luck whatever you do :-)",
                    "I have taken this medication for six years and it has really helped with my migraines and my inability to sleep or stay asleep. I started off at 10mg and slowly increased to 50mg and have been on the same dosage for the past four. The only downside is my absolute need to take it at the same time every night in order for it to make me sleepy otherwise I can stay up the entire night if I take it later than 9pm.",

I almost think I'd rather have headaches than gain this weight.",
                    "Amitriptyline made a huge difference to my daily life in terms of pain relief from Vulvodynia, but it has many side effects. I stuck to a low level 25mg and had to wiegh up benefits vs side-effects. Changed to Nortriptyline and had the same benefits but less side-effects. Now take 30mg of Nortriptyline.",
                    "For many years I was very resistant to taking medications for my anxiety because I watched my mother who is bipolar try many types of medications without success. My anxiety was constant: racing thoughts, hypochondria, worry about my kids, etc. The stress was actually causing me physical pain. I was even tense in my sleep and woke up every morning feeling like I had been in a fight. Elavil was life changing. I started out at 10mg and was bumped up to 25mg after a couple of weeks. The only side effects that I experience are drowsiness (you take it at night, so no big deal) and sometimes weird dreams. I am so at ease these days. I no longer have any stress-related pain. My quality of life has been vastly improved.",
                    "I have been on 10 mg. Amitriptyline... for a month and am really getting  a good night sleep. I must say the first weeks, I was really tired and and exhausted . After 3 weeks my body adjusted quite well. I have a low tolerance to medication so 10 mg. Is good for now.",

                    "I've been taking this for 27 years, 50 mg a night and except for a few flare-ups, I've been virtually pain free. I find that it really depends what manufacturer the druggest purchases it from. Strange but true. I highly recommend this medicine.",

Rarely feel pain (unless I go the tomato or citrus route), sleep all through the night, and I'm generally in a better mood. Gaining a little weight but definitely worth it.",
                    "I had headaches for a year. At six months I switched my allergy meds, relief cut the headache intensity by half. The rest of the cause was minor concussion as a result of an auto accident and overdoing( occasionally overdosing) of OTC pain relievers ( Tylenol and aspirin). Started elavil almost 3 months ago, I am now mostly headache free with only slight headaches and off all OTC pain relief. OTC pain relievers can be addictive and by reducing how much per day I took, I am now taking OTC pain relievers for minor muscle and joint problems as needed (which is only occasionally). Looking forward to stop using elavil every day. Some tips listen to your doctor, keep a log or journal of progress and remember not thinking always about a headache",
                    "About 3 months ago I started experiencing thunderclap migraines. My doctor put me on Atenolol which did nothing for me. She then put me on Amitriptyline 25 mg which has pretty much eliminated the migraines. I guess I was somewhat depressed because now I feel wonderful, patient, and have a sense of well being. My emotions seem to have levelled out. I have experienced some not so pleasant side effects such as vivid bizarre dreams, blurry vision, constipation and dry mouth. I kept hearing about serious weight gain but due to my new found satisfaction in life I don't turn to food for comfort anymore so I've lost weight on this medicine! I love what this medicine has done for me.",

Before my rheumatologist prescribed this, I went through numerous other things which all caused me to get horrible headaches, stomach problems, and did nothing for my depression.  I sleep well pretty much every night and I dont wake up feeling groggy, I dont have as many 'bad body days' anymore, and I feel way better emotionally.",
                    "Second medication I tried after years of issues, definitely helped but didn't help completely and issues have been slowly returning here and there. Works much better if I make sure to take it at the same time every day.",
                    "I have a very high tolerance for a lot of pain medications due to pain issues. Your body always needs more and more to produce the same effect until almost nothing works.  Fortunately, this type of medication doesn't affect me that way. Although I guess it is mainly used for depression. It has worked like a charm for me to get my body to sleep much longer. And I have never had to increase the dose. The only drawback for me with this medication is that when I do wake up I am pretty groggy for about 45 minutes.",

                    "I started having headaches about 2 and a half years ago. I had at least 3 per week. Then it got to the point where I had a headache literally EVERY SINGLE DAY. After 2 MRIs, countless blood tests, an eye exam, and seeing a neurologist, no one could tell me why I had a headache every day. It got to the point I couldn't eat, couldn't sleep, and couldn't get anything done. My head hurt so bad I couldn't move some days. FINALLY a doctor prescribed me 25mg of amitriptyline once a day. I've been on it for 3 weeks now and have only had 2 light headaches since taking it. This medicine seriously saved my life. I got so depressed from constant pain. The first week I started taking amitriptyline I was drowsy but I'm fine now. I take it every night before bed.",
                    "I was skeptical and did not want to take this. My doctor prescribed Amitriptyline and Citalopram in approx. 1/4 dosage given for depression. I had just gone through the worst 4 four months of my life with debilitating Irritable Bowel Syndrome attacks nearly every day that would last for two to up to 8 hours. I gave in and tried the medications. I have not had a single IBS attack since the very first night I took the medications. It feels like a miracle. My attacks were so bad the thought of dying seemed better than having the attacks regularly. I thank my incredible doctor and God for introducing me to this medicine. ",

Sharp pains and long lasting dull ache on the right side wouldn't go away, sometimes numbness etc. And for about a year I went through EVERY type of Dr & test possible. Long story short and two MRI's later (all came back normal). I was no closer to ridding myself of these pains. I found a new Dr who put me on Elavil (25mg) and I can say after 3 months my head pains are reduced 85%. I have pain free days now! It took about 2 months to work in my case. Tiredness is a side effect but mine went away after a few weeks. This med has given me hope. I hope if you're having these problems you will give it a chance to work...",

I had been to many doctors complaining of lethargy and body pain/aches, and I never had any answers, one doctor said \"do you think this might be all in your head.\"My life changed at 41 when I started on amitriptyline, I finally went into a deep sleep, felt more refreshed, and it substantially reduced the pain.  I am currently 55, original dose lost its efficacy overtime. I am now on 125 mg, but I am very active and run and bicycle weekly.  Don't get scared if you feel even more tired in the first 2 to 3 weeks of taking the medication, that will dissipate and you will feel refreshed all day.",

The drug has worked wonders on me and as long as I take my medication every night, I never experience a headache unless under extreme stress. Wonder drug, mild side effects. First few years dry mouth was really intense. It is harder for me to fall asleep now, have to take 5-10mg of melatonin as well.

Took me a long time to get diagnosed but was pretty much confirmed when 10mg of Amitriptyline compleatly stopped my cycle. I had been on and off it for years. Recently after moving to a new state it seems I am now always on it. In 7 years I went from 25mg to starting today 100mg. This drug really is a life saver but I'm getting concerned I'm going to get to the max dose and have to find something else. I also take 5mg lexapro for irritability. My side effects have been dry mouth and weight gain. Which I don't mind for getting my life back.",

I'm currently weaning off this medication to try something else, but it did help for awhile.",

It has worked wonders in managing my migraines. I went from 4 migraines a week to now once a week. I will be returning to Dr. to figure out the next step since I have been a year in overall peace but still have the constant one a week.

It can also make your blood sugar go up or down.",

The 10mg works better for fibromyalgia on low dose apparently (10mg) but anyway I took it daily an hour or two before bed but it did take a good 4 months to get into my system and work on blocking out most of my pain and actually get to grips with my own personal experiences with this chronic condition. It worked really well on my migraines I get them occasionally if I eat food triggers wheat - dairy - msg amongst other triggers but not nearly as bad as before I started taking amitriptyline. I can honestly say its given me back my life and can plan ahead which I have never been able to do before. I gave it a  10/10.

Then I recently got one migraine that Frova couldn't keep away for more than 12 hours. After 8 weeks of undulating pain, I tried amitriptyline and my migraine finally disappeared after only 2 days. I was also able to get a full night's sleep. Been on 10mg for two weeks now and feel almost back to my normal self again. The drowsiness subsided after about a week. I will occasionally get the sensation that I'm getting a migraine, but it dissipates quickly. No issues with weight gain yet - I actually lost about 10 pounds, but it could be because I've been doing more sleeping than eating lately.",

Am going to try to stay the course and see what happens. Perhaps it would be easier to just stay on the med, but I know long-term it's not good. So, we will see what happens.",

My dose now is only 50 mg...so glad I tried this medicine. I am very scared of antidepressants due to a horrible reaction from Cymbalta but Elavil is an older medication and its chemical makeup is different than most of the newer SSRIs. I went from sleeping on average of 4 to 5 hours a night...now I can sleep 10 without ever waking up..literally something I haven't been able to do in 5 years.

Finally, I saw a new GP last week, that seemed to chalk my symptoms up to IBS, and she prescribed me this medication. I've only been on 1/2 a 25mg pill each evening for five days, and already my symptoms have vastly improved. There's brief pain for about 10 minutes occasionally, but it passes quickly now and is far less severe, and I'm not kept up all night by the pain anymore like before. No ill effects, as I take it in the evening about an hour before bedtime. This medication is a godsend for me!",

Following two pregnancies I have had about 6 silent migraines (visual aura but no headache) a year until this year when I started to have alot more (still silent) migraines. I realise I am very lucky to not have full blown headaches, but they have still been incapacitating and scary. After having six migraines in a week I started to take amytriptiline (10mg). I've been taking it now for about 11 weeks and have had three mild migraine auras since then. Seems to be working -- will persevere. No side effects after first week.",

About 27 yrs before my College Neurologist prescribed me 10 mg amitriptyline every night and next day I would not get migraine. It was nothing less than a miracle. The side effects were also bad as last 27 yrs I fall in sleep in all those awkward places like Movie theater, While in class but I did not stop as at least I did not have migraine. No one would know the extent of migraine unless or until he/she had a first hand experience. My mouth is always dry but I will take the side effects over migraine.",

I had originally tried Amitriptyline at the beginning of my diagnosis; however, quickly got off of it (I don't remember why). 6 years later and a new doctor suggested we give it a try. Almost immediately I noticed my eyes changing. Very blurred vision. I also experienced rapid weight gain, hostility, aggression and more sweating. Within three weeks of being on the medicine, I called my doctor and had them get me off of it. Now I am on nortriptyline. Glad because I soon after received notification from my insurance that they wouldn't cover the suggested amount of 50 mg, only 25 mg for 30 days.",

My doctor prescribed this to me at 5 MG a day to start slowly I got up to 10 MG a day and that is what I take now the only downside I've had with this pill is it makes me very tired for this reason I take it at night. We experimented with taking 10 MG one night then 5 MG the next it helped the tiredness but I was willing to deal with the tiredness in exchange for less pain I still have to stay away from foods that make me sick and it doesn't take away all pain but has helped tremendously and I'm very grateful for it.",

Tried different medication, some made me worse and some did nothing. After changing GPs I was put on Amitriptyline, I didn't hold out much hope but after 1 month I noticed the difference.

Elavil worked great to reduce the intensity of my headaches. Although they were still going on it was much more tolerable. I had been on Elavil only one month and a week before I stopped. First week my insomnia and anxiety seemed to be simmering down (This stopped soon after week 2). As for my depression... Elavil put it under a magnifying glass.

Along with my normal pain management (Morphine/vicodin/muscle relaxer) he suggested Elavil. I was weary at first, but thought why not. Because of my high tolerance to medicines, he started me out at 50mg. After 1 week, I was AMAZED. I slept through the night and my pain seemed to subside to tolerable.

Following a few days of relative calm, a second migraine (or continuation of the previous one... who knows?) occurred and essentially disabled me for an additional 1 1/2 weeks. After much research, I talked to my physician and decided on a treatment plan which includes taking 25mg of amitriptyline (Elavil) at bedtime every night, as well as Maxalt MLT and a nausea drug when needed.

So, I broke down, went to the doctor and he gave me this medicine. I told him that I lay there and think - Nothing Negative, I am a happy person, but just lay there thinking about stuff. This medicine made me CRAZY; I was pacing and angry and pulling my hair (metaphorically speaking).  It is a Psychotropic drug - NASTY STUFF!

Last week I finally realised that I need serious help as I was planning suicide. I'm back on 100mg endep and 25mg Seroquel if needed at night. I sleep fantastic, wake up feeling so refreshed. Sleeping makes a HUGE difference, and the funny thing is now that I'm feeling good, I'm out of bed and exercising.

Before I started to take amitriptyline, I had migraines every other day. The neurologist said the migraines are rebounding and my brain was screaming for Maxalt or Imitrex. I haven't been needing to take Maxalt and Imitrex for 3 months now. Amitriptyline doesn't affect my mood, but I feel my body is retaining water and have constipation too.

I've taken it for a week, and after one dose, the first thing I noticed was an awesome night's sleep, and no neck or jaw pain, pain on rising. I feel completely relaxed in the morning, a little drowsy but am able to function and get my three kids to school.

I have occasional flares (like right now I am in one)), but for the most part, my Interstitial Cystitis has been under control for the past 2.5 years.

He asked why I had been taking them so long and what doses I was taking. I was taking 8 x co comodal and 4 x ibrufen a day. He diagnosed me with fibromyalgia and suggested I try Amitriptyline. He suggested 10mg at first raising to 20mg if I had not side effects. He said to carry on with the pain relief when I felt I needed it. I took some time off work and went ahead. It was amazing.

                    "I was put on 25mg of amitriptyline because of my dependence to zoplicone (a horrible sleeping pill). It took a few weeks for the amitriptyline to kick in but once it did I was able to easily fall asleep, stay asleep for 8-10 hours and wake up feeling refreshed. I am happy to say that it's been 3 months and I haven't had to take any zopiclone which is a big deal for me. I only take 10mg now a night but actually feel like I don't even need it. I plan to completely stop it next week. ",
                    "This medication helps with flare ups and helps me sleep through the night. ",
                    "I must say that the migraine suffering that I had for years is almost gone.Although today I have slight headaches.My MD prescribed me with a heavy dosage but after checking out from the hospital after an angio,the cardiologist reduced the dosage which prevents me from feeling sleepy.",
                    "I suffer an array of chronic pain / low back and leg issues - My doctor, after many failed attempts of finding the right medication for me, used this in conjunction with the muscle relaxant Robaxin and in the first three days there was notable significant relief of virtually all pain. I continue to take 75mg twice a day and I feel like I have my life back again. This medicine has been a blessing.",
                    "I had a very hard time sleeping. Most of the time I would stay up till 5 or 6 in the morning. I tried this pill and oh boy did it work. I love the feeling of being sleepy when I take these because I don't really know what that feels like anymore since I can never sleep. I am only on 20mg but I vary from 20mg to 40mg. I do not feel like they are addictive but I do enjoy how they put me right to sleep. They are great pills if you have trouble sleeping.",
                    "Amazing difference.",
                    "Most effective antidepressant. Works way better than SSRI and Effexor.",
                    "For the past 4 years this medication has been great to me. I was prescribed this because I have had horrible TMJ. At night this would ease my pain. It would also relax my jaw enough to sleep and not have clenching and grinding. I've only had 2 problems taking it. It has gave me nightmares and it makes me so sleepy that I rarely get out of bed on time the next day. But all in all it has helped me.",
                    "My migraines have been cut in half by using 10mg elavil daily. I used to get severe headaches 2 times per month lasting at least 3 days each. Now I get about 1 every 4-6 weeks and for the most part they last a day or 2 and are Much less severe. I used to be bed ridden for days and it's happened only once or twice since starting elavil 6 months ag. I pray that this continues and that I don't build a tolerance and have to up my dosage because I don't like taking meds",
                    "I have been taking amitriptyline for 2 weeks for irritable bowel syndrome. Until now I was taking Buscopan 3-4 x a day. They were really good and helped my problem with diarrhea but on the odd occasion I'd still get a flare up and had to watch what I eat. I now take 10 mg of amitriptyline each night and am pleased to say, I'm now able to eat whatever I fancy without getting the gurgling tummy, bloatedness and urgency to use the loo. ",
                    "Since my car accident a little over year ago I shattered my femur, had a compound fracture in my tib and fib and had previous issues with my back, bad L4 and L5 herniations and my S1 is also herniated as my sacrum was fractured in the accident. It was a very traumatic accident, if you saw the pictures of my car you would have a hard time believing anybody lived through it so I now have lots of hardware in my left leg and no idea what happened. I had my dogs in the car and they didn't have a scratch. Been through 3 surgeries and numerous hospital stays and last weekend my 20 y/o \"bf\"/(was dating him) passed on, this medication has really helped me to be able to sleep through the night; including helping with pain, depression, anxiety & grief",
                    "It makes me drowsy, so take it at night but this is the only thing that has worked. I had dry mouth but i was temporary.",
                    "I was given elavil for my migraine. .I've been taking 10 my for 1 week N now week 2 up to 20mg..I also have dealt with ibs-c..the migraine/headaches hav subsided a little..but my bloating N cramping N nausea r all still there..it did help my sleep the first week but I've had trouble sleeping on week 2..from the other testimonials on here I'm gonna give it a couple more weeks to see if more improvement occurs..",
                    "I'm 20 years old and this medicine cured my nocturnal Enuresis (bedwetting). I take 25mg per night. Now I can focus on my other problems.",
                    "Taking it for migraine prevention and chronic pain and depression and sleep aid. Works great, went from 3 or more migraines a week to 3 in four weeks.",
                    "I was really depressed.... This helped",
                    "I was on Elavil 10mg previously for a few years and had only a handful of migraines in all that time. I decided to stop it for a year to see how I would feel, eventually I went back to 4-5 migraine days a week. I've been on it for two weeks again, most of the initial side effects have subsided (dizziness, fatigue and dry mouth - nothing unbearable) and I have not had a single migraine since I took the first pill. I'm now on 20mg - I take it to also help with arthritic pain and symptoms of Crohn's disease. I feel better than I have in a long time. I sleep amazing and wake up feeling good and energized. I have never experienced weight gain on this medication - however I do eat very healthy and exercise regularly.",
                    "Was given this medication for migraines, worst mistake ever, I had bad thoughts about myself, had panic attacks, lost control of myself. Only took it for two nights. Please read the paper because I didn't, only after. Never again. Good luck to everyone else x",
                    "I have had chronic pain since I was about 11 yrs old, I'm 43 now, due to a genetic blood disease. It's caused arthritis that's led to neuropathy, spine degeneration, and many damaged joints.  I have been taking toradol and gabapentin for nerve pain for almost 3 years. Recently a bleed in my feet caused extensive nerve damage that would make my feet burn at night. My doctor added 50 mg of Elavil to my bedtime meds and after 6 weeks I notice a significant improvement. It has been 3 months and 90% of my foot pain and numbness is gone. I have also noticed an overall improvement in my face pain and back pain. I am lucky enough to not have any notable side effects.",
                    "I took this medicine for anxiety and panick attacks. After suffering for several months trying all sorts of medication. It was this old school medicine that gave me hope that i can actually recover. It improves my general health condition. But i found it difficult to wake up from sleep while i was still on this medication.It really helps but did not address the symptoms permanently.",
                    "I lost my hand in a car accident about 3 year's ago I got rsd because of that. Nothing truly helped my pain until I got on Amitriptyline. With chronic pain it takes all your energy but Amitriptyline helped me get my life back. I still have very bad days but I'm able to clean again play with my kids. Thank too Amitriptyline I love life again.",

                    "After surgery to remove a kidney I developed IBS mixed. I was missing so much work and school and it only got worse as I got older. After moving I saw a new digestive health Dr. He put me on this with Levsin, omg the change was almost immediate. Within a week I was so much better. I've been on them for about a year now and I still have a couple episodes once every 3 months or so but it's managed and controlled now. If I forget to refill or skip a dose, I suffer within 12 hours of the missed dose.",
                    "I currently take 25mg and sleep just fine. Remember that lower dosages 25-50mg are for insomnia, the more you take you move into the antidepressant effects and become less effective for sleep. So 300mg isn't going to help your insomnia and may increase it.",
                    "I first started out at 50mg of Elavil almost 2 years ago. It was like instant heaven! I am a horrible insomniac and with Elavil I was getting good quality sleep and woke up feeling rested. I was also on Lyrica at the time. For a while both of them together had me feeling a lot better. Unfortunately I have a very high tolerance to any medicine. I am now at 150mg Elavil. I can't imagine going any higher yet my pain is increasing so I don't know what will happen when I totally max out at this level. I no longer take Lyrica as I became tolerant. Savella seems to help with fibromyalgia fog but it doesn't touch my pain. Give it a try. ",
                    "I have been sick for over 4 years now and been on this for the past 2 weeks and its been a miracle. I haven't been sick or in pain once. I don't mean I just vomit, I start and I can't stop for 19 of 30 days. So far the minute I took one, that night I have been more relaxed and less sick have been able to cut down my oxycodone and Zofran so I am thankful. I will let you know how it continues to go but so far its my miracle.",
                    "I'm 27 years old and have been to the doctors many many times. I've had nausea, vomiting, weight loss and headaches/migraines, for over a year now. I'll have a few days to a week with no symptoms and then they come right back. I've had appointments with gastroenterologist and have had a colonoscopy and endoscopy done. I've been to the hospital on a few occasions due to my vomiting. Doctors still don't know whats wrong. They have put me on acid reflex medications, which don't help much. I have talked to my doctor about the possibility of me having CVS. He hasn't said that's what I have but prescribed me Amitriptyline. Just started it yesterday... Hope it works. Close to losing my job if I cant get this under control.....",
                    "I've used Amitriptyline for about 6 mnth now I sleep well, little harder to get up in the morning, It doesn't help my pain, but I do find I'm able to cope better. Also I find using deep heat heat rub helps. I rub it into my muscles. My doctor says it ok as it an anti inflammatory.",
                    "I only take it when I get a migraine and I can then function at work. I take it maybe twice that day and don't take it again until I get another mygraine.",
                    "I am 58 years old and had headache since I was 7. I had taken tons of pain killers, had seen so many specialists and under taken numerous tests. Recently I did botox on my forehead on 2 occasions, none worked! I was desperate not knowing what to do. I had stomach pain too because of too much ibuprofen, aspirin and so on. My rectum suffered as well, as I frequently used diclofenac suppository. Now it is about 2 months I am on amitriptyline. Started at 10 and now at 75mg and it worked. Yes I am now living headache free, can you believe it. Thanks to my dear GP, and of course AMITRIPTYLINE.",
                    "I have suffered from migraine on and off since my teens always visual patterns then wham! the headache. A few years ago I just had the patterns and no pain then it changed to tension neck pain which which then turned into headache as soon as I woke up more or less daily. Imigran helped but was popping them like smarties. I tried giving up all the known triggers but nothing helped then a couple of months ago Dr prescribed Amitriptyline 25mgs every night I have had maybe 2 or 3 slight headaches since. First week I was a little woozy but that passed. Now I wake up with a dry mouth and food tastes different but no headache. It used to be unusual to wake up with no headache now its unusual to wake up with one. I recommend anyone to give it a try.",
                    "This was a miracle initially. Been on it since around 1995, I am up to 100 mg at bedtime. I now find it very difficult to get moving in the morning. I have NOT had constant PAIN since starting this medicine. I recommend it.",
                    "I was diagnosed with severe anterior bridging endophytis as well as facet joint arthropathy and some nuchal ossification in my cervical spine. Basically, my neck is fairly solid and I suffer intense pain shocks when lying down at night. The result was that I suffered from intense sleep deprivation and pain. I now take 10mg Amitriptyline. The result? Solid sleep every night, recovered energy levels and the large black bags beneath my eyes have dissipated. I used to wake up a couple of times each night to urinate, but now sleep for minimum 8 hours and usually awake bursting for the toilet!",
                    "Nothing has worked for me for anxiety, depression, or insomnia. Add this to the list. I wish I could find something that works. My doc put me on 50mg of this in the morning and before bed, along with 1 & 1/2 1.5mg klonipin 3x a day and 2mg Xanax as needed. I was also given lexapro for depression. It didn't help at all. Caused sleeplessness, restlessness, worsened insomnia, weight gain and bloating, ED, and gynocemastia. Not sure which meds caused which, but I was also on nexium, water pills, and lisinipril. Got off all meds as fast as I could and am still suffering from stage 2 hypertension, depression, anxiety, SAD, insomnia, and GERD without meds. Life is rough, but at least I'm not dealing with side effects.",

                    "I took Endep 25 for headaches. I felt drowsy even the next day. So I went to Endep 10. I need to to take it about 2 hours before sleep. Side effect - ear noise which is going on for over 1 week now after 1 tablet. Going to stop it for a while due to side effect.",
                    "I am prescribed Amitriptyline due to side effects from Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis. I have been taking it for approximately 18 months, and the only negative side effect I ever had was seriously dry mouth. As I have continued to take it, the side effect has gone away.",
                    "I suffered from common migraine most of my adult life and had gone through just about every conceivable medicine there was including Sansert. Nothing seemed to help prevent them but I did have Imitrex to take when I had a migraine. But I took it too often and got rebound headaches. Then, with the 4th neurologist within 25 years, she prescribed 50 mg of amitriptyline to take at night. Immediately I was free of migraines and over 10 years have never had to resort to Imitrex. Amitriptyline changed my life.",
                    "I take it for sleep. Started on a low dose and increased later. I am not on 75mg per day. It is not expensive and is an old medicine so side effects are well studied. Only issue is that if I miss one dose you can feel depressed. Sleep is a huge part to conquering this. I have noted a huge difference in my sleep and how I feel on a morning. I am better able to work as well. Brain coming back.",

I'm looking forward to a new me since ",
                    "Ive been taking this for about 3 1/2 years. It works great for what I take it for. The only problem I have, which is a huge problem, is increased appetite and weight gain. I'm actually gonna start a different medication for nerve pain. Amitriptyline has helped but I'm also battling obesity. This medication doesn't help at all in that area. Im still young, mid 30s. So maybe I'll resume taking it when I'm in my 60s or 70s. I wont care so much then about the weight gain. ",

My doctor decided to put me on amitriptline and immediately I saw improvements. I am now going to be 21 and still taking 50 mg of it every night before bed. This medication is the only one of my many medications (other health problems) that I will never stop taking. I would recommend this medication to anyone struggling with IC pain .definatly talk to your doctor about it!",

I've been taking it for about 2 months and I've gone from 6 separate migraine attacks in a 2 week span to 4 in a two month span. I may need to up the dosage soon because 3 have been recently (within the last month). Anywho, helps me sleep wonderfully at night without making me groggy before or after bed. I also have no harsh side effects like thoughts of suicide or anything like that. 10/10 would recommend for migraine sufferers - I have it a 9 because I think I need to up my dosage.",

I started at just 10mg a night and after each 4 day period increased it by 10mg until I reached 30mg. This was on Amitrip-10. As my body adjusted the pain would return. I was suffering from dry mouth, morning drowsiness until about 10.30am and certain level of confusion. I eventually had to increase to 40mg and was doing really well - pain free for the first time in 2 years. Then the funding agency Pharmac changed the supplier and my next prescription was Amirol. I had to almost double the strength for effective relief, in spite of the claimed same dosage. So be careful if you change brands.",
                    "I struggled horribly with severe anxiety for years I tried all kinds of natural remedies and doctor prescribed medicines but nothing worked long term then two years ago I was diagnosed with interstitial cystitis and was prescribed AmItriptyline for pain but what I got was amazing relief from my anxiety and stress now I know what people mean when they say \"I got my life back\" I take 5mg before bed I sleep great and have a little trouble waking up cause I sleep so well but once I'm up I'm fine no drowsiness and no more anxiety",

I starting having more vivid dreams while sleeping. This is the best antidepressant I've taken. I didn't even know it was an antidepressant till I looked it up. As I swore never to take antidepressants again but it helped with the headaches, so I guess I will just keep taking this magic pill. I wish I was prescribed this years sooner!",
                    "I think this medication really helped with the Interstitial Cystitis but unfortunately it gave me terrible headaches. Every morning - after about a week of taking 10 mg's of this - I'd wake up with a terrible migraine. It would last all day! At first I wasn't sure if it was the medication but now I'm positive. I stopped taking it (after 3 weeks of use) and my headaches all but disappeared. In my opinion, the headaches were just as bad as the Interstitial Cystitis! I don't know if anyone else here has had that experience but it certainly happened to me. Good luck everyone.",
                    "I was prescribed these for insomnia and anxiety. I've been on every anti-depressant you can think of, all with awful side effects. I do get a dry mouth, tiredness, headaches and mild anxiety with Amitryptaline, but it's much more manageable - I was suffering from daily, pretty constant anxiety before starting Amitryptaline. I'm on 30mg. My sleep is 90% better (which after 12 years of chronic insomnia is a amazing).",
                    "I started getting tension headaches everyday for months around the same time late in the afternoon. No matter where I was, the cycle would continue and cause stress due to the headache.  A GP started me in 10mg daily. It takes about two weeks to feel the effects. This drug has greatly reduced my pain and helped break the cycle. Side effects are morning drowsiness, occasionally blurry vision, and sleepiness.",
                    "I used this for a year for insomnia, but once my sleep cycle got better they took me off of it. I am going to ask for it again as I have been reduced to 3 to 4 hours of sleep once more. I hope it works as well now as it did 20 years ago.",
                    "I started on a very low dose, like 2.5 or 5 mg, then 10mg, then 25 and now I'm on 50. I started seeing a definite decrease in my migraines at 25mg so my doctor doubled my dose, but nothing new after 3 weeks at 50mg. It's nice that this is an anti-depressant too, I feel happier since I've been on it. Haven't noticed any weight gain and I hope I don't ever. Anyway it seems to just block my usual triggers, they just don't bother me as much as they used to. I still get migraines once or twice a week, worse with heavy stress, but I have been amazed at how I can go out into the sunlight or exercise without immediately getting a migraine. Amazing.",

I would wake up with my hair being a total mess like I was sleeping restless. My doctor said to start this at 20mg before bed and if that dose doesn't help increase by 10mg until I get to a level that works. First couple nights have been wonderful. But I have been waking up at 6am both days and can't go back to sleep. I feel rested and alot less morning pain. Doctor is hoping I can go off lyrica. Lyrica is causing me to feel high. I get 8-9 hours relief with lyrica and then my pain comes back. I have gained about 10lbs while on lyrica but at least I can work.",

                    "I took this drug for low back pain and anxiety. I stayed on for two weeks at only 10mg before night. It does help you sleep and does prevent migraines, without a doubt. However, I woke up with a lot of pain in my upper back and chest from muscle spasms I guess. Every night. And you can't drink alcohol at all unless it's late at night after the drug wears off. Oh, and it doesn't help with anxiety or panic attacks at all.",

First thing, 1st pill, was extremely dry mouth with a dry cough that last a couple of hours. 2 day same but now accompanied with an internally anxiety accompanied by insomnia. Within a week, felt like every adverse reaction mention in pamphlet and online was applicable plus some not mentioned (dry mouth, blurred vision, centralized stomach pain/gut, constipation and blurred double vision... OH! not to mention the vivid racing dreams anytime I could fall asleep.) When I mentioned to Dr., his feeling was for me to continue meds. Issues would work themselves out within a couple weeks more. \"Ok doc. I'll give it a couple of weeks more of this torture these pills have put me in.\" Went home and tossed them in garbage.",

Plus, the first night that I took it I woke up with a migraine that wouldn't go away after my Imitrex Statdose injection. So now my doctor put me on a beta blocker.

I have since had a difficult marriage break up to deal with and increased the dose to 25mg. I don't know how I would have coped without this drug.

                    "I developed fibromyalgia recently. I had been on low dose of a similar medication (Doxepin) for long time, mainly for a sleep disorder. The neurologist I saw for my fibromyalgia suggested switching from Doxepin to Amitriptyline. Overall, I am glad I made the switch, as my fibromyalgia is now much more manageable. I take 35 mg of amitriptyline nightly. Initially very sedating, but now less so. It has also helped my irritable bowel syndrome. On the negative side, it has led to constipation problems, and my irritable bladder (bladder urgency) is now much more chronic, which is surprising because amitriptyline has higher anticholinergic properties. But my pharmacist feels that Doxepin must have helped me more with that. NOTE: Beware of combining amitriptyline with Detrol LA (for bladder urgency).",

                    "Amitriptyline immediately worked wonders on my urinary tract pain. I am almost afraid to say how well it has worked because I do not want to jinx it, but it has done wonders for me. Not sure about the weight gain. Not sure if it is the Amitriptyline or the excessive calories and lack of exercise that has put on the pounds. My guess is it is probably more likely due to my eating and exercise habits. I sleep better at night with a deeper sleep REM. I, too, have vivid dreams and do sleep longer.",
                    "Been suffering from severe right eye & top of the head pains, which normally develop into excruciating migraines and last for hours so I'm forced to take Migraleve which helps sometimes and go to bed with lights off and just rest. My doc prescribed me Amitriptyline and I took it 5 times in a month so far. I get a few side effects (insomnia, depression) and can only take them a few hours before bed as they still affect me the day after (sleepiness, tiredness, inability to focus). It does work almost immediately, and the effect last for a week even, which is great. I feel very relaxed but I noticed that I started feeling without reason rather depressed, to the point that one day I actually felt a bit suicidal so I stopped taking them for a week",
                    "I have been on amitriptyline for 8 months and it has supremely helped my condition. Although I still have one or two migraines a month, I was having them almost daily before starting on the amitriptyline. I was hesitant to be taking an anti depressant, especially after trying at least a dozen of other medications, but I am glad that I trusted my neurologist.",
                    "I have been taking 25mg amitriptyline for over a year now. My migraines have almost disappeared which is very good as I was having 2 a month lasting up to 3 days each. I've had Migraines since I was 14 and had hoped that I would start to get better after the age of 60. But not so I'm 68 now and will continue the pills though I'm worried about long term use. I get it on the national health here.",

After the first few weeks, I filtered out the adjustment side effects and looked at what was left. It didn't prevent migraines, it just delayed them. Hit a trigger, get a quick pain blast, a tingle, and the migraine would set in a few hours later. 31 days, 16 with migraines. A sleep efficiency of 52%, almost never in blocks lasting an hour, averaging just over 4 hours per night. Raised blood pressure. Toward the end, walking black outs. In the 3rd week, starting having constant paranoia. The blackouts did it, though. I see the neurologist tomorrow and ask to be taken off; I'm worse on it than I was without it.",
                    "This is great at helping with my headaches! There wasn't any cause for my migraines/frequent headaches and I wanted to solve the problem. It either makes them go away completely or decreases the pain dramatically so you're able to function beautifully. However, I do get dry mouth and I feel like I have to go and pee a lot. Which are two side effects and you do get tired but mostly when it's at night when you take them so it doesn't matter too much.",
                    "I've been on 20 mg of amitriptyline at bedtime for insomnia for 6 years now. I had been on valium after a bout with acute stress disorder, but found it highly addictive and found myself going to my shrink not for therapy, but just to get my RX renewed. I knew then that I had to get off the valium. My GP suggested the amitriptyline, and it is great. No side effects, and it LETS me sleep, it doesn't MAKE me sleep. It also lets me get back to sleep if I have to get up at night to use the bathroom. My doc told me to start with 10 mg and move up by 10 mg increments until I found a dose that worked but that didn't leave me hung over the next day. 10 mg worked. 30 mg put me in a fog til noon the next day. 20 mg has been perfect!",

                    "Like many who have commented here, I have experienced almost total relief from recurring migraine headaches - due to cranial nerve inflammation stemming from arthritis in C4 and C5. Before I started the amitriptyline, I had a strong headache nearly 24/7 with crushing flares maybe 2x per week. I was treating them with NSAIDs and Tramadol to keep them under control, with a 'triptan' for the flares. My doctor put me on a regimen involving titration from 50mg up to 300mg over a 5-week period. I only got to 150mg before the side effects (lethargy, dry mouth, constipation) were too much for me. I have backed down to 50mg before bed and that is working pretty well. My quality of life is SO much better. You'll get used to the side effects.",

I started on 10mg of amitriptyline and had no effect. Over a period of about 5 months I had reached a 40mg dosage everyday and still had no effect. Still suffering from migraines almost every day. On my 4th tablet now so hopefully this one might work! Glad it worked for some people though.",

This morning, 6 days since I started amitriptyline, I haven't slept and when I say that I mean that - not a wink of sleep in the last 3 night's. I was passing out yesterday with exhaustion. They have reduced my dose to 35 and I will persist but at this present time it hasn't helped me at all, just made me worse. I am hoping it will come good because the reviews are inspiring.",

Omg , it work so well , the first day I took , I had slept like 10hours (was at weekend ) .

After being prescribed 20mg Amitriptyline to be taken nightly my sleep has been amazing and pain levels are almost nil! I feel I have my life back now, I was concerned that I may be a little drowsy in the mornings as I have to drive to work early but I felt fine and 100% 'with it'. The most amazing feeling ever is one of not having to adjust everything I have to do daily to fit around the pain/muscle spasms etc...I also keep a 'pain level' diary which is a real help on looking back.",

There are still certain foods I avoid and I very occasionally get a flare up (normally because I have either over eaten or eaten something I would normally avoid). I take 20mg at night time, I did try to reduce this down to 10mg but after a couple of weeks all my symptoms were back, pain, bloating, constipation, etc. I'd advice anyone suffering to give it a go. It took several weeks of taking it before I experienced significant relief of symptom. Although I read that for some people it works straight away. Hope this helps.",

It helped with head aches but I couldn't concentrate, felt overly emotional, crying and angry. I found it hard to drive from lack of focus 18 hours after taking pill. I had a deep sleep, but not a restful one, the dreams were bizarre. Dry mouth and irritable too. Not worth not having a headache to have all of these problems. I am very sensitive to medication as I don't drink so it was not for me. Oh and I gained three pounds in first two weeks using it.",

This lead to me feeling constantly worn out and depressed. I really thought I was stuck with this for life and then ... I was prescribed amitriptyline. I started with 20mg and gradually increased to 50mg over a period of 6 months. The dosage was then gradually decreased and I was fine until I got down to 10mg, when the pains started to come back again. I increased to 20mg, which I have been taking for about 2 years and other than the occasional short flare-up, I have been fine. I have my life back again!",

I even switched from working days to working a low stress night job as a caregiver because my stomach was calmer at night. I also had really bad migraines. I was averaging 12-15 migraine days a month. Finally, I went to the doctor and told him about both of my problems. He suggested amitriptyline to control both issues. Within a month I could tell a major difference. I've been taking 50 mg every night for about 2 years now. My stomach still gets mildly sensitive occasionally. But I rarely get diarrhea and never have to take Imodium anymore. My migraines are down to about 4 or 5 a month.",

It causes sugar and carb cravings like crazy you never feel full it's addictive and you can form a tolerance to it which causes you to have to go up in dose every once in a while. I have slowly grown to hate it because I personally have gained 40 pounds in less than a year taking this medication. I've noticed lately that it hasn't been working as well for my migraines signalling an increase in dose. I am going to try a different medication because I'm already taking 100mg of this one and I can't deal with the cravings and weight gain!",

                    "I have had Chronic Pain for over 13 years, as a result of a head-on MVA (other driver was impaired) 33 years ago. The impact caused several injuries, but my broken knee and Fibula, were the worst. I had several surgeries, that kept me pain free and active until a TKR was required. Due to my age, it was put off, & though the surgery went well, it was put off to long and triggered Chronic Pain. I take Morphine 60 mg. x3/daily, which helps me function. Recently, the doctor put me on Amytriptyline 25mg x3/nightly. I have cut back to one, as it is very difficult for me to wake up in the morning, no matter how early I take it the night before. It does help with the pain though, and I do sleep much better!",

I am disabled with disc and bone disease my pain doctor added amitriptyline to my meds. I never would have imagined my pain doctor giving me a drug that could change my whole life, especially at my age. I gave up on finding a medication that really helped.

I've been on it less than a month and with a combination of the medicine and a diet (staying away from fatty foods, fried foods, soda, chocolate and eating lots of fruit) I have found relief I thought I'd never find. I'm 18 years old and I've had my fair share of history in battling these symptoms, it was rough but with this medicine, it became a lot easier.",

Because of weight gain I stayed mostly at 25 mgs nightly rather than increase the dose. But recently I have increased my dose back up to 50mgs. It is helping with the pelvic and bladder pain associated with Interstitial Cystitis at about 65 percent. It is not though helping with the frequency of urination around the clock as for so many years. But the relief with my abdominal and bladder discomfort is improving at present. For me that is a God send. My other medical and health challenges I am plugging away at. ",

Immediately before starting the medication, I had dizziness, nausea, jaw pain and migraine like headaches with light sensitivity for 3 solid months. I had suffered with these headaches since my early 20's but I had never had one long nonstop migraine for 3 months before. I have only had the beginnings of one small migraine (flashing lights) in the past few months and that correlated with missing a dose of the Elavil the previous night. I take one 25mg tablet at bedtime for migraine prevention. I sleep well, feel great and my mood is elevated, all because I don't have those debilitating headaches which were ruining my life.",

So the doctor gave me 25mg Amitriptyline which I just couldn't tolerate. Gave me worse insomnia, nightmares, even some bruises and muscle spasms in my back, which I'm assuming is related to the medication.  I'm going to go back down to the 10mg and see what happens. I'm so sad because I've been reading all of these great reviews, and was really hoping it would help. I'm underweight, and just very sensitive to most medicines. So I would say give it a try, since it works differently for everyone. I will update soon.",

It helps me have really deep sleep and it has reduced my anxiety and panic attacks to a zero. This medicine is the best for anyone who is undergoing severe stress, panic attacks or prolonged periods of sadness.

His symptoms included bloating, gas pains, constipation, and diarrhea. Sometimes the stomach pains would keep him up at night, unable to sleep. We monitored his diet, and found that removing dairy helped, but did not eliminate the problem. We, along with doctors determined he suffered from Irritable Bowel Syndrome. A pediatric GI doctor recommended trying amitriptyline. He started with a 10 mg dose each night which seemed to help. After several months the dose was upped to 20 mg/night. It has made a significant difference! He sleeps well each night, and has not had a significant painful IBS flare up in almost a year!",

Now, through close monitoring and guidance by my doctor, I am taking 40 mg of the amitriptyline around 10am and 20 mg around 10pm. Side effects at this dosage are insignificant (dry mouth, bitter taste, sometimes sleepy 3 hours after morning dose) considering I am getting much relief from the constant pushing/pulling. I rated 8 this time because this amount seems the most I can take. I'm so grateful for having about 15 days and evenings where I can sit normally to watch T.V or read, not having to have to be lying down.

I was started on amitriptyline 10mg and was also told it would help with my other myriad of symptoms - Irritable Bowel Syndrome, weak bladder, insomnia, anxiety, etc. At first, it caused numbness in my fingers and toes and on waking and going to the bathroom I had dizzy spells, my vision was a bit weird. The doctor told me to half my dose to 5mg and although it took a few months, I gradually started to feel better and all of my symptoms improved.

But, it's supposed to help with early morning awakening when you can't get back to sleep. I believe it does help with that. I find you want to take it early, like at 8:00 p.m. if you want to feel sleepy at 10:00 p.m. Also, you WILL be drowsy the next morning - another reason to take it early. I actually started taking it at 7:00 p.m. to help with the morning drowsiness.

Over time, as my back pain worsened, I started developing migraines, which started at maybe one a month and soon developed into one a week, lasting 2-3 days at a time. I was forced to take a leave of absence from my job due to my worsening back pain coupled with the nuclear bombs (migraines) erupting inside my head on an almost daily basis. Needless to say, my mood and overall disposition deteriorated rapidly and I had little to no hope that I'd ever return to a normal way of living. That is until my neurologist prescribed me Elavil.

No weight gain at 25mg, even after several months. When I tried 50mg, I had a hard time controlling carb cravings and gained 10lbs over 2 months; but, I didn't make much effort to fight carb cravings. I suspect if one exercises moderately and watches carb intake, weight gain can be avoided, even at \"higher\" doses (25mg+). I'm now taking 40mg.

I cannot tell you this unless the 'broken neck' ( as I call it, that's how it felt). I need you to understand how it was. I would have chose cancer over this endless pain. I read about aimtrip for pain. I said let's try amitriptyline. Quietly and without fanfare, this drug came to me. My pain is completely gone. If you have endless pain, ask your doctor to give you this drug.",
                    "I've been on Elavil for three years and it has been a God-send: Ironically, I was seeing a Gastrointestinal doctor until she recommended that I \"stop and smell the roses more.\" Combined with therapy sessions for about a year, I worry less as I see more of what really is worth getting worked up over -- not a whole lot. One can be passionate about certain things such as family and country and life, but other things are less, way-less significant. Elavil has taught me how to best sort out what some things are worth worrying over and not. I take 100mg/day at 8pm normally and I sleep well at night, and feel good generally about how things will be throughout the next day. I love the smell of roses. ",
                    "This can be a life-changer. I'm 22 and had gotten a concussion back in Nov. I was in bed every day for over 2 months, told to avoid ALL stimulation, lost a few lbs, hit with multiple migraines per day. My doc prescribed amitriptyline & within a few days of starting, I was easing back out of the dark and into the light (metaphorically and literally).This med gave me my life back and now I'm able to graduate on-time which was threatened then. Sympt: little more constipation than my usual, dry mouth, a dampened libido... they're all not bad sacrifices for me. Also, I've been aura-migraine-free since this medicine too! My aunt has been on it for almost 30 yrs and it's helped her chronic migraines as well. She's about 55 I think. Consider it!!!",
                    "I have been taking amitriptyline for 3 months now - I take 10mg morning and night due to how severe my irritable bowel syndrome is. I can eat everything now and have no side effects - I used to have diarrhea, bloating, stomach cramps & bad gas every time I ate gluten, dairy, spicy foods, onion, garlic and coffee (I've suffered from IBS for 8 years) This medicine has changed my life.",
                    "Just wanted to add more now that been taking longer. Positives - it's still working and at the low dose of 10mg. - Weirdly, I have lost weight although this seems like fluid and bloat loss but has amounted to half a stone. Issues - beginning to think I'm indestructible and after having tea and wine, I had a flare. However, the flare only lasted a day and I wasn't crying in pain. - changing brand from Actavis to Accord. Still working for IC but weirdly more unpleasant side effects, drowsiness, dry mouth and zombified feeling in morning. The difference was pretty immediate so I'm sure it's that. Perhaps other users should take note of brands. I will return to Actavis as this had no side effects whatsoever.",

I was not having to take it each night, usually 3 to 4 nights of as little as 12mg, sometimes even less at 6.5 mg did the trick. I found that the medication made it a bit harder to wake up in the morning but I was able to sleep thru the night. I am now having trouble sleeping due to increased stress and anxiety and the medication has been helpful in helping me sleep. Only issue for me has been the dry mouth in the morning which is manageable, I also try to eat right and exercise daily which has helped my anxiety. In reading the reviews, I can certainly relate to what many of you are going thru. Unless you've been thru it, people have no idea what its like.",

He sent me to a neurologist, who gave me Amitriptyline.  Helped me tolerate them but they never went away. They made me cranky, irritable, and down right mean. I have muscle weakness, and can not concentrate. Dr. for Fibro wants to increase dose to 100mg. I don't see that helping my side effects since the side effects started with this med. I'm going to see GP for a third opinion and referral to a Psychiatrist.  This drug is not for everyone. Be careful.",

He prescribed Amitriptyline . I was very skeptical about this. .then finally I started with 5 mg for my body to get used it.Then 1 week after I did 10 mg...and after 10 days I went to 15 mg...that did the trick no more paib but then I amped it to 20 mg. I never thought I will be able to have normal life again but this med saved my life.In this 6 weeks of taking Amitriptyline I had few days of pain of level 2 .but rest days so far ok.no pain !!

                    "This drug has changed my life. I wish it hadn't taken going through 7-8 medications and 2 years of feeling like a test subject, but I finally found the one! Doctors tend to use SSRIs for the first line of defence against anxiety and depression (also insomnia). I tried Lexapro, Hydroxyzine, Celexa, Zoloft, Effexor, Wellbutrin, Zoloft (again), and a variety of over the counter supplements. I also did yoga, crossfit, all the natural cures to mental instability. The SSRIs helped significantly but resulted in bad side effects such as sexual, feeling like a robot, and wearing off, over time. After a few melt downs, 3 doctors, and 2 years, I tried amitriptyline (a tricyclic antidepressant). Now, I feel fantastic- happy, sleeping well, anxiety-free",

I (and everyone in my family) have always had trouble sleeping, and I didn't think there was a medicine out there that would make me sleep on a reliable schedule. This is amazing. Negatives: Miss a dose and you'll have a bad migraine. It makes you extremely drowsy for the first week, but that will pass. I keep a bottle of water by my bed because of the dry mouth. Cravings is a side effect so if you get them you should monitor your diet to avoid weight gain. Also I drank half a beer after taking it and felt like I'd drank 15. Approach alcohol use VERY carefully.",

The only bad thing is I wake up shaky and I have this awful rash on my face that goes from the middle of my forehead down the mid cheek area on both sides of my face.

I was started on 25 mg Elavil with no relief, it was increased to 50 mg at bedtime and I have been nearly headache free for 3 weeks. I did miss one dose and had a headache the next day but not the rebound headaches that I was experiencing.  The side effect that bothered me most was the dry mouth and I did experience fatigue. I am a RN and work 12 hour shifts, there was no way I could work with a headache and would subsequently miss work. My fingers are crossed and I am hoping this is my cure. Yay!",

Increase anxiety to severe state as I never know if this vomiting thing is going to come back. Overall, it works. Side effects are not bad at all. Anxiety is almost unbearable, which is not a side effect of this medication. I think it is a side effect of having CVS.",

I take 100mg 2 hours before I plan to sleep & Amitriptyline HCL 100 mg. It is best thing I ever did.

I would stay up for 3 days at a time while working crazy 12 hour back to back shifts. I was at my wit's end, so exhausted, delirious, and beyond stressed. I have tried so many different medicines to help with sleep and anxiety. None have even come anywhere as close as Amitriptyline has, to giving me good sleep.

Over the years though, this has changed. I started off on 50mg per day and over the years had to have it increased to the maximum does of 150mg. Recently I have been having heart palpatations and an increased heart rate. My doctor has put it down to the extended time I have been on Endep at such a high rate. So now I am on a drug to lower my heart rate, which works well, but my doctor is getting me to try to cut down on the Endep with a view of going off it altogether and hopefully also going off the drug that I need to lower my heart rate.

I sleep solid and right through the night which is unusual for me these days as my stressful job and back pain often leaves me anxious and tossing and turning every night and then I end up grumpy, run down and feeling sick as a result. So far it has not helped with my anxiety or depression but getting a good night sleep helps me cope and gives me energy to attend yoga and exercise. I believe the dose may be too small to help the depression. I'm also taking this as it is the most studied antidepressant used during pregnancy and the SSRI's give me insomnia. I have almost no side effects so far.",

I started out at 10mg nightly, it was a God send, a miracle medicine. I was completely migraine free for approximately 2 1/2 yrs while taking this medicine, I had no side effects really, maybe gained a few pounds maybe 4 or 5 during this 2 year stretch, then all of a sudden the migraines started back again about 1 month age. I went back to the neurologist, he increased my dosage to 30 mg. I haven't really seen any improvement, have been on this for about 3 days now, was initially increased to 20 mg for 5 days previously.

I've now increased to 20mg and hoping this will help further as I still have mild to medium chronic migraine headache. From what I have read on here, 20mg seems to be the dosage that proper relief kicks in so I am hopeful!

To lose weight, I started adhering to a plant-based diet and exercising. After 4 months of diet and exercise, my pain was almost gone, so I dropped all of my medications. After that, I lost 15 pounds. A few months later, my insomnia came back. Because I wasn't sleeping, my pain increased again. So, I started back on amitriptyline. I take 30mg 4-5hrs before bed. It takes a few weeks to kick-in as a sleep aid and it might cause night-sweats for about a month. After a month, I started sleeping like a rock and I have no side-effects or weight gain.

It freaked me out that it would prevent me from sleeping if I didn't take it, so I got off of it quickly. It DID help some of the pain, but it wasn't worth it.",
                    "Have been suffering nerve damage pain on my leg after having 3 slipped discs for more than 1.5 years and tried a lot of pain relief tablets but didn't like the side affects from them plus I still had the pain. My dr perscribed me these, must admit I really didn't think they would be any good but was surprised from the moment I took the first tablet, the pain had greatly decreased so after a week I started to take 2 every evening after dinner and I hardly know myself. Pain free. And the only side affect is feeling a bit sleepy, hence taking then in the evening.",

Now looking into alternative healthy medication I'm told from a sufferer of back and disc pain that I should stop taking this toxin and try hemp oil along with vitamins.",

The doctors did basically nothing until now because my insurance (state insurance) was having them go through all kinds of hoops. Finally I was sent to pain management in the recent month, and from there I was prescribed amitriptyline hcl. I've found so far, after taking this medication for almost a week, 10mg 30 mins before I go to bed, that I've been having intense headaches, but only in my right side of my brain, along with sinus pressure and extreme drowsiness. I literally have slept an entire 19 hours! Normally I only sleep from 10pm to 6am, so sleeping this long is insane. So far it hasn't helped with my pain either... :(",

I developed every inflammatory immune response possible - joints so weak I could hardly stand up, eyes felt like they had sand or glass in them, could not sleep, anxious all the time and crippling rebound migraines. I lost 1 year of work. Metabolism has never re-corrected itself fully.  I stopped going to Doctors after this drug experience as they failed to understand the negative potency of this drug and had no solutions. I got healthy again through properly researched supplementation and nutrition. Wrecked my life.",
                    "I started Amitriptyline for Fibromyalgia, with hopes that it would also help with depression & anxiety. My max dose so far is 40mgs @ bedtime. Initially, it was extremely sedating, but less so as time went on, & when I started taking Wellbutrin for fatigue, I had no residual sedation or daytime sleepiness at all. Ami was a life saver to me in regards to pain relief. As for depression & anxiety, it wasn't helpful until I combined it with Wellbutrin. I would highly recommend the combo for Fibro fog/fatigue/pain/anxiety/depression. It's like taking an SNRI without the side effects! I increase by 10mgs as needed when my pain begins breaking through. I also found if I'm really stressed or anxious during the day & take 10mgs, it is very calming.",

I prefer not to take prescription medication but had tried homeopathic remedies, adjusted my diet and lived a very regimented lifestyle but would still have 8+ migraines a month. Was prescribed 10 mg in the evening. I started taking 5 mg to slowly start my body on it and minimize side effects---been on 5 mg for the last 6 weeks and have had tremendous success. Side effects: sleepiness in the am--so I take the pill about 6:30 in the evening and have minimal sleepiness in the morning. I was worried about weight gain but haven't seen it (I'm 110 so it would be noticeable). Dry mouth--I just drink more water. Other than that, minimal side effects.",

I started on a dosage of 25 mg which did nothing. Not even make me sleepy. Had immediate relief after the dosage was regulated. This in conjunction with anti anxiety medication has helped tremendously. I just have to exercise daily and keep a watch over what I eat. But that is a small trade for the drastic change in my overall well being and frame of mind.",

I take Amitriptyline 10-30 mg in the evening and its the only thing that has relieved me of the shocking pain I feel and the end of my jaw. At first I felt immense drowsiness, but as my body got used to the drug and that side effect went away. The pain is gone now, I am able to eat, drink and shower without the pain. It's been great. I don't have any side effects.",

Since my neurologist started me on Elavil at 25 mg and finally building up to 50 mg a night (2 months ago) I have only used 2 Imitrex and no more Tylenol with Codeine. This is truly miraculous! The only down side is a 10 lb weight gain. I eat a pretty restricted diet to begin with (no butter or fats, lean meats/fish and no sweets or snack foods). I am trying to further reduce my caloric intake to stop the weight gain. Anyway, I would rather be a little chubby and almost pain free.",

It allows me to slip into sleep if taken about 2 hrs before I go to bed. If I do wake it allows me to get back to sleep easily. The initial dry mouth etc soon went and I am delighted with the ongoing ease with which I can sleep.",

After many years I finally went to a rheumatologist who had me on elavil 40 mg. I take that and my 40 mg or prozac and have no fibromyalgia pain any more. I do however have the side effects of fibro fog, short term memory loss. It's very scary I want to stop all medicine but am afraid. The elavil acts like a prophylactic to complicated migraines for me as well as helping me sleep. Any advice from anyone. I've been on medicine for 30 years now. thanks",

I was shaking, pacing, unable to sleep, talking a mile a minute but making no sense, full of anxiety and rage, unable to eat or keep anything down and in a total panic. My husband took me to the ER when my heart rate went through the roof and I became short of breath. The hospital kept me overnight on a heart monitor and gave me sedatives to calm me down. My doctor wants me to try another medication but I am terrified at the prospect. Honestly, I'd rather be depressed and have migraines than try another anti depressant.

Saying it's has been a wonder drug for me would be an understatement: I will take it and within 30 minutes to 2 hours, I will drift off into a deep, albeit pleasant sleep, but it gets better: I do not feel groggy when waking and wake up naturally at a time that's convenient for me. I have never been more productive in my whole life. You might get some unusual sensations in your head the first few days, but they aren't bothersome in the slightest.",
                    "I was diagnosed with IC after so many real UTIs and some that were not. I felt like I always had a UTI. In November of 2011, I was diagnosed. It was so severe I had the cystoscopy immediately. I started installations and took various medications. Getting on amitriptyline was great until 6 months later I was in day treatment not understanding why my mania and depression were off the chart. The doctors could not stabilize me and I was hospitalized twice for suicidal thoughts and psychosis. Just beware if you have mental illness, this medication may counteract bipolar and other mental health meds!!",
                    "I have tried many OTC sleep aids, to no avail. My doctor started me out at a 10mg dose, so my body would have time to adjust before we started increasing the dosage. I think that this was a good tactic because when I first started out on this medication, I felt zombie-like the following day. He gradually increased the dosage on weekends until a month and a half later I started taking 75mg. I get a full 8 hours sleep with my new 75mg dosage, however I was waking in the middle of the night with the smaller dosages. I'm happy with this medication, and no longer experience the post-sleep-zombification. I think however it deserves only an 8 because it takes me 6 hours after taking it to feel sleepy enough.",

I was diagnosed with pernicious anemia and things got worse. I now take amitriptyline 50mg before bed and two tablets during the day of Lyrica 25mg each tablet. To begin with it didn't seem to be working and I was so thirsty and extremely tired but that gets totally better after a few weeks. My anxiety has disappeared and my sleeping is 99%/100% better. I would recommend these two tablets without a doubt. They have saved me.",

I could only sleep for a maximum of two hours at night before the pain woke me up and it was also pretty grim throughout the day. Worked my way up to 20mg of Amitriptyline (5mg more every few days) and found that after several weeks the pain had reduced greatly. After a few months tried reducing dose to 15mg (due to side effects of tiredness and feeling groggy in the morning) but the pain returned so increased dose back to 20mg and pain has gone again. This drug might not suit everyone but for me the benefits of this medication definitely outweigh the side effects and I shall be continuing to take it.",

Although this is an anti-depressant (I wasn%u2019t depressed) this medicine did boost my moods and made me feel much better throughout the day. It also gave me a very restful nights sleep. This medicine has been claimed to make some people gain weight but I work out at least three to four times a week and have not gained any weight. Works wonders and if you eat healthy and work out you shouldn%u2019t see that drastic weight gain that everyone mentions!",

My symptoms all returned from the diseases....burning feet and toes, pain in knees and hips and back and shoulders... so I started back on my 25mg. The first night I slept through the whole night..first time in months. I'm on day 5 and still have the hung over feeling 24/7, but nothing hurts. My whole body has a tingling sensation which is much more tolerable than pain. However my appetite has doubled, which is a huge worry as weight gain equals more pain in the joints.

Bottom line--it works. It really does. I still have the frequency but the pain is almost completely gone. There have been some days when I feel the pain but I take an extra dose and it helps so much. I do have to say though, it makes me tired, I've gained about 30 pounds and waking up in the morning is harder than ever. Still, it's worth it.",

I left it couple of days and tried 25 mg, let's just say I slept the best I had in a long time. I haven't really noticed any other side affects, maybe this is because citrolopram made me feel so strange this doesn't even scratch the surface.

Enough was enough then as I was having 4 every month, went to see a speicalist then reduced by 80% in 2 and half years. At first you just want to sleep but after 4 weeks you feel better.

It works to a point, and also helps with the chronic insomnia I have experienced for 10 years. However, I don't like taking this drug; I feel like a zombie the next day and it takes a whole day to get over the feeling. However, I like to keep a supply on hand for when the BMS becomes unbearable; I'll actually 'knock myself out' with Endep to obtain relief when my symptoms are really severe.

The doctor kept upping the dose thinking it would help, but of course it just got worse and I felt crazy. It was only a week, but I had to take off work and I just felt miserable. I couldn't eat and lost eight pounds.

The doctor said this isn't possible as it's not a high enough dose but it's worked for me so I'm going to carry on. I do wonder if all I needed was more sleep but whatever it is, it's worked for me. I do plan on increasing the dosage as recommended by my doctor but after 20mg I felt extremely tired so I think I tried it too soon.

I occasionally will get a twinge of pain, here and there, but mostly I've been pain free.",
                    "It was both heartwarming and very frustrating reading all the posts on the amazing results that sufferers of IBS found from this medication. I suffer from a disease called Chronic Radiation Enteritis, which is a possible late effect of having radiation to my abdominal area when I was 12 -- I am now 53. After only 2-3 days of taking the drug, I became extremely anxious, moody, and eventually a general feeling of hopelessness settled on me that was absolutely horrible. I have taken the 30 pills as asked, but not only did it not help my gut, but made me generally miserable for the entire month. So IBS people, I am so happy for you, and pray that something will come along that will help me even half as much as the testimonials I read here.",
                    "It got rid of mine! Tried many meds over the years with various side effects. This is the only one that got rid of my anxiety and depression and gave me no side effects. Not to mention I sleep better on it. I was out of it the first few days until I got used to it and now I can't even tell I am taking something except that I have no anxiety, panic attacks or depression anymore. It was a game changer for me. I feel like a new, normal person again. I highly recommend trying it.",

I tried pain injections, gabapentin and tramadol. Of course I was depressed. My doctor who always listens to me with all her attention said \" I'm going to try Amitriptyline 20mg at bed . I think it will help your depression and your pain. She was 100% right, my leg feels great I stopped the gabapentin and only use the tramadol on a bad weather days. It helps me sleep as well.",
                    "I was having migraines just about daily. Started taking amitriptyline at first 25mg, then 50mg, then 75mg daily. Effects: reduced the frequency and intensity of the migraines both by roughly 70%. Side effects: Full night sleeps. Major appetite gain (literally, a pathological obsession with food) and weight gain became out of control. Reduced to 50 mg amitriptyline daily, managed to lose the 12 lb weight gained. We kept it at 50mg with only moderate increase in appetite and complete night sleeps. Doctor started me on beta-blocker Propanolol 30mg. No side effects. So 50mg amitriptyline  30mg propanolol has resulted to completely stop of migraines (except for possibly a very stressful day which will provoke one).",

At first they were every 3 months for a year then once a month and this last year at age 15 they became two or three times a week! We tried Imitrex nose spray and once the urgent care gave her Fioricet. Nothing worked. She had severe aura, loss of vision then the headache followed by vomiting. Also once she was given Topamax which had too many bad side effects. She will be going to Germany for one year as a foreign exchange student and I was going to have to cancel that if we couldn't find a way to get this under control. I took her to a children's neurologist and she gave her Amitriptyline. It has been an absolute miracle for us!! No side effects & NO more migraines!",

I used 300mg Lyrica and 50mg of amitriptyline, at first, and then increased to 100mg at night, to help with the pain and allow me to get to sleep. I went off the Lyrica after 4 months but have chosen to stay on the amitriptyline. The bonus that I experienced with using amitriptyline was that for the first time in over 20yrs I was able to get more than 4 hours of sleep per night. This has changed my life dramatically as I have energy that I haven't experienced in many years and I wake up fully rested and ready to meet the day.",

There was nothing I could do about it. Apparently, this sort of thing happened to most of the people in my family and on my mothers side. So, I talked to my doctor and he said it sounded like a chemical imbalance, seeing as I wasn't sad about anything and I was healthy, so he asked me to try Amitriptyline. Once I started it, all of my symptoms basically vanished and after 2 years I've fully adjusted to it's affects on my body.",

It solved the problem almost immediately. I was having daily migraines before I took it for about 2 months and didn't have a single one while on it. I then decided to go off of it and to my surprise, I was mostly migraine free for about 6 months after (aside from that time of the month). Then, stress peaked and I found myself with almost daily migraines again. So, I've started taking it again. Bc I take it at night to avoid day drowsiness, it is harder to wake up in the morning. I don't feel any difference in my mood. But I am pain free, hurray.",

No amount of physio or chiropractor visits had helped and I was at a loss as it was genuinely ruining my personal and working life. I was prescribed amitriptyline by my GP due to its muscle relaxant capabilities and ever since then the headaches have been cut by nearly 90%, to the point where I now notice if I have one compared to before where I noticed if I didn't (!). If you suffer from the same, I would suggest talking to your doctor about their use for treating chronic headaches.",
                    "My first migraine came at 16 years of age. Extreme headache pain, optical halos that would move over my eyes for 45 minutes, vomiting, serious aversion to light and smell. At age 32 the migraine events became a daily experience. My doctor prescribed 25 mg of Amitriptyline at bedtime. The headaches disappeared and very rarely does one break through. However, when it does breakthrough all I get is the optical side of the headache which lasts 45 mins. I have tried to wean myself off the medication but after a week the headaches start again. Today I have been on the medication for 29 years and I am very happy that this low dosage of this drug allows me the ability to have a great life, free of that horrible pain and suffering",
                    "I didn't think this medication was working at all, but when I went off of it, I was in more pain than I'd ever experienced before. When I'd been back on it for about ten days, my pain was not gone, but it was certainly more tolerable.",

                    "//What is it?//Depression is one of the most common psychiatric illnesses. According to the World Health Organization, depression is one of the leading health problems in the developed world. It is estimated that one in four women and one in ten men may experience depression at some point in their lives and children can also be affected. There is no concrete data regarding its frequency in Portugal, but estimates refer to values \u200b\u200bof 2 to 3% for men and 5 to 9% for women for the most severe forms of depression and values \u200b\u200bgreater than 20% for more serious forms. mild severity of the disease.//What distinguishes depression from sadness?//Depression is a pathology that can go unnoticed, since its symptoms can be attributed to other causes (such as physical illnesses or stress). It is important to understand that everyone can feel sad, but that these feelings do not last long. On the contrary, depression interferes with daily activities and is associated with intense suffering. As such, depression, although common, is a serious illness. Many people with depression do not seek treatment, even though there are effective ways to treat it.//Symptoms//Depression is a mood disorder that should not be confused with feelings of sadness, which are generally reactive to life events, temporary and, generally speaking, not incompatible with a normal life. Depression can present different forms and degrees of severity and its symptoms can last for a long time, and may include: Feelings of sadness and annoyance;/ Feelings of irritability, tension or agitation;/ Feelings of distress, worry, unfounded fears and insecurity;/ Decreased energy, fatigue and sluggishness;/ Loss of interest and pleasure in daily activities;/ Sleep and sexual desire disturbance;/ Significant weight fluctuations due to appetite disturbances;/ Feelings of guilt and self-devaluation;/ Changes in concentration, memory and reasoning;/ Physical symptoms not due to another illness (headaches, digestive disorders, chronic pain, general malaise);/ Ideas of death and suicide attempts;/  Depression significantly affects work performance, family and school life and all activities of the patient, causing great suffering. In the most severe forms, symptoms may appear without any apparent relation to traumatic life events and last for several months. In milder forms, the intensity of symptoms is lower and allows daily activities to be maintained, although the feeling of fatigue, sadness and disinterest is present, and tends to last for years. In some cases, depression does not manifest itself in the form of sadness, but through symptoms such as fatigue, non-specific pain, a feeling of tightness in the chest, insomnia, digestive disorders (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), which raises the hypothesis that a different disease, making diagnosis difficult and delaying. Depression can be part of bipolar disorder, in which episodes of depression alternate with periods of excitement and euphoria. In the euphoric phases, patients' self-esteem is very high and they lose touch with reality, which can lead to excessive spending and impossible deals.//Causes//In general, depression results from a combination of genetic, biological, environmental and psychological factors: There is a hereditary tendency for some types of depression.;/ Traumatic life events contribute to the onset of depression and can trigger or facilitate depressive episodes.;/ The personality type and the way each individual deals with problems is also associated with a greater or lesser predisposition to depression.;///Treatment//Treatment is important so that depression does not prolong and worsen. If symptoms are not recognized as part of an illness, negative evaluation by others will tend to accentuate poor personal image and reduced self-esteem. Suicide is a possibility that should not be forgotten and treatment is essential to reduce this risk and allow the symptoms of depression to improve. There are several possible treatments for depression, including antidepressant medication and psychotherapy, which should be chosen by a doctor on an individual basis. In general, these treatments must be continued for a significant period of time in order to be effective. Family and social support is an important complement to the treatment selected by the doctor. The prognosis for depression is good and depends essentially on the treatment instituted and adequate control of all risk factors present in each case.//Prevention//Although it is not possible to prevent depression, there are some lifestyle habits you can adopt to maintain your mental health: Find ways to manage stress and improve self-esteem.;/ Take good care of yourself: get enough sleep, eat a healthy diet and exercise regularly.;/ Seek support from family and friends in the most difficult times.;/ Have regular check-ups and consult your doctor if you are not feeling well.;/ Seek help if you feel depressed; don't wait, as this could make things worse.;/ American Psychological Association, 2013 Support Association for Depressive and Manic-Depressive Patients (ADEB), 2013 Gon\u00e7alves, B et al., Prevalence and diagnosis of depression in general and family medicine, Rev Port Clin Geral 2004;20:13-27 G.E.

Regardless, it is essential to identify the symptoms of this mental illness and seek help. Antidepressants are medications used to treat depression, but also other psychological conditions.

                    "//What is it?//Headache and migraine are different entities. Migraine is one of the most common and well characterized, but there are 14 broad categories that can be subdivided into more than 200 different forms. Migraine itself has about 20 different genres. In general, headaches are divided into two large groups: primary and secondary. Primary illnesses correspond to a disease, not reflecting other health problems and represent around 90% of the total. Secondary symptoms are symptoms of diseases of the nervous system or other organs of the human body. They can occur in cases of flu, alcohol poisoning or withdrawal, minor head trauma, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels) or a high blood pressure crisis. Migraine is a primary headache in which very intense episodes of pain occur interspersed with periods without symptoms. In general, it begins between the ages of 15 and 40, but it can appear in childhood or shortly after the first menstruation. If it appears for the first time after the age of 45, other causes must be excluded. Some of its characteristics are closely associated with the female reproductive cycle: higher prevalence after the first menstruation or during the menstrual period; occasional worsening due to taking birth control pills or hormone therapy; attenuation or disappearance during pregnancy or menopause. Before adolescence, migraines affect boys and girls equally. From then on, it is two to three times more common in females. It is estimated that 8% to 15% of individuals living in Western countries (including Portugal) suffer from this problem. The fact of reaching people in the productive phase implies large economic, social and family costs.//Symptoms//It appears recurrently, several times throughout life, but always with completely free intervals. If it occurs every day, it is probably overuse of painkillers or other medications. Drug abuse can convert a migraine into a chronic daily headache. There are people who preferably appear on the weekend. These crises can be precipitated by changes in sleep schedule, failure to eat breakfast, reduced stress or alcohol abuse. In these cases, it is important to consider a lifestyle change over the weekend. The symptoms are intense and often prevent work or study. The pain tends to be throbbing, worsening with physical exertion or head movements. In general, it affects only one side of the head, and is accompanied by nausea, vomiting, intolerance to light, noise and some smells. It is not mandatory that all of these elements are present simultaneously. And they can occur twice a week or just a few throughout a lifetime. During attacks, people seek a dark, quiet place to rest or fall asleep. An episode can last from a few hours to three days. Between attacks, there are usually no complaints. Some types of migraines may have more complex symptoms (with aura). These forms are less common, affecting around 15% of people with this problem, and include transient neurological symptoms, originating attributable to certain areas of the brain. The other signs are identical to those of migraine without aura. The most common auras are temporary vision disorders, in the form of loss of vision on one side of the visual field, blurred images, perception of bright points, geometric figures or bright zigzags. Other auras can be translated as tingling or numbness on one side of the face or one of the hands. There are people who have difficulty speaking or even temporary paralysis of their limbs, usually only on one side of the body. These changes last about 10 to 30 minutes and precede the pain. In children, migraines tend to be bilateral, less intense and of shorter duration. Vomiting and dark circles can be exuberant. Disturbances in sleep and meal schedules are common precipitating factors. Treating these crises is easier than in adults. Sleep usually gives good results. At these ages, the occipital location is not normal and, when present, requires a medical consultation. Likewise, the presence of headaches with morning vomiting or other unusual symptoms in very young children should be seen by a healthcare professional.//Causes//It is caused by a combination of brain processes: excitation/depression of cells, dilation of arteries and release of chemicals. People with migraine are more sensitive to certain stimuli, environmental or from their own body, that can trigger these brain processes. It is also thought that there is some genetic susceptibility. Some individuals can identify the signs of their attacks. The most common are cheese, chocolate, strawberries, seafood, wine, artificial sauces, changes in sleep patterns, stress, menstruation, fasting, physical exercise, and minor trauma. Others cannot identify them at all. People who drink coffee regularly may experience headaches when they stop this habit.//Diagnosis//The key to diagnosis lies in the clinical history, physical and neurological examination. Observation of the fundus is a very important part of these procedures. In some cases, it may be necessary to resort to computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to exclude other diseases.//Treatment//Migraines have no cure but can be controlled. There are medications and behaviors that can reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks. Symptomatic treatment, during acute periods, involves resting in a quiet, dark place. Pressure or cold can be applied to the area of \u200b\u200bpain. At this stage, analgesics, anti-inflammatories, antiemetics and triptans are very useful.//Prevention//People with migraines should create calendars that allow them to identify their symptoms and assess their impact on their quality of life. The first step in prevention is to identify and eliminate precipitating factors, whenever possible. In some cases, it is necessary to use daily medication to reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks, but there are no drugs specifically developed for their prevention. However, there are some drugs used in other contexts that have proven to be effective, such as beta-blockers, antidepressants or antiepileptics, and these should always be prescribed by a doctor.

I decided to cut the pill in half, take it at night and now I have joint pains along with other symptoms. My worst day yet, I just didn't feel right all day; felt confused, anxious to drive to work. Stopped taking the drug that day and one day later I feel like myself again. Symptoms fading; will ask doc for diff drug.",
                    "Have been taking Amlodipine for 4 days now. After first day felt fine, second day had a panic attack on the train to work, shook me to the core and haven't felt right since. Fluttering heartbeat, feeling nervous and anxious for no reason, feeling like I'm not totally in my body or in the moment. Woke up at 4am and had a mild panic attack and couldn't sleep for another hour. Ringing in ears and tingling fingers and toes. Taking this with perindopril combi 5mg, have NEVER had any adverse reaction to previous blood pressure medication. I'm so scared to keep taking this medication, thought I was imagining things until I researched and found many, many others similar and worse reactions. Have scheduled doctor appointment to change meds. I'm 20&F",

Tried every thing and desperate to the point of having a Pacemaker. Thanks to a pharmacy that let me into some information about Amlodipine. MY heart rate is steady at 68-78, blood pressure 120/68.

After 4 weeks, bouts of insomnia started creeping in, nausea (to the point that my stomach wanted to really vomit), and my hands and feet started to sweat profusely. After a week, I started feeling tingling sensations in my hands and feet as well as palpitations. I fainted at work about 1.5 weeks ago, doctors couldn't find out what the problem was. I almost fainted last Sunday, and again doctors couldn't see what the problem was, though maybe it could be side effects of the amlodipine. The cardiologist shifted me over to enalapril 10mg instead. Been off the drug for 3 days now, but still feel side effects. When do they disappear?",

Now bad itch and bumpy blistery looking rash. For the past month, I'm exhausted, dull nagging headache, general malaise, shortness of breath, lethargic, gained 5 lbs. I used to power walk with weights 3 miles 5X week, but stopped due to shortness of breath. When I ride my bike I get winded to the point of dizziness and nausea. Glad I found these reviews I think it's the Blood pressure medicines.",

At one stage; I gained 5 kilograms as I retained water. I just don't know what to do. I would rather not be taking any drugs but I feel I have no choice. I go to the gym 3 times a day and made life style changes to lower my blood pressure but when this did not work; I was put on the drug by my doctor. I am looking at other options.",

I thought it was just a matter of getting older. I also have gained weight on this medication. I've been dieting and I'm active, but the weight would not go down. I would get very tired in the afternoon. My doctor increased the medication and I wound up not being able to stand when I got out of bed. I decided to stop taking it for a few days. Almost all the pain went away and the swelling in my feet became less. I'm changing meds asap.",

However, I am feeling very very tired, and my mind is one big fog that I noticed so clearly in meditation how unclear my mind is. I have to get off. I trust my cardio who says he has seen little or no reported side effects on such a low dose, but not for me.

As I got used to the Med, the feelings decreased but I still have that Panic feeling once in a while. After a week my Right leg and ankle became swollen, but not my Left leg? I also experience Nausea with this medicine and a loss of Appetite, which, in part, is good as I'm overweight. However I could do without the Nausea. I always take this Medication with food and my other Meds in the morning. It has dropped my High Blood Pressure from 200/97 to 140/83. This is the only good thing about this medicine. I can't put my finger on it, but I just don't feel right since I've been taking Amlodipine 5 mg. ",

After about a month of taking 5 mg/day of amlodipine, which was initially prescribed for borderline hypertension (140/90), my headaches went to once/week, and they were all treatable with one 1 Excedrin. I only need Imitrex now once every two months instead of of two or three times a week. What a difference in my life! I don't understand why this medication isn't used more frequently for migraine sufferers.",

Amlodipine caused hives, heart palpitations, swelling and weight gain. However, I have to admit that the combination of both pills was effective in bringing my blood pressure down in 2 weeks. I just couldn't tolerate the side effects. Doctor changed script to 180mg Diltiazem CD. Hopefully this will work.",
                    "I have been taking Amlodipine (Norvasc) for about 2 months. Norvasc (Amlodipine Besylate 5 mg) did lower my blood pressure from 150's over 80's to 120's over 60's. That's great.  Problem is with side effects every day. Intestinal cramps, diarrhea, gas. Begins about 5 hours after I take the pill. Stomach (intestines ?) roll constantly for about 3 hours.  I am going to try splitting the pills in half and see if lower dosage stops the side effects. If not, I guess I'll go back to the doctor and try something else for blood pressure. It seems like all of these blood pressure pills have side effects of one kind or another.",

I was having some attacks of gout and thought that was it that causing the problem but the pain and swelling went on long after the gout. I got to where I could hardly walk. My wife noticed that swelling was a side effect. I quit the medicine immediately, and noticed a huge difference within a week. I have been off the medicine for 3-4 mths, but still have some problems with swelling and pain although not near as severe. I have also have developed knots in my calves while on this medicine that has not went away since stopping the medicine. I fear I have irreversible damage.",

Told Dr I was healthy running 1/2 marathons and now can barely run 3km due to above. Told Dr I just didn't feel right. Told benefits outweighed side effects. August went to Urgent Care & asked them to do Lyme test cuz of aches and neck pain - negative. Thanks giving week elbow pain unbearable, trouble walking downstairs knees hurt, knees and thighs swollen. Called Dr. Went off. Immediately fog lifted, still anxious as I don't feel right. Joints still achy & knees hurt. Back/neck trouble past two weeks hoping they'll go away and I'll feel better. HATE amlodipine. Started on HCT, see Dr next week.",

Doctor says give it a little while longer. One day I almost passed out, got light headed and felt like I was in another dimension! Doctor says he can't say for sure it was a side effect of this medicine. I will keep trying it for awhile longer.",

I feel as if I have my life back now.",

I read some posts and decided to stop taking it and I felt better in a few days and my knee doesn't hurt. 5mgs of poison every morning......",

Then, I went up to 10mg per doctor's orders, and the headaches stopped. If this keeps up, yes, this is a miracle. Have suffered with migraines almost 40 years--and have tried lots of meds including Imitrex which was a lifesaver and Botox which helped initially but not for very long. As for side effects, no swelling--maybe a little fatigue. I was on loads of Excredrin and probably 3 Imitrex a week. So glad to be able to get off these meds. Still keeping them around just in case but am very encouraged with amlodipine.",

After about three weeks I noticed redness, dry and dark circles under my eyes, had feelings of depression, hallucinations, insomnia, irritability, and a racing heart beat at times. My fiance told me that on one occasion while sleeping on my back I stopped breathing for a few seconds. I have vivid dreams and wake up with brief sleep paralysis. I also have been itching a small dry patch of skin on my back. I'm 37, and work out 2-3 times per week. My BP is usually around 120-30/90. I'm going to have my doctor switch me to another med.",

My BP is 125/72, but I have put on 60 lbs in the last two years. I do suffer from Graves Disease of the Thyroid. This is not related to the medication. The point is, when I got down to 114 lbs, I actually stopped taking Amlodipine; my bp was normal. The weight loss was due to Graves Disease ( Hyperthyroidism). Then I had radiation treatment, gained weight now my bp is elevated again. I now started taking Amlodipine Besylate again, same dose since 2011. The only side effect I noticed is it makes me somewhat hypervigilant, but nothing to be concerned about.",

My mother has it and she has kidney failure and my grandmother died from a stroke. Both were caused from it being uncontrolled. I found out when I went to visit the dentist that it was high. I went to the hospital because of chest pains and it was 141/101 which was extremely high for my age and my weight size. This medicine has lowered it to 126/76 which is great for me!! I wish the bottom number would go to 70 but I am about to speed up the exercising to help out. I take it at night because it MAKES ME SLEEPY, which is something that I don't mind.",

Then my doctor said take 5mg norvasc like before but add 2mg coversyl - that made me have palpitations very tired fatigued and out of breath, headaches and felt like someone is strangling me and felt anxious. Basically couldn't function so I went back to just 5mg and going to see cardiologist. I feel like a guinea pig trying different medicine with no results. I'm still tired out of breath sometimes laboured breathing BP is still high, get cramps in stomach, I must have gone to hospital and my doctor so many times.",

I was prescribed 5 mg., and the first day of taking it, and every day since, I have had major heart palpitations. Not a nice feeling. I also feel WIRED. So far, not liking this medication at all! Why do medications, to treat illness and symptoms, bring an entirely new set of problems?",

It's worked wonders for my quality of life.",
                    "Did nothing for Bp but does cause ankles and feet to swell a lot. Thought I gained weight (happily) nope, it was the fluid retention caused by amlodipine. That's not great because fluid retention can make Bp rise.",

My balance is terrible and recently had two bad falls in a week! I have constant ringing in my ears, cramp in my feet at night, feel tired and have to have a sleep most afternoons, Swollen feet and ankles. Researching the side effects of Amlodipine has made me realise all these symptoms are probably due to this awful drug. Will be seeing doc next week to get it changed",

Mixture of white coat syndrome and an IBS episode I was in the middle of, plus whatever else is the cause of my HBP. Dr said go to the ER! I declined. He did an EKG and all was fine. Dr prescribed 10mg of Norvasc and Coreq. I went home and took my bp it was 170/100. Took 5mg of Norvasc and 50mg Toprol I was already on. BP came down to about 140/95 in about 12 hours. Pain by my pancreas for 12 hours a few days into it. Feet and ankles swollen like balloons. 4/14 on 10mg my bp averages around 133/86, feet still swollen by night. Feeling A LOT better.

However, the side effects were terrible: frequent urination, constipation followed 10 minutes later by uncontrollable diarrhea, blurry vision, cough, fatigue and sleepiness. When I would go out, I would not take the medicine. I found out that Amlodipine was causing my problems when I took an airplane flight. I did not take it because I did not want to go to the bathroom when we were flying. I didn't take it for 2 days and almost all my symptoms disappeared. I took it again and all the problems came back so I stopped taking it. O was put on Clonidine and that did not lower my BP but gave me a cough and sleepiness.",

Now, right then and there the doc should have taken me off Norvasc, because it is contraindicated for AS.  I told my PA, who took me off & put me me on lisinopril. Murmur went away. (Well, until a few years later when I was put on cipro/flagyl and had a horrible time with the flagyl.)...Saturday I asked the doc if he could hear a murmur...NOPE! Very early Thursday morning as I was being admitted, I now had a murmur. Not as loud as the previous one. Hopefully, after I recover from the current nonsense, I will be able to rid myself of this murmur as well.  I hope.",

I went to urgent care and they suggested I go to the ER. At the ER they did a lot of tests and couldn't find anything. 48 hours after taking amlodipine blood pressure still hasn't gone down.

Like all meds, this will effect everyone differently, but from what the Dr's tell me, it's the one with the least number of side effects. The following are things I have noticed since taking this drug. 1. My legs seem a little weaker than before but have not noticed significant swelling which is one of the main side effects. 2. At night I have discomfort in my legs generally the thigh muscles. Not pain but discomfort like I ran on a treadmill for an hour. Nothing that keeps me awake. Overall, it works for me.",

I started off on Metoprolol (I think its called) it helped lower my BP a little going down to 135/85 but the side effects were HORRIBLE.

I lost 8 pounds of water over the next few days and low and behold, blood pressure went way, way down! I hit as los as 109/59, which prompted me to stop another BP med, losartan, which turned out to have been causing my chronic leg pain! I am now only on chlorthalidone, with a bp a bit high at 135/82, not sure which way to go next. Maybe try cutting salt.

I had daily headaches. Was on high doses of daily tryptans. A year ago, my bp started to rise (150/90 vs 110/60) and I got worried bc tryptans are generally contraindicated in patients with high bp. Ran into several case report publications suggesting almost miracle results after migraine pts were given amlodipine. My pcp cooperated. I stated very slowly with 2.5 mg a day and felt positive results right away.",

I hope others suffering will read this, because within 24 hours of stopping this med, I'm already feeling much better. Sadly I will likely have some permanent damage, but at least I stopped before I became worse. It's a CRIME that patients are ignored when they complain about side effects. Big Pharma take notice!",

It seemed to do a good job of lowering my BP... however, as many of the comments above it makes you feel zombie-like. When I attempted to go to sleep I laid in bed for 8 hours straight without ever falling asleep. There was one moment when I almost fell asleep, however, I ended up jumping up and gasping for air... I do believe I will not be taking this drug the next day.. or ever again!

I had a strongly pounding heartbeat for a few days the first week, which went away. I was also tired the first couple of days and my legs felt heavy on my daily 2-mile walk -- that also resolved by the second week.

I discovered other people who had experienced smelling smoke and traced it to a chemical/ mineral (?) Di-calcium chloride, or phrosphoric acid or magnesium phosphate. .. there are many names for this compound.. It keeps product from seperating like; nut butters, orange juice , frappicinos, over the counter drugs ,liquid vitamins ( sublingual B12 my experience).

Well, to my amazement, my numbers were down to the 120/80 range almost immediately, with zero side effects! And that I get it free at the local Public, only makes it better.

With no verbal warning from the Doctor or the pharmacy, after three days I stopped sleeping. I went for a 40 hour period with two hours of sleep. When I was awake, I had absolutely no energy or enthusiasm. I had no idea what was happening. I reached out to the Doctor via email for help, She actually suggested I might need psychiatric help.

I told my doctor that I had quit because I was unhappy, and he said that he was very happy and that I needed help for moderately high blood pressure. I then suggested that HE try amlodipine. He once had me use ezetrol , and I stupidly continued for almost a year before realising I had become severely affected. I now give new meds a trial period and tell the doc if I am not amused.",

During this time anxiety is slowly creeping in it was getting a little worse everyday until it was a constant feeling. Pressure in my head constantly and full blown panic attacks by month 4.

It took about 2-3 weeks for the headaches and upset stomach to stop completely.It took about 6 weeks for my blood pressure to be in the normal range. No side effects currently. The only thing I'm not happy about is I haven't been able to lose weight while on Amlodipine, even though I'm strictly dieting. Prior to starting this drug, I had been losing nicely.

Before taking this med, I was generally having very deep and unconscious type night sleeps and regular migraines in the base of skull (occipital nerves) after awakening in the morning. Whenever I was very tired and feeling very sleepy before going to bed in the night, I woke up in the mid night due to severe pain in the base of the skull. Whenever I suddenly awaken from deep sleep due to external interruption, I found myself a bit confused for some time. With amlodipine, I have moderate depth of sleep and don't get confused if suddenly awaken / interrupted from sleep. No migraines so far.",

The edema was so bad that bending my ankles was uncomfortable. Upon stopping the drug, I can once again see my ankles and the veins of my feet. I cannot believe that a drug that produces one of the side effects of congestive heart failure can be a good drug. I am never taking it again.",

I was getting about one headache a week for the first couple weeks at 10 mg, now I think it's been two weeks since my last one. No side effects for me. It's a miracle.

The past few weeks have been worse than a nightmare for me - my anxiety has reached severe levels, the pains in my upper chest, shoulders, and forearms was becoming unbearable, I've been continuously nauseous for nearly 2 weeks now, had high-pitched ringing in my ears, and was completely depersonalized.",
                    "This medication changed my life! At age 60 I thought I would go to my grave with a migraine. This started at around age 16. Then being diagnosed with high blood preasure I ran the gambet of a few different drugs to figure out what worked best for me. In the fine tuning stages of treatment I was prescribed Amlodipine in combination with another drug. Life changing!!!!! I had migraines at least 3 times a week and suddenly I realised it had been 2 weeks, then 3 then a month, then 2......no headache! Why oh why did it take all this time to figure it out! So very Happy with my new life!!!!!!!",
                    "I began taking these tablets a week ago. My face and neck has has been flushing red. I have been feeling uncomfortable heat in my feet, my skin has been extraordinarily dry and I have been feeling sluggish and sick. I was prescribed Amlodopin because the Losartan I was taking gave me a chronic cough.",
                    "I hate Norvasc! It made my blood pressure worse. I was always borderline with my blood pressure. It didn't help that I work nights and my diet isn't the greatest. My doctor wanted to me try this medication for a month to see if my blood pressure would lower. Within a week my blood pressure which usually hovers at 140/80 with a pulse of 80 shot to a ridiculous 200/98 with a pulse of 98. My blood pressure will always spike around the evening. My anxiety worsened and I got headaches. This medication does not work for me and I am not going to be tricked into staying on it longer.",
                    "Wanted to post my experience. I started on amlodipine, 10mg, in January 2011. Everything was fine and my bp was 115/78. Sometime late 2012, I started experiencing lightheadedness, foot and ankle swelling, my asthma worsened and I had severe pelvic pain. Spent three months and quite a bit of my deductible trying to figure out why. A friend suggested it may be time to change my bp medication. I went to the doctor and she told me the formula had been changed for generic amlodipine late last year and many of her patients had experienced problems with it, had to discontinue the medication. I've been on Metoprolol and I haven't had any issues so far.",
                    "Many won't read this far into the coments, but I found Amlodepine to work well by taking it in a different way. I, too, had some strong side effects on (1) 10mg or (2) 5mg daily. Swollen ankles were worst,, but nausea, tiredness, etc were culprits too. I asked my doctor what the smallest pill (mg) was. It is 2.5. I started using 4 in a day, but spreading them out. In other words, a 2.5 pill at 7am, 12pm, 5pm and 10pm (or approximate times spread out). I now actually only take 3 pills (7.5 total), but still spread them out. For me, it still has the right effect of bringing down the BP, but the side effects are dispersed out so they are MUCH more manageable. I sit in a soft chair or use the recliner to reduce ankle swelling.",
                    "I recently started this medication at the 5mg level and have now gone up to 10mg. I feel better and don't feel like I am not so distressed when doing small chores like before. Only issue I have had is I am so tired.",
                    "I've only been on Norvasc 10mg for about a week. It has lowered my blood pressure and so far no side effects. Will keep on monitoring it.",
                    "Having started on 5mg of the medicine and finding benefit, my doctor moved me to 10mg once a day, then the changes started. My condition became serious with continual coughs and no sleep, my blood pressure was very good at 137/68 but my quality of life was useless.",
                    "I have been on amlodipine for nearly a year. Doctor said to avoid sodium and exercise/diet. I take 2 x 5mg pills in the morning and 1 x 5mg at night. Blood Pressure has done very well. As long as I stay away from sodium, I have no swelling in ankles/feet. Heart doctor said to stay away from chips, bacon and soup. I am 74 and do not exercise regularly I need to lose about 30lbs. I am so tired, how do I exercise? It takes all I have to make something to eat. The one side effect I noticed was 'skin rash/itch'. I have this scalp problem, with little pimples that I scratch. Dermatologist said dermatitis; I use prescription shampoo. Scalp problem started just after starting the generic amlodipine. ",
                    "Started amlodipine after stopping lisinopril due to throat swelling after taking for one year. Amlodipine took 5 days to begin working on lowering my blood pressure after introduction. My dosage was 5mg once daily. It didn't lower my blood pressure very much. Went from 165/111 to 145/100 in 5 days.  Side effects included: Very sore arms and legs Lower legs felt sore and full of blood (heavy) Facial flishing Profucious sweating from feet and hands Headaches Notable lack of energy and sleepiness , nervousness  I recommend using this drug ONLY if it's your last resort and you don't need an immediate drop in blood pressure. Remember everyone is different this may work well for you. Long walks seemed to help with the sore legs.",
                    "Using 5mg since 8 months. It prevents me from severe pain in the base of my skull (perhaps occipital neuralgia). The important point to be noted in my case is the timing of taking the medicine. I mostly get the pains in early morning while in deep sleep. Before taking this med, I would wake up in severe pain that would last until I take a painkiller. Than I started taking amlodipine 5mg at night. However, I need to take the medicine about 10~12 hours before the onset of the pain. If I am late, I would get the pain on the same time in morning in spite of taking the pill. However, in such case, the pain gradually diminishes as the time approaches to the required time.   Looking forward to hear from those suffering from similar conditions.",
                    "Been using amlodipine for a month. Has not really lowered blood pressure. I'm generally in good health except for elevated blood pressure. Amlodipine has had many bad side effects. Fatigue during workouts, muscle weakness, insomnia, and complete loss of libido. Wife very disappointed. Going back to my doctor this week for different medication.",
                    "Last summer I was in the hospital because of a stroke. To stabilize my blood pressure my Dr. used 4 different pills including amlodipine. I once got migraines once a month or more. I haven't had one in 11months. I think they're gone and I DON'T MISS THEM AT ALL. Thank you for amlodipine.",
                    "One month used of amlodipine",
                    "I have been hypertensive for a little over 12 years. I have tried many meds to reduce it. All worked, but they also had negative side effects. After chatting with my Pharmacist and Doctor we started me on Amlodipine 10mg daily. This was maybe two years ago. After losing weight and starting to exercise more, I am now down to 2.5mg daily and no negative side effects. I recently started to supplement magnesium in the morning and evening and my pressures have further reduced.",
                    "I have been taking Norvasc for probably 30 years. The first 20, the drug worked to lower my blood pressure well. In the last ten years, I've been plagued with scorching legs. It has literally ruined my life. Doctors never even had a clue and I never thought it was Norvasc that was hurting me until I had trouble a week ago getting the prescription filled I was out of for 4 days. On the 4th day without taking it, my legs were feeling pretty good. I got my prescription refilled took the pill and the next day, I was back to debilitating pain. I haven't taken it since. I am now feeling pressure in my head as I've always been prone to migraine headaches. I never got one after I started taking Norvasc. I think I'll take the migraines.",
                    "I was prescribed 10 mg Amlodopine for high blood pressure. Relieves the blood pressure but I get terrible headaches since taking Amlodopine, no matter if I take in the morning or in the evening. Still the excruciating headaches and cannot sleep. What to do?",
                    "Without taking this my blood pressure was 156 over something. After two weeks it was 132 over something. I'll take the side effects, a little light headedness, over a stroke any day. No swelling to report and I've been on this for about 20 days.",
                    "Norvasc has lowered my blood pressure from 160/102 to about 110/80 on 10 mg. The side effects are debilitating for me. I have horrible chest pains and unable to do much without exhaustion. I have lost so much weight due to lack of appetite. Dr. does not want to take me off because I have difficulty finding anything that lowers my blood pressure. I am also on Atenolol.",
                    "I was prescribed 10mg Amlodipine to treat Coronary artery spasm after 2 myocardial infarctions at 35 and 37 years. First came nausea, which lasted about 2 weeks, however, the chronic insomnia and horrific, extremely vivid nightmares began almost immediately and are still persisting even though I stopped taking it about 6 days ago. Another side effect I experienced was extremely stiff and sore feet - I thought I had developed painful arthritis overnight and walking on them was horrible. I also experienced extreme fatigue all day every day, making it near impossible to care for my three children at home who are all under school age. I thought I was losing my mind. Feeling a bit better every day. This was a very scary experience for me.",
                    "I am a mid-fifty male post open heart (4 mths ago) and stents (3 weeks ago).I have been on Norvasc 5 mg for about 10 days now as the predecessor drug's side effect were horrible. It has been very effective at lowering my BP (117/75) the side effects are still concerning. Dizzy, tired, maybe some depression & anxiety, slight problem with deep breathing and week muscles. Although I can function normally the day-to-day functions are an effort so I push through. The mornings (when I take Norvasc) are not as good as the afternoon when I feel better. I believe the side effects are getting better but am unsure. What I want is to be normal again and active. They say it takes a few week for the body to adjust. I'll give it its due course.",
                    "FYI -- I tried various high blood pressure meds, most with some serious side effects. Amlodipine was helping better than any previous, but had some nausea, swelling, dizziness, etc. Decided to try taking 2.5 pill 4-four times daily instead of one 10mg pill. Made a huge difference. Seems my body can handle everything with only slight side effects by doing this. My doctor said he'd never had a patient do it this way, but due to my good effect, has now put several patients on Amlodipine in this manner. By breaking it up, the body seems to be able to tolerate it well. May not work for everyone, but for me it was such a blessing.",
                    "Taking for three weeks. Lowered the bottom number of my blood pressure almost too low. Average now is 116/63. Caused some dizziness, light-headed and little shortness of breath. Slowed pulse down also. Good medicine but don't want dizziness. ",
                    "Both my husband and I have been taking Norvasc for a period of approximately 6 months. It has lowered both of our blood pressures into the normal range and we have suffered absolutely no side effects.",
                    "Took 2.5 mg for a year with not recognizing any side effect. At annual checkup blood pressure was over 200--but I had just taken a bad fall and had big time bruises and a hematoma (excuse bad spelling) on hip. Dr bumped up amlodipine to 10 mg. Within 10 days noticed significant swelling of ankles and feet and experienced pain on the inside of legs (the entire length of the leg). Cut dose to 5 mg and pain gone next day, swelling reduced. Two weeks on 5 mg and blood pressure 135/70. Another week on 5 mg and 130/69. Feet and ankles still somewhat swollen, frequent leg cramps every night. Considering going back to 2.5 mg.",
                    "My Dr. Prescribed amlodipine I've only been on it a week. Now having terrible stomach pain & I mean unbearable. Red rash flare ups on my arms. Taking myself off of the crap.",
                    "LOVE this medication! After having been on Micardis for five years, the affordability is a welcome change, and it works just as well with fewer side-effects!",
                    "Norvasc worked fantastic for about a year then I started experiencing muscle twitching and cramps that got worse and worse. I have been trying to switch to another medicine and haven't had much luck. I pray I can find a medicine as good as Norvasc. I can tell you that numerous blood tests have been run and while this medicine MAY cause cramps, my blood sugar, cholesterol, liver panel, metabolic panel, CBC, creatinine, etc. are all perfect! I have a lot of faith to the fact that this medicine will not harm you other than possibly muscle cramps or fluid retention. I experienced no fluid retention BUT I exercise.",
                    "47 yo male tried Ramipril first which was great at reducing blood pressure but also turned me into a zombie, foggy head and constantly tired and I believe bad interaction with Lipitor.  Have been taking Amlodipine for 2 months and the side-effects are way less but not totally gone. Have had trouble sleeping, some tiredness, constant numbness/tingling in left hand and weight gain (assuming water gain?). Trying to tough it out but may end up not taking BP meds at all. (Was in the 140/90ish range when starting the drugs).The side effects do not make me feel right.",
                    "swelling feet ankles breathing problems chest pain .... bad medicine",
                    "I was switched to 10mg amlodipine after suffering side effects with a dose increase of Lisinopril. I tried the medication for about two weeks and developed severe, painful edema in my feet and ankles. Moreover, my blood pressure remained greater than 135/85, even though I was taking the maximum dosage.",
                    "I have had high blood pressure for over five years and this includes treatment with numerous medication and supplements. Two months ago I was prescribed Amlodipine for high blood pressure, I had headaches and dizziness with being physically tired. Today I do not have the headaches, but occasionally experience dizziness if I move fast, or get up from setting, or lying down. Usually only last a few minutes at a time, but I must sincerely and happily let those who read these comments that this medication works. My blood pressure even on other medications such as Atenolol did not work as good, my blood pressure was normally between 140 and 150 everyday. Today it is hitting below 120/70 regularly and usually in the low 100/60 or lower.",
                    "On Norvasc since 1992. Started with 5 mg. After kidney cancer, one kidney removed in 2004, blood pressure slowly rose, now I take 10 mg once a day. Also tried all generic brands, but the filler in all maintenance medication causes an Adverse Reaction, called Myalgia. Pain in the groin and upper legs, so must stay on Name Brand, Norvasc. Now Kidney Disease, Stage 4, blood pressure often rises, usually because I get off my strict diet. It will go up to 200/100, but generally it stays 134/73. I am 76 years old, so that 134/76 is a perfect blood pressure for my age, especially with Kidney Disease. Norvasc has been a life saver for me.",
                    "I have BP problems. Having hard time finding a med to control it. Was given a beta blocker that caused a heart attack put me in hospital. Put me on Norvacs 5mg twice a day. Was on 1 and 1/2 weeks I had severe headaches. Tremors,blurred vision, stomach pains, burning in my legs, had red burning spots form on my lower abdomen then blisters. Off med and will never take Norvasc again. Now on Losartin and Clondine,doing fair with BP. & no side effects.",
                    "I've taken both Norvasc and it's generic, amlodopine. I am taking amlodopine 10mg now. No side effects, just does what it does, and I love it. Just wish it did all of it. It only brings it down to around 160/90- down from 230/150. Too bad I can't just take more. Everything we've tried to add, headaches and headaches, and aches and pains.  I don't get symptoms from from my BP. More like a rush, if anything. Why would take something that makes me feel that way? Quality of life, you know? I'm a 50 year old woman in reasonably decent health but for this",
                    "I've been taking 2.5mg for a month with great results and no side effects, until the weather got colder so the doctor increased dose to 5mg, partly because he wanted a better result to my high blood pressure as well. The sudden increase has caused severe sleepiness and a tight chest. I cut back to 3mg for now to ease into it and will increase to 5mg if/when the side effects decrease. I believe in caution and I know my doctor takes the same stand.",
                    "My blood pressure went up to 220/150 and I was placed on Norvasc 10mg and Diovan 80mg. Been on this for over a year now and my blood pressure is currently 120/80 and I have had no side effects other than swelling on the lower leg which steady brisk walking has handled. The combination worked very well for me.",
                    "Good.",
                    "Terrible medication. Gave me headaches, frightening dizzy spells and didn't work well. Blood Pressure kept spiking to 155/90. Switched to Lisinopril and blood pressure was stable at 115/65.",
                    "Had blood pressure issue. Another drug that I was put on didnt work. Doc suggested Amlodipine which is the generic for Norvasc. First day my bp was something like 145/90. Took new med on the afternoon late, and within 2 hours it was down to 117/70. I thought that was fast because Doc said to give it a few days to start working. Second day I noticed myself becoming edgy and almost scared. Anxiety was started creeping in. Started feeling tingling infingers and feet. The third day the tingling turned to slight numbness in those areas. I also got severe headaches to the back of my head. Legs and arms felt very weak as well. Its almost day for and im having water retention. Im coming off of this drug.",

After takin amlodipine within 24hours my B.P. went down to 136/78 and has stayed that way for the last 3 months.",
                    "-Not a very good one. Complained to Drs . About dry mouth,diarrhea, and numbness in toes. Tingling at tip of fingers. They dismissed it as nothing. The numbness has progressed to my foot,legs,hands,arms. Have trouble walking without a cane because I loose my balance and have fallen many times.",
                    "This drug has worked very fast in reducing high blood pressure. I was on lisinopril but developed hives, swollen lips and tongue so doctor switched me to Norvasc. I seem to still have occasional hives but not as severe and may be triggered by heat. AZ this time of year is quite hot.",
                    "I've been taking almost 3.5 yrs. side effects: restless leg, itching, dry mouth, rash, tired, insomnia, joint pain and overall feeling of something wrong. I stopped taking it and for about two weeks and I've been feeling great. Right away I started to feel more energetic. Sleeping well. Today I took one to see if I should start taking again and now I have itching, restless leg and insomnia. I'm not taking anymore. It's horrible",

No drastic side effects yet, except for slight dizziness, and abdominal pain related to gas (once). I am worried about sexual issues, since there are lots of reports going around saying that Micardis may hamper erectile function. Other reports say exactly the opposite! Will have to test this on a long-time basis. All in all, seems pretty good.",
                    "I suspect causation between Micardis (40mg) and BPPV. I've missed my dose a couple of times, blood pressure rocked up to 140/90's and I felt great the following day. Normally BP is 120/80's on 40mg but I feel like crap with a general level of dizzyness through the day. Sparadoic episodes but this BPPV episode has lasted 6 months now. Worse in morning and means lying down/standing up takes special headmoves to minimise dizzy episode.",
                    "I took Micardis on and off for over two years. It caused me to have leg cramps. It controlled my blood pressure, but I would avoid taking it at times because of the leg cramps. I developed severe hip and leg pains, which I think may have been caused by the Micardis. I have switched to another blood pressure medicine in the last couple of months and I'm hoping the hip and leg pains will continue to subside.",

I've not had any major side effects that I can tell, but recently in the last 1 year when I turned 44, I started to experience insomnia. At first it was for a few days, then weeks. The longest bout of insomnia I had was 5 weeks where I couldn't sleep (tossing/turning) until 5-6am. Thereafter I could sleep for about 2 or 3 hours before I had to get up for work. I've checked some medical websites and apparently telemisartan drugs like Micardis may cause insomnia.",

The initial 40mg went well without any side effects. Blood pressure was consistently 130-140/80-90. A few months ago when I turned 38, during my routine blood pressure checks, I noticed that it was 140-150/90-100 even with the 40mg pill. Monitored this for about 2 weeks and it remained thereabouts. After consulting my doctor, he recommended a higher dosage of 80mg. It worked, and the pressure stabilized at 70-90/120-140. However, I did notice a slight discomfort in my respiratory tract or somewhat a mile heartburn (I think!).",

The leg cramp I assumed was from strain from exercise and the cough from dust due to construction work in the neighborhood. However, after both conditions subsided the symptoms were still there. I checked the post marketing experience for Micardis and these symptoms were adverse signs. Will consult with my physician as the warning says these symptoms should be reported immediately.",

                    "//What is it?//This is an increase in blood pressure above values \u200b\u200bconsidered normal. It occurs when there is excessive pressure of blood on the walls of the arteries during circulation. It can increase at certain times, due to physical or emotional exertion, and it is natural that, after these situations, its values \u200b\u200breturn to normal levels. This condition is only serious and causes health problems when it remains high for months, or when it increases suddenly. It is important to know that tension tends to increase with age. However, hypertension should not be considered normal in the elderly. As a rule, arterial hypertension is considered to be present when the maximum pressure is greater than or equal to 160 mmHge/or the minimum pressure is greater than or equal to 95 mmHge. High blood pressure is associated with coronary heart disease, stroke and heart failure and is the most common modifiable cardiovascular risk factor, which is why its treatment is essential in preventing these pathologies. Cardiovascular diseases are the cause of death for at least 34.1% of the Brazilian population, mainly as a consequence of stroke and coronary disease. It is estimated that the prevalence of high blood pressure in the Portuguese adult population is 42.1%, with only 39.0% of these patients taking antihypertensive drugs and only 11.2% being under control.//Symptoms//In the first few years, it does not cause any symptoms. Over time, blood pressure ends up damaging the blood vessels and the main organs of the body, such as the brain, heart and kidneys, causing headaches, dizziness, tinnitus and increased heart rate. The main diseases associated with high blood pressure are stroke, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, heart and kidney failure.//Causes//Around 90% of cases are related to lifestyle habits. Obesity is one of the important factors. Each pound of fat requires the formation of an additional 1.5 kilometers of small blood vessels to supply the excess adipose tissue. Increased blood pressure is required to pump blood through them. Therefore, being overweight by 20% or more increases the risk of hypertension by five times;;/ Excess salt consumption. It is known that high blood pressure is less frequent in populations where its consumption is low. Our body only needs 1/8 of a teaspoon of salt per day;;/ Tobacco is another cause to consider. Even just one cigarette can increase it for about 30 minutes. A pack-a-day smoker can, through smoking alone, cause an increase in blood pressure for 24 hours;;/ Around 5% to 15% of cases may be related to moderate alcohol consumption. On the other hand, one cup of coffee a day can cause an increase in blood pressure;;/ Physical inactivity and stress are also at its origin;;/ The remaining 10% of high blood pressure cases have organic causes, such as some hormonal changes, kidney or blood vessel diseases.//Diagnosis//It is important to remember that high blood pressure cannot be felt, it must be measured. In order to obtain correct values, it is important to rest in a sitting position for at least five minutes before measuring. You should use the same device and always measure on the same arm. The diagnosis of high blood pressure requires measuring an elevated blood pressure on three separate occasions over a period of a week or more. Once its existence has been confirmed, other tests must also be carried out to help understand its origin and/or the complications associated with it.//Treatment//Treatment depends on the severity of the condition. For example, people with moderate hypertension can control it by simply changing some lifestyle habits, such as reducing salt and alcohol intake, controlling their weight, exercising regularly and stopping smoking. There are several medications available for the treatment of high blood pressure that can be used alone or in combination. It is up to the doctor to decide which is the best treatment for each situation.//Prevention//Since most cases have their origin in lifestyle, it is important that it is healthy. All the recommendations mentioned in the treatment prevent the onset of this disease.

The first month was great then on October 21st my resting heart rate went from 61 to 70 and when I walk it suddenly goes to 140 for no reason. I work out 6 days a week and it doesn't make any sence to me. Going back to my doctor tomorrow to figure it out. I just don't see why all of a sudden it would make things 10x worse. I didn't take it today to see if it would help. I was able to exersice without my heart rate sky rocketing to ridiculous numbers. This is the first medication like this I have ever taken. Plus the weight gain is ridiculous. I lost 15 lbs before starting this medication and less then 2 months I gained it all back.",

I take 25mg. in the morning, and 25mg. about 11 hours later. The medicine has stopped my PVC's, and also slows down my heart rate.

He sent me home to suffer with it. A couple of weeks ago I made an appt. with the clinic and the most wonderful nurse practioner started me on Metoprolol 25 mg/2x daily and \"I FEEL GREAT!\" I couldn't believe how my heart calmed down, my anxiety was relieved, I SLEPT BETTER b/c it stopped the night time AFIB attacks which constantly woke me up in the middle of the night and i just feel much more comfortable in my own skin...I actually cleaned the house without any huffing, puffing or the usual AFIB attack.

However, @ 25mg I still have bouts of high readings, so when I see my PCP this week, she might raise it to 50mg. I will say that I prefer to see a Cardiologist for this because I am terrified of exercising. Yes, I know exercise and weight loss can lower my bp to healthy levels, but I can't understand I can exert myself while having high bp. Shouldn't it first be controlled with meds first before exercising?",

                    "I have been on some form of metoprolol for seven years. It was actually my first prescribed medication at 28. I never even thought about side effects as being the problems I was experiencing; thought there was always something else that the Doctor's was overlooking. Now that I have read these comments, I suffer from most of the common ones; tiredness, weakness, trouble losing weight, strange dreams, increased sweating, difficulty breathing, etc. Have had numerous tests off and on for the last two years, and nothing is ever found. I have also since then started taking clonidine and amlodipine. Some of these symptoms are probably drug interactions. I noticed a chaotic heartbeat when clonidine was added to the medicines. It has gotten worse for the past two years.",

At times though I have spells that usually run less than a few minutes with a heart rate of around 190 plus and pain. My worst battle with this level lasted about 15 minutes. I take 50mg of Metoprolol 2 times a day on a regular basis but add another 50 if I have the biggies and that settles the heart rate down quickly. Luckily I have no side affects but would love to find something else that quickly slows the heart rate ... mainly to avoid the pain and spooky stuff that goes a;long with it. I've had 11 angioplasties and 10 stents since 1990 and am 70.",

I take blood pressure and pulse 2times/ day and it is averaging 107/71, pulse 63- working well. It took me a good 4 weeks to adapt to the tough side effects though. I felt very tired to the point of falling asleep during the day, was worn out if I walked to far or even stood too long, felt lightheadedness, nauseated, was afraid to drive. I'm glad I stuck it out, the side effects finally abated. Hang in there, the bad side effects can go away. For the record I'm a 69 year old woman, 5`4\" 128 lbs. I take the pill at night.",

My BP is very high in the morning, like 167/110, before I take my daily dosage of valsartan. Within 2 hours of taking it my BP hasn't improved, then at about 5 hours after I take my BP med my BP plummets to like 71/54, sometimes lower. I fall asleep without even realizing it when it happens & sleep for about half hour. BP readings, about 4 times daily, shows PVCs at all times with an infrequent no PVC reading.

My doctor prescribed 25 mg of metoprolol for me and I started taking it in February of this year (2015). My blood pressure was lowered from 140/90 to 125/82, so it DOES work in that respect. I had no side effects at ALL from this until the first week of June. Today is July 22nd. The first week of June, I was recovering from a sore throat and cough and then three weeks later, I realized that I was STILL hoarse and my voice was cracking. It is STILL like that as of today.

I still feel a little of that about 12 hours after I take it- I figure that is a slight \" withdrawal\" effect, it lasts about 30-45 min. & I don't have it every day. When I took the generic ( manufacturer, PAR) I felt on a roller coaster, up & down all day. The time release delivery feels to be much smoother with the brand name, toprol- I recommend it. All in all, it works well, keeps my heart in sinus rhythm, but it's a tough drug to have to take.",
                    "This drug has literally changed my life in a very short time. I was having horrible chest pains, with a mixture of general anxiety due to work/home stress. Cardiologist found source of my chest pain is a narrowed subclavian artery.  The chest pain completely stopped within 24 hours. The only real side effect is difficulty sleeping if instructed to take it at night. I switched to taking it first thing in the morning and I now sleep like a baby. I give it a 9/10 solely for that side effect. I did feel very lethargic when I first took it, but that went away completely after 2 days or so once my body got used to the meds. I feel much more calm than I did before so this medication has really changed the way I feel. improvement is noticeable",

I feel nervous having my natural rhythm manipulated but when it comes to the heart, I'll just do what they say. Had an attack of pericarditis 3 weeks ago and then Atrial fibrillation two days ago. I was told that this was normal after pericarditis. Metoprolol is recommended while heart recovers. ",

It does the job well, but the side affects are rough to handle sometimes. Such as dizziness, sleepless nights, daytime drowsiness, forgetfulness, and depression but, i'm still coping after about four years and i guess on for the rest of my life. But if i can manage after three brother suicides than so can you.",
                    "Elevated blood pressure and increased heart rate due to long term undertreated high blood pressure. Metoprolol worked wonders. Been on it for a year - the side effects are strange dreams (not scary...just strange) and exercise difficulties. My doctor recommended sticking with 80% of exercise target heart rate. If you're having side effects, give this medication a couple months to work. It will get better. Make sure your doctor monitors your triglycerides and blood sugar while on any beta blocker. My triglycerides shot through the roof, but now under control with fish oil. ",

After this I went to a cardiologist who gave me 50 mg Metoprolol to take as needed. I am happy that i don't have to take it daily because it does make me sluggish on the very rare times that I do-I am pleased to have a solution when these events happen and my fears of dying suddenly from a heart episode have been drastically reduced.",

It lowered my b.p. by like 20 points/day, and I was fine for 2 days, but then had episodes of exhaustion to the point where I had to lie on the couch for hours to recover from simple housework like washing pots. Was also short of breath like I'd run 5 miles. Swallowing felt weird. Got disoriented while driving. It's a 9 on effectiveness, but can't tolerate the side effects. Am 63/F.",

The first month or so was tough as I had headaches, chest pains shortness of breath, etc. I think a large part of it was anxiety from a life changing surprise condition. No more headaches and anxiety is much, much better. I have a bit of shortness of breath, even when sitting at times, but I have been able to jog at the gym. Just started again this week and went 30 minute today. Overall, not sure if anything is working, but I am trying to just trust my Doctor and listen to my body.

I recommend it to anyone with my problem.",
                    "I love this medicine! It has quite literally saved my life, and has made my life much more livable. Whenever I would do anything physical, my heart would beat so fast that I would frequently faint. I went to my cardiologist, and she gave me a holter monitor. She saw what I was talking about and gave me 50mg of Toprol-XL everyday. That was over 3 years ago, still on the same dosage, and it is wonderful. For the first few months, I was a little over tired, but that side effect quickly went away.",

                    "I was put on 50 mg 3 X a day for rapid, arrhythmic heartbeat and high blood pressure, in November last year. At first, it made me very sleepy and dizzy, but I have gotten over that. It lowered my heart rate into the low 60's and 50's, occasionally upper 40's. Halving the dose has not changed this; I am hoping to be off it, or at least on an even lower dose, after my next cardiology appointment in June. I think it is making me forgetful. That has definitely been a problem since taking it, although I was a bit of an absent-minded professor before. It may also have helped lower my blood pressure, although I have made some diet and lifestyle changes that would affect that, also.",

Over three years ago I started having increased muscle weakness, episodes of collapsing or falling without knowing why or even a warning that I was going to fall, extremely dry eyes (OTC eye drops were ineffective), severe muscle spasms, back pain, increased diarrhea, swelling in hands and feet, and pinpoint red spots on my skin. I looked up the side effects of this med and I had 24 of the adverse effects!! I had become so weak that I had to use 2 walking sticks, could hardly get in or out of bed, couldn't walk a 100 ft.

My hands have developed arthritis in both thumbs, my feet have it in my toes. I tried another Astra Zeneca product called Atacand and it works better but is so expensive I can't afford to buy it.",

Started out at 50mg, but had breakthroughs regularly, and went up to 100mg after a year. The medication works great to keep my heart rate and blood pressure down to normal levels, however, for the first month on the medication I constantly fell asleep during daily activity, and even now I maintain a sense of perpetual fatigue. Hard to lose weight, and depression creeps up often. Brain fog has slowed my ability to focus and react swiftly, which is frustrating. Still, the medication works so well to keep the heart episodes at bay that I haven't tried switching to a new medication.",

It has helped in slowing my rapid heart beat down but the side effects have almost been unbearable. I have hardly slept, after taking the medicine I get short of breath and feel like I'm having an anxiety attack, and I take the medicine at bedtime. In the mornings when I wake for the first two to three hours I feel shaky, sweaty, nauseous, and extremely dizzy. My regular MD took me down to 25mg once daily and I still can't sleep and feel anxious. This is the first day taking 25mg so we'll see how I feel in the morning.",

I told this many times but he still thinking about the BPM..so at the end the BPM decrease but not the blood pressure so is working 50/50. PS I gained more than 10lb after using the metoprolol",

After a few days it felt like I hadn't taken the medicine. Toprol XL works great, and when i swapped back to the original I felt great again. There must be some difference in the release between the two. This med brings the BP into 120's over low to mid 70's range where I was reg 140's/90's. It also helps bpm from mid 90's down to upper 70's.",

It made me tired. I don't know if part of the problem is the doctors I have been seeing don't know what exactly is wrong with my heart and why it does this.

At the end of that 3 weeks I increased metoprolol to 75 mg/day and by the end of the 6th week my systolic had climed to 134.

Again seems likely to be the medication. Off all things meant to help me sleep, Metoprolol has made for some difficult sleepless nights, not something I've ever had before.

I informed my PA of this after my last crisis and she is looking into prescribing a different product (one given at the hospital) but this after a few years on Toprol.

I called my doctor, and he asked me to go to the ER to make sure everything is okay. I did. They did XRAY, blood work, gave me IV to flush it out. Everything was normal. My HR kept jumping from 67 to 105 suddenly. I was told to stop taking it. I am bummed out because I was looking forward to this helping me. After everything, my HR has was 54 resting and 72 active.

I was having 10-15 severe migraines per month, causing frequent ER visits, stroke level high blood pressure and severe performance anxiety. Immediately after beginning this medicine I have few headaches and they are rarely severe. My blood pressure is down and my anxiety is significantly improved.  I have no problems exercising.

No problems getting the heart rate up in exercise (still quite the opposite actually! I can reach 180bpm after 5mins) Unfortunately it didnt stop the progression to AF. After 6yrs of SVT & metoprolol I was further diagnosed with AF. Dosage was increased from 25mg to 50-75mg per day. Starting to work a little better now in preventing rapid AF however I still get slow AF.

I figured out the only change I'd made was taking metoprolol so I weaned myself off of it and the depression cleared right up. My doctor said he has a lot of patients on this medication and even though depression is a side effect none of them have had this issue.

                    "I have been taking Amlodipine (Norvasc) for about 2 months. Norvasc (Amlodipine Besylate 5 mg) did lower my blood pressure from 150's over 80's to 120's over 60's. That's great.  Problem is with side effects every day. Intestinal cramps, diarrhea, gas. Begins about 5 hours after I take the pill. Stomach (intestines ?) roll constantly for about 3 hours.  I am going to try splitting the pills in half and see if lower dosage stops the side effects. If not, I guess I'll go back to the doctor and try something else for blood pressure. It seems like all of these blood pressure pills have side effects of one kind or another.",
                    "I began taking this amlopidine for high blood pressure about a year ago. It worked fine for several months til I started having swelling and pain in my feet and legs. I was having some attacks of gout and thought that was it that causing the problem but the pain and swelling went on long after the gout. I got to where I could hardly walk. My wife noticed that swelling was a side effect. I quit the medicine immediately, and noticed a huge difference within a week. I have been off the medicine for 3-4 mths, but still have some problems with swelling and pain although not near as severe. I have also have developed knots in my calves while on this medicine that has not went away since stopping the medicine. I fear I have irreversible damage.",

Told Dr I was healthy running 1/2 marathons and now can barely run 3km due to above. Told Dr I just didn't feel right. Told benefits outweighed side effects. August went to Urgent Care & asked them to do Lyme test cuz of aches and neck pain - negative. Thanks giving week elbow pain unbearable, trouble walking downstairs knees hurt, knees and thighs swollen. Called Dr. Went off. Immediately fog lifted, still anxious as I don't feel right. Joints still achy & knees hurt. Back/neck trouble past two weeks hoping they'll go away and I'll feel better. HATE amlodipine. Started on HCT, see Dr next week.",

Doctor says give it a little while longer. One day I almost passed out, got light headed and felt like I was in another dimension! Doctor says he can't say for sure it was a side effect of this medicine. I will keep trying it for awhile longer.",

The doctors have prescribed many different high blood pressure medications for me over the years and none have stabalized my pressure. About a month ago, they changed me to Norvasc 10MG.

I feel as if I have my life back now.",

My left knee had so much fluid I had it aspirated three times and not one Doctor said a word. I read some posts and decided to stop taking it and I felt better in a few days and my knee doesn't hurt. 5mgs of poison every morning......",

Then, I went up to 10mg per doctor's orders, and the headaches stopped. If this keeps up, yes, this is a miracle. Have suffered with migraines almost 40 years--and have tried lots of meds including Imitrex which was a lifesaver and Botox which helped initially but not for very long. As for side effects, no swelling--maybe a little fatigue. I was on loads of Excredrin and probably 3 Imitrex a week. So glad to be able to get off these meds. Still keeping them around just in case but am very encouraged with amlodipine.",

I was having severe side effects from using Benicar over the past 5 years and asked my doctor to place me on another medication. After about three weeks I noticed redness, dry and dark circles under my eyes, had feelings of depression, hallucinations, insomnia, irritability, and a racing heart beat at times. My fiance told me that on one occasion while sleeping on my back I stopped breathing for a few seconds. I have vivid dreams and wake up with brief sleep paralysis. I also have been itching a small dry patch of skin on my back. I'm 37, and work out 2-3 times per week. My BP is usually around 120-30/90. I'm going to have my doctor switch me to another med.",

My BP is 125/72, but I have put on 60 lbs in the last two years. I do suffer from Graves Disease of the Thyroid. This is not related to the medication. The point is, when I got down to 114 lbs, I actually stopped taking Amlodipine; my bp was normal. The weight loss was due to Graves Disease ( Hyperthyroidism). Then I had radiation treatment, gained weight now my bp is elevated again. I now started taking Amlodipine Besylate again, same dose since 2011. The only side effect I noticed is it makes me somewhat hypervigilant, but nothing to be concerned about.",

My mother has it and she has kidney failure and my grandmother died from a stroke. Both were caused from it being uncontrolled. I found out when I went to visit the dentist that it was high. I went to the hospital because of chest pains and it was 141/101 which was extremely high for my age and my weight size. This medicine has lowered it to 126/76 which is great for me!! I wish the bottom number would go to 70 but I am about to speed up the exercising to help out. I take it at night because it MAKES ME SLEEPY, which is something that I don't mind.",

Its a no win situation but what does help and helps substantially is weight loss and walking. Walking is the best thing since sliced bread - highly recommended. With this medication a little exercise goes a long way. Great reason to walk the dog.",

Then my doctor said take 5mg norvasc like before but add 2mg coversyl - that made me have palpitations very tired fatigued and out of breath, headaches and felt like someone is strangling me and felt anxious. Basically couldn't function so I went back to just 5mg and going to see cardiologist. I feel like a guinea pig trying different medicine with no results. I'm still tired out of breath sometimes laboured breathing BP is still high, get cramps in stomach, I must have gone to hospital and my doctor so many times.",

I was prescribed 5 mg., and the first day of taking it, and every day since, I have had major heart palpitations. Not a nice feeling. I also feel WIRED. So far, not liking this medication at all! Why do medications, to treat illness and symptoms, bring an entirely new set of problems?",

I have been under the hospital for really bad tongue and mouth ulcers, for the last 2.5 years and also under the hospital for a badly bloated stomach, I look like I am 7 or 8 months pregnant, (both side effects) all tests have come back ok. My balance is terrible and recently had two bad falls in a week! I have constant ringing in my ears, cramp in my feet at night, feel tired and have to have a sleep most afternoons, Swollen feet and ankles. Researching the side effects of Amlodipine has made me realise all these symptoms are probably due to this awful drug. Will be seeing doc next week to get it changed",

Mixture of white coat syndrome and an IBS episode I was in the middle of, plus whatever else is the cause of my HBP. Dr said go to the ER! I declined. He did an EKG and all was fine. Dr prescribed 10mg of Norvasc and Coreq. I went home and took my bp it was 170/100. Took 5mg of Norvasc and 50mg Toprol I was already on. BP came down to about 140/95 in about 12 hours. Pain by my pancreas for 12 hours a few days into it. Feet and ankles swollen like balloons. 4/14 on 10mg my bp averages around 133/86, feet still swollen by night. Feeling A LOT better. Finally, something that works for me. No other side effects",

However, the side effects were terrible: frequent urination, constipation followed 10 minutes later by uncontrollable diarrhea, blurry vision, cough, fatigue and sleepiness. When I would go out, I would not take the medicine. I found out that Amlodipine was causing my problems when I took an airplane flight. I did not take it because I did not want to go to the bathroom when we were flying. I didn't take it for 2 days and almost all my symptoms disappeared. I took it again and all the problems came back so I stopped taking it. O was put on Clonidine and that did not lower my BP but gave me a cough and sleepiness.",

Now, right then and there the doc should have taken me off Norvasc, because it is contraindicated for AS.  I told my PA, who took me off & put me me on lisinopril. Murmur went away. (Well, until a few years later when I was put on cipro/flagyl and had a horrible time with the flagyl.)...Saturday I asked the doc if he could hear a murmur...NOPE! Very early Thursday morning as I was being admitted, I now had a murmur. Not as loud as the previous one. Hopefully, after I recover from the current nonsense, I will be able to rid myself of this murmur as well.  I hope.",

I went to urgent care and they suggested I go to the ER. At the ER they did a lot of tests and couldn't find anything. 48 hours after taking amlodipine blood pressure still hasn't gone down.

Like all meds, this will effect everyone differently, but from what the Dr's tell me, it's the one with the least number of side effects. The following are things I have noticed since taking this drug. 1. My legs seem a little weaker than before but have not noticed significant swelling which is one of the main side effects. 2. At night I have discomfort in my legs generally the thigh muscles. Not pain but discomfort like I ran on a treadmill for an hour. Nothing that keeps me awake. Overall, it works for me.",

I lost 8 pounds of water over the next few days and low and behold, blood pressure went way, way down! I hit as los as 109/59, which prompted me to stop another BP med, losartan, which turned out to have been causing my chronic leg pain! I am now only on chlorthalidone, with a bp a bit high at 135/82, not sure which way to go next. Maybe try cutting salt.

I had daily headaches. Was on high doses of daily tryptans. A year ago, my bp started to rise (150/90 vs 110/60) and I got worried bc tryptans are generally contraindicated in patients with high bp.

                    "I suffered for three years with bleeding and red spongy gums. It got worse as time went on...even developed small painless ulcers. Finally, after going to 5 different doctors, a periodontist told me to stop Amlodipine. My gums are fine now. Of course, I had to get periodontal work done to the tune of $1125, but by that point, I would have paid double to get to the bottom of it.",
                    "Started taking amlodipine 5 mg for high blood pressure and to my delight it has reduced my migraines to about once a month instead of 3-4 per week! I have been on other meds for high BP but they did not lessen my migraines (verapamil, lisonpril, bystolic to name a few). I am so happy this drug has helped with my migraines. I had given up hope on finding a migraine preventative. To fellow migraine sufferers: Keep trying different high BP meds until you find one that works for you.",
                    "It makes me sleepy. I get phlegm all the time. It's hard to function on a daily basis once I've taken it. My doctor doesn't believe it's the medicine and won't change it but yet she isn't trying to find any other results as to why I'm feeling this way. I've switch my time for taking it. I now take it around 4 pm. I still have to fight to stay awake but at least it isn't all day.",
                    "I started taking Norvasc after trying many other meds. including Topamax which had too many bad side effects for me. So far since starting about a month ago; I have only had 1 headache and that was at the very beginning. No side effects. I was having headaches which was affected by weather pressure; about 1 a week. So nice not to have them and to feel good on this medication.",

Migraine level headaches, lightheadedness, dizziness, racing heart. I suffer from graves disease and hypertension. This medication made me worse. Would not recommend it at all.",
                    "I have had hormonal migraines sine I was 17. I would have horrible migraines through my menstrual cycle each month.  I developed high blood pressure & my doctor prescribed Linsinopril & when that didn't lower it enough he added Amlodipine.  I took it for about 9 months and never had a migraine which was wonderful.  BUT, I developed waves of severe fatigue and was feeling crappy all over much of the time. I developed swelling in my feet & ankles & my diastolic blood pressure was almost 100 all the time. I researched the medicines I've been taking & decided to monitor my blood pressure & stop the Amlodipine. I instantly felt better & my blood pressure actually went down. Don't know if migraine will return. Not worth the side effects!",
                    "I used amlodipine for 6 months during which I developed \"football feet\", swollen ankles, lower legs. Since onset was gradual, I did not realise how much oedema I had accrued. I stopped taking amlodipine - swelling in my lower limbs were rapidly back to almost normal, almost because of 3 varicosities on my left ankle, for which I now must use an ankle brace. I told my doctor that I had quit because I was unhappy, and he said that he was very happy and that I needed help for moderately high blood pressure. I then suggested that HE try amlodipine. He once had me use ezetrol , and I stupidly continued for almost a year before realising I had become severely affected. I now give new meds a trial period and tell the doc if I am not amused.",

I was really forgetful and would sometimes feel confused. Then the trembling in my legs started them spread to my arms went from trembling to twitching really fast then it spread to my face. During this time anxiety is slowly creeping in it was getting a little worse everyday until it was a constant feeling. Pressure in my head constantly and full blown panic attacks by month 4. I discussed this with my doctor and I stopped taking this medication 2 days ago and was prescribed something else. I can feel my anxiety subsiding. ",

They seem to have come back, however, and it is mid-summer. I also take Ritalin for narcolepsy and I fear that it may be causing some of the symptoms. I would recommend trying this medicine for Raynaud's. I take 5 mg per day.",

                    "The medicine works rapidly and the 5mg daily dosage is still effective for me after several years of treatment. There's only been a few occasions that I've experienced any side effects after the first few initial doses of medicine. The one I experienced most was sleepiness. Otherwise, I take one pill every evening at bedtime and I'm fine until the next dose.",

When I was told to come off it by the cardiologist , the migraines returned . It's changed my life . The only side effect is oedema ( swollen ankles) a small price to pay . Been on it for 15 years now",

Slight swelling in ankles but remedied with additional candasartan 16mg. Feel lots better. Worth checking out the maleate if probs with itching tingling and pain in upper limbs.",
                    "It has lowered my blood pressure, which was crazy high (upper number 210 once and otherwise always in the 190's). Everything was fine at first. But now I'm so tired it hurts. I am actually so fatigued that I am close to not being able to function. I have also noticed some double vision (comes & goes). ",
                    "Norvasc caused extreme leg and ankle edema and did not improve hypertension much. After 6 weeks of use I was put on lisinopril and within 2 days had no more leg swelling and blood pressure lowered greatly. So far so good on new medication.",
                    "I was prescribed amlodipine after lisinopril hctz and Losartan both caused severe hair loss and insomnia. After taking a dose, I would experience a severe headache for 20 hours, plus stomach upset. However, my hair was not falling out, nor did I have insomnia. It took about 2-3 weeks for the headaches and upset stomach to stop completely.It took about 6 weeks for my blood pressure to be in the normal range. No side effects currently. The only thing I'm not happy about is I haven't been able to lose weight while on Amlodipine, even though I'm strictly dieting. Prior to starting this drug, I had been losing nicely. But I suppose I'd rather be fatter with a full head of hair, than thin and bald. :)",
                    "After taking Norvasc 10mg for 3 months I found my feet ankles and hands were swelling up, also gained weight even though I walk every day. My Doctor has put me on Avapro and I will monitor it for the next 3 months. ",

                    "Writing again, I guess amlodipine has something to do with my sleep stages. I feel some changes in the depth of night sleep. Before taking this med, I was generally having very deep and unconscious type night sleeps and regular migraines in the base of skull (occipital nerves) after awakening in the morning. Whenever I was very tired and feeling very sleepy before going to bed in the night, I woke up in the mid night due to severe pain in the base of the skull. Whenever I suddenly awaken from deep sleep due to external interruption, I found myself a bit confused for some time. With amlodipine, I have moderate depth of sleep and don't get confused if suddenly awaken / interrupted from sleep. No migraines so far.",

I've been taking it for over 3 years..I do know that when I eat right, and put less salt in my system, my blood pressure get's really low, like two numbers at the top and bottom, so I will take it every other day which will regulate it to 120/80",

                    "I have been on Amlodipine for several years in addition to a diuretic and ARB for high blood pressure. Although it does lower blood pressure slightly, its main effect to me was to cause swelling of my ankles and feet. That became entirely unacceptable to me a couple of months ago. The edema was so bad that bending my ankles was uncomfortable. Upon stopping the drug, I can once again see my ankles and the veins of my feet. I cannot believe that a drug that produces one of the side effects of congestive heart failure can be a good drug. I am never taking it again.",
                    "The first 2/3 days were very encouraging. It helped me a lot. but afterwards I had severe side effects, chronic diarrhea, vomiting, nausea etc. generally feeling really crap, so that i had to stay home for a couple of days. Even a reduction in dosage didn't help much. switched to verapamil, which works similarly, but practically without side effects for me.",

Side effects include left shoulder pain. Loss of hair, eyesight going bad due inflammation of the cornea, weakness, tiredness to the point of delusion. The doctor had be go from 5 to 10 mg and that made everything worse. Three days after stopping it my shoulder pain went away and so much energy returned. my mother was put on it from her doctor and had similar results. After she stopped taking it she no longer needs her walker. I'm 63 and she is 88 going on 29.",

                    "I took exactly one pill and woke up the next day with the worse headache : top of my head hurt, temples were squeezing, had pressure in my eyes, and couldn't tolerate sounds. How ironic that people take this to prevent migraines! I was done after 1 day. This came after 4 days on metoprolol (sp), which had left me exhausted and short of breath, so I wasn't exactly 100%. B.P. went up somewhat the day I was on this. Headache left as soon as I went off it. (Was put on valsartan right after, and had terrible back/spine pain from that.) I think I am done with meds. Maybe I'll do yoga.",

I don't exercise much. No ill side effects, but one side benefit, after taking this medicine my outbreaks of psoriasis have completely gone away.",
                    "30 minutes after taking one 5MG tablet, I suffered chills and had to sleep in a jacket in an attempt to stay warm in July. The chills continued from 10PM to 6 AM the next morning.  ",
                    "I did a lot of research. Amlodipine seems to be the best migraine preventative for those of us with stubborn nearly daily migraines that don't seem to respond to the typical medications, at least in the long term. I was on two other preventatives for years: Inderal and Amitriptyline. I am now weaning off of both these other medications. I was getting about one headache a week for the first couple weeks at 10 mg, now I think it's been two weeks since my last one. No side effects for me. It's a miracle. Verapamil seems to have the same effect, but requires very high doses up to 720 mg/day. You MUST try this medication if you have tried the others without lasting effects.",

My doctor quickly took me off and put me on Amlodipine, which lowered my blood pressure to 134/74 in 2 weeks, and NO side effects! The pounding in my chest GONE! A true wonder for me!",

I tried everything and was put on everything. Finally, I tried amlodipine and the next day, no headache no migraine. I was amazed. I take it every night before bed. I didn't feel dizzy and haven't had any swelling. I was worried cause my blood pressure runs low already, but I'm doing so much better now and no side effects.",

It helps decrease my usual 170/104 to approx 150/70 but only for a few hours. I am fatigued, headaches and super cold feet and hands constantly. I also have muscle cramps. I feel as if I had a heart attack a few days ago but my doctor says its gastritis. The side effects are worse than hypertension itself! Maybe I need a new medicine and/or a new physician.

On amlodipine I really went downhill, severe joint pain every joint is affected and leg and ankle swelling are really terrible. Achy all the time most especially in low back and legs to the point I simply can not walk anymore. I take a few steps and the legs ache so bad they lock up and I must rest to take another step. Eventually I get home but really I can't even walk anymore and have gained weight and flab.losartan is not lowering my bp and I really feel death would be a kinder more desirable event.

No other side effects. Feel good and thankful BP is down. Would like to try 5mg at 8am and 5mg at 8pm. Will discuss this with my doctor. But so far, absolutely no complaints - just a positive experience.",

My BP is down and I feel great other than the insomnia. I'm on 5 mg. wondering if the 2.5 mg would work? Anyone know if lessing the dosage would work?",

I have almost PASSED OUT 3 times, VERY EXHAUSTED, DEPRESSED, CALF HURTS, felt a doom and gloom feeling, really SUCKED, CRIED ALL DAY for no reason. Only took it for 5 days 2.5 mg.

I was perfectly fine taking 5 mg each day for the first several months. Then around June of 2015, I started getting pains in my upper left and right chests, headaches began to hit me, and I began to develop an anxiety problem. I am typing this review 3 days after I have now stopped taking Amlodipine. The past few weeks have been worse than a nightmare for me - my anxiety has reached severe levels, the pains in my upper chest, shoulders, and forearms was becoming unbearable, I've been continuously nauseous for nearly 2 weeks now, had high-pitched ringing in my ears, and was completely depersonalized.",

Then being diagnosed with high blood preasure I ran the gambet of a few different drugs to figure out what worked best for me. In the fine tuning stages of treatment I was prescribed Amlodipine in combination with another drug. Life changing!!!!! I had migraines at least 3 times a week and suddenly I realised it had been 2 weeks, then 3 then a month, then 2......no headache! Why oh why did it take all this time to figure it out! So very Happy with my new life!!!!!!!",

I have been feeling uncomfortable heat in my feet, my skin has been extraordinarily dry and I have been feeling sluggish and sick. I was prescribed Amlodopin because the Losartan I was taking gave me a chronic cough.",

My doctor wanted to me try this medication for a month to see if my blood pressure would lower. Within a week my blood pressure which usually hovers at 140/80 with a pulse of 80 shot to a ridiculous 200/98 with a pulse of 98. My blood pressure will always spike around the evening. My anxiety worsened and I got headaches. This medication does not work for me and I am not going to be tricked into staying on it longer.",

Sometime late 2012, I started experiencing lightheadedness, foot and ankle swelling, my asthma worsened and I had severe pelvic pain. Spent three months and quite a bit of my deductible trying to figure out why. A friend suggested it may be time to change my bp medication. I went to the doctor and she told me the formula had been changed for generic amlodipine late last year and many of her patients had experienced problems with it, had to discontinue the medication. I've been on Metoprolol and I haven't had any issues so far.",
                    "Many won't read this far into the coments, but I found Amlodepine to work well by taking it in a different way. I, too, had some strong side effects on (1) 10mg or (2) 5mg daily. Swollen ankles were worst,, but nausea, tiredness, etc were culprits too. I asked my doctor what the smallest pill (mg) was. It is 2.5. I started using 4 in a day, but spreading them out. In other words, a 2.5 pill at 7am, 12pm, 5pm and 10pm (or approximate times spread out). I now actually only take 3 pills (7.5 total), but still spread them out. For me, it still has the right effect of bringing down the BP, but the side effects are dispersed out so they are MUCH more manageable. I sit in a soft chair or use the recliner to reduce ankle swelling.",
                    "I recently started this medication at the 5mg level and have now gone up to 10mg. I feel better and don't feel like I am not so distressed when doing small chores like before. Only issue I have had is I am so tired.",

                    "I have been on amlodipine for nearly a year. Doctor said to avoid sodium and exercise/diet. I take 2 x 5mg pills in the morning and 1 x 5mg at night. Blood Pressure has done very well. As long as I stay away from sodium, I have no swelling in ankles/feet. Heart doctor said to stay away from chips, bacon and soup. I am 74 and do not exercise regularly I need to lose about 30lbs. I am so tired, how do I exercise? It takes all I have to make something to eat. The one side effect I noticed was 'skin rash/itch'. I have this scalp problem, with little pimples that I scratch. Dermatologist said dermatitis; I use prescription shampoo. Scalp problem started just after starting the generic amlodipine. ",
                    "Started amlodipine after stopping lisinopril due to throat swelling after taking for one year. Amlodipine took 5 days to begin working on lowering my blood pressure after introduction. My dosage was 5mg once daily. It didn't lower my blood pressure very much. Went from 165/111 to 145/100 in 5 days.  Side effects included: Very sore arms and legs Lower legs felt sore and full of blood (heavy) Facial flishing Profucious sweating from feet and hands Headaches Notable lack of energy and sleepiness , nervousness  I recommend using this drug ONLY if it's your last resort and you don't need an immediate drop in blood pressure. Remember everyone is different this may work well for you. Long walks seemed to help with the sore legs.",
                    "Using 5mg since 8 months. It prevents me from severe pain in the base of my skull (perhaps occipital neuralgia). The important point to be noted in my case is the timing of taking the medicine. I mostly get the pains in early morning while in deep sleep. Before taking this med, I would wake up in severe pain that would last until I take a painkiller. Than I started taking amlodipine 5mg at night. However, I need to take the medicine about 10~12 hours before the onset of the pain. If I am late, I would get the pain on the same time in morning in spite of taking the pill. However, in such case, the pain gradually diminishes as the time approaches to the required time.   Looking forward to hear from those suffering from similar conditions.",

After losing weight and starting to exercise more, I am now down to 2.5mg daily and no negative side effects.

It has literally ruined my life. Doctors never even had a clue and I never thought it was Norvasc that was hurting me until I had trouble a week ago getting the prescription filled I was out of for 4 days. On the 4th day without taking it, my legs were feeling pretty good. I got my prescription refilled took the pill and the next day, I was back to debilitating pain. I haven't taken it since. I am now feeling pressure in my head as I've always been prone to migraine headaches. I never got one after I started taking Norvasc. I think I'll take the migraines.",

First came nausea, which lasted about 2 weeks, however, the chronic insomnia and horrific, extremely vivid nightmares began almost immediately and are still persisting even though I stopped taking it about 6 days ago. Another side effect I experienced was extremely stiff and sore feet - I thought I had developed painful arthritis overnight and walking on them was horrible. I also experienced extreme fatigue all day every day, making it near impossible to care for my three children at home who are all under school age. I thought I was losing my mind. Feeling a bit better every day. This was a very scary experience for me.",
                    "I am a mid-fifty male post open heart (4 mths ago) and stents (3 weeks ago).I have been on Norvasc 5 mg for about 10 days now as the predecessor drug's side effect were horrible. It has been very effective at lowering my BP (117/75) the side effects are still concerning. Dizzy, tired, maybe some depression & anxiety, slight problem with deep breathing and week muscles. Although I can function normally the day-to-day functions are an effort so I push through. The mornings (when I take Norvasc) are not as good as the afternoon when I feel better. I believe the side effects are getting better but am unsure. What I want is to be normal again and active. They say it takes a few week for the body to adjust. I'll give it its due course.",
                    "FYI -- I tried various high blood pressure meds, most with some serious side effects. Amlodipine was helping better than any previous, but had some nausea, swelling, dizziness, etc. Decided to try taking 2.5 pill 4-four times daily instead of one 10mg pill. Made a huge difference. Seems my body can handle everything with only slight side effects by doing this. My doctor said he'd never had a patient do it this way, but due to my good effect, has now put several patients on Amlodipine in this manner. By breaking it up, the body seems to be able to tolerate it well. May not work for everyone, but for me it was such a blessing.",
                    "Taking for three weeks. Lowered the bottom number of my blood pressure almost too low. Average now is 116/63. Caused some dizziness, light-headed and little shortness of breath. Slowed pulse down also. Good medicine but don't want dizziness. ",
                    "Both my husband and I have been taking Norvasc for a period of approximately 6 months. It has lowered both of our blood pressures into the normal range and we have suffered absolutely no side effects.",
                    "Took 2.5 mg for a year with not recognizing any side effect. At annual checkup blood pressure was over 200--but I had just taken a bad fall and had big time bruises and a hematoma (excuse bad spelling) on hip. Dr bumped up amlodipine to 10 mg. Within 10 days noticed significant swelling of ankles and feet and experienced pain on the inside of legs (the entire length of the leg). Cut dose to 5 mg and pain gone next day, swelling reduced. Two weeks on 5 mg and blood pressure 135/70. Another week on 5 mg and 130/69. Feet and ankles still somewhat swollen, frequent leg cramps every night. Considering going back to 2.5 mg.",
                    "My Dr. Prescribed amlodipine I've only been on it a week. Now having terrible stomach pain & I mean unbearable. Red rash flare ups on my arms. Taking myself off of the crap.",
                    "LOVE this medication! After having been on Micardis for five years, the affordability is a welcome change, and it works just as well with fewer side-effects!",
                    "Norvasc worked fantastic for about a year then I started experiencing muscle twitching and cramps that got worse and worse. I have been trying to switch to another medicine and haven't had much luck. I pray I can find a medicine as good as Norvasc. I can tell you that numerous blood tests have been run and while this medicine MAY cause cramps, my blood sugar, cholesterol, liver panel, metabolic panel, CBC, creatinine, etc. are all perfect! I have a lot of faith to the fact that this medicine will not harm you other than possibly muscle cramps or fluid retention. I experienced no fluid retention BUT I exercise.",
                    "47 yo male tried Ramipril first which was great at reducing blood pressure but also turned me into a zombie, foggy head and constantly tired and I believe bad interaction with Lipitor.  Have been taking Amlodipine for 2 months and the side-effects are way less but not totally gone. Have had trouble sleeping, some tiredness, constant numbness/tingling in left hand and weight gain (assuming water gain?). Trying to tough it out but may end up not taking BP meds at all. (Was in the 140/90ish range when starting the drugs).The side effects do not make me feel right.",

                    "I was switched to 10mg amlodipine after suffering side effects with a dose increase of Lisinopril. I tried the medication for about two weeks and developed severe, painful edema in my feet and ankles. Moreover, my blood pressure remained greater than 135/85, even though I was taking the maximum dosage.",
                    "I have had high blood pressure for over five years and this includes treatment with numerous medication and supplements. Two months ago I was prescribed Amlodipine for high blood pressure, I had headaches and dizziness with being physically tired. Today I do not have the headaches, but occasionally experience dizziness if I move fast, or get up from setting, or lying down. Usually only last a few minutes at a time, but I must sincerely and happily let those who read these comments that this medication works. My blood pressure even on other medications such as Atenolol did not work as good, my blood pressure was normally between 140 and 150 everyday. Today it is hitting below 120/70 regularly and usually in the low 100/60 or lower.",
                    "On Norvasc since 1992. Started with 5 mg. After kidney cancer, one kidney removed in 2004, blood pressure slowly rose, now I take 10 mg once a day. Also tried all generic brands, but the filler in all maintenance medication causes an Adverse Reaction, called Myalgia. Pain in the groin and upper legs, so must stay on Name Brand, Norvasc. Now Kidney Disease, Stage 4, blood pressure often rises, usually because I get off my strict diet. It will go up to 200/100, but generally it stays 134/73. I am 76 years old, so that 134/76 is a perfect blood pressure for my age, especially with Kidney Disease. Norvasc has been a life saver for me.",
                    "I have BP problems. Having hard time finding a med to control it. Was given a beta blocker that caused a heart attack put me in hospital. Put me on Norvacs 5mg twice a day. Was on 1 and 1/2 weeks I had severe headaches. Tremors,blurred vision, stomach pains, burning in my legs, had red burning spots form on my lower abdomen then blisters. Off med and will never take Norvasc again. Now on Losartin and Clondine,doing fair with BP. & no side effects.",
                    "I've taken both Norvasc and it's generic, amlodopine. I am taking amlodopine 10mg now. No side effects, just does what it does, and I love it. Just wish it did all of it. It only brings it down to around 160/90- down from 230/150. Too bad I can't just take more. Everything we've tried to add, headaches and headaches, and aches and pains.  I don't get symptoms from from my BP. More like a rush, if anything. Why would take something that makes me feel that way? Quality of life, you know? I'm a 50 year old woman in reasonably decent health but for this",
                    "I've been taking 2.5mg for a month with great results and no side effects, until the weather got colder so the doctor increased dose to 5mg, partly because he wanted a better result to my high blood pressure as well. The sudden increase has caused severe sleepiness and a tight chest. I cut back to 3mg for now to ease into it and will increase to 5mg if/when the side effects decrease. I believe in caution and I know my doctor takes the same stand.",
                    "My blood pressure went up to 220/150 and I was placed on Norvasc 10mg and Diovan 80mg. Been on this for over a year now and my blood pressure is currently 120/80 and I have had no side effects other than swelling on the lower leg which steady brisk walking has handled. The combination worked very well for me.",
                    "Good.",
                    "Terrible medication. Gave me headaches, frightening dizzy spells and didn't work well. Blood Pressure kept spiking to 155/90. Switched to Lisinopril and blood pressure was stable at 115/65.",
                    "Had blood pressure issue. Another drug that I was put on didnt work. Doc suggested Amlodipine which is the generic for Norvasc. First day my bp was something like 145/90. Took new med on the afternoon late, and within 2 hours it was down to 117/70. I thought that was fast because Doc said to give it a few days to start working. Second day I noticed myself becoming edgy and almost scared. Anxiety was started creeping in. Started feeling tingling infingers and feet. The third day the tingling turned to slight numbness in those areas. I also got severe headaches to the back of my head. Legs and arms felt very weak as well. Its almost day for and im having water retention. Im coming off of this drug.",

After takin amlodipine within 24hours my B.P. went down to 136/78 and has stayed that way for the last 3 months.",
                    "-Not a very good one. Complained to Drs . About dry mouth,diarrhea, and numbness in toes. Tingling at tip of fingers. They dismissed it as nothing. The numbness has progressed to my foot,legs,hands,arms. Have trouble walking without a cane because I loose my balance and have fallen many times.",
                    "This drug has worked very fast in reducing high blood pressure. I was on lisinopril but developed hives, swollen lips and tongue so doctor switched me to Norvasc. I seem to still have occasional hives but not as severe and may be triggered by heat. AZ this time of year is quite hot.",

                    "//What is it?//This is an increase in blood pressure above values \u200b\u200bconsidered normal. It occurs when there is excessive pressure of blood on the walls of the arteries during circulation. It can increase at certain times, due to physical or emotional exertion, and it is natural that, after these situations, its values \u200b\u200breturn to normal levels. This condition is only serious and causes health problems when it remains high for months, or when it increases suddenly. It is important to know that tension tends to increase with age. However, hypertension should not be considered normal in the elderly. As a rule, arterial hypertension is considered to be present when the maximum pressure is greater than or equal to 160 mmHge/or the minimum pressure is greater than or equal to 95 mmHge. High blood pressure is associated with coronary heart disease, stroke and heart failure and is the most common modifiable cardiovascular risk factor, which is why its treatment is essential in preventing these pathologies. Cardiovascular diseases are the cause of death for at least 34.1% of the Brazilian population, mainly as a consequence of stroke and coronary disease. It is estimated that the prevalence of high blood pressure in the Portuguese adult population is 42.1%, with only 39.0% of these patients taking antihypertensive drugs and only 11.2% being under control.//Symptoms//In the first few years, it does not cause any symptoms. Over time, blood pressure ends up damaging the blood vessels and the main organs of the body, such as the brain, heart and kidneys, causing headaches, dizziness, tinnitus and increased heart rate. The main diseases associated with high blood pressure are stroke, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, heart and kidney failure.//Causes//Around 90% of cases are related to lifestyle habits. Obesity is one of the important factors. Each pound of fat requires the formation of an additional 1.5 kilometers of small blood vessels to supply the excess adipose tissue. Increased blood pressure is required to pump blood through them. Therefore, being overweight by 20% or more increases the risk of hypertension by five times;;/ Excess salt consumption. It is known that high blood pressure is less frequent in populations where its consumption is low. Our body only needs 1/8 of a teaspoon of salt per day;;/ Tobacco is another cause to consider. Even just one cigarette can increase it for about 30 minutes. A pack-a-day smoker can, through smoking alone, cause an increase in blood pressure for 24 hours;;/ Around 5% to 15% of cases may be related to moderate alcohol consumption. On the other hand, one cup of coffee a day can cause an increase in blood pressure;;/ Physical inactivity and stress are also at its origin;;/ The remaining 10% of high blood pressure cases have organic causes, such as some hormonal changes, kidney or blood vessel diseases.//Diagnosis//It is important to remember that high blood pressure cannot be felt, it must be measured. In order to obtain correct values, it is important to rest in a sitting position for at least five minutes before measuring. You should use the same device and always measure on the same arm. The diagnosis of high blood pressure requires measuring an elevated blood pressure on three separate occasions over a period of a week or more. Once its existence has been confirmed, other tests must also be carried out to help understand its origin and/or the complications associated with it.//Treatment//Treatment depends on the severity of the condition. For example, people with moderate hypertension can control it by simply changing some lifestyle habits, such as reducing salt and alcohol intake, controlling their weight, exercising regularly and stopping smoking. There are several medications available for the treatment of high blood pressure that can be used alone or in combination. It is up to the doctor to decide which is the best treatment for each situation.//Prevention//Since most cases have their origin in lifestyle, it is important that it is healthy. All the recommendations mentioned in the treatment prevent the onset of this disease.

Before I got fear mongered into taking it I was COMPLETELY NORMAL!!!! I have been trying to get back to normal ever since the ER trip when I got off this poison pill!

Do NOT take this poison!!",

I decided to write this review because I read others that said their BP went down but did not stay down. My doc fixed that by giving me 2 doses a day. I take one at bedtime and one after breakfast. It's working great.",

Exercise became more difficult; hands fall asleep at night, every night, unless I wear arm braces; swelling in ankles; general feeling of being in a 'fog' and also very easily irritated. Nodding off around 6pm after work; but force myself to stay awake. When I go to bed, I have insomnia. I decided to cut the pill in half, take it at night and now I have joint pains along with other symptoms. My worst day yet, I just didn't feel right all day; felt confused, anxious to drive to work. Stopped taking the drug that day and one day later I feel like myself again. Symptoms fading; will ask doc for diff drug.",

Fluttering heartbeat, feeling nervous and anxious for no reason, feeling like I'm not totally in my body or in the moment. Woke up at 4am and had a mild panic attack and couldn't sleep for another hour. Ringing in ears and tingling fingers and toes. Taking this with perindopril combi 5mg, have NEVER had any adverse reaction to previous blood pressure medication. I'm so scared to keep taking this medication, thought I was imagining things until I researched and found many, many others similar and worse reactions.

After 4 weeks, bouts of insomnia started creeping in, nausea (to the point that my stomach wanted to really vomit), and my hands and feet started to sweat profusely. After a week, I started feeling tingling sensations in my hands and feet as well as palpitations. I fainted at work about 1.5 weeks ago, doctors couldn't find out what the problem was. I almost fainted last Sunday, and again doctors couldn't see what the problem was, though maybe it could be side effects of the amlodipine. The cardiologist shifted me over to enalapril 10mg instead. Been off the drug for 3 days now, but still feel side effects. When do they disappear?",

I would get very tired in the afternoon. My doctor increased the medication and I wound up not being able to stand when I got out of bed. I decided to stop taking it for a few days. Almost all the pain went away and the swelling in my feet became less. I'm changing meds asap.",

I trust my cardio who says he has seen little or no reported side effects on such a low dose, but not for me.

As I got used to the Med, the feelings decreased but I still have that Panic feeling once in a while. After a week my Right leg and ankle became swollen, but not my Left leg? I also experience Nausea with this medicine and a loss of Appetite, which, in part, is good as I'm overweight. However I could do without the Nausea. I always take this Medication with food and my other Meds in the morning. It has dropped my High Blood Pressure from 200/97 to 140/83. This is the only good thing about this medicine. I can't put my finger on it, but I just don't feel right since I've been taking Amlodipine 5 mg. ",
                    "I used to get migraines 2 days out of every 3, and 2 Excedrin would work about half the time, the other half I needed Imitrex. After about a month of taking 5 mg/day of amlodipine, which was initially prescribed for borderline hypertension (140/90), my headaches went to once/week, and they were all treatable with one 1 Excedrin. I only need Imitrex now once every two months instead of of two or three times a week. What a difference in my life! I don't understand why this medication isn't used more frequently for migraine sufferers.",
                    "Just completed my first week of amlodipine. I take 5mg once a day. My blood pressure went from 140's/100's to 115/80's. I have experienced absolutely NO side effects. I'm young, in shape, and pretty active. I'm so happy to find a medication that works for me.",

                    "Started taking amlodipine 5 mg with indapamide once a day. I had terrible side effects with both medications. Amlodipine caused hives, heart palpitations, swelling and weight gain. However, I have to admit that the combination of both pills was effective in bringing my blood pressure down in 2 weeks. I just couldn't tolerate the side effects. Doctor changed script to 180mg Diltiazem CD. Hopefully this will work.",
                    "I have been taking Amlodipine (Norvasc) for about 2 months. Norvasc (Amlodipine Besylate 5 mg) did lower my blood pressure from 150's over 80's to 120's over 60's. That's great.  Problem is with side effects every day. Intestinal cramps, diarrhea, gas. Begins about 5 hours after I take the pill. Stomach (intestines ?) roll constantly for about 3 hours.  I am going to try splitting the pills in half and see if lower dosage stops the side effects. If not, I guess I'll go back to the doctor and try something else for blood pressure. It seems like all of these blood pressure pills have side effects of one kind or another.",
                    "I began taking this amlopidine for high blood pressure about a year ago. It worked fine for several months til I started having swelling and pain in my feet and legs. I was having some attacks of gout and thought that was it that causing the problem but the pain and swelling went on long after the gout. I got to where I could hardly walk. My wife noticed that swelling was a side effect. I quit the medicine immediately, and noticed a huge difference within a week. I have been off the medicine for 3-4 mths, but still have some problems with swelling and pain although not near as severe. I have also have developed knots in my calves while on this medicine that has not went away since stopping the medicine. I fear I have irreversible damage.",

Told Dr I was healthy running 1/2 marathons and now can barely run 3km due to above. Told Dr I just didn't feel right. Told benefits outweighed side effects. August went to Urgent Care & asked them to do Lyme test cuz of aches and neck pain - negative. Thanks giving week elbow pain unbearable, trouble walking downstairs knees hurt, knees and thighs swollen. Called Dr. Went off. Immediately fog lifted, still anxious as I don't feel right. Joints still achy & knees hurt. Back/neck trouble past two weeks hoping they'll go away and I'll feel better. HATE amlodipine. Started on HCT, see Dr next week.",

Doctor says give it a little while longer. One day I almost passed out, got light headed and felt like I was in another dimension! Doctor says he can't say for sure it was a side effect of this medicine. I will keep trying it for awhile longer.",

The doctors have prescribed many different high blood pressure medications for me over the years and none have stabalized my pressure. About a month ago, they changed me to Norvasc 10MG.

I feel as if I have my life back now.",
                    "This medication has many side effects and I think that I had them all. Redness of the face, swelling of ankles and hands, severe knee pain, nausea to name a few. My left knee had so much fluid I had it aspirated three times and not one Doctor said a word. I read some posts and decided to stop taking it and I felt better in a few days and my knee doesn't hurt. 5mgs of poison every morning......",

Then, I went up to 10mg per doctor's orders, and the headaches stopped. If this keeps up, yes, this is a miracle. Have suffered with migraines almost 40 years--and have tried lots of meds including Imitrex which was a lifesaver and Botox which helped initially but not for very long. As for side effects, no swelling--maybe a little fatigue. I was on loads of Excredrin and probably 3 Imitrex a week. So glad to be able to get off these meds. Still keeping them around just in case but am very encouraged with amlodipine.",

I was having severe side effects from using Benicar over the past 5 years and asked my doctor to place me on another medication. After about three weeks I noticed redness, dry and dark circles under my eyes, had feelings of depression, hallucinations, insomnia, irritability, and a racing heart beat at times. My fiance told me that on one occasion while sleeping on my back I stopped breathing for a few seconds. I have vivid dreams and wake up with brief sleep paralysis. I also have been itching a small dry patch of skin on my back. I'm 37, and work out 2-3 times per week. My BP is usually around 120-30/90. I'm going to have my doctor switch me to another med.",

My BP is 125/72, but I have put on 60 lbs in the last two years. I do suffer from Graves Disease of the Thyroid. This is not related to the medication. The point is, when I got down to 114 lbs, I actually stopped taking Amlodipine; my bp was normal. The weight loss was due to Graves Disease ( Hyperthyroidism). Then I had radiation treatment, gained weight now my bp is elevated again. I now started taking Amlodipine Besylate again, same dose since 2011. The only side effect I noticed is it makes me somewhat hypervigilant, but nothing to be concerned about.",

My mother has it and she has kidney failure and my grandmother died from a stroke. Both were caused from it being uncontrolled. I found out when I went to visit the dentist that it was high. I went to the hospital because of chest pains and it was 141/101 which was extremely high for my age and my weight size. This medicine has lowered it to 126/76 which is great for me!! I wish the bottom number would go to 70 but I am about to speed up the exercising to help out. I take it at night because it MAKES ME SLEEPY, which is something that I don't mind.",

Its a no win situation but what does help and helps substantially is weight loss and walking. Walking is the best thing since sliced bread - highly recommended. With this medication a little exercise goes a long way. Great reason to walk the dog.",

Then my doctor said take 5mg norvasc like before but add 2mg coversyl - that made me have palpitations very tired fatigued and out of breath, headaches and felt like someone is strangling me and felt anxious. Basically couldn't function so I went back to just 5mg and going to see cardiologist. I feel like a guinea pig trying different medicine with no results. I'm still tired out of breath sometimes laboured breathing BP is still high, get cramps in stomach, I must have gone to hospital and my doctor so many times.",

I was prescribed 5 mg., and the first day of taking it, and every day since, I have had major heart palpitations. Not a nice feeling. I also feel WIRED. So far, not liking this medication at all! Why do medications, to treat illness and symptoms, bring an entirely new set of problems?",

I also have migraines, but since taking this, my headaches have decreased dramatically. I rarely have a migraine any more. It's been a blessing! I love this medication. It's worked wonders for my quality of life.",
                    "Did nothing for Bp but does cause ankles and feet to swell a lot. Thought I gained weight (happily) nope, it was the fluid retention caused by amlodipine. That's not great because fluid retention can make Bp rise.",

I have been under the hospital for really bad tongue and mouth ulcers, for the last 2.5 years and also under the hospital for a badly bloated stomach, I look like I am 7 or 8 months pregnant, (both side effects) all tests have come back ok. My balance is terrible and recently had two bad falls in a week! I have constant ringing in my ears, cramp in my feet at night, feel tired and have to have a sleep most afternoons, Swollen feet and ankles. Researching the side effects of Amlodipine has made me realise all these symptoms are probably due to this awful drug. Will be seeing doc next week to get it changed",

Mixture of white coat syndrome and an IBS episode I was in the middle of, plus whatever else is the cause of my HBP. Dr said go to the ER! I declined. He did an EKG and all was fine. Dr prescribed 10mg of Norvasc and Coreq. I went home and took my bp it was 170/100. Took 5mg of Norvasc and 50mg Toprol I was already on. BP came down to about 140/95 in about 12 hours. Pain by my pancreas for 12 hours a few days into it. Feet and ankles swollen like balloons. 4/14 on 10mg my bp averages around 133/86, feet still swollen by night. Feeling A LOT better. Finally, something that works for me. No other side effects",

However, the side effects were terrible: frequent urination, constipation followed 10 minutes later by uncontrollable diarrhea, blurry vision, cough, fatigue and sleepiness. When I would go out, I would not take the medicine. I found out that Amlodipine was causing my problems when I took an airplane flight. I did not take it because I did not want to go to the bathroom when we were flying. I didn't take it for 2 days and almost all my symptoms disappeared. I took it again and all the problems came back so I stopped taking it. O was put on Clonidine and that did not lower my BP but gave me a cough and sleepiness.",

Now, right then and there the doc should have taken me off Norvasc, because it is contraindicated for AS.  I told my PA, who took me off & put me me on lisinopril. Murmur went away. (Well, until a few years later when I was put on cipro/flagyl and had a horrible time with the flagyl.)...Saturday I asked the doc if he could hear a murmur...NOPE! Very early Thursday morning as I was being admitted, I now had a murmur. Not as loud as the previous one. Hopefully, after I recover from the current nonsense, I will be able to rid myself of this murmur as well.  I hope.",

I went to urgent care and they suggested I go to the ER. At the ER they did a lot of tests and couldn't find anything. 48 hours after taking amlodipine blood pressure still hasn't gone down.

Like all meds, this will effect everyone differently, but from what the Dr's tell me, it's the one with the least number of side effects. The following are things I have noticed since taking this drug. 1. My legs seem a little weaker than before but have not noticed significant swelling which is one of the main side effects. 2. At night I have discomfort in my legs generally the thigh muscles. Not pain but discomfort like I ran on a treadmill for an hour. Nothing that keeps me awake. Overall, it works for me.",

I lost 8 pounds of water over the next few days and low and behold, blood pressure went way, way down! I hit as los as 109/59, which prompted me to stop another BP med, losartan, which turned out to have been causing my chronic leg pain! I am now only on chlorthalidone, with a bp a bit high at 135/82, not sure which way to go next. Maybe try cutting salt.

I had daily headaches. Was on high doses of daily tryptans. A year ago, my bp started to rise (150/90 vs 110/60) and I got worried bc tryptans are generally contraindicated in patients with high bp.

                    "I have been taking Amlodipine for at least 10 years. I think I have to quit taking it. My blood pressure goes up after I take it. It was 148/74 before I took it. It's been 195/88 this evening. Don't know what to do. I have adverse reactions to Lisinipril, and Losartan didn't lower it at all.",
                    "67 yo female diagnosed with (freakishly) high blood pressure. 266/177. 10 mg. amlodipine was prescribed along with Losartan and a few others. Pressure has been under control, but the side effects have been horrendous: Swollen gums, pain in calves, dizziness, shortness of breath, extreme fatigue, unusual weakness, belching, gas, cracked, dry and itchy skin, changes in my vision. Swollen feet and ankles...I could go on. My cardiologist discontinued it today and what a difference! Much, much better! Whew!",
                    "Novask like all meds have side affects works great on me..lowered my stubborn pressure from 238/110 down to 140/90 in 4weeks. Its very effective. I found that taking 5mg in the am and 5mg at night are more effective with less side effects No results on lopressor after a year on that stuff. .bad side effects.",
                    "On it for two years now, was lightheaded at first but that went away quick and have had only swelling in my feet every now and then. I just put my legs up a little then it goes away, this doesn't cause me any pain. Other than that no side effects not even having any problems getting an erection, wife likes that. She was worried about that at first. No problem with other meds either so far. Also it works best with exercise.",
                    "I'm 25 years old and I'm taking 10mg of Norvasc and 25mg of hydrochlorothiazide and at the moment I'm not liking either of the medicines. Between stuffy nose, sore throat, increased thirst, dry mouth, severely dry skin, blurred vision, it makes me feel like its worse than having high blood pressure. My side effects are symptoms of an allergic reaction so maybe someone else might have better luck than me.",
                    "Face flushes and felt incredibly warm! Meds dropped my BP but I couldn't live with the nuclear glow from my face! Doc moved me to other meds.",
                    "I suffered for three years with bleeding and red spongy gums. It got worse as time went on...even developed small painless ulcers. Finally, after going to 5 different doctors, a periodontist told me to stop Amlodipine. My gums are fine now. Of course, I had to get periodontal work done to the tune of $1125, but by that point, I would have paid double to get to the bottom of it.",
                    "Started taking amlodipine 5 mg for high blood pressure and to my delight it has reduced my migraines to about once a month instead of 3-4 per week! I have been on other meds for high BP but they did not lessen my migraines (verapamil, lisonpril, bystolic to name a few). I am so happy this drug has helped with my migraines. I had given up hope on finding a migraine preventative. To fellow migraine sufferers: Keep trying different high BP meds until you find one that works for you.",
                    "It makes me sleepy. I get phlegm all the time. It's hard to function on a daily basis once I've taken it. My doctor doesn't believe it's the medicine and won't change it but yet she isn't trying to find any other results as to why I'm feeling this way. I've switch my time for taking it. I now take it around 4 pm. I still have to fight to stay awake but at least it isn't all day.",
                    "I started taking Norvasc after trying many other meds. including Topamax which had too many bad side effects for me. So far since starting about a month ago; I have only had 1 headache and that was at the very beginning. No side effects. I was having headaches which was affected by weather pressure; about 1 a week. So nice not to have them and to feel good on this medication.",
                    "I am having (for me), serious side effects from this medicine and I have only been taking it for 30 days. Fatique, flushing, fluid retention and severe swelling of the feet and ankles. I go back to the doctor today. My doctor gave it to me for high blood pressure.",
                    "I was put on a 5mg dosage on a Friday. By Monday I was contacting my doctor telling her that I could not take the side effects. Migraine level headaches, lightheadedness, dizziness, racing heart. I suffer from graves disease and hypertension. This medication made me worse. Would not recommend it at all.",
                    "I have had hormonal migraines sine I was 17. I would have horrible migraines through my menstrual cycle each month.  I developed high blood pressure & my doctor prescribed Linsinopril & when that didn't lower it enough he added Amlodipine.  I took it for about 9 months and never had a migraine which was wonderful.  BUT, I developed waves of severe fatigue and was feeling crappy all over much of the time. I developed swelling in my feet & ankles & my diastolic blood pressure was almost 100 all the time. I researched the medicines I've been taking & decided to monitor my blood pressure & stop the Amlodipine. I instantly felt better & my blood pressure actually went down. Don't know if migraine will return. Not worth the side effects!",
                    "I used amlodipine for 6 months during which I developed \"football feet\", swollen ankles, lower legs. Since onset was gradual, I did not realise how much oedema I had accrued. I stopped taking amlodipine - swelling in my lower limbs were rapidly back to almost normal, almost because of 3 varicosities on my left ankle, for which I now must use an ankle brace. I told my doctor that I had quit because I was unhappy, and he said that he was very happy and that I needed help for moderately high blood pressure. I then suggested that HE try amlodipine. He once had me use ezetrol , and I stupidly continued for almost a year before realising I had become severely affected. I now give new meds a trial period and tell the doc if I am not amused.",
                    "I've been taking this medication for about 4 months. The First month was fine it brought my blood pressure down to acceptable numbers. The side effects started gradually. I was really forgetful and would sometimes feel confused. Then the trembling in my legs started them spread to my arms went from trembling to twitching really fast then it spread to my face. During this time anxiety is slowly creeping in it was getting a little worse everyday until it was a constant feeling. Pressure in my head constantly and full blown panic attacks by month 4. I discussed this with my doctor and I stopped taking this medication 2 days ago and was prescribed something else. I can feel my anxiety subsiding. ",
                    "At first I got fantastic results. I have severe Raynaud's and was basically house bound. It even presented in warm weather. At first the Norvasc totally removed the symptoms.  They seem to have come back, however, and it is mid-summer. I also take Ritalin for narcolepsy and I fear that it may be causing some of the symptoms. I would recommend trying this medicine for Raynaud's. I take 5 mg per day.",
                    "No side effects. Blood pressure fairly well controlled on 5 mg of this only.",
                    "The medicine works rapidly and the 5mg daily dosage is still effective for me after several years of treatment. There's only been a few occasions that I've experienced any side effects after the first few initial doses of medicine. The one I experienced most was sleepiness. Otherwise, I take one pill every evening at bedtime and I'm fine until the next dose.",
                    "No side efects as of yet (taken for 4 weeks so far) only taken while on high doses of steroids (80mg daily but deceasing 10mg every 3 days. Keeping my BP in my normal range of 110/60.",
                    "I was prescribed amlodipine ironically after a heart attack possibly caused by zomig .When I was taking it thought it was weird I was no longer getting migraines . When I was told to come off it by the cardiologist , the migraines returned . It's changed my life . The only side effect is oedema ( swollen ankles) a small price to pay . Been on it for 15 years now",
                    "Been on amlodipine 3 years. Initially basileate but got pain and itching in hands and arms like RSI. Allergic to basileate. Now on amlodipine maleate and no probs. Slight swelling in ankles but remedied with additional candasartan 16mg. Feel lots better. Worth checking out the maleate if probs with itching tingling and pain in upper limbs.",
                    "It has lowered my blood pressure, which was crazy high (upper number 210 once and otherwise always in the 190's). Everything was fine at first. But now I'm so tired it hurts. I am actually so fatigued that I am close to not being able to function. I have also noticed some double vision (comes & goes). ",
                    "Norvasc caused extreme leg and ankle edema and did not improve hypertension much. After 6 weeks of use I was put on lisinopril and within 2 days had no more leg swelling and blood pressure lowered greatly. So far so good on new medication.",
                    "I was prescribed amlodipine after lisinopril hctz and Losartan both caused severe hair loss and insomnia. After taking a dose, I would experience a severe headache for 20 hours, plus stomach upset. However, my hair was not falling out, nor did I have insomnia. It took about 2-3 weeks for the headaches and upset stomach to stop completely.It took about 6 weeks for my blood pressure to be in the normal range. No side effects currently. The only thing I'm not happy about is I haven't been able to lose weight while on Amlodipine, even though I'm strictly dieting. Prior to starting this drug, I had been losing nicely. But I suppose I'd rather be fatter with a full head of hair, than thin and bald. :)",
                    "After taking Norvasc 10mg for 3 months I found my feet ankles and hands were swelling up, also gained weight even though I walk every day. My Doctor has put me on Avapro and I will monitor it for the next 3 months. ",
                    "My doctor put me on Amlodipine 10mg in February 2013 and it has been great for my blood pressure. I have no problems with any side effects.",
                    "Writing again, I guess amlodipine has something to do with my sleep stages. I feel some changes in the depth of night sleep. Before taking this med, I was generally having very deep and unconscious type night sleeps and regular migraines in the base of skull (occipital nerves) after awakening in the morning. Whenever I was very tired and feeling very sleepy before going to bed in the night, I woke up in the mid night due to severe pain in the base of the skull. Whenever I suddenly awaken from deep sleep due to external interruption, I found myself a bit confused for some time. With amlodipine, I have moderate depth of sleep and don't get confused if suddenly awaken / interrupted from sleep. No migraines so far.",
                    "I have not had any issues with this drug. I've been taking it for over 3 years..I do know that when I eat right, and put less salt in my system, my blood pressure get's really low, like two numbers at the top and bottom, so I will take it every other day which will regulate it to 120/80",
                    "Have been on Amlodipine for about 2 years. At first it worked wonderful. Now experiencing rapid heart beat, headache, tingling in upper body some weakness. also elevated pressure at times. Will have to try something else. Tried many before this one. ",
                    "I take 10 mg amlodipine daily, 300 mg irbesartan and 20 mg nebivolol daily. The amlodipine seems to do me the most good. There is some ankle swelling. I am a 76 yr old male.",
                    "I have been on Amlodipine for several years in addition to a diuretic and ARB for high blood pressure. Although it does lower blood pressure slightly, its main effect to me was to cause swelling of my ankles and feet. That became entirely unacceptable to me a couple of months ago. The edema was so bad that bending my ankles was uncomfortable. Upon stopping the drug, I can once again see my ankles and the veins of my feet. I cannot believe that a drug that produces one of the side effects of congestive heart failure can be a good drug. I am never taking it again.",
                    "The first 2/3 days were very encouraging. It helped me a lot. but afterwards I had severe side effects, chronic diarrhea, vomiting, nausea etc. generally feeling really crap, so that i had to stay home for a couple of days. Even a reduction in dosage didn't help much. switched to verapamil, which works similarly, but practically without side effects for me.",
                    "Amlodipine 5mg and 10mg caused continuing and annoying swelling of feet, ankles, and calves. I am finally changing it in favor of a different medication.",
                    "This medication is cheap which is why they recommend it so much since it saves the insurance companies a bundle. My BP didn't move at all. Side effects include left shoulder pain. Loss of hair, eyesight going bad due inflammation of the cornea, weakness, tiredness to the point of delusion. The doctor had be go from 5 to 10 mg and that made everything worse. Three days after stopping it my shoulder pain went away and so much energy returned. my mother was put on it from her doctor and had similar results. After she stopped taking it she no longer needs her walker. I'm 63 and she is 88 going on 29.",

                    "Took one 5 mg pill at 11 am, became immediately tired. Fell asleep. Had VERY VIVID dream. Feel pain in kidneys. Getting a tension headache now just 2 hours later.  Reading other reviews I can't believe this medicine is legal. Diet and exercise is the better choice.",
                    "I took exactly one pill and woke up the next day with the worse headache : top of my head hurt, temples were squeezing, had pressure in my eyes, and couldn't tolerate sounds. How ironic that people take this to prevent migraines! I was done after 1 day. This came after 4 days on metoprolol (sp), which had left me exhausted and short of breath, so I wasn't exactly 100%. B.P. went up somewhat the day I was on this. Headache left as soon as I went off it. (Was put on valsartan right after, and had terrible back/spine pain from that.) I think I am done with meds. Maybe I'll do yoga.",
                    "Blood pressure dropped from, 190/110 to 158/81, heart rate dropped form 97 to 58. I was waking up at night out of breath, this stopped. I was having a lot of phlegm, this was reduced. I can't say enough about this medicine. My breathing is greatly improved. ",
                    "I have been taking one 5 mg pill, twice a day for headaches about 3 years and am very pleased with the results. That coupled with very low sodium diet has done the trick for me. I don't exercise much. No ill side effects, but one side benefit, after taking this medicine my outbreaks of psoriasis have completely gone away.",
                    "30 minutes after taking one 5MG tablet, I suffered chills and had to sleep in a jacket in an attempt to stay warm in July. The chills continued from 10PM to 6 AM the next morning.  ",
                    "I did a lot of research. Amlodipine seems to be the best migraine preventative for those of us with stubborn nearly daily migraines that don't seem to respond to the typical medications, at least in the long term. I was on two other preventatives for years: Inderal and Amitriptyline. I am now weaning off of both these other medications. I was getting about one headache a week for the first couple weeks at 10 mg, now I think it's been two weeks since my last one. No side effects for me. It's a miracle. Verapamil seems to have the same effect, but requires very high doses up to 720 mg/day. You MUST try this medication if you have tried the others without lasting effects.",
                    "Was taking lisinopril which didn't help my blood pressure... it actually went up a little to 190/84. It gave me shots of chest pain and a pounding heartbeat. My doctor quickly took me off and put me on Amlodipine, which lowered my blood pressure to 134/74 in 2 weeks, and NO side effects! The pounding in my chest GONE! A true wonder for me!",
                    "I would get migraines weekly and when it wasn't a migraine it was a headache that turned into a tension headache and later lead back to a migraine. I tried everything and was put on everything. Finally, I tried amlodipine and the next day, no headache no migraine. I was amazed. I take it every night before bed. I didn't feel dizzy and haven't had any swelling. I was worried cause my blood pressure runs low already, but I'm doing so much better now and no side effects.",

                    "With the DASH diet and exercise my BP was still high and the doctor increased my daily 5mg of Norvasc to 10mg. It helps decrease my usual 170/104 to approx 150/70 but only for a few hours. I am fatigued, headaches and super cold feet and hands constantly. I also have muscle cramps. I feel as if I had a heart attack a few days ago but my doctor says its gastritis. The side effects are worse than hypertension itself! Maybe I need a new medicine and/or a new physician. Good health to you!",

On amlodipine I really went downhill, severe joint pain every joint is affected and leg and ankle swelling are really terrible. Achy all the time most especially in low back and legs to the point I simply can not walk anymore. I take a few steps and the legs ache so bad they lock up and I must rest to take another step. Eventually I get home but really I can't even walk anymore and have gained weight and flab.losartan is not lowering my bp and I really feel death would be a kinder more desirable event. Who wants to live with this chemical straight jacket 24/7? The fatigue is so constant I look forward to going to bed.",

No other side effects. Feel good and thankful BP is down. Would like to try 5mg at 8am and 5mg at 8pm. Will discuss this with my doctor. But so far, absolutely no complaints - just a positive experience.",
                    "I've been on Amlodipine for almost 8 days now. I've had nausea off and on and this is my 2nd night of insomnia (luckily, not in a row), but it really sucks. My BP is down and I feel great other than the insomnia. I'm on 5 mg. wondering if the 2.5 mg would work? Anyone know if lessing the dosage would work?",

I have almost PASSED OUT 3 times, VERY EXHAUSTED, DEPRESSED, CALF HURTS, felt a doom and gloom feeling, really SUCKED, CRIED ALL DAY for no reason. Only took it for 5 days 2.5 mg. Going to quit and start working out a little instead. Thank you to everyone who posted, I was SO RELIEVED to hear my symptoms had a cause that could be fixed. ",
                    "I am a 24 year old male with high blood pressure. I started Amlodipine back in October 2014 and it did an excellent job to lower my pressure. I was perfectly fine taking 5 mg each day for the first several months. Then around June of 2015, I started getting pains in my upper left and right chests, headaches began to hit me, and I began to develop an anxiety problem. I am typing this review 3 days after I have now stopped taking Amlodipine. The past few weeks have been worse than a nightmare for me - my anxiety has reached severe levels, the pains in my upper chest, shoulders, and forearms was becoming unbearable, I've been continuously nauseous for nearly 2 weeks now, had high-pitched ringing in my ears, and was completely depersonalized.",

Then being diagnosed with high blood preasure I ran the gambet of a few different drugs to figure out what worked best for me. In the fine tuning stages of treatment I was prescribed Amlodipine in combination with another drug. Life changing!!!!! I had migraines at least 3 times a week and suddenly I realised it had been 2 weeks, then 3 then a month, then 2......no headache! Why oh why did it take all this time to figure it out! So very Happy with my new life!!!!!!!",

I have been feeling uncomfortable heat in my feet, my skin has been extraordinarily dry and I have been feeling sluggish and sick. I was prescribed Amlodopin because the Losartan I was taking gave me a chronic cough.",

My doctor wanted to me try this medication for a month to see if my blood pressure would lower. Within a week my blood pressure which usually hovers at 140/80 with a pulse of 80 shot to a ridiculous 200/98 with a pulse of 98. My blood pressure will always spike around the evening. My anxiety worsened and I got headaches. This medication does not work for me and I am not going to be tricked into staying on it longer.",
                    "Wanted to post my experience. I started on amlodipine, 10mg, in January 2011. Everything was fine and my bp was 115/78. Sometime late 2012, I started experiencing lightheadedness, foot and ankle swelling, my asthma worsened and I had severe pelvic pain. Spent three months and quite a bit of my deductible trying to figure out why. A friend suggested it may be time to change my bp medication. I went to the doctor and she told me the formula had been changed for generic amlodipine late last year and many of her patients had experienced problems with it, had to discontinue the medication. I've been on Metoprolol and I haven't had any issues so far.",
                    "Many won't read this far into the coments, but I found Amlodepine to work well by taking it in a different way. I, too, had some strong side effects on (1) 10mg or (2) 5mg daily. Swollen ankles were worst,, but nausea, tiredness, etc were culprits too. I asked my doctor what the smallest pill (mg) was. It is 2.5. I started using 4 in a day, but spreading them out. In other words, a 2.5 pill at 7am, 12pm, 5pm and 10pm (or approximate times spread out). I now actually only take 3 pills (7.5 total), but still spread them out. For me, it still has the right effect of bringing down the BP, but the side effects are dispersed out so they are MUCH more manageable. I sit in a soft chair or use the recliner to reduce ankle swelling.",
                    "I recently started this medication at the 5mg level and have now gone up to 10mg. I feel better and don't feel like I am not so distressed when doing small chores like before. Only issue I have had is I am so tired.",

                    "Having started on 5mg of the medicine and finding benefit, my doctor moved me to 10mg once a day, then the changes started. My condition became serious with continual coughs and no sleep, my blood pressure was very good at 137/68 but my quality of life was useless.",
                    "I have been on amlodipine for nearly a year. Doctor said to avoid sodium and exercise/diet. I take 2 x 5mg pills in the morning and 1 x 5mg at night. Blood Pressure has done very well. As long as I stay away from sodium, I have no swelling in ankles/feet. Heart doctor said to stay away from chips, bacon and soup. I am 74 and do not exercise regularly I need to lose about 30lbs. I am so tired, how do I exercise? It takes all I have to make something to eat. The one side effect I noticed was 'skin rash/itch'. I have this scalp problem, with little pimples that I scratch. Dermatologist said dermatitis; I use prescription shampoo. Scalp problem started just after starting the generic amlodipine. ",
                    "Started amlodipine after stopping lisinopril due to throat swelling after taking for one year. Amlodipine took 5 days to begin working on lowering my blood pressure after introduction. My dosage was 5mg once daily. It didn't lower my blood pressure very much. Went from 165/111 to 145/100 in 5 days.  Side effects included: Very sore arms and legs Lower legs felt sore and full of blood (heavy) Facial flishing Profucious sweating from feet and hands Headaches Notable lack of energy and sleepiness , nervousness  I recommend using this drug ONLY if it's your last resort and you don't need an immediate drop in blood pressure. Remember everyone is different this may work well for you. Long walks seemed to help with the sore legs.",
                    "Using 5mg since 8 months. It prevents me from severe pain in the base of my skull (perhaps occipital neuralgia). The important point to be noted in my case is the timing of taking the medicine. I mostly get the pains in early morning while in deep sleep. Before taking this med, I would wake up in severe pain that would last until I take a painkiller. Than I started taking amlodipine 5mg at night. However, I need to take the medicine about 10~12 hours before the onset of the pain. If I am late, I would get the pain on the same time in morning in spite of taking the pill. However, in such case, the pain gradually diminishes as the time approaches to the required time.   Looking forward to hear from those suffering from similar conditions.",

After chatting with my Pharmacist and Doctor we started me on Amlodipine 10mg daily. This was maybe two years ago. After losing weight and starting to exercise more, I am now down to 2.5mg daily and no negative side effects. I recently started to supplement magnesium in the morning and evening and my pressures have further reduced.",
                    "I have been taking Norvasc for probably 30 years. The first 20, the drug worked to lower my blood pressure well. In the last ten years, I've been plagued with scorching legs. It has literally ruined my life. Doctors never even had a clue and I never thought it was Norvasc that was hurting me until I had trouble a week ago getting the prescription filled I was out of for 4 days. On the 4th day without taking it, my legs were feeling pretty good. I got my prescription refilled took the pill and the next day, I was back to debilitating pain. I haven't taken it since. I am now feeling pressure in my head as I've always been prone to migraine headaches. I never got one after I started taking Norvasc. I think I'll take the migraines.",
                    "I was prescribed 10 mg Amlodopine for high blood pressure. Relieves the blood pressure but I get terrible headaches since taking Amlodopine, no matter if I take in the morning or in the evening. Still the excruciating headaches and cannot sleep. What to do?",
                    "Without taking this my blood pressure was 156 over something. After two weeks it was 132 over something. I'll take the side effects, a little light headedness, over a stroke any day. No swelling to report and I've been on this for about 20 days.",
                    "Norvasc has lowered my blood pressure from 160/102 to about 110/80 on 10 mg. The side effects are debilitating for me. I have horrible chest pains and unable to do much without exhaustion. I have lost so much weight due to lack of appetite. Dr. does not want to take me off because I have difficulty finding anything that lowers my blood pressure. I am also on Atenolol.",
                    "I was prescribed 10mg Amlodipine to treat Coronary artery spasm after 2 myocardial infarctions at 35 and 37 years. First came nausea, which lasted about 2 weeks, however, the chronic insomnia and horrific, extremely vivid nightmares began almost immediately and are still persisting even though I stopped taking it about 6 days ago. Another side effect I experienced was extremely stiff and sore feet - I thought I had developed painful arthritis overnight and walking on them was horrible. I also experienced extreme fatigue all day every day, making it near impossible to care for my three children at home who are all under school age. I thought I was losing my mind. Feeling a bit better every day. This was a very scary experience for me.",
                    "I am a mid-fifty male post open heart (4 mths ago) and stents (3 weeks ago).I have been on Norvasc 5 mg for about 10 days now as the predecessor drug's side effect were horrible. It has been very effective at lowering my BP (117/75) the side effects are still concerning. Dizzy, tired, maybe some depression & anxiety, slight problem with deep breathing and week muscles. Although I can function normally the day-to-day functions are an effort so I push through. The mornings (when I take Norvasc) are not as good as the afternoon when I feel better. I believe the side effects are getting better but am unsure. What I want is to be normal again and active. They say it takes a few week for the body to adjust. I'll give it its due course.",
                    "FYI -- I tried various high blood pressure meds, most with some serious side effects. Amlodipine was helping better than any previous, but had some nausea, swelling, dizziness, etc. Decided to try taking 2.5 pill 4-four times daily instead of one 10mg pill. Made a huge difference. Seems my body can handle everything with only slight side effects by doing this. My doctor said he'd never had a patient do it this way, but due to my good effect, has now put several patients on Amlodipine in this manner. By breaking it up, the body seems to be able to tolerate it well. May not work for everyone, but for me it was such a blessing.",
                    "Taking for three weeks. Lowered the bottom number of my blood pressure almost too low. Average now is 116/63. Caused some dizziness, light-headed and little shortness of breath. Slowed pulse down also. Good medicine but don't want dizziness. ",

At annual checkup blood pressure was over 200--but I had just taken a bad fall and had big time bruises and a hematoma (excuse bad spelling) on hip. Dr bumped up amlodipine to 10 mg. Within 10 days noticed significant swelling of ankles and feet and experienced pain on the inside of legs (the entire length of the leg). Cut dose to 5 mg and pain gone next day, swelling reduced. Two weeks on 5 mg and blood pressure 135/70. Another week on 5 mg and 130/69. Feet and ankles still somewhat swollen, frequent leg cramps every night. Considering going back to 2.5 mg.",

I have been trying to switch to another medicine and haven't had much luck. I pray I can find a medicine as good as Norvasc. I can tell you that numerous blood tests have been run and while this medicine MAY cause cramps, my blood sugar, cholesterol, liver panel, metabolic panel, CBC, creatinine, etc. are all perfect! I have a lot of faith to the fact that this medicine will not harm you other than possibly muscle cramps or fluid retention. I experienced no fluid retention BUT I exercise.",

Have been taking Amlodipine for 2 months and the side-effects are way less but not totally gone. Have had trouble sleeping, some tiredness, constant numbness/tingling in left hand and weight gain (assuming water gain?). Trying to tough it out but may end up not taking BP meds at all. (Was in the 140/90ish range when starting the drugs).The side effects do not make me feel right.",

Two months ago I was prescribed Amlodipine for high blood pressure, I had headaches and dizziness with being physically tired. Today I do not have the headaches, but occasionally experience dizziness if I move fast, or get up from setting, or lying down. Usually only last a few minutes at a time, but I must sincerely and happily let those who read these comments that this medication works. My blood pressure even on other medications such as Atenolol did not work as good, my blood pressure was normally between 140 and 150 everyday. Today it is hitting below 120/70 regularly and usually in the low 100/60 or lower.",

Also tried all generic brands, but the filler in all maintenance medication causes an Adverse Reaction, called Myalgia. Pain in the groin and upper legs, so must stay on Name Brand, Norvasc. Now Kidney Disease, Stage 4, blood pressure often rises, usually because I get off my strict diet. It will go up to 200/100, but generally it stays 134/73. I am 76 years old, so that 134/76 is a perfect blood pressure for my age, especially with Kidney Disease. Norvasc has been a life saver for me.",

Was on 1 and 1/2 weeks I had severe headaches. Tremors,blurred vision, stomach pains, burning in my legs, had red burning spots form on my lower abdomen then blisters.

It only brings it down to around 160/90- down from 230/150. Too bad I can't just take more. Everything we've tried to add, headaches and headaches, and aches and pains.  I don't get symptoms from from my BP. More like a rush, if anything. Why would take something that makes me feel that way? Quality of life, you know? I'm a 50 year old woman in reasonably decent health but for this",
                    "I've been taking 2.5mg for a month with great results and no side effects, until the weather got colder so the doctor increased dose to 5mg, partly because he wanted a better result to my high blood pressure as well. The sudden increase has caused severe sleepiness and a tight chest. I cut back to 3mg for now to ease into it and will increase to 5mg if/when the side effects decrease. I believe in caution and I know my doctor takes the same stand.",

Took new med on the afternoon late, and within 2 hours it was down to 117/70. I thought that was fast because Doc said to give it a few days to start working. Second day I noticed myself becoming edgy and almost scared. Anxiety was started creeping in. Started feeling tingling infingers and feet. The third day the tingling turned to slight numbness in those areas. I also got severe headaches to the back of my head. Legs and arms felt very weak as well.

I had an initial period of being light-headed for a few weeks when I first started the medicine, but after that, no problems whatsoever. Keeps my blood pressure around 115-70. My bottom figure had been around 95. Benicar is more expensive than a lot of the other hypertension medicines, but it is well worth it for me.",

Maybe I'll need the 20mg but love the focus and energy I have again and the looser bowels are an additional perk! Knees stopped hurting from arthritis too.",

I think that is why I finally realized every time I would take a pill I would wake up during the night with severe leg cramps. I told my doctor about it and he changed my prescription to plain Benicar. After that I take it regularly and have no side effects or problems at all and it keeps my blood pressure level at 110/70.",

I started out taking Benicar 20/12.5mg and the 12.5 HCTZ caused dizziness and light-headedness after several days of use. So I requested the plain Benicar 20mg without the HCTZ diuretic and I have felt much better, no problems at all. My blood pressure has stayed at 120/78, and often it is even lower.

I was determined to tackle the blood pressure issue. I started exercising and eating healthy (not a diet). A month later, I had dropped 16 lbs and 18 points on my blood pressure; however, the Doctor put me on Benicar (20 mg). It's been a week and about the only side effect has been feeling light headed. Some mornings I also feel sluggish. My pressure has gone down to 148/94. Although I have a way to go, I lost another 4 lbs in this week.

I've fought my weight every since I started taking it. I started having problems keeping my blood pressure regulated. My doctor added 1 tablet of Benicar HCT 20mg. I couldn't believe how much it dropped my blood pressure. Breathing back to normal. My blood pressure now runs 120's/70's. My heart rate runs in the 70's. When I exercise it raises to 80's. I feel so much better. I think this will allow my body to burn fat and function more normally. Love the way I'm feeling now.",

My best pressure was 138/90. The first week we tried Benicar HCT 40/25, I could tell a big difference. My best pressure was 128/78. After losing some weight, pressure dropped as well. 116/68. I started feeling extremely dizzy. Broke the pill in half and dizziness improved. Doctor will need to adjust dosage and hopefully will be able to discontinue use by end of year if weight loss continues. My appointments are now 3 months instead of monthly. Overall, I am pleased with my progress since I started taking Benicar.",

One day a few years ago I came down with painful gout. My new doctor took me off Benicar right away. She said it contributed to my gout flare ups because it affected my kidneys. I was so angry because I didn't know and hadn't read up on it. Have your kidneys check regularly while taking this med. Now through diet and another BP med I do well with the Gout, however I wish I hadn't taken Benicar so long and had it affect my kidneys. Be careful!",

Daily descending stairs also a vertigo nightmare. Blood pressure can easily go into 214/105s in emergencies, so I would like to find something to reduce those numbers, without the extreme dizziness. I work in a psychiatric setting, so I have to be alert and to move quickly without falling on my face.

I take it in the mornings and do not have a problem with drowsiness, even though I'm really prone to this side effect with other medicines. I just wish my insurance covered it on their formulary. As it is I pay $45/month. This, in combination with the diabetic medicines and supplies, really takes a toll on my budget. But I guess the results are worth it. As a state worker in California, though, I may have to investigate less expensive options soon! ",

My doctor first put me on Lisinopril, which caused my lungs to feel like they were full of fluid, after having difficulty breathing I stopped that medication. Then the Dr put me on samples of Benicar and it dropped my blood pressure readings to normal and I didn't notice side effects but the insurance wouldn't approve it. So they approved losartan, which seems to have no side effects but barely reduced my blood pressure, it worked but not very well. So they got the insurance to approve Benicar, but after taking it for almost 2 months it has caused me to have irritable bowel syndrome, if I stop taking it, I improve, start taking it it gets worse.",

I do experience dizziness and light-headiness frequently but I sit at a desk most of the day at work so it's no big deal. I also cannot stay out in the sun long at all. I don't know if this is a side effect of Benicar but also 2 years ago I started getting vision \"Floaters\" and had to change to another prescription twice. I'm only 43 and my vision is no longer 20/20 and can only get 20/40 with corrective lenses. Eye doctor doesn't see anything wrong and says 20/40 is okay. I'll get a 2nd opinion just in case.

Also facial flushing, pounding head, sleeping badly with vivid dreaming. Apart from not Iowering my blood pressure, 165/80 I seemed to be getting every side effect and was despairing that this was it for the rest of my life. I spoke with my GP who was unaware of Olmesartan, I think due to the fact that its a more expensive drug, she reluctantly prescribed it for me. Its been a month now my BP averages 115 to 125/60 no side effects apart from slight light headedness. Got my life back !",
                    "I give this medicine a 5 because it does lower your blood pressure but unfortunately the side effects are pretty bad. I was diagnosed with hypertension at 25 and before benicar I never had a dizzy spell in my life. Now dizzy spells are just part of life as well as fatigue and breathing issues. It's not all the time but a few times a week I just feel unwell. I think this is a good medicine for an older person who just needs to get the numbers down but it's terrible for a young active person.",
                    "I have been on Benicar for about a year now and I have to say it has helped my blood pressure. Blood pressure is 120-130 and over 70-75 average. My pressure was not dangerously high but my doctor recommended I go on it since it is in my family history, I am 40.",
                    "Have been taking Benicar for over a year now. Blood pressure is controlled and I have had no side effects that I can tell.",
                    "I have been using Benicar for about a year now and it is great. It is one of those medicines that I can't TELL I'm taking. No real side effects, I was taking it at night before I went to bed but I was waking up to go to the bathroom a lot. Now I take it mid morning and I still have to go to the bathroom a lot but at least it isn't waking me up. On the days I forget I realize it because I'm not going to the bathroom 1/2 as much as when I do. For whatever that's worth. Great medication though and glad I started after being very resistant about going to the doctor.",
                    "This is the 4th anti-hypertensive I've tried and I am happy so far. NO side effects, I feel great! Glad I checked here for reviews before trying this medication.",

                    "My PCP started me on Benicar 20mgs/12.5 HCTZ on November 30th. My blood pressure before I took the medication was 145/84, after that it's 135/83-138/85. So far the only side effect I've had is occasional facial flushing. I'll keep monitoring to see how it goes after a full three months on it.",
                    "When I first started on these medicines they worked fine, but 18 months later the medicines are no longer controlling my blood pressure very well at all.",

                    "Dry, hacking cough! It took about a year for this side effect to develop, and about 6 months to realize it was the Benicar. I should have known, as Lisinopril and Diovan made me cough previously. I had taken Hyzaar for 2 years, but had to switch because of insurance issues. I did not have the coughing with Hyzaar.",
                    "My blood pressure was controlled at 120/80, but... after 18 months on Benicar, I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis (not good). So to remedy the UC, I had to take a drug that cost $8000 per year because doctors did not know at the time that Benicar causes UC in some people.   I think people should be aware of this very BAD side effect before starting Benicar.",
                    "I've been on Benicar HCT 20mg/12.5mg for 3 week now this medicine has some bad side effects I've experienced light headed, dizziness, cough feel like my chest feel tight sometime muscle aches tired all the time..does anybody else experience these side effects..when you tell your doctor what your experience they thinks it's not the medicine we know our bodies..",
                    "Noted that many concerned about the price of Benicar. Go on their website and you can get a coupon that will reduce the co-pay on your Benicar to no more than $25 per month assuming you have health insurance.",
                    "As of today, it's two weeks since I started taking Benicar 40/12.5mg. Wow, what an experience. I don't take any other medicines for ANYTHING. I do take vitamins and supplements. My blood pressure now is so great that it helps me deal with the side effects better. I have lightheadedness, spontaneous increase in heart beats, light muscle aches all of these I didn't have before taking Benicar. It took at least a week and a half for my system to adjust. I'll continue on with it and hopefully after significant weight loss I will come off altogether. Until then, I'll take the 123/75 blood pressure any day!",
                    "Suffered most of the side effects.",
                    "Not compatible with moderate alcohol. I haven't had a hangover in over 10 years. After two pills, I had a doozy.",
                    "I was taking a different pill at first but my doctor decided it wasn't working to lower my pressure enough, so they said we are going to try you on this one. I took one the next day since I had already taken my old pill. The first day the pill did lower my blood pressure with no problems. The second day I took it my pressure was still at a good number. I did not later when I tried to sleep I couldn't. Each time I would fall asleep it was hard for me to breath and a few times that I woke up my heart was beating differently and I had some pain in my chest. I won't be taking this medication anymore. I will lower it the natural way by watching what I eat, walking and with God's help I will be just fine.",
                    "I have taken both Olmesartan (Benicar) and Losartan (generic Angiotensin II receptor antagonists) to replace earlier ACE Inhibitor drugs, which invariably caused a chronic cough for me. I went off Benicar in 2015 because my insurance designated it as non-preferred and it was extremely expensive, but I have recently discovered that it is now available as a generic. Olmesartan has given me better and more stable control of moderately elevated blood pressure than Losartan.",
                    "I have been using this medicine for almost 2 years with no side effects, which I am prone to from drugs, because of multiple organ issues. I take it at night which keeps me from worrying about getting drowsy during the day.",
                    "I have been taking Diovan HCT for the past 10 years; varying doses as my BP continued to increase with age. Diovan was giving me debilitating migraines and the weight gain was out of control; even though I am a vegetarian and walk about 3 miles a day. Life on Diovan was miserable. Two weeks ago I persuaded my doctor to switch me to Benicar HCT and to start me on the lowest dose. My BP while on Diovan HCT hovered around 190/102 the highest was 200/105 which was becoming rather common lately. So my doctor also prescribed Bystolic. Three hours after taking Benicar HCT, my blood pressure slowly dropped to 133/80. I am not used to \"normal\" blood pressure, so I felt like I was drunk. Quite a nice feeling from such a small pill...LOL.",
                    "I have been taking Benicar 40 mg for about 4 years. Dizziness is the only occasional trouble. Never had any problems associated with drinking alcohol even after some all-night vodka binges - no hangovers either. That was some years ago. I don't drink much nowadays. Blood pressure alternates but is never above 130/80. Interestingly, after running 7 miles (I do it once a week or so) systolic count is often below 110 and diastolic in the low sixties within 5 minutes of the run. I am 56. I am thinking of lowering to 20mg. ",
                    "Have been using Benicar 20mg for a couple of years now (age 47). Slight dizziness first week after hard exercise in sun (bike riding up steep hill, singles tennis in 85 degree sun). Doctor suggested taking at night before bedtime. Now no problems. Was 140 /95 . Now 122/70 still exercising (tennis, biking) 3-4 days per week without dizziness. Feels like no side effects. Love it.",
                    "I took 20 MG Benicar as an alternative to Lisinopril which caused a cough. With Benicar, the cough went away after a few weeks but a new side effect took its place: I would wake up in the middle of the night with a sore chest and upper back pain. Its a shame because during the day, Benicar had no apparent side effect and kept BP at 128/79.",
                    "Beware!! This med worked well to lower bp, but I have been on 40mg for 3 years now this slowly caused problems I didn't catch on to immediately such as severe pain in feet top and bottom like planter fasciitis extremely painful to walk on. Stiffness in legs like bad arthritis pains woke up so stiff. Possibly caused depression weight gain and lack of sex drive. Fatigue. No energy also was diagnosed with under active thyroid. Also diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Stopped taking Metformin for 2 weeks now only noticed slight improvement in foot pain. Been off of Benicar for 5 days seeing improvement each day pain in feet going away also stiffness going away I'm 50 y.o female felt like 90 years old body in so much pain.",
                    "I have been on Benicar HCT for 2 years after being diagnosed with high blood pressure at 23. Side effects were dizziness, constant sleepiness, and weird heart beats, but it works amazingly. After dropping some weight I have just been dropped down just to regular Benicar and have no complaints. Awesome stuff. Now if they could only make it taste better.",
                    "Switched over to Benicar from lisinopril (which caused horrendous body jolting chronic cough) Cough has disappeared, blood pressure averages 116/74 to 124/80 maximum. Feel great, mild sleepiness by end of day - a plus - could not sleep well before, also constipation has disappeared. Cramping in legs below knees at night...somewhat like side effects of statin. Will check with doctor..this is my 2nd week of Benicar..took lisinopril for a month. Hope this continues to work. If I miss a dose I become keenly aware. Seems to take effect within an hour. I feel much better and blood pressure readily stabilizes. ",
                    "BP dropped over 100 pts for systolic and diastolic pressures after ONE dose of 20/12.5 Benicar HCT. No side effects at all. Has remained below 120/78 for a week at two daily dosages of 20/12.5 AM and PM. Shortness of breath is gone, all leg and feet swelling is gone, and no increase in frequency of urination. Absolutely no side effects and BP taken twice a day, AM and PM is around 113/63.",
                    "I started Benicar two weeks ago for extremely high blood pressure 220/105. After two weeks my blood prezssure is now down to 140/80. I do feel much better. More energy. The only complaint I have are the muscle/leg cramps, aches I get every night. Nothing helps. I am on 40mg of Benicar once a day. I will call my doctor and see if there is any solution for the muscle aches. Otherwise I am very happy with the results.",
                    "I have been using Olmesartan for 9 months. I am a 63 year old male with no prior medical history. My lifestyle has always been healthy (intake-wise) but increasingly sedentary and stressful and I think these factors are what exacerbated my BP. Otherwise I was healthy: non-smoker, low alcohol, average weight etc. My wife finally convinced me to get a routine medical check-up (last check-up approx. 5 or 6 years previously) and the result was the doctor discovered high BP ( Systolic 190, Diastolic I can't remember - but the message was clear - my BP was dangerously high). So the doctor prescribed Olmetec 40mg, once-daily at bed-time - and arranged a follow up appointment for a fortnight later. I went home and immediately ordered a BP monitor",
                    "I have been taking Benicar 20mg. for 2 1/2 yrs. Dr. switched me from lisinopril hydrochlorothiazide after prostate surgery. My blood pressure has remained in the 120/75 range the whole time. The only side effects I have noticed is a change in my sex drive and leg cramps. The lack of sex drive could be from the surgery, Or the fact that I am almost 72 years young.",
                    "Good medication! Keeps my blood pressure in a safe range. Have experienced FEW side effects.",
                    "I've had high Bp for 20 years and controlled it with exercise, karate, but finally went to Dr with buzzing in my ears, my Bp was 260/160. Olmetec brought it down to 120/70 in a few days, after a workout my Bp is 90/60. I've been taking it for a month now and feel so relaxed, like chilled out all the time. But arms and legs feel like lead when working out and I tire real easy but I knew taking Bp meds would do this, but at 260/160, that was too risky. Many comments here I agree, sex drive goes to zero, feeling of lethargy but the drug works. I did try coversyl first and that had absolutely no affect on me.",
                    "Was put on Benicar 20mg twice a day after suffering a stroke, works great with other meds that I'm taking due to stents. Tried other blood pressure meds, but none of them works as well as the Benicar",

Now it has got her BP under control, however the Insurance Companby refuses to pay for it twice a day, saying it has no effect. We have proof that in her case it does.We challeged their refusal to no effect.",

                    "Started on Benicar 7 days ago after 3 years on Cardizem Dl 360. So far my blood pressure has not responded well especially my diastolic. I am a nurse so I take my blood pressure daily. I have a history of intolerance to drugs and have to change medications freguently.",

                    "//What is it?//This is an increase in blood pressure above values \u200b\u200bconsidered normal. It occurs when there is excessive pressure of blood on the walls of the arteries during circulation. It can increase at certain times, due to physical or emotional exertion, and it is natural that, after these situations, its values \u200b\u200breturn to normal levels. This condition is only serious and causes health problems when it remains high for months, or when it increases suddenly. It is important to know that tension tends to increase with age. However, hypertension should not be considered normal in the elderly. As a rule, arterial hypertension is considered to be present when the maximum pressure is greater than or equal to 160 mmHge/or the minimum pressure is greater than or equal to 95 mmHge. High blood pressure is associated with coronary heart disease, stroke and heart failure and is the most common modifiable cardiovascular risk factor, which is why its treatment is essential in preventing these pathologies. Cardiovascular diseases are the cause of death for at least 34.1% of the Brazilian population, mainly as a consequence of stroke and coronary disease. It is estimated that the prevalence of high blood pressure in the Portuguese adult population is 42.1%, with only 39.0% of these patients taking antihypertensive drugs and only 11.2% being under control.//Symptoms//In the first few years, it does not cause any symptoms. Over time, blood pressure ends up damaging the blood vessels and the main organs of the body, such as the brain, heart and kidneys, causing headaches, dizziness, tinnitus and increased heart rate. The main diseases associated with high blood pressure are stroke, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, heart and kidney failure.//Causes//Around 90% of cases are related to lifestyle habits. Obesity is one of the important factors. Each pound of fat requires the formation of an additional 1.5 kilometers of small blood vessels to supply the excess adipose tissue. Increased blood pressure is required to pump blood through them. Therefore, being overweight by 20% or more increases the risk of hypertension by five times;;/ Excess salt consumption. It is known that high blood pressure is less frequent in populations where its consumption is low. Our body only needs 1/8 of a teaspoon of salt per day;;/ Tobacco is another cause to consider. Even just one cigarette can increase it for about 30 minutes. A pack-a-day smoker can, through smoking alone, cause an increase in blood pressure for 24 hours;;/ Around 5% to 15% of cases may be related to moderate alcohol consumption. On the other hand, one cup of coffee a day can cause an increase in blood pressure;;/ Physical inactivity and stress are also at its origin;;/ The remaining 10% of high blood pressure cases have organic causes, such as some hormonal changes, kidney or blood vessel diseases.//Diagnosis//It is important to remember that high blood pressure cannot be felt, it must be measured. In order to obtain correct values, it is important to rest in a sitting position for at least five minutes before measuring. You should use the same device and always measure on the same arm. The diagnosis of high blood pressure requires measuring an elevated blood pressure on three separate occasions over a period of a week or more. Once its existence has been confirmed, other tests must also be carried out to help understand its origin and/or the complications associated with it.//Treatment//Treatment depends on the severity of the condition. For example, people with moderate hypertension can control it by simply changing some lifestyle habits, such as reducing salt and alcohol intake, controlling their weight, exercising regularly and stopping smoking. There are several medications available for the treatment of high blood pressure that can be used alone or in combination. It is up to the doctor to decide which is the best treatment for each situation.//Prevention//Since most cases have their origin in lifestyle, it is important that it is healthy. All the recommendations mentioned in the treatment prevent the onset of this disease.

I didn't take it today to see if it would help. I was able to exersice without my heart rate sky rocketing to ridiculous numbers. This is the first medication like this I have ever taken.

I will say that I prefer to see a Cardiologist for this because I am terrified of exercising.

I never even thought about side effects as being the problems I was experiencing; thought there was always something else that the Doctor's was overlooking. Now that I have read these comments, I suffer from most of the common ones; tiredness, weakness, trouble losing weight, strange dreams, increased sweating, difficulty breathing, etc. Have had numerous tests off and on for the last two years, and nothing is ever found. I have also since then started taking clonidine and amlodipine. Some of these symptoms are probably drug interactions. I noticed a chaotic heartbeat when clonidine was added to the medicines.

I take 50mg of Metoprolol 2 times a day on a regular basis but add another 50 if I have the biggies and that settles the heart rate down quickly. Luckily I have no side affects but would love to find something else that quickly slows the heart rate ... mainly to avoid the pain and spooky stuff that goes a;long with it.

I take blood pressure and pulse 2times/ day and it is averaging 107/71, pulse 63- working well. It took me a good 4 weeks to adapt to the tough side effects though. I felt very tired to the point of falling asleep during the day, was worn out if I walked to far or even stood too long, felt lightheadedness, nauseated, was afraid to drive. I'm glad I stuck it out, the side effects finally abated. Hang in there, the bad side effects can go away. For the record I'm a 69 year old woman, 5`4\" 128 lbs. I take the pill at night.",

My BP is very high in the morning, like 167/110, before I take my daily dosage of valsartan. Within 2 hours of taking it my BP hasn't improved, then at about 5 hours after I take my BP med my BP plummets to like 71/54, sometimes lower. I fall asleep without even realizing it when it happens & sleep for about half hour. BP readings, about 4 times daily, shows PVCs at all times with an infrequent no PVC reading.

I had no side effects at ALL from this until the first week of June. Today is July 22nd. The first week of June, I was recovering from a sore throat and cough and then three weeks later, I realized that I was STILL hoarse and my voice was cracking. It is STILL like that as of today.

I still feel a little of that about 12 hours after I take it- I figure that is a slight \" withdrawal\" effect, it lasts about 30-45 min. & I don't have it every day. When I took the generic ( manufacturer, PAR) I felt on a roller coaster, up & down all day. The time release delivery feels to be much smoother with the brand name, toprol- I recommend it.

Cardiologist found source of my chest pain is a narrowed subclavian artery.  The chest pain completely stopped within 24 hours. The only real side effect is difficulty sleeping if instructed to take it at night. I switched to taking it first thing in the morning and I now sleep like a baby. I give it a 9/10 solely for that side effect. I did feel very lethargic when I first took it, but that went away completely after 2 days or so once my body got used to the meds.

If you're having side effects, give this medication a couple months to work. It will get better. Make sure your doctor monitors your triglycerides and blood sugar while on any beta blocker.

After this I went to a cardiologist who gave me 50 mg Metoprolol to take as needed. I am happy that i don't have to take it daily because it does make me sluggish on the very rare times that I do-I am pleased to have a solution when these events happen and my fears of dying suddenly from a heart episode have been drastically reduced.",

Halving the dose has not changed this; I am hoping to be off it, or at least on an even lower dose, after my next cardiology appointment in June. I think it is making me forgetful. That has definitely been a problem since taking it, although I was a bit of an absent-minded professor before.

The medication works great to keep my heart rate and blood pressure down to normal levels, however, for the first month on the medication I constantly fell asleep during daily activity, and even now I maintain a sense of perpetual fatigue. Hard to lose weight, and depression creeps up often. Brain fog has slowed my ability to focus and react swiftly, which is frustrating.

I ended up only taking Toprol for 8 months and I had no more migraines or palpitations and of course my blood pressure was under control. It stayed that way for about a year and a half until I became pregnant and that seemed to trigger it all back. But I did the same thing and am fine now and I never experienced any side effects.",

I got prescribed Metoprolol Tartrate twice a day at first and it was a nightmare. It actually had like a reverse reaction on me and gave me constant flutters for a whole day. The doctor told me to take Magnesium twice a day with it and it would help and it definitely did. I eventually switched to the extended release, once a day, along with Magnesium and I couldn't be happier. I feel a lot more relaxed and normal. Had few palps still with Tartrate but not with Succinate (yet). I wanted to wait to write a review because I know I relied on reviews. Hope this helps!",

I've never had a problem eating or swallowing in my life. The cardiologist I was seeing ignored me and said that's not a side effect. After two ERr trips w what felt like my throat closing was told to half the pill and wean off, because the drug was causing my issues. I took it for 3 weeks and have been off now now for 10 days but still can't eat. had an endoscopy and they found there is little to no pressure in esophagus & attribute this to the drug.

Came off the opioids and find I have diarrhoea which seems to be the medication. I also developed vertigo 10 days ago. It's reduced in severity, but is still hanging around. Again seems likely to be the medication. Off all things meant to help me sleep, Metoprolol has made for some difficult sleepless nights, not something I've ever had before. At the same time it's controlling my heart rate and BP, and so far no more AF. My first week home from rehab I also suffered the anxious feeling, which was an unpleasant, crawly feeling in my chest. It seems to work though.",

A few hours before I am to take my next dose I begin to feel depressed, very cranky and angry and generally just awful. Once I take the medicine though those feelings tend to go away. It also upsets my stomach and I have had a mild loss of appetite. I have also noticed that some foods taste different. I am also having a problem staying asleep, but I seem to fall asleep easily.

I would wake at about 2 am and not be able to go back to sleep for several hours. Always tired, then would want to eat. I gained 20 pounds in a couple of months.

Also it gives me terrible nightmares, very violent. I'll wake up wondering how I could even have such terrible dreams. It also makes me tired.

I checked the brands of the former medications and the new and found they were different.

Average BPM was 190 and upon reaching 235 BPM I would start to loose consciousness. I tried all varieties of maneuvers to trigger the SVT to stop but none worked. If it laster longer than an hour I was transported to the ER where I was given Adenosine to restart my heart. I was given an Rx for Metoprlol Tartrate a few months before my first ablation when I was 20. I was started on 25mg/day. 9 days after my ablation, I had more episodes and was bumped up to 50mg, 100mg, then 150mg/day before my second ablation when I was 21. Had it been unsuccessful, I'd have been switched to an Ace-inhibitor.",

                    "Make sure you review your dosage with the doctor. As the others stated, it will make you tired and lethargic. It also has had an effect on my ability to have a discussion without forgetting a word or two. My doctor gave me a dosage of 100mg/2x daily. I wound up back in the hospital due to my heart rate being a low 32 beats per minute. The hospital treated it as a failure with the original stent and went back in to check the previous operation. That was over a year ago. We tweaked the prescription down to 50 mg once a day, but I never got out of the lethargic state.",

I had suffered severe chest pain for two hours before going to the ER, which was stupid of me. I have been on Metoprolol Tartrate for 2.5 years now. 25 mg. twice daily. It seems to work fine, as my blood pressure is consistently around 116 over 64, and my heart rate is 54 BPM at last check-up two months ago. Before my heart attack, it was around 150 over 80, so a vast improvement there. I also am on a low dose (10 mg. daily) of Lisinopril, so that may help as well. The only side effect I am experiencing is severe exhaustion following a 10-hour shift at work. Age 57.",

Kept BP at home and was fine. Every time at the Doctor's it was like 150/90 never understood this. Last time was placed on Lisinopril, this kicked my butt, dizziness, ear ringing, dry cough. Said heck with it and found a Cardiologist. He took me off the Ace Inhibitor and put me on Norvasc 10mg, will see how it works.",

This med caused me to be quite tired/fatigued. In the beginning I was also dizzy but that eventually went away almost completely. The sleepiness has not gone away but it's manageable. The good it does for my heart outweighs the side effects for me.",

I also take flecainide and it has some of the same side effects as metoprolol so it's hard to tell which medication is causing this. Sometimes a little hard to focus but together they seem to help with the Atrial fibrillation. ",

Everyone warned me about how tired I was going to be since this medication would literally be slowing my heart down but I've never experienced that. I don't sleep much and have insomnia so that could be why. I also have experienced crazy dreams and I sleep walk from time to time. I've always had dreams and talked in my sleep but I think the medication makes it a little worse especially if you're taking it closer to bed time. I do get a little light headed if I stand up quick and bend down but it's not bad. The benefit I get from this medication outweighs any of these insignificant side effects. I would recommend to push through any side effects and let the medication adapt to you!",

American doctors refuse to give me the prescription. I finally had to go to another country to obtain the prescrption.I absolutely hate the American medical system. I pay a fortune for insurance only for them to not care for me. I am discusted by our greedy, price fixed, non caring medical system.

I haven't felt this calm and comfortable in years! Doctors really need to stop assuming that anxiety is the diagnosis of everyone's problems. There's a bit of drowsiness and fatigue in the beginning but that goes away as your body gets used to it. I am very happy with this medication.",

I tried taking it in the morning, but it made me feel weird and heart felt heavy. I switched to night time. It does help me sleep. I was initially tired, but that wore off.

I figured out the only change I'd made was taking metoprolol so I weaned myself off of it and the depression cleared right up.

I'm tired, and have a lot of trouble focusing on my work during the day, have a lot of restless nights of tossing and turning, and have now developed a rash under my arms. I think it also contributes to erectile dysfunction. I spoke to my cardiologist about all this today, and he's cutting my dose in half.

Next 2 episodes, 30 yr old, more severe, ER - negative tests. Next 5 episodes, 40-50 yr old increasing severity, ER. During the last ER visit, I heard about a new type of Doc, an electrocardiophysiologist. I wore a monitor for 6 weeks before it finally \"caught\" the SVT. I started on Toprol 50 mg per day. But then, I had an episode of severe low BP (80/40) - back to the ER. My new Doc said to split dose, take 25 mg AM & PM. No episodes past 20 years. I'm a happy camper !",

I was determined to tackle the blood pressure issue. I started exercising and eating healthy (not a diet). A month later, I had dropped 16 lbs and 18 points on my blood pressure; however, the Doctor put me on Benicar (20 mg). It's been a week and about the only side effect has been feeling light headed.

My best pressure was 138/90. The first week we tried Benicar HCT 40/25, I could tell a big difference. My best pressure was 128/78. After losing some weight, pressure dropped as well. 116/68. I started feeling extremely dizzy. Broke the pill in half and dizziness improved.

One day a few years ago I came down with painful gout. My new doctor took me off Benicar right away. She said it contributed to my gout flare ups because it affected my kidneys. I was so angry because I didn't know and hadn't read up on it. Have your kidneys check regularly while taking this med. Now through diet and another BP med I do well with the Gout, however I wish I hadn't taken Benicar so long and had it affect my kidneys. Be careful!",

My blood pressure is consistently about 110/70 (sometimes lower). No side effects. I take it in the mornings and do not have a problem with drowsiness, even though I'm really prone to this side effect with other medicines. I just wish my insurance covered it on their formulary. As it is I pay $45/month. This, in combination with the diabetic medicines and supplies, really takes a toll on my budget. But I guess the results are worth it. As a state worker in California, though, I may have to investigate less expensive options soon! ",

My doctor first put me on Lisinopril, which caused my lungs to feel like they were full of fluid, after having difficulty breathing I stopped that medication. Then the Dr put me on samples of Benicar and it dropped my blood pressure readings to normal and I didn't notice side effects but the insurance wouldn't approve it. So they approved losartan, which seems to have no side effects but barely reduced my blood pressure, it worked but not very well. So they got the insurance to approve Benicar, but after taking it for almost 2 months it has caused me to have irritable bowel syndrome, if I stop taking it, I improve, start taking it it gets worse.",

I don't know if this is a side effect of Benicar but also 2 years ago I started getting vision \"Floaters\" and had to change to another prescription twice. I'm only 43 and my vision is no longer 20/20 and can only get 20/40 with corrective lenses. Eye doctor doesn't see anything wrong and says 20/40 is okay. I'll get a 2nd opinion just in case.

Also facial flushing, pounding head, sleeping badly with vivid dreaming. Apart from not Iowering my blood pressure, 165/80 I seemed to be getting every side effect and was despairing that this was it for the rest of my life. I spoke with my GP who was unaware of Olmesartan, I think due to the fact that its a more expensive drug, she reluctantly prescribed it for me. Its been a month now my BP averages 115 to 125/60 no side effects apart from slight light headedness. Got my life back !",

It's not all the time but a few times a week I just feel unwell.

Now I take it mid morning and I still have to go to the bathroom a lot but at least it isn't waking me up.

My blood pressure now is so great that it helps me deal with the side effects better. I have lightheadedness, spontaneous increase in heart beats, light muscle aches all of these I didn't have before taking Benicar. It took at least a week and a half for my system to adjust. I'll continue on with it and hopefully after significant weight loss I will come off altogether. Until then, I'll take the 123/75 blood pressure any day!",

I did not later when I tried to sleep I couldn't. Each time I would fall asleep it was hard for me to breath and a few times that I woke up my heart was beating differently and I had some pain in my chest. I won't be taking this medication anymore.

Diovan was giving me debilitating migraines and the weight gain was out of control; even though I am a vegetarian and walk about 3 miles a day. Life on Diovan was miserable. Two weeks ago I persuaded my doctor to switch me to Benicar HCT and to start me on the lowest dose. My BP while on Diovan HCT hovered around 190/102 the highest was 200/105 which was becoming rather common lately. So my doctor also prescribed Bystolic. Three hours after taking Benicar HCT, my blood pressure slowly dropped to 133/80. I am not used to \"normal\" blood pressure, so I felt like I was drunk. Quite a nice feeling from such a small pill...LOL.",

Blood pressure alternates but is never above 130/80. Interestingly, after running 7 miles (I do it once a week or so) systolic count is often below 110 and diastolic in the low sixties within 5 minutes of the run. I am 56.

With Benicar, the cough went away after a few weeks but a new side effect took its place: I would wake up in the middle of the night with a sore chest and upper back pain.

Also diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Stopped taking Metformin for 2 weeks now only noticed slight improvement in foot pain.

                    "Switched over to Benicar from lisinopril (which caused horrendous body jolting chronic cough) Cough has disappeared, blood pressure averages 116/74 to 124/80 maximum. Feel great, mild sleepiness by end of day - a plus - could not sleep well before, also constipation has disappeared. Cramping in legs below knees at night...somewhat like side effects of statin. Will check with doctor..this is my 2nd week of Benicar..took lisinopril for a month. Hope this continues to work. If I miss a dose I become keenly aware. Seems to take effect within an hour. I feel much better and blood pressure readily stabilizes. ",
                    "BP dropped over 100 pts for systolic and diastolic pressures after ONE dose of 20/12.5 Benicar HCT. No side effects at all. Has remained below 120/78 for a week at two daily dosages of 20/12.5 AM and PM. Shortness of breath is gone, all leg and feet swelling is gone, and no increase in frequency of urination. Absolutely no side effects and BP taken twice a day, AM and PM is around 113/63.",
                    "I started Benicar two weeks ago for extremely high blood pressure 220/105. After two weeks my blood prezssure is now down to 140/80. I do feel much better. More energy. The only complaint I have are the muscle/leg cramps, aches I get every night. Nothing helps. I am on 40mg of Benicar once a day. I will call my doctor and see if there is any solution for the muscle aches. Otherwise I am very happy with the results.",
                    "I have been using Olmesartan for 9 months. I am a 63 year old male with no prior medical history. My lifestyle has always been healthy (intake-wise) but increasingly sedentary and stressful and I think these factors are what exacerbated my BP. Otherwise I was healthy: non-smoker, low alcohol, average weight etc. My wife finally convinced me to get a routine medical check-up (last check-up approx. 5 or 6 years previously) and the result was the doctor discovered high BP ( Systolic 190, Diastolic I can't remember - but the message was clear - my BP was dangerously high). So the doctor prescribed Olmetec 40mg, once-daily at bed-time - and arranged a follow up appointment for a fortnight later. I went home and immediately ordered a BP monitor",
                    "I have been taking Benicar 20mg. for 2 1/2 yrs. Dr. switched me from lisinopril hydrochlorothiazide after prostate surgery. My blood pressure has remained in the 120/75 range the whole time. The only side effects I have noticed is a change in my sex drive and leg cramps. The lack of sex drive could be from the surgery, Or the fact that I am almost 72 years young.",
                    "Good medication! Keeps my blood pressure in a safe range. Have experienced FEW side effects.",
                    "I've had high Bp for 20 years and controlled it with exercise, karate, but finally went to Dr with buzzing in my ears, my Bp was 260/160. Olmetec brought it down to 120/70 in a few days, after a workout my Bp is 90/60. I've been taking it for a month now and feel so relaxed, like chilled out all the time. But arms and legs feel like lead when working out and I tire real easy but I knew taking Bp meds would do this, but at 260/160, that was too risky. Many comments here I agree, sex drive goes to zero, feeling of lethargy but the drug works. I did try coversyl first and that had absolutely no affect on me.",
                    "Was put on Benicar 20mg twice a day after suffering a stroke, works great with other meds that I'm taking due to stents. Tried other blood pressure meds, but none of them works as well as the Benicar",
                    "I just started taking this medicine, and it makes me dizzy.",
                    "Had some eye problems, especially when reading small print or looking at computer too long, my feet also hurt/swelled. Benicar has a particularly strong odor in pill form.",
                    "My wife tried Benicar once a day and her BP came up after 1 hour. Her doctor advised her to take Benicar twice a day (once in the morning and once at night). Now it has got her BP under control, however the Insurance Companby refuses to pay for it twice a day, saying it has no effect. We have proof that in her case it does.We challeged their refusal to no effect.",
                    "Has been effective, and with no remarkable side effects. ",
                    "Keeps my blood pressure down but for me, the best benefit is it has helped with my bowels. Every other medication I've had is constipating. This has normalized me.",
                    "I went to Doctor because of a four day headache. My blood pressure was through the roof. I started taking Benicar and within the same night I felt 100% better. My energy level is fantastic and I felt happier than I ever have. I have no side effects from this medicine.",
                    "Started on Benicar 7 days ago after 3 years on Cardizem Dl 360. So far my blood pressure has not responded well especially my diastolic. I am a nurse so I take my blood pressure daily. I have a history of intolerance to drugs and have to change medications freguently.",
                    "I was first put on lisinopril but it made me cough. Switched to Benicar and it has worked good. I take a half of 20mg in the mornings. No side effects to report. My blood pressure was just a little high and it lowered into normal range."

                    "//What is it?//This is an increase in blood pressure above values \u200b\u200bconsidered normal. It occurs when there is excessive pressure of blood on the walls of the arteries during circulation. It can increase at certain times, due to physical or emotional exertion, and it is natural that, after these situations, its values \u200b\u200breturn to normal levels. This condition is only serious and causes health problems when it remains high for months, or when it increases suddenly. It is important to know that tension tends to increase with age. However, hypertension should not be considered normal in the elderly. As a rule, arterial hypertension is considered to be present when the maximum pressure is greater than or equal to 160 mmHge/or the minimum pressure is greater than or equal to 95 mmHge. High blood pressure is associated with coronary heart disease, stroke and heart failure and is the most common modifiable cardiovascular risk factor, which is why its treatment is essential in preventing these pathologies. Cardiovascular diseases are the cause of death for at least 34.1% of the Brazilian population, mainly as a consequence of stroke and coronary disease. It is estimated that the prevalence of high blood pressure in the Portuguese adult population is 42.1%, with only 39.0% of these patients taking antihypertensive drugs and only 11.2% being under control.//Symptoms//In the first few years, it does not cause any symptoms. Over time, blood pressure ends up damaging the blood vessels and the main organs of the body, such as the brain, heart and kidneys, causing headaches, dizziness, tinnitus and increased heart rate. The main diseases associated with high blood pressure are stroke, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, heart and kidney failure.//Causes//Around 90% of cases are related to lifestyle habits. Obesity is one of the important factors. Each pound of fat requires the formation of an additional 1.5 kilometers of small blood vessels to supply the excess adipose tissue. Increased blood pressure is required to pump blood through them. Therefore, being overweight by 20% or more increases the risk of hypertension by five times;;/ Excess salt consumption. It is known that high blood pressure is less frequent in populations where its consumption is low. Our body only needs 1/8 of a teaspoon of salt per day;;/ Tobacco is another cause to consider. Even just one cigarette can increase it for about 30 minutes. A pack-a-day smoker can, through smoking alone, cause an increase in blood pressure for 24 hours;;/ Around 5% to 15% of cases may be related to moderate alcohol consumption. On the other hand, one cup of coffee a day can cause an increase in blood pressure;;/ Physical inactivity and stress are also at its origin;;/ The remaining 10% of high blood pressure cases have organic causes, such as some hormonal changes, kidney or blood vessel diseases.//Diagnosis//It is important to remember that high blood pressure cannot be felt, it must be measured. In order to obtain correct values, it is important to rest in a sitting position for at least five minutes before measuring. You should use the same device and always measure on the same arm. The diagnosis of high blood pressure requires measuring an elevated blood pressure on three separate occasions over a period of a week or more. Once its existence has been confirmed, other tests must also be carried out to help understand its origin and/or the complications associated with it.//Treatment//Treatment depends on the severity of the condition. For example, people with moderate hypertension can control it by simply changing some lifestyle habits, such as reducing salt and alcohol intake, controlling their weight, exercising regularly and stopping smoking. There are several medications available for the treatment of high blood pressure that can be used alone or in combination. It is up to the doctor to decide which is the best treatment for each situation.//Prevention//Since most cases have their origin in lifestyle, it is important that it is healthy. All the recommendations mentioned in the treatment prevent the onset of this disease.

The first month was great then on October 21st my resting heart rate went from 61 to 70 and when I walk it suddenly goes to 140 for no reason. I work out 6 days a week and it doesn't make any sence to me. Going back to my doctor tomorrow to figure it out. I just don't see why all of a sudden it would make things 10x worse. I didn't take it today to see if it would help. I was able to exersice without my heart rate sky rocketing to ridiculous numbers. This is the first medication like this I have ever taken. Plus the weight gain is ridiculous. I lost 15 lbs before starting this medication and less then 2 months I gained it all back.",

I take 25mg. in the morning, and 25mg. about 11 hours later. The medicine has stopped my PVC's, and also slows down my heart rate. When I first started taking Metoprorlol Tartrate, it made me very tired, but after about 2 weeks, my body got used to it, and I was fine.",

                    "I was diagnosed with AFIB in 2012 at the age of 43, long sad frustrating story cut short, the doctor said there was nothing he could do about it. He sent me home to suffer with it. A couple of weeks ago I made an appt. with the clinic and the most wonderful nurse practioner started me on Metoprolol 25 mg/2x daily and \"I FEEL GREAT!\" I couldn't believe how my heart calmed down, my anxiety was relieved, I SLEPT BETTER b/c it stopped the night time AFIB attacks which constantly woke me up in the middle of the night and i just feel much more comfortable in my own skin...I actually cleaned the house without any huffing, puffing or the usual AFIB attack. I agree that it makes me drowsy which is becoming less severe I LOVE IT! :)",

However, @ 25mg I still have bouts of high readings, so when I see my PCP this week, she might raise it to 50mg. I will say that I prefer to see a Cardiologist for this because I am terrified of exercising. Yes, I know exercise and weight loss can lower my bp to healthy levels, but I can't understand I can exert myself while having high bp. Shouldn't it first be controlled with meds first before exercising?",
                    "I have been taking Metoprolol 25mg once a day for 13 days. It has lowered my heart rate by about 30 beats a minute but I am always tired, get chest pain, headache and numbness. Little to no benefit in lowering my blood pressure (140/95's).",
                    "I have been on some form of metoprolol for seven years. It was actually my first prescribed medication at 28. I never even thought about side effects as being the problems I was experiencing; thought there was always something else that the Doctor's was overlooking. Now that I have read these comments, I suffer from most of the common ones; tiredness, weakness, trouble losing weight, strange dreams, increased sweating, difficulty breathing, etc. Have had numerous tests off and on for the last two years, and nothing is ever found. I have also since then started taking clonidine and amlodipine. Some of these symptoms are probably drug interactions. I noticed a chaotic heartbeat when clonidine was added to the medicines. It has gotten worse for the past two years.",

At times though I have spells that usually run less than a few minutes with a heart rate of around 190 plus and pain. My worst battle with this level lasted about 15 minutes. I take 50mg of Metoprolol 2 times a day on a regular basis but add another 50 if I have the biggies and that settles the heart rate down quickly. Luckily I have no side affects but would love to find something else that quickly slows the heart rate ... mainly to avoid the pain and spooky stuff that goes a;long with it. I've had 11 angioplasties and 10 stents since 1990 and am 70.",

I take blood pressure and pulse 2times/ day and it is averaging 107/71, pulse 63- working well. It took me a good 4 weeks to adapt to the tough side effects though. I felt very tired to the point of falling asleep during the day, was worn out if I walked to far or even stood too long, felt lightheadedness, nauseated, was afraid to drive. I'm glad I stuck it out, the side effects finally abated. Hang in there, the bad side effects can go away. For the record I'm a 69 year old woman, 5`4\" 128 lbs. I take the pill at night.",

My BP is very high in the morning, like 167/110, before I take my daily dosage of valsartan. Within 2 hours of taking it my BP hasn't improved, then at about 5 hours after I take my BP med my BP plummets to like 71/54, sometimes lower. I fall asleep without even realizing it when it happens & sleep for about half hour. BP readings, about 4 times daily, shows PVCs at all times with an infrequent no PVC reading.

My doctor prescribed 25 mg of metoprolol for me and I started taking it in February of this year (2015). My blood pressure was lowered from 140/90 to 125/82, so it DOES work in that respect. I had no side effects at ALL from this until the first week of June. Today is July 22nd. The first week of June, I was recovering from a sore throat and cough and then three weeks later, I realized that I was STILL hoarse and my voice was cracking. It is STILL like that as of today. Indeed, one of the rare side effects is hoarseness! I called my doctor today and he switched me to Amlopidine.",

This has happened to me quite a bit recently, using metroprolol succ ER 25 mg daily, for about 2 years now. I did have great success in reducing my pulse (130 resting pulse for 20 years, adjust to 90 now). Overall I was happy with it, but now somewhat concerned with long term use.",

I still feel a little of that about 12 hours after I take it- I figure that is a slight \" withdrawal\" effect, it lasts about 30-45 min. & I don't have it every day. When I took the generic ( manufacturer, PAR) I felt on a roller coaster, up & down all day. The time release delivery feels to be much smoother with the brand name, toprol- I recommend it. All in all, it works well, keeps my heart in sinus rhythm, but it's a tough drug to have to take.",
                    "This drug has literally changed my life in a very short time. I was having horrible chest pains, with a mixture of general anxiety due to work/home stress. Cardiologist found source of my chest pain is a narrowed subclavian artery.  The chest pain completely stopped within 24 hours. The only real side effect is difficulty sleeping if instructed to take it at night. I switched to taking it first thing in the morning and I now sleep like a baby. I give it a 9/10 solely for that side effect. I did feel very lethargic when I first took it, but that went away completely after 2 days or so once my body got used to the meds.

I feel nervous having my natural rhythm manipulated but when it comes to the heart, I'll just do what they say. Had an attack of pericarditis 3 weeks ago and then Atrial fibrillation two days ago. I was told that this was normal after pericarditis. Metoprolol is recommended while heart recovers. ",

It does the job well, but the side affects are rough to handle sometimes. Such as dizziness, sleepless nights, daytime drowsiness, forgetfulness, and depression but, i'm still coping after about four years and i guess on for the rest of my life. But if i can manage after three brother suicides than so can you.",

Been on it for a year - the side effects are strange dreams (not scary...just strange) and exercise difficulties. My doctor recommended sticking with 80% of exercise target heart rate. If you're having side effects, give this medication a couple months to work. It will get better. Make sure your doctor monitors your triglycerides and blood sugar while on any beta blocker.

After this I went to a cardiologist who gave me 50 mg Metoprolol to take as needed. I am happy that i don't have to take it daily because it does make me sluggish on the very rare times that I do-I am pleased to have a solution when these events happen and my fears of dying suddenly from a heart episode have been drastically reduced.",

It lowered my b.p. by like 20 points/day, and I was fine for 2 days, but then had episodes of exhaustion to the point where I had to lie on the couch for hours to recover from simple housework like washing pots. Was also short of breath like I'd run 5 miles. Swallowing felt weird. Got disoriented while driving. It's a 9 on effectiveness, but can't tolerate the side effects. Am 63/F.",

The first month or so was tough as I had headaches, chest pains shortness of breath, etc. I think a large part of it was anxiety from a life changing surprise condition. No more headaches and anxiety is much, much better. I have a bit of shortness of breath, even when sitting at times, but I have been able to jog at the gym. Just started again this week and went 30 minute today. Overall, not sure if anything is working, but I am trying to just trust my Doctor and listen to my body.

I recommend it to anyone with my problem.",

Whenever I would do anything physical, my heart would beat so fast that I would frequently faint. I went to my cardiologist, and she gave me a holter monitor. She saw what I was talking about and gave me 50mg of Toprol-XL everyday. That was over 3 years ago, still on the same dosage, and it is wonderful. For the first few months, I was a little over tired, but that side effect quickly went away.",

At first, it made me very sleepy and dizzy, but I have gotten over that. It lowered my heart rate into the low 60's and 50's, occasionally upper 40's. Halving the dose has not changed this; I am hoping to be off it, or at least on an even lower dose, after my next cardiology appointment in June. I think it is making me forgetful. That has definitely been a problem since taking it, although I was a bit of an absent-minded professor before. It may also have helped lower my blood pressure, although I have made some diet and lifestyle changes that would affect that, also.",

I looked up the side effects of this med and I had 24 of the adverse effects!! I had become so weak that I had to use 2 walking sticks, could hardly get in or out of bed, couldn't walk a 100 ft.

Started out at 50mg, but had breakthroughs regularly, and went up to 100mg after a year. The medication works great to keep my heart rate and blood pressure down to normal levels, however, for the first month on the medication I constantly fell asleep during daily activity, and even now I maintain a sense of perpetual fatigue. Hard to lose weight, and depression creeps up often. Brain fog has slowed my ability to focus and react swiftly, which is frustrating.

I have hardly slept, after taking the medicine I get short of breath and feel like I'm having an anxiety attack, and I take the medicine at bedtime. In the mornings when I wake for the first two to three hours I feel shaky, sweaty, nauseous, and extremely dizzy.

There must be some difference in the release between the two. This med brings the BP into 120's over low to mid 70's range where I was reg 140's/90's.

It made me tired. I don't know if part of the problem is the doctors I have been seeing don't know what exactly is wrong with my heart and why it does this.

They scared me which just increased my anxiety. Finally my dr said I had slight tachycardia, my resting heart rate was usually around 100bpm and prescribed me metoprolol 50mg twice a day. The first week i hated this medicine. Swore it made me feel 'just not right'. I believe it was from reading negative reviews. After a couple weeks, palps gone, rating heart rate a around 60bpm.

                    "I have been on Micardis HCT (telmisartan/hydrocholorothiazide) for over 5 years. Lately my urine output has been less and I've developed a cough and leg cramp. The leg cramp I assumed was from strain from exercise and the cough from dust due to construction work in the neighborhood. However, after both conditions subsided the symptoms were still there. I checked the post marketing experience for Micardis and these symptoms were adverse signs. Will consult with my physician as the warning says these symptoms should be reported immediately.",

                    "//What is it?//This is an increase in blood pressure above values \u200b\u200bconsidered normal. It occurs when there is excessive pressure of blood on the walls of the arteries during circulation. It can increase at certain times, due to physical or emotional exertion, and it is natural that, after these situations, its values \u200b\u200breturn to normal levels. This condition is only serious and causes health problems when it remains high for months, or when it increases suddenly. It is important to know that tension tends to increase with age. However, hypertension should not be considered normal in the elderly. As a rule, arterial hypertension is considered to be present when the maximum pressure is greater than or equal to 160 mmHge/or the minimum pressure is greater than or equal to 95 mmHge. High blood pressure is associated with coronary heart disease, stroke and heart failure and is the most common modifiable cardiovascular risk factor, which is why its treatment is essential in preventing these pathologies. Cardiovascular diseases are the cause of death for at least 34.1% of the Brazilian population, mainly as a consequence of stroke and coronary disease. It is estimated that the prevalence of high blood pressure in the Portuguese adult population is 42.1%, with only 39.0% of these patients taking antihypertensive drugs and only 11.2% being under control.//Symptoms//In the first few years, it does not cause any symptoms. Over time, blood pressure ends up damaging the blood vessels and the main organs of the body, such as the brain, heart and kidneys, causing headaches, dizziness, tinnitus and increased heart rate. The main diseases associated with high blood pressure are stroke, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, heart and kidney failure.//Causes//Around 90% of cases are related to lifestyle habits. Obesity is one of the important factors. Each pound of fat requires the formation of an additional 1.5 kilometers of small blood vessels to supply the excess adipose tissue. Increased blood pressure is required to pump blood through them. Therefore, being overweight by 20% or more increases the risk of hypertension by five times;;/ Excess salt consumption. It is known that high blood pressure is less frequent in populations where its consumption is low. Our body only needs 1/8 of a teaspoon of salt per day;;/ Tobacco is another cause to consider. Even just one cigarette can increase it for about 30 minutes. A pack-a-day smoker can, through smoking alone, cause an increase in blood pressure for 24 hours;;/ Around 5% to 15% of cases may be related to moderate alcohol consumption. On the other hand, one cup of coffee a day can cause an increase in blood pressure;;/ Physical inactivity and stress are also at its origin;;/ The remaining 10% of high blood pressure cases have organic causes, such as some hormonal changes, kidney or blood vessel diseases.//Diagnosis//It is important to remember that high blood pressure cannot be felt, it must be measured. In order to obtain correct values, it is important to rest in a sitting position for at least five minutes before measuring. You should use the same device and always measure on the same arm. The diagnosis of high blood pressure requires measuring an elevated blood pressure on three separate occasions over a period of a week or more. Once its existence has been confirmed, other tests must also be carried out to help understand its origin and/or the complications associated with it.//Treatment//Treatment depends on the severity of the condition. For example, people with moderate hypertension can control it by simply changing some lifestyle habits, such as reducing salt and alcohol intake, controlling their weight, exercising regularly and stopping smoking. There are several medications available for the treatment of high blood pressure that can be used alone or in combination. It is up to the doctor to decide which is the best treatment for each situation.//Prevention//Since most cases have their origin in lifestyle, it is important that it is healthy. All the recommendations mentioned in the treatment prevent the onset of this disease.

I have only had intermittent pain and it was extremely mild in comparison to before this combination.",
                    "I have suffered severe pain for 20 years following a motorcycle accident. During this time I have tried every sort of pain relief available to me, mainly narcotic drugs which I found as bad as the pain itself. Earlier this year I was prescribed Lyrica as far as pain relief goes...fantastic. After a few months (1x 75mg cap per day) I experienced total confusion and was unable to perform my daily tasks at work or at home. I was becoming agitated and experienced suicidal thoughts. Things returned to normal after a week or so of not taking Lyrica. Because it worked so well I am tempted to give it another go. It was just so good to not feel the pain anymore.",

                    "For the past 3 years I have been dealing with nerve pain left from shingles in my neck. I have tried EVERYTHING for this pain including injections and narcotics. Nothing really helped unless I was a zombie. I am allergic to a lot of medications including Tegretol and Neurontin. So when my neurologist suggested I try this medication I was VERY skeptical. I have been on this medicaton for a week now. I started on 25mg twice a day and felt some relief. I thought it was in my head. Now I am on 50mg twice a day and I can't believe the difference. I am relieved I can finally get my life back. I am a mother of 2. I did not realize how much the pain had taken over my life until now.",

                    "Hi I have been on pregabalin for over a year. Started at 75 mgs and thought it was going to work but it only lasted 1  day. I got up to 150 mgs twice a day with no positive effect. I am now down to 100 mgs twice a day. I have had no weight gain. I am on a few other meds but I still suffer daily with this awful anxiety. I am trying transcranial magnetic simulation right now and have about 3 weeks of treatments left, it hasn't helped me yet. The only thing that works for me is benzodiazepines and I become tolerant very quickly.",
                    "I have a pinched sciatic nerve in my lower back due to a compression fracture, and also severe nerve damage in my left arm. After being on different narcotics that didn't work, I gave up and just lived with the aching in my arm that never stopped. My Doctor put me on Lyrica, and I swear, I started crying because I had NO pain in my arm for the first time since my accident: 5 years. Lyrica has been a God send for me. It helps both my back and my arm. When my Doctor increases the dose, the side effects go away after 2 weeks. I recommend this medicine to anybody with nerve damage.",
                    "Been suffering with low back pain worse in the buttocks and sometimes hips. Numbness, tingling in both legs. Underwent a laminotomy for spinal compression due to synovial cyst and facet joint disease. Have a couple herniated discs, but left alone in surgery...felt I would recover from this on its own as I have very mild degenerative disc disease.. Since taking Lyrica for only 3 days at a low dose my pain has subsided enough so I could actually leave my home to go out to dinner. Pain went from about \"10\" at its worst down to about a m \"2-3\".  I would say try it as it may work for you. Side effects are less than gabapention.",
                    "I have had fibromyalgia for as long as I can remember. The pain was so bad 6 months ago from too much stress that I wasn't sleeping which made it worse. I had to quit my job and I would just lay in bed and cry moving my heating pad all around my body. It was a nightmare. I wanted my life back. I found a doctor to do all the tests and diagnose me. I tried gabapentin first and did nothing for me and I was a zombie so we switched to Lyrica. I take 300mg a day. It's not perfect ALL the time. Some days I am back in pain. And three days before my period I'm in a lot of pain. It has also helped my anxiety and insomnia. For me, the dizziness went away after a month. And the other side effects are minimal.",
                    "I was prescribed Lyrica (pregabalin) about 6 months ago. I was so shocked by the feelings of unreality it initially caused that I quickly stopped taking it. My fibromyalgia got so bad at the end of the year, that I decided to try it again.  I take low doses, 25 mg 2x a day, sometimes a 50 mg. The effect sets in within hours. My fibromyalgia pain is almost completely gone. A late evening dose allows me to sleep longer. I do feel strange when I take it and my intellectual capacity is quite affected, but the lack of distraction by the pain and a better social interaction with increased confidence levels makes up for that. I have to make sure that authorities and decision-making bodies are aware of my reduced competence, and close friends should know of these side effects, so that they can make allowances for any out-of-character behaviour on my part i.e. my inability to repair their car stereo.",
                    "Works very well, the only draw back is weight gain.",

I was started on Pre Gabling two months ago and for me, it was a miracle, I have my life back! I know the Doctors say meds arent the answer for GAD but they are for me, I have had CBT, counselling, hypnotherapy, and nothing worked. But with pre gablin I have been on holiday with no probs, was actually able to relax for the first time in 8 years. I can go into any social scene and be really calm and enjoy it. All I hope is that it lasts and I dont get used to it. All my friends and family have said how well i am and relaxed and happy I appear. And I really am.",

Thank you Pfizer for Lyrica it has made such a difference in my quality of life!",
                    "Terrible Med! Years after taking for a few weeks I still have seriously blurry vision. Seems to be permanent. Everything about this drug was far worse than the problems it was supposed to address.  Do not take this toxic garbage. My Dr insisted I had to give it time to work... Any more time and I'd likely be dead or blind! Avoid like the plague and/or carefully read of myriad side effects and hope you can stop in time to avoid permanent problems from side effects. IMO this med s/b taken off the market!",

                    "Makes me swell up, eat too much, bump into things, forget words and does nothing for my pain. Stupid, expensive drug. I've been taking 150mg. 2X per day for almost three months. It doesn't work.",
                    "I feel the need to warn everybody about the side effects and how difficult it can be to get off this drug. I've been on it for approximately 8 years before the side effects really started kicking in. Began as morning anxiety attacks, severe GI upset, mood swings and low to mid level depression. Tried changing the schedule from twice a day to three times a day. It helped at first but about two months later my body began anticipating new schedule and the side effects would start kicking in about an hour before next dose. Its taken me 8 months to get dosage down from 225 mg a day to 75mg a day and every step down has been sheer hell. Every step down leads to a period of depression, and it gets worse the closer you get to zero.",
                    "Living with polyneuropathy, Fibromyalgia, spinal stenosis and lots of arthritis is difficult. I started on 200 mg twice a day then increased to 300 mg three times a day. I developed a problem with my kidneys, not from Lyrica, and had to decrease the dose to 300 mg twice a day. I have to say that I get little pain relief from this med but do get a feeling of well-being, or contentment. So, I call it my little happy pill. When I miss a dose, I notice I'm a bit depressed. It's not an antidepressant but it works that way for me. Thank you",
                    "Hi, I was prescribed Pregabalin about 8 years ago and have been taking it ever since. I suffer quite badly from anxiety and agitation and I can't tell you just how much this medication has helped. Even if I could just about get through the daytime without it, when I am asleep and my mind can follow any path it wishes to, it chooses to go down really bad avenues and I wake up feeling absolutely dreadful and this reached a terrible climax 8 years ago and resulted in me not eating at all and therefore losing a frightening amount of weight. However on my last pharmacy visit, I was a generic version of the drug which has not worked at all and so I am hoping my GP will put me back on Lyrica. If not, I am very fearful for the future.",
                    "I started taking Lyrica about 8 months ago. In about 3 days I had felt a significant change. It was working great for my Fibro, but I also have spinal arthritis. It did nothing for that or my sciatica. Finally I was bumped up to high dose, but do to other things in life I had to stop because of financial difficulties. I couldn't even afford copays. So I'm on gabapentin and it barely works. If I could, I would get back on Lyrica!                Thank you all for sharing your experiences!",
                    "I hate to write this comment, but it has to be done. I have been on Lyrica for 5 years. I now take 150mg 3x day. At first this was a dream medicine f or me. It relieved the aches and body spasms almost instantly. I could sleep at night, and woke up pain free and was able to live a somewhat normal life. I did however gain 40 lbs. I am now experiencing severe depression, and I feel it is the Lyrica. I ran out once and experienced the worst withdrawal symptoms. I felt like I was dying and the pain was severe. This medicine is wonderful, but getting off of it is very hard. ",

I'm constantly hungry, sleepy, dizzy and I feel like I'm drunk. I worked VERY hard to lose the weight that I gained when I was pregnant and since I've been on this medication, I've put it all back on and then some (40 lbs). It's hard to say if the pain is better or if I'm so caught up with the side effects that I don't care. I'm being weened off of it right now and being put on a different medicine. I'd rather go back to the opiates and itch like crazy.",

I was in terrible pain and had bad fatigue to where I couldn't live life-- I have 3 kids who I couldn't keep up with. I can't say that everything is perfect now but it's pretty darn close! I hardly have any pain and my fatigue has decreased. I take 75 mg twice a day. I pray for everyone with Fibro to keep working at it until you find something that works.",

It has taken care of the larger muscle pains but does NOTHING for the life-sucking body ache that I have suffered with since 1978. Nor does it stop my back pain. I take hydrocodone to deal with the body ache/back pain. I have good days and bad days still, but when the day is good, very little muscle pain. Downside: I have gained a great deal of weight. Also there seems to be a great deal of fluid retention with Lyrica, a diuretic helps. ",

I almost never left my bed and I moved as little as possible because the pain was so severe. My doctor prescribed Lyrica for me and it changed my life. I still have good and bad days, but I can bear the bad days because of Lyrica. It gave me my life back. When I first took it, I did have the \"high\" feeling the side effects mention, but it was only my first two doses. Also, I HAVE to take it with food, otherwise I get extremely nauseous and dizzy. I have gained a lot of weight (about 40 lbs), but I also have CFS which has caused me to have a very sedentary lifestyle. overall, Lyrica saved my life.",

I was not pain free and the cost per month was half of my rent.",

The pain medicines just hide the pain and not that well on cold and rainy days. Lyrica helps the pain - it is the best nerve medicine I have ever had. I gained 40 lbs.

Also don't get as tired as before. Just got back from visiting turkey and the week I spent there was hectic. Lots and lots of walking. Don't think I would have been able to do it without this medication. I have fibromyalgia since the last 2 and half years and had shyed away from this medication because of the side effects.

Started a couple of new drugs today in addition to the Lyrica. Hope to get serious relief and complete recovery.",

It was wonderful, no more daily nagging pain. However, the side affects started to out weigh the pain relief. I had to start taking a water pills because of the water retention, my memory& cognitive thinking were really effected. On three separate occasions, I was sent home from work because I was so drowsy I kept falling asleep. I was staggering, slurring my speech. My supervisor thought I had been drinking. It was very embarassing. If I did not have all these side effects, I would've stayed on these meds but it was getting out of control-my weight has sky rocketed also. I'm weening off.Pain is back.",

I started of on 50 at night just to see how I would cope it chilled me out and when I woke I didn't feel heavy so that was good. Because when I take a pill on the night and next day get up heavy makes my anxiety mad. But started on 50. Now am on 100s 3 times a day. Can talk to people can go for hair cut can sit in the same room as people look at there face when talking to me. With out almost passing out. If I was to say if you wanted to get anxiety under control these are well worth ago. Plus I also recommend propranolol beta blockers 40mg 4 times a day They are great as well",
                    "I started taking Lyrica for pain from Hashimoto's disease. At first I had a lot of energy. Then, I leveled off and the fatigue is back. The pain is about 85% gone! I did experience a huge emotional roller coaster at first and even had suicidal thoughts for the first time ever. I figured it was just the adjustment period and gave it more time. It has been about 2 months now and I just wish I could figure out if it is the Lyrica causing the fatigue. I ache too much without it to test the theory.",
                    "I was taking Lyrica for several years. I stopped taking it because of the price. My prescription medications are covered by Medicare & other insurance, but I do not believe in indiscriminately spending Medicare money. So, again, only because of the cost, I stopped. My feet went wild, burning pain, could not even have the bed covers on them at night. I got my Rx for Lyrica renewed and when it came I first took 2 caps in order to see if it would get started again. It did! I'm going to be doing a bit of research on the internet for a lower cost alternative. Gabapentin looks good at the moment, maybe on my next doc appt. I'll try it. I gave it only a 9 because of the cost, but for effectiveness I'd give it as high a number as allowed.",
                    "Lyrica has been a life saver for me. Prior to being prescribed Lyrica, I was living with terrible burning pain because of vulvodynia. Lyrica provided me with the relief I did not get from any other drugs. I can now enjoy life with little to no pain. I am so thankful that I was prescribed Lyrica.",

When I first started the pain I was in was about a 9 out of 10 in intensity. After a year of being on the Lyrica it might have gone to a 7 or 8 but it caused me to put on about 40 lbs, my skin changed, and caused a lot of other side effects. I finally told my doctor it wasn't worth all the side effects if it wasn't going to help the pain.",
                    "Lyrica put me into a more restful sleep. Waking up at 5:30am for work is very difficult on this medication and I feel fatigued still throughout the day. I still ache from my fibromyaliga on this medication. I can't remember how long I was on this medication. I went off it and started taking Savella. Savella took care of the pain from the condition but now I'm having side effects from the medicine. Now I don't know what I'm going to take.",
                    "I am 51 yrs old and I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia about a month ago. My doctor prescribed Lyrica. My Mother also had fibromyalgia and was taking Lyrica. She suffered a lot of the sleepy/out of it side effect and didn't like that at all. It did ease some of her pain, but she was not willing to increase the dosage. I started taking Lyrica when diagnosed, and within just a day or two I felt incredible! I didn't hurt when I woke up in the morning. I could move and do regular activities around the house without the horrible pain I had before. I did have some of the loopy/confusion/unable to focus for a short time, but that went away. I'm so thankful for Lyrica. I can live and not just exist.",
                    "I started taking Lyrica about 5 months ago. It has worked great for relieving my pain from fibro, however I have experienced bladder retention at times and since I also suffer from anxiety, depression, and PTSD, over the last couple months, I have been having really scary thoughts of suicide. (I would never, ever do that. I know myself well enough to know that I would never do anything. I lost my husband that way.) I feel like it has increased my symptoms of depression and PTSD. I stopped taking it 2 days ago and while I am in a lot of pain, it's better than the side effects of this medicine. I'm going to my Dr in a couple days and I'm going to talk to her about another option.",

After fighting with my insurance company for two weeks I was approved. Within one week I have minimal pain! It is a miracle for me. I take 25mg three times a day. Love it! Thank you!",

My Doctor decided to try me on Lyrica and I can say with 100% truth and honesty that 4 days after I started it, on just 75mgs a day, I can walk again. I am still walking now in 2013 but just in short jaunts. I'm glad this pill exists.",

I got anxious, depressed, confused, blurred vision, and a general \"high\" (not a good high) feeling. I felt very dumb and had a lot of trouble articulating my thoughts. Overall a terrible drug for me. The side effects out weighed the benefits of this medication. ",

Also driving the car my leg was in so much pain I had to lift it up with my hand to ease the pain. No medication I had taken stopped the pain which was unbearable and I couldn't sleep at night, My Doctor prescribed Lyrica and at first I did not like it because it made my feet puffy however I went back on it with the prescribed dose of 150mg twice a day. Now I have to try to recall the pain because I have no sciatic pain at all with this drug.  It also had the side effect of making me a bit \"dreamy\" which I rather like but I do forget names and things I am saying which I do not like. Can't have it all though!",

One day it would be in my legs, then my torso, then my arm, my throat, my ear and then shingles surfaced on my torso-right side. I took an antiviral for the shingles, and Neurontin for pain. The blisters were painful and they went away in a couple weeks but the pain remained and I took Neurontin in high doses, with Tylenol so I could sleep but my right leg hurt all the time. I couldn't walk up/down stairs on that leg, or sleep on either of side without pain and I am a side sleeper so I was miserable. A neurologist was skeptical that the cause was shingles but prescribed Lyrica and it was magic! 75 mg once a day and the pain is 95% gone, 6 months later still works.",

I got leg spasms at night after not taking it. Walking around a little stopped the spasms. I'd like to give it a better try, but the side effects prevent me from functioning.",

Currently I'm feeling spaced all the time, gaining weight each day, and kind of depressed, but my psychiatrist said that could be anxiety coming through. I have been taking Xanax also for about 6 years, before that I was tried on Lexapro and went crazy on it. Also the Xanax was a disaster long term, as they become very addictive. Well the moral of the story is I'm praying for the Lyrica to work.",

I got a new Auto CPAP last week as well as started taking Lyrics 75mg twice a day and I already notice a difference. So far my appetite has decreased. The first 3 days I was only taking one a day and incredibly tired having to take naps on my lunch hour. The extra sleepiness has subsided substantially even while increasing the dose. It has not been a week yet but I can feel a difference. The numbness, tingling and muscle spasms that keep me awake or start by the time I get out of bed have decreased as well as the pain. I'm looking forward and hoping it works out.",

The surgeon removed the cyst, realigned my vertebrae and used instrumentation to hold the vertebrae in place. Unfortunately, after the surgery, the most painful part was the pain in my arms. I had taken Lyrica in the past for a very short time and it caused weight gain. I kept the medication on hand because it was expensive. After 2 trips back into the ER, the surgeon wanted me to take the Lyrica. His RN said that I will know if it will work in 1 1/2 - 2 days. She was right, thank God! The pain decreased dramatically. I'll deal with the weight gain later.",

Now I take 225mg in the morning and another 225mg at bedtime. It has helped me sleep at night a little better but other than that, I haven't had the relief as some have described here. It's frustrating to say the least. Considering the fact that I am also on Xanax, Clonazepam, Hydrocodone, Tramadol, Trazadone and Savella. Some I only take 1 x per day, others 3 x per day and a couple 2x per day. Lyrica was added after Tramadol. I had no side effects from it and it did not interfere with the other medicines that I am on. I was losing weight easily before, but now it is a bit harder. I'm staying on it.",

Unlike SSRI's it gives me no sexual side effects and no feelings of apathy.  It's highly effective for anxiety. I take 300mg daily. At this dose I still have some anxiety but it is greatly reduced.  I have no serious side effects other than an increase in appetite which may lead to weight gain. Dizziness and feelings of being 'high' pass in a week. I highly recommend giving Lyrica a go. Having your life back is worth the cost.",

Took Lyrica (300mg/day) for 3 years & it worked initially to calm the aching but became less effective after a few months. It helped me get restful sleep & calmed my anxiety but I couldn't think, had very poor memory & felt very depressed (got worse overtime). When I stopped taking it I had the worst withdrawal symptoms imaginable (way worse than benzos). I literally felt worse than dying & all I could think of was when the hellish experience would stop . Took about a month to start feeling better & several months to really feel better. Doctors say that Lyrica doesn't have withdrawal (or it should be minor) but that's rubbish. Withdrawal eventually passes",

A week ago my dosage increased to 150mg twice a day and my back pain is good and sciatica is gone. Additionally my general anxiety is eased. There's no worsening of my depression symptoms (I manage depression/anxiety with efexor). Aside from mild sedation I've had a great result from lyrica so far. Hope it continues working this well! :)",

The pain was unbearable from the swelling and in the end I had a lot of broken veins. If you're swelling up and your doctor says \"oh, you just ate too much salt this week\" get another opinion to get off Lyrica and see if the swelling doesn't stop. I wish I could take it, it really did help. Good luck to all with Fibromyalgia, it's an awful and painful disease.",

Prior to Lyrica I was taking 60mg/day of methadone with significant relief but with plenty of room for improvement. With the addition of Lyrica to my Methadone regimen, my relief now stands at approx. 80% analgesia which is a God send considering the severity of my pain. As a welcome side benefit, significant anxiety, hot flushes and insomnia were relieved as well. For me, Lyrica has been something of a miracle drug.",

Doc finally had me gave me lyrica (after I had to try everything else first) ams at first, it worked. I did feel \"high\" but that slowly went away. After approx. 2 weeks of 75mg a day, I had horrible side effects..feeling depressed, like people were talking about me or didnt like me, had no memory or wasn't able to concentrate but what finally got me to stop was I had thoughts of driving my car off of a hill that i drive down daily. I may suffer from pain so intensely that I cry all the time, can't leave my home at times or feel blue because of it, but I had never thought of taking my own life.

The doctor had said that it was the worse shingles he had seen. After the scabs had gone I was Prescribed lyrica.  I take 300mg at night and 25mg in the morning. It has been 5 weeks since I developed shingles and my face and scalp are still numb. I have intermittent pain shocks. I believe the lyrica is effective as I can't imagine what it would be like if I didn't take it. I'm not sure how long I am suppose to take this but I imagine by other feedbacks that it could be months.",

My doctor originally prescribed Vicodin, then switched me to Lyrica in anticipation of my return to work. Lyrica was very effective at reducing the severity of the pain, but it caused me to be very drowsy. I slept for 14 hours a night, and had difficulty concentrating during the day. I would also have trouble remembering things I had done while taking Lyrica. I had to discontinue using it.",

I have suffered on and off for years and a few months ago I was bed/couch ridden and found it impossible to even leave my house. My family has told me I am a completely different person since starting it. I feel alive again. I also used to take Xanax for years for social and general anxiety and I have found that it is helping with that also. Only side effect was feeling high the first two doses but now I just feel like a normal person, which is what I have always wished for. I hope it continues to work and gets better as I up my dose. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who suffers from fibromyalgia. Good luck to all.",

Doctor came in and sat down looking worried. \"There's probably nothing more you can do for me.\" I said \"No, there's not.\" She sent me home with maximum doses of every painkiller on the planet-nothing got rid of the deep burning aching pain. It hurt to stand, sit, walk, lie down. I laid in bed for days not knowing what to do. I tried Lyrica. That pain has been gone ever since. I got my life back.",

                    "I've been struggling with deep muscle and bone pain. After trying Vicodin, tramadol, gabapentin and more I can't even remember, my new doctor gave me a Lyrica sample. For the first time in four years, I was able to get out of bed with no pain. It's changed my life.",
                    "I had lumbar decompression surgery in July for a herniated disk (L4,L5) and spinal stenosis. A week after the surgery, the nerve in my left leg and foot \"woke\" up and the pain was severe. My left foot was constantly burning, with feelings of electric shock 24 hours a day. I couldn't wear my shoe and I was very depressed by the pain - I couldn't walk barely without pain. My surgeon put me on Lyrica and within a week, almost all of the burning disappeared. I get a random \"shock\" in my toes, a spasm in my arch and part of my foot is still numb, but I can function again. The pain is manageable and minor. I'm told it will heal but will take months. I've had some blurred vision, but that's better than the pain. Lyrica was a life saver.",
                    "I was diagnosed with fobromyalgia in 1997, but wasn't prescribed lyrica until 2007. What a difference. Until lyrica I was in bed and couldn't do anything!!I was vomiting every day and had to be hospitalized several times and had lost several pounds. Now I'm back to work full time which i'd never thought i'd be able to do again. Doing more than simple tasks is a joy, and being able to play with my grand kids is more enjoyable than I can say. I do have to say I have to take pain medicines and muscle relaxers and had a pain pump placed inside my stomach, but with everything I'm almost back to normal. The only negative is the weight gain, but i'll take that. My husband said I needed it anyway. But I can't tell you how happy I am with the lyrica.",

                    "Y'all, like so many others have said, this is a life saver! It got me off my addiction to benzos. I had the \"euphoric\" feeling after a couple of days which unfortunately went away but I'm still happy all the time. I'm no longer having extreme emotions. I thought something was wrong bc I've never felt this way! It's been 4 months and I take 100mg 3x day. I may have had side effects in the beginning but they've gone away. I have however gained 30 pounds in 4 months. That is NOT normal. So it's come to the point that I'm gaining weight too rapidly to control and I must stop the meds. I'm very sad about this, except I'm not bc the lyrica will not allow me to be sad. So yeah. EXTREME WEIGHT GAIN. But amazing drug.",
                    "Lyrica is about as effective as opiates without the baggage that comes with the latter. Lyrica has it's own side effects for me while working up to 450 mg/day including a floaty spaced out sensation, INSANE appetite, and constipation - these side effects largely disappeared at the 2-week point. Pain relief was fairly quick, at about the third or fourth day.",
                    "I have had nerve pain for years. I've had 3 back surgeries from 2011-2014. Also FM and MPS diagnosed in mid 1990s. PAIN has controlled my life for years. I have been on all the opiates and muscle relaxers and anti-anxiety drugs and Neurontin, etc that doctors thought might help. I am very sensitive to medications and the side effects from anti-depressants cause more depression than relief. So, to try another drug was scary for me. I saw a Rheumatologist, and he dx my Arthritis called DISH in my spine. He recommended Lyrica. I finally saw my PCP MD and said let's try this drug. From the 1st pill I had almost total nerve pain relief. I am so amazed! After all these years I feel wonderful. The side effect of being \"Happy\" has been a new feeling",

After trying pregabalin over a two years, with limited success. 150mg once a day (which I was advised, but its not right dosage as it dissipates in 12 hours as I understand it). I then tried 150mg twice a day with limited success and then 300mg twice a day (this had no different). But then I hit on, the idea of taking it, three times, a day, exactly every eight hours (8am, 4pm, 12am) and this completely eliminated my GAD, making me functional, but I have to be very careful to stick to the correct times to take the dose, out by an hour and my GAD returns with vengeance.",

                    "Lyrica has been incredible for my anxiety! Within just a couple days I was running errands without needing to have someone with me due to anxiety, I was doing chores which I without a second thought often delayed and I was enjoying my life and time with my children. I was prescribed pregablin for Fibromyalgia pain and I can't say I've noticed a difference with pain but its done EVERYTHING for my anxiety! I am way less irritable and moody and feel like I can actually enjoy living a happy and complete life for once without worry, fear or nervousness. I went from being a procrastinating home body to a normal feeling, confident person! My side effects have been blurred vision, sometimes a little sleepy and dizziness. Its 100% worth trying!!",
                    "I hate this medication because it hasn't helped any of my joints or nerve pain. The only positive side is it helped my IBS and I don't get stomach attacks anymore. I still have so bad joint and muscle pain all the time, I take 75 mg twice a day and nothing seems to do the trick. I hate the side effects I get a real bad headache too.",
                    "Was put on Lyrica for recurring hip pain (& lower back pain). By one month I was on 2x75mg morning & night. Greatly reduced the pain, but I felt like I was constantly forgetful & would have brain fogs constantly. Have gained just a little weight, but can't do much with my hip anyway. The one thing that has made my Dr decrease the dose back to one a night very quickly, was I became depressive. Unfortunately, would prefer to deal with the pain & find something else, than feel that way. It is effective for pain relief (I found), but unfortunately I suffered some of the bad side effects.",

Since about the third day of taking the low dose of this medication I suddenly began to be extremely tired. I was not feeling like myself at all. I had to leave work early one day and was off for the rest of the week. I also slept for about one whole day. My doctor is aware and wants me to stick with the low dose for now since I am still feeling pretty lethargic during the 3rd week. I hope that it will get better soon. ",

While an active AA member over these years I've found that I still suffered from extreme shyness and anxiety around others. Doctor gave me some samples of Lyrica for Restless Leg Syndrome and I found that it made me quite sociable, talkative and able to let go some of my inhibitions, but without the sloppiness and horrible side effects as something like alcohol. I've tried Benzos and found they just made me feel dulled out and depressed. Lyrica, used periodically (a few times a month) never fails to brighten my mood and make me feel a bit closer to people. On the downside it also makes me feel closer to food. It's very helpful for me.",

Numbing/tingling/foot drop /balance issues all standard with MS. 75 Mg per day and already noticed difference...I can move my toes! Pain is reduced. Gabapentin did not help, baclofen or flexeril same. So far lyrica is doing the trick for me. Dr increasing Lyrica slowly each week to find the right dosage.",
                    "This used in conjunction with Cymbalta is about as good as it gets for nerve pain. In the past I was given Neurontin, Gabapentin, and many others but none were as effective. On the down side I found that the Lyrica in higher doses (150MG - 600MG) left me tired and unable to enjoy my days. I found that I received no greater pain relief taking the larger doses, just more / worse side effects. Even with Lyrica and the Cymbalta some people with extreme pain may still need to use some other type of pain relief in addition to this drug. I take 300MG of Lyrica spread over 4 doses per day and the Cymbalta, and 120MG of OxyContin and up to 40MG Oxycodone for breakthrough pain. In severe cases, a second anti-depressant may be needed in addition to The Cymbalta to help fight the depression that comes with chronic pain. The big down side to both of these name brand medicines is the cost. A months supply of Lyrica with no insurance is over $330 and the Cymbalta will set you back just over $300 each month. Even with insurance these both will end up on the top tier (My co-pay is $50.00 each) and neither of them has a generic equivalent.",

For years after surgery I have had acupuncture, chiropractic care, physical therapy and medications. I have taken methadone, morphine and oxycodone for 4 years. Now I have been taking Lyrica for a year. For the first 6-7 months it was like a wonder drug. It worked as well as anything else aside from dry mouth, weight gain and blurred vision. Now it's not working so well. An MRI showed I have many broad based disc bulges, spondyliosis, stenosis and arthritis. Now looking at a fusion surgery.

It's my 3rd day on it and I am taking 100 mg's now and in two more days will be on 150mg. So far this is amazing. I went golfing today and I had no pain in my swing.

I have lost weight on Lyrica, by been more positive and active. I ignore the increase in appetite and just drink water and it works. Pain is still there but not as bad. It is truly a miracle.",

Neurontin was effective, but only at 1800 mg./day, which left me drowsy (fell asleep anytime I wasn't moving). My MD switched me to Lyrica (75 mg), but when I got to 3 per day, I rapidly gained weight - 10 lbs. in 2 wks!  As a med student, I knew the two meds worked in a similar way and were metabolized similarly. I decreased the Lyrica to 1/ day, which stopped the weight gain, but didn't control the nerve pain, so I added back in one 300 mg. Neurontin per day (both at bedtime, to minimize drowsiness) - still not enough pain control. I added another Neurontin, and that was optimal for me. I take it all at bedtime.",

I started noticing red spots and my head, arms and back wouldn't stop itching. I got Benadryl and after 20 days, the itching is still here, but not as much as when I was taking lyrica.

I am a healthy 46 year old male. The side effects were some fuzziness and weight gain. This may have been due to lack of movement and also the Christmas eating but I put on 3 kilos in two weeks which is a lot for me. I am feeling that I would like to come off it so will reduce dosage and see what happens. At first I was nervous about taking this but it has notably reduced the pain to practically nothing.",

Much lower doses prescribed in Europe to limit side effects listed in some cases here. Seems to help getting to sleep and sleeping through night, wake early though with less of that anxious feeling in stomach. Take 10mg escitalopram (should be on 20 but want to limit the cocktail). Focus here is to be less dependent on benzos which seem less defective.

By the 4th day and 4th dose, I couldn't function.

There were people begging to get back on it. I was on it for four years and by the time the clinical trial ended, and i went through a divorce, I had weaned myself off and didnt need it again until several years later when the fibromyagia became increadably painful. it took YEARS to go through the crappy drugs the insurance co. made me go thru with adverse reactions to get back to Lyrica !",

Then I read about Lyrica, talked to my Doctor got some and stopped my flair-ups. It saved me. Lyrica cut my pain by about 40% and stopped my flair-ups by about 80%. It kind of acts like an anti-depressant for me and makes me a bit hyper-(Good thing) But kills my sex drive and I stopped it for a week, it was hard on me and pain and flair-ups came back. I built a fast resistance to Lyrica fast, I went from 100mg to now 600 mg.

Combined with a good sleep-initiating medicine (i.e. trazodone), pregabalin is an even better lifesaver than alone. Next, pregabalin works quite well for benzodiazepine withdrawals. Lastly, it does work well for depression and anxiety. The downside is that it will dull cognition greatly and can also greatly increase depression at certain doses. For me, the best dose for sleep isn't great for those reasons however lowering the dosage (after a break) has provided better results. Takes experimenting with dosages.",

I have PTSD, insomnia and a history of drug abuse as I was always using drugs to try and help me feel better not to get high. My problem with pregabalin started about 4 days after starting them, I done tons of research and took two 300mg the first time, too much, yeah I felt great but like I said don't want to be high just well.

Was taking gabapentin but only helped a bit, still found walking uncomfortable. Am now taking pregabalin 75mg three times a day and have found this wonderful. I work full time in a busy pharmacy, this has helped me to continue my work and improved my life considerably. Am struggling with weight gain but it's worth it.",

I now take 225 mg twice daily and cannot miss one dose. Nothing else worked. I took up to 600 mg but found no difference in relief so I am on the 225 twice daily. This is one medication that does not mix well with alcohol. It induces a coma like state that lasts for 30 minutes and longer. I was drinking beer and only had 3 beers in 2 hours. Then BOOM goes the dynamite! But am aware of everything going around me but can't move or respond. When it's over, it's over and I am vertical again. So now I know why the ad states avoid alcohol!",

I also take Lamotrigine 100 mg am and pm so perhaps some sort of interaction? I have Bipolar 2 depressive emphasis and traits of BPD. I stopped taking the Lyrica and asked my GP for 50mg. I have been taking 50 mg morning an evening for about three weeks and I have never felt better. Took about a week to really feel a difference.  I cannot remember a time when I felt so good. Well I can but I had to give up sugar, carbs, alchohol, practice meditation and exercise.... I am calmer and I sleep so well, seven hour stretches!!! I'm also finding my mood lifting and so am more productive a appropriatly sociable. Helenx",

I woke up on day 3 - No relief. Lyrica just completely stopped working by day 3 & I was back to agony. I continued on my dose of 75mg each night for over 3 weeks, I then upped the dose to one 75mg in the morning & two 75mg at night. I've been on this higher dose now for a few weeks and still absolutely no relief. I must say that I've experienced little side effects - Some memory loss & tiredness. No weight gain at all. If Lyrica had have kept working I would have been really happy but unfortunately it just stopped working for me! I'd recommend at least trying it for anyone that's considering",

I have tried everything from trigger point injections to high doses of opioids. Nothing really worked on the underlying pain. Yes I would have some relief but the nerve pain was always there. So now after being on maintanence methadone for a year I have started taking lyrica for the past month with really good results. Now I am starting to slowly to come down off the methadone because of the great results from this medication. I was pleasantly surprised. I just hope it can continue the good work.",

                    "I will start off by saying it did cause weight gain. My clothes fit the same but the number on the scale went up about 7-10 pounds depending on the day. I cannot say this is solely because the drug- I think I can safely say that this is because my pain has improved so drastically that I have appetite again. I can keep the weight off if I really want to, but I am not overweight and I am content with my appetite finally being back after years of struggles that I don't think it's a problem. Regardless, I have been on lyrica for almost a year now. It has drastically improved my nerve pain, joint stiffness and swelling (along with a gallon of water a day), appetite, energy, and sleep. I am not pain free but no fibromyalgia patient truly ever is pain free but my pain has gone from an average of 8-9 down to a 4-5 on my good days. My flare ups are far less frequent and I only experience them once every two or so months which is a huge improvement over every other week. The length of the flare ups is also shortened from 3-5 days down to 2 days maximum. At the beginning of taking the medicine I was slightly drowsy but nothing dangerous. I only take it once a day and I am trying to keep it that way to avoid moving up to 2 doses a day. Lyrica is my miracle drug and has definitely given me my life back. My biggest complaint is the cost and insurance but it could be worse. It costs me $2 a day to feel normal again.",

I use cannibis oil CBD form it helps with inflammation , it sure helps considerably better with no side effects! The cbd form does NOT get you 'stoned, high, or buzzed' it removes the pain. I am extremely grateful for my Cannibis oil, the effects last longer then lyrica tooo! I can enjoy my grandkids again!",

Anyone who is looking into this medication PLEASE at least try it, take it as you told to by your DR. and give it four weeks to fully work it's magic, I almost asked my DR. to take me off it, three weeks into taking it, but my wife told me to give it one more week and BOOM! she was right.

After 11 operations I was depressed and very very sore. both in the abdomen and of course the spine . I drank and drank . It seemed like the only thing that would ameliorate the pain. Three months ago my GP started me on Lyrica . After 3 days , pain was gone, also my anxiety seemed to just hop up and walk away . Im only drinking a few beers on a saturday now. Lyrica saved my life . I dont say that flippantly .",

Upped it to 150mg twice daily and yes, it definitely works to eliminate \"one level of pain\", while leaving some \"levels of pain\" still there. I do feel side effects of feeling calm while having more motivation for projects, some slight feeling of alcohol-like impairment (not so much after less than a week of 300mg/day). I also occasionally use oral cannabis and the Lyrica potentiates it quite a bit. I'm feeling very positive about this medicine, even though it doesn't get at all levels of my pain, I like what it does do for me.",

The pain is not as bad as it was in the beginning, but I am in constant pain and, according to my pain management and spinal and lower limb reconstruction consultants, this will probably always be the case. Initially I thought if I found the right combination of medications I could stop it and so I tried all of the other drugs prescribed for neuropathy, as well as some more experimental ones. Without Lyric I spent a lot of time crying and ended up in hospital a few times because the pain was so bad.",

Weird in that I just felt SO GOOD, almost too good, Then side effects hit. Bad dizziness, but still felt good mentally. Cut the dose to 100mg. Over the next 2 weeks side effects resolved themselves. No weight gain. The artificial high dissipated. What I'm left with is this...NORMAL LIFE. Lyrica gave me my life back. Pray it works for others as well as it's worked for me.",

However, after some time I grew tolerant to it and my pains and anxiety started coming back slowly, so my dose got upped to 150mg twice a day. It works for my anxiety and pains but it makes me really sleepy now. Side effects were only at first weeks, some stomach troubles which disappeared. PS! This is a temporary solution, since you get tolerant to it. Antidepressant is still needed for anxiety.",

The problem is the side effects, the worst being that after three days my eyesight is so degraded that I can not drive, I cannot read anything on the television 6 feet away, there is some eye pain and my eyes seem dry and burning.

Doc then changed prescription to 50mg twice daily. As a painkiller it is fantastic. I've never known a painkiller like it, however one bad side effect is my swollen feet. I fear that I will have to change to something else if it continues to make my feet swell, because it is extremely uncomfortable. Another side effect is the feeling of being drunk. It does however help me to sleep. I haven't slept this well in years, though I wake up feeling groggy. I could live with all these side effects, if I could overcome the swollen feet.",

I have been able to keep the weight off by being very mindful of my hunger, or mindless eating. I am 5'10\" 185lbs. Without Lyrica I don't really get hungry. Mind is bigger than the belly when I order food. With Lyrica I find I could eat a horse, and a cow and maybe a squirl as an after dinner snack ..LOL. It makes me lose what ever normal appetite suppresent that I may have. It does wonders for my nerve pain that started 6 months ago and seems to get worse without Lyrica.",
                    "I am a 39 year old male and sustained a fall back in October shattering both heels and ankles and have been diagnosed with RSD (Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy)and my pain management doctor prescribed Lyrica 300mg twice a day for the burning and pain. I have had 4 epidurals and 1 nerve block and have found that the lyrica works best for me and it works well with the other medicines I take on a daily basis. I have been taking for almost a year now and I have not had any side effects!",
                    "I was prescribed Lyrica (pregabalin) about 6 months ago. I was so shocked by the feelings of unreality it initially caused that I quickly stopped taking it. My fibromyalgia got so bad at the end of the year, that I decided to try it again.  I take low doses, 25 mg 2x a day, sometimes a 50 mg. The effect sets in within hours. My fibromyalgia pain is almost completely gone. A late evening dose allows me to sleep longer. I do feel strange when I take it and my intellectual capacity is quite affected, but the lack of distraction by the pain and a better social interaction with increased confidence levels makes up for that. I have to make sure that authorities and decision-making bodies are aware of my reduced competence.",
                    "I had a Triple Arthrodesis (triple fusion in my foot), and because so many nerves had to be cut, my foot was on fire. I was originally given Nuerotin, which I took, and it bottomed out my blood pressure, I was rushed to the ER unconscious, and kept there until I was okay. Needless to say, I discontinued it, and was given Lyrica....but that made me nervous as well. With my pain over a 10, and the inability to sleep, I decided to try it. I slept well, my pain is decreased some, but isn't gone. I'm only at day 3, and I'm pretty dizzy, sick to my stomach, and sleepy, but that's all so far. I do hope it helps my pain a little more, it's about an 8 now, so we shall see! I'm glad to hear some good stories.",
                    "I had to stop taking Cymbalta because my insurance would no longer cover it. After 2 months of increasing pain to the point I cried all day my Dr prescribed Lyrica after my suggestion. I think after about the 3rd day my pain had decreased dramatically. On the day I went to the Dr, my pain level was 10 and after 4 days of 75mg in morning and evening I would probably rate my pain level of 2. I hope this continues.",
                    "Been on Lyrica for 6 months now. 100mg 2x daily. Has worked great for pain relief. Side effects for me include dizziness and blurred vision. Have tried to change to Savella to see if same relief would happen without side effects, but after 3 days off Lyrica started to feel really bad. No weight gain but I do stay very active.",
                    "Severe neck pain was causing migraines, took several narcotics with no relief. Dr. switched me to Lyrica, pain was gone in three days after two years of terrible pain. Lyrica improved my quality of life to say the least.",
                    "I developed shingles in my face, scalp, and eye in 2005. The initial pain was treated with gabapentin, which didn't work very well. The doc wouldn't prescribe anything stronger. In fact, she hardly recognized that shingles pain was significant. My PHN kicked in when the rash disappeared. I've still got it. I monitored the internet for PHN meds and when Lyrica came out I notified my new doc immediately. He started me out at 100 mg three times a day and when that was only modestly effective he kicked it up to 150 mg X 3. It works very nicely. However there are side effects. My weight gain has been significant. Brain fog happens. I get double vision on an irregular basis. I feel tired. Now my liver values are increasing.",
                    "My husband suffers from neuropathy and his Dr put him on Lyrica 75mg twice a day. The side effects were horrible, he had to stop taking it immediately. He was dizzy, had headaches, off balance, couldn't judge distance, and it looked to him like the walls and floors were moving.",
                    "My doctor prescribed Lyrica for fibromyalgia. As I am very sensitive to medication, I was prescribed 75 mg at bedtime each night.  The first month, I did feel better taking Lyrica. However, after about 4 months I began experiencing strange symptoms.  I could not remember things. My brain was foggy. I wasn't myself and my pain returned. It was a no brainer, so I informed my doctor that I wanted off of this medication.  I've been off Lyrica now for two months and my brain is back to normal. It was very scary to even think how little I was taking and what an impact it made on me.   I am taking apple cider vinegar with honey every morning, exercising a little day, even if I don't want to, and resting when my body needs it.",
                    "Lyrica was the first medication that helped with the nerve pains. It calmed down some of the burning in my toes, especially. It also gave me some hope in addition to pain relief.",
                    "I was prescribed Lyrica nine months ago and ever since I've been on this drug my quality of life has greatly increased because not only does it greatly relieve me of muscle tension and pain it greatly improves my mood and makes me feel like doing things that I normally wouldn't have the energy for.",
                    "My husband was perscribed Lyrica for neuropathic pain. He has been in pain with low back issues since 2005. He has had shots, surgeries, a stim unit inplant. The pain continues to get increase. The lyrica within three days made him completely crazy. Couldn't sleep, very emotional. Started weaning right away. He had side effects all the way to cold and flu like symtoms. This Lyica is horrible, worst medicine he has ever taken and now we're stuck for $100.00",
                    "Made my feet swell",
                    "I have been dealing with Fibromyalgia for many years and my doctor was so excited when Lyrica came out, like it was going to be the cure or something; but it did not help my FMS at all. Not to mention, I had horrific fluid retention! I couldn't wear normal shoes, my hands so swollen I couldn't get my wedding ring on. The swelling lasted for a while even after I discontinued the medication.",
                    "I've tried sertraline, amitriptyline and trazodone for depression and anxiety in the past, but none helped my anxiety as much as this. I was told I couldn't use other anxiety meds because I have low blood pressure, but I can use pregablin. It has helped tremendously. I still have panic attacks but instead of many times daily, it's the odd one here and there when something has particularly stressed me out. It doesn't take away the anxiety completely, it's still there and I have really bad days still and it doesn't help depression, but it's much more manageable than before, likewise my OCD isn't as bad either. The only side effect I experience is weird dreams, insomnia and poor memory/memory loss. I recommend!!!",
                    "Works pretty well for nerve pain and numbness. I have degenerative disc disease along with several other cervical and spinal issues. I started at higher dose that had too many side effects but when my dosage was lowered I had a lot of relief.",
                    "I had been quite a bit of pain for a little over four months. We couldn't figure out what was causing the pain in my face. My doctor figured out that I had Trigeminal Euralgea Facial Nerve Pain. So he started my on Lyrica. We started at 75mg x 2 times a day, and then had to move up to 150mg x 2 times a day. Lyrica really helps to keep the pain away. My chiropractor has said that since taking Lyrica that my back and neck can be manipulated easier than before. I love being able to feel better!",
                    "Helped TREMENDOUSLY with my pain, which is not cured of course, but at LEAST cut my daily pain in half. My old boyfriend is also on this and feels the same way as I do.",
                    "I started taking pregabalin yesterday - start at a low dose 75mg in morning, then 75mg in the evening. The effect was pretty much instant I swear.  I went from being hypersensitive, worrying, stressing and having all these horrible physical symptoms ( from the anxiety disorder I have been diagnosed with ) to being calm, having a subtle feeling of well being... my acid reflux stopped, my muscles have started to lose their tension, the tension headaches are lifting too. Side effects ? a little sleepy, but nothing too severe. I haven't listened to music for months and been able to enjoy it, but today I AM ! ... amazing ! I feel like a normal person, its like the volume has been turned down on life to a level I can manage :)",
                    "I recently stopped taking lyrica after 6 months. I was taking lyrica for nerve pain following a terrible car accident. I wish I had never started taking lyrica. It not only did not help with the pain but only made my condition worse, not to mention the 30 pounds of weight I put on. Also the horrible withdrawal's was worse than I ever could of imagined. I absolutely do not recommend ever starting lyrica",
                    "It didn't work.",
                    "I was on this drug for many years and while in the beginning I felt it helped with both the frequency of headaches and fibromyalgia associated with ME, over time it stopped working. On the flip side, it definitely had a negative effect on my memory. I VERY slowly weaned myself off of it and most of my memory has returned. My insurance only paid a small part of the cost and it is very expensive. I would not use it again. No upside and plenty of downside.",
                    "This drug changed my life with unexpected benefits. I started taking for herniated disc and a lot of nerve damage. I started feeling pain relief immediately. It made me feel very high the first week and I had to be careful how and when I would take it / 150MGs 3xs a day. The high feeling eventually, gradually dissipated  After a week, I noticed my wife smiling a lot with great caution I asked her why and she said she likes how calm and relaxed I am. I'm naturally a very high strung, intense person. I thought about what she said and noticed I actually was very relaxed and things that typically set me off they just didn't anymore. I then read about how the drug helps with anxiety. My insurance doesn't really cover it...I pay 50 for a months",
                    "For 18 months have had severe lumbar, butt and leg pain. Got spinal injections that helped some, but leg pain still was especially bad. Finally had back surgery, which helped the lower back, but not the pain in my hips and legs, which was intense. As usual, had physical therapy, massage, and finally acupuncture. Nothing worked. My doctor finally started me on Lyrica at 50 mg before bed, then 100, and finally at 200 mg before bedtime. It has reduced the pain about 70 percent. It also helps me sleep like a log, and the only side effects are some dizziness in the morning, but by around 10 AM that goes away. Great stuff!",
                    "I too progressed from Gabapentin to Lyrica, 100mg 3x a day. I have chemically-induced neuropathy from 6 months of chemo. My hands and feet are numb, tingling, like they are asleep. Lyrica is supposed to be an advanced form of the Gabapentin, though I have seen little difference. I have increased appetite and some swelling in my hands and ankles. I continue using Lyrica because I need something for the hot shooting pain. This was the last med prescribed for my neuropathy.",
                    "This is poison, destroyed my life, horrible side effects and made my pain so much worse. Detoxing is a living hell and makes coming off narcotics a walk in the park. It's horrible and should be taken off the market.",
                    "On narcotics, muscle relaxers for neuropathic pain from inoperable herniated discs, arthritis in back. Narcotics cut in half by doctor and prescribed Lyrica, 75mg once at night, then 75mg am and pm and on til taking 150mg am, pm. Nothing. Today an additional 75 mg to be added midday.  Decided to check here before taking more. Wow. I have had left hand/arm jerks where my arm just flies up, once throwing iPad mini across the room, another time scatting nuts everywhere while chopping them. I now realize this condition started with Lyric and gets worse with increased dosage. I am going to slowly stop this drug because a) it does nothing for pain, and b) what has it done to my brain?",
                    "It helps with my seizures as well as my fibromyalgia so I've always been really happy with my Lyrica. I've been on it for years now.",
                    "Had a slipped disc with sciatic pain diagnosed before new year.  Had been having heart palpitations, anxiousness, blurry vision and having suicidal thoughts. Felt could be due to the drugs I'm taking and turns out... it's all from lyrica. ",
                    "I've used Lyrica for a while now and it seems that my body is getting so used to the drug that it's not working like it first did. I take 75mg in the morning and 75mg at bedtime. I either need to increase my dose or find something else that will work. It's hard to function during my days because of the pain.",
                    "I suffer from severe peripheral neuropathy. It is unusual in the sense that it is not diabetes caused, but is apparently idiopathic and hereditary. I have excellent relief from Lyrica with few side effects. I find myself nodding out occasionally at my computer or watching TV. I exercise more, drink more coffee, and allow more time for sleep. The more I take, the greater the relief. I take 400mg per day. ",
                    "Instant joint pain gone....anxiety gone....only been 1 week...hopeful it lasts...so far it's a miracle for me..I'm also on cymbalta and klonipin",
                    "I was given this medicine from my Dr. I told her I would research it but I paid $25 and picked it up. What a waste of money, I should've researched first. After reading this I'm deathly afraid to take this drug so I won't be. Thank you for all the reviews.",
                    "I have only been diagnosed for about a year now. I have completely lost my life due to fibromyalgia pain. My doctor started me on Cymbalta, which worked for awhile but then stopped, then put me on Lyrica without weaning me off Cymbalta....WITHDRAWALS hello. Had to start again and wean off while also taking Lyrica. The Lyrica seemed to help at first too, then wham just like everything else, stopped working....EXCEPT on weight gain and brain fog. I was a zombie. So now I'm worsening day by day even though I try to stay active have cut all caffeine, etc. because my doctors just don't believe pain medicines help and say there isn't much else they can do for me. Glad for the people it has helped.",
                    "I have Fibromyalgia and developed horrific back/sciatic pain last year. I started taking lyrica about 3 months ago and within a week,I could walk properly. I could sleep, I could exercise and I thought it had fixed everything.  Then my elbow started hurting. I just thought I'd strained it at the gym. The pain became excruciating. Then it hit the other arm until 3 days ago when it got so bad, I couldn't move my arms properly. It felt like my arms were inflamed from my shoulders to my finger tips. I stopped taking it 2 days ago and the arm pain is starting to go. But the back pain is starting to come back. I also have had no idea what day it is for the last 3 weeks which I thought was stress but suspect is the lyrica.",
                    "When I first started Lyrica, my pain almost totally disappeared. After about 3 weeks, my pain started returning. My tongue started to tingle and was sore.",
                    "I was prescribed Pregabalin by my GP for anxiety disorder. I am 27 and have had anxiety since a teenager. I have never tried meds before. I have just gone up to 600mg. I have definitely experienced side effects (blurred vision/dizziness/drowsiness). The side effects do wear off but it does take some perseverance in the beginning to get to grips with it. I felt 'out of it' for a few days. I definitely feel less anxious. It's hard to tell how well it is working but I definitely have the ability to look at 'stressful' and 'anxious' situations with far more clarity. I am a designer and I always worried if taking meds would suppress my creativity but in fact - I think it helps me to have more confidence in my ideas.",
                    "I was diagnosed with adult onset Diabetes last Dec. I started on Metformin 750 and almost immediately my fasting glucose dropped to 94. That is what it has been since but I have been bothered with neuropathy for months. I tried Lyrica for 3 months and it did absolutely nothing for the pain. I am presently taking gabapentin 300 mg at bedtime and it helps slightly. The cost for the Lyrica was money out the window.",
                    "I am glad that Lyrica has helped many, just did nothing for my nerve pain and tons of side effects.",
                    "Just started Lyrica 75mg twice a day yesterday. My first dose, I felt extremely drunk, and could not function. I took my second dose at bedtime, and slept through the night, and woke up refreshed! I had no aches or pain. My 3rd dose, this morning, again feeling a little drunk, and off balance... but again, I feel good. I can actually sit still at work, without having to move around and try to be comfortable. I am going to stick with this medication, and hope that the side effects go away in a couple of days.",
                    "I had been experiencing major depressive disorder and I have an anxiety disorder. I have tried every antidepressant on earth and had suicidal ideation with each one, even after one pill! I have some nerve pain so I tried gabapentin but didn't really get any relief from it so I asked my doctor for some lyrica. The NEXT DAY I felt the depression lift and the anxiety came to a manageable level where I felt I could function well and go out in public. I recently started vaping nicotine and the anxiety is back. I am going to quit and continue to take the lyrica. When I feel really anxious I take 10 mg of valium with it and I am in heavenly bliss. No pain, no worries, just normal albeit a bit sedated but still very functional.",
                    "I had an accident in April 2016. Riding lawnmower fell on top of me in a deep ditch. It knocked me out and caused severe lumbar spinal stenosis , pinched nerves . Up until this year I was in a lot of pain due to the nerves being pinched by my spine. All this time I have seen 3 doctors, really 4, one neurologist, 2 neurosurgeons, internist. No one even suggested Lyrica for my pain...except the neurologist who did the nerve conduction study. He said it worked for restless leg syndrome which I also have. I go some Lyrica and tried it. It has brought me from 10 pain level to a 2 or 3. I get up early now like I used to, I have the will to do things on my property etc. I had lost the desire to even get out of bed, I wish I had tried Lyrica a lot sooner, it gave me my life back.",

I am getting as good or better pain control with the Lyrica alone as I was with the Duragesic patch and without the added fatigue.",
                    "I couldn't make it without my Lyrica! This medicine has absolutely changed my life. I was hurting all the time and used all my energy just to work. There was no joy in my life until I was prescribed this medicine. Now I work and feel like doing the things I enjoy, like working in my flower garden. I thank God everyday for this medication!",

After many years of being tried on just about every drug out there FINALLY a drug that actually helped me!..I now drive again and sometimes leave the house alone and even on occasion brave the supermarket ALONE..After 3 years on the same dose and with its effect starting to wane I am now on 150mg twice a day..And yes I am very tired, vague and spaced out, but this will wear of with time as my body adjusts..And regarding the weight gain, I have lost 5 stone, and have regained some control.",
                    "I was prescribe Lyrica for a pinched nerve in my elbow after a dislocation. The pain made physical therapy intolerable. With just one dose of 75mg of Lyrica, I could bend my elbow without wincing. Absolutely marvelous. Unfortunately there were 2 side effects that make me stop taking it. First one was that I fell asleep almost immediately after taking it for about 2 hours and my brain felt very foggy after I woke up. Second issue was a slight tightness in the chest and feeling a little out of breath. Not severe, but enough to let me know that I couldn't take it again. Made me sad because it really worked.",

Once could top out any IQ tests but my husband says I can't even find my \"behind\" anymore. Taking it for neuropathy & came home from complete knee surgery with foot drop in leg operated on. Now the other foot has dropped half way so I am all but an invalid. No more going outside for me to enjoy our horses on our farm. The dry mouth I got with Lyrica also frightens me as afraid I will lose my teeth as others have. Lyrica also causes severe sleepiness. I guess it MIGHT have stopped the shooting pains in my feet at night?",

I think the Lyrica is really working. I am still tired, but I feel it is a normal tired from having two kids and running around with them. The way I felt before, I couldn't move. I really don't want to use the Neurontin, I don't want to lose the benefits that I have gained.",
                    "Lyrica works well on my chronic neck pain which I have had for 4 years. But I have gained about 30 pounds so am considering trying Neurontin to see if effects are the same but without the weight gain!",

Doctors put me on Neurontin which just made me neurotic...and did not help the pain. A month after switching to Lyrica, I was able to lose the crutches, and a few weeks later the prosthetic supporting my leg. After four months, yes I still have a crushed nerve, but pain and hypersensitivity dropped to bearable levels and after six months off all medication but Motrin. Four years later... I have a resurgence of RSD due to a back injury. Lyrica had me back walking in two weeks and has continued to reduce the pain levels.",

                    "I was on Lyrica for 2 years. At first it was fabulous! But over time I needed to keep increasing the dosage to get the same result. The side effects were bad for me. In the two years I was on it I gained 60 lbs and my hair started falling out. I have since switched to Neurontin with no side effects and my hair is slowly coming back. Lyrica was a miracle for me for about 18 months but as they say all good things must come to an end.",
                    "I would give it a 10, then a 1. At first the medicine worked GREAT but then 30 days later it just quit. After a few months I gave up on it, I occasionally retry the medicine but no luck.",
                    "Taking Lyrica hasn't helped my Fibrmyalgia symptoms at all, and even though I'm on a starter dose of 75 mg once per day the side effects are terrible! I tremble so badly it appears as if I have Parkinson's disease. I can't hand write at all and let alone many other daily functions. It has affected my thinking terribly and makes my mind race and my thoughts are very jumbled which makes me feel extremely anxious, plus when talking my speech is very shaky sounding and very fast and slurry. I also have a lot of trouble urinating. I find it extremely difficult to empty my bladder and at times very painful. I was already taking sleeping tablets ( Temazipan), but Lyrica has made getting to sleep even worse. My chest and nose both feel congested.",

I suffer from back, buttock, leg & feet pain from a 360 degree double spinal fusion of L4-L5 & L5 & S1 done 20 years ago. Nerve pain is now ruining my life. However since being on this medicine my pain is now around a 2-3 out of 10 from being anywhere between 5-9. The only real side effect I am having is feeling \"High\" 24 hrs a day. Supposedly this will go away in time. I also feel uplifted and it has helped with my depression. I do feel a bit aggressive at times too. I have been keeping a close check on my weight too but nothing has changed. My normal weight is 75 kgs and I'm fit & strong as I workout in the gym regularly which helps control back pain.",

I had previously taken Cymbalta 60mg for 7/8 years and was feeling that it was no longer as effective so my doctor prescribed Lyrica. I noticed a large amount of weight gain (which I would not have minded if helped the pain!) about 50 pounds over 6 months before it stabilized. After some time of taking the medication (9 months or a year I forget) I was always complaining to my doctor about pain and fatigue being bad so he switched me to Savella. I noticed a huge difference and I lost the weight!",
                    "Lyrica was great as a pain reliever. It is not a pain killer. The side effects were brutal - weight gain, swelling, water retention yikes. I only stayed on Lyrica a few months. I am now trying Robaxasil.",

I've been on lorazepam, alprazolam, and clonazepam and all 3 became ineffective after 6 months to 1 year and were extremely difficult to get off of. I don't notice any tolerance issues with pregabalin either. I've been on the same dose for about 2 years. Better than any of the benzodiazepines and other medications I've tried for anxiety. Only side effects I've noticed are calmness, sedation, and increased appetite but exercise and healthy eating take care of any weight gain.",
                    "I was prescribed Lyrica for nerve pain as well as tingling/numbness/electricity feeling in my legs. Since I have been taking it (about 6 months now) these symptoms are all but gone. The only side effects I have are short term memory loss and concentration issues but I am able to work around these in most cases. Lyrica has been amazing for me.",

I still have pain but it has been knocked down some and it does help me sleep. I have fibromyalgia, small fiber neuropathy, scoliosis, osteoarthritis, collapsed discs, disc disease.",
                    "I've been on lryica for a month now. 150 mg 2x a day. It works wonders for the awful muscle spasms and fibromyalgia pain but I do have side effects. I have to do every thing from chores to running errands before I take it. Once I take I become unbalanced, forget words and become extremely tired. I sleep a lot and very heavy and usually can't remember the previous day. I definitely cannot function after I take it. I don't care for the side effects but so far has been the only thing that has worked for me. I tried cymbalta, neurton, zanaflex, flexeral lots of things. To me its worth taking the lryica as those terrible rib and back spasms keep at bay..and after two years of dealing with those I don't ever want to again. btw does kill my appetite.",

I finally see the world again the way it was supposed to be seen and can enjoy the grass under my feet in the park. Honestly these little things make a world of difference and move me like nothing else. I feel connected with the world yet again.",

I lost those yrs of my life sleeping 17 hours a day and the pain was horrible even taking 90mg a day and 30mg of Valium. I went to Wilmington Treatment Center to stop the medicines & so they started me on the Lyrica 450mg per day. It saved my life. Without the Lyrica I was awake for 3 days crying in pain, could not lay in a bed due to the sheets touching me, my core temperature would not come up, I was freezing but everything burned my skin if it touched me. The Lyrica within 2 hours gave me hope and I started turning around for the better. My life is so much better now. My family is glad to have me back!",
                    "I JUST started using this drug 3 days ago. I have been suffering with horrible pain from a herniated disc over the past 2 months. Tried hydrocortisone shots in my back and the pain went away for 3-4 days. I've been on vicodin and skelaxin as well as Aleve twice a day. I've had to take my vicodin every 4 hours instead of every 6 hours because the pain has been so bad. Just in the last 48 hours, I've noticed such a difference with Lyrica. I keep waiting for the pain to be there, but it is NOT. I'm still titrating my way up on the dosage, but in another day or two, my maximum dose will be 50 mg 3 times a day. Currently, I'm taking 50 mg 2 times a day. It really works.",

The things that bothered me before no longer bother me. I am a smoker and since starting Lyrica I no longer crave cigarettes. I have had severe back pain due to arthritis and I no longer have back pain! It does however make me hyper. I can live with that, and it makes me hungry, but this stuff works really well for me.",
                    "Worked wonders at the start. Was up to 600mg a day. I don't eat the best but I do think this did make me gain weight. I live in the great white north but I struggled with balance, fell often, and also had trouble putting my thoughts into words. These side effects are now gone now that I'm off this. Balance and communication much better now that I'm off.",
                    "I recently started taking Lyrica for two herniated discs. The doctor said I have massive nerve damage that will result in surgery but suggested taking this medication temporarily until surgery because my pain was unbearable! At first I was a little off balance but within a week I wasn't constantly in pain....within a month my pain was almost gone and I refuse to do surgery now! Thanks Lyrica for making this happen!",
                    "75mg x2 daily - no noticeable effect. 150mg x2 daily - slight effect of calm, not really therapeutic. 300mg x2 daily - feeling calm, a little sleepy, but I quite like that... it is still early days, but I don't feel the need to take any valium anymore. I stopped it weeks ago. I like being in this calm fluffy state, rather than sweating and thinking 100 miles an hour and stressing out. I am taking this medication for an anxiety disorder, panic attacks and lower limbs pain and walking problems...supposedly they are all linked.",

Over the few months however I have had increased swelling in my joints and gained 15 lbs with no change in eating habits. I started feeling confused with memory loss, then two weeks ago I started feeling suicidal. I did not ever suffer from depression but could not get the thought of just taking a bottle of pills. Due to my experience of working with mental health I knew something was not right so I am now working at reducing Lyrica and going off of it . I think it was amazing for the pain but not worth the risk with the change in my mental state.",

I tried nuerotin years ago but after the second day I could not function, so any one with nerve pain should give this a try. .it sure has helped me",

I started taking Lyrica for some unresolved jaw pain thought to have arisen from my wisdom tooth extraction. It was like a switch had been flipped, the next morning I woke up completely refreshed; a feeling I hadn't experienced in years. I experimented on-and-off to determine whether Lyrica was indeed the reason for this change in energy and mood. Indeed, nights that I took Lyrica (75mg) I was completely refreshed and motivated the next day. This contrasted my normal routine greatly, where I would typically take high doses of vyvanse (75mg-max dose) at 5 am just to wake up. Game changer for depression.",

Over the next 5 months it pretty much stopped working for the pain and the side effects became very worrying. I could not think straight and was dangerously clumbsy. I was is a malaise and did not wish to do anything so I decided to quit. I followed the instructions to taper over at least a week, then the real problems began. This is a horrendous drug to come off, I had to reinstate as I went out of my mind. I am now tapering at 10% as and when I can. I feel so unwell, anxiety has spiralled, depression, suicidal thoughts, insomnia, lack of appetite, sweats, the list could go on it has been a hellish period.",

I was diagnosed with bipolar II, GAD and mixed anxiety and depressive disorder, all I can say week 2 on this medication has saved my life! I'm on 75mg twice a day and can increase if I wish too, but with the way I am feeling at the moment I feel I don't need too. I can leave the house, I'm going back to work next week, and my girls have their mummy back, also suffer from damaged nerves in my lower back, it's helped so much with the pain. It's a miracle",

                    "I started taking lyrica about 4 years ago for fibromyalgia and found it lowered my daily pain by about 60%. While I do not suffer from GAD, I have always had feelings of anxiousness and physical feeling of restless uneasiness, and also restless leg syndrome. It was an unexpected side benefit that the lyrica helped control these feelings. After about a year and a half of taking 150 mg twice a day, I began to worry about addiction, and decided to cut back in an effort to possibly quit altogether. I soon found that my anxiousness and restlessness seemed worse than before, so I went back to my full 300mg per day dose, and have remained at that dosage. While on lyrica, I intentionally lost 35 lbs, and have not gained any weight back for 3 years",

After surgery I was also experiencing new pain of stabbing, electrical sensations in addition to the pain I previously had. I was prescribed Neurontin and the doctor kept raising the dose with no difference in my pain. I heard of similar experiences and being switched to Lyrica and it made a huge difference. I was in so much pain day after day. I switched to Lyrica and I have had nearly full relief of the pain I was having. I can't even describe how much this medication has helped me.

I don't have the side effects from it that most have, and it works to control the pain, although I do have neuropathy flare ups from time to time. I'm taking it as a result of neuropathy from spinal chord injury. and my insurance pays for it so no out of pocket costs. I recommend this to people who have nerve pain.",
                    "Like many others, my pain doctor had me on gabapentin first, then after several months without relief, switched me to Lyrica. Without a generic version available, it can cost a small fortune depending on your insurance. Without any insurance, 100mg capsules 3X daily, 90 pills will cost upward of $600! With my Part D, and not qualifying for \"Extra Help\" through the state, I'm now paying $140 for a 2 week supply, $280 monthly. That's a car payment! I have no idea what to do once the free samples run out, it's a very good medication but unaffordable. If your doctor tells you gabapentin (Neurontin) works the same, chemically there's no difference, that just isn't true. It may be similar, but Lyrica works much better with significantly less mg's",

This pill made it worse. I took 50 mg at bedtime for about a week. The doctor said it takes a while to get into the system. I'm not waiting that long.

The dose increased again with good effect. I do notice if I am late on a dose or miss a dose, sure pay for it, takes some time for pain to come back under control. I say as I write this at 5 am having not slept a wink. I'm currently on 150 mg twice daily. I'm gaining a belly but have not gotten on the scales, initially giddy and absent minded but that has subsided even with dosage increases. I think its a good drug choice for me. here hoping.",

So last year I stopped taking it as I still had a lot of nerve pain. But since I have been off it I realized just how much it actually did for me. I started suffering from crippling anxiety, my pain has gotten progressively worse and my hand tremors have returned. So after 9 months off it I am back on it again as I need a quality of life and Lyrica gives me that. It may not work for everyone but it does for me. I have fibromyalgia and General Anxiety.",

I just feel normal. My anxiety got so bad it was causing severe stomach problems, I almost had my gallbladder removed. Not only did it cure my anxiety, my stomach issues are gone, as well as my IBS that was a seperate issue, my restless legs are gone!!! GONE, RLS was torture, it stopped me from going to movies or on planes.. but that's not even the best part!

The only side effect that MAY have been due to Lyrica is vision loss, but I have worn glasses for 30 years, so no big deal for my eyesight to slightly worsen over 2 yrs on the drug. Some of the side effects that people mention could be due to menopause rather than Lyrica. I gladly spend $60 for a monthly supply. Other meds I took previously left me like a zombie.

For 6 years, everyday I would have to lay in the tub and the shower hit my back or lay on a heating pad and even at night just to fall asleep I use sleep aids and constant showers or heating pads to get the muscles to stop hurting and spasms and then I couldn't take it anymore. The muscle relaxers wouldn't work and my back and neck were burning and stiff and spasms all day and night and I couldn't sleep and went desperately to a my new doctor that I was seeing and got his associate.

At first probably the first 2 months only side effect I had was a little swelling of my hands. Lyrica was a wonder miracle for me. The doctor had me on it for over 3 years with no problems, then my insurance refuses to pay for it now, because a 30 day supply is $900.00. They wanted to give me Neurontin, which I am allergic too. Now all the nerve pain is back and worse. I want the Lyrica back and would recommend it to any one.",

Lyrica helped a lot, with much less frequency and severity of burning. Finally some relief. Unfortunately, I had to discontinue because of side effects. I had almost all side effects listed in the info sheet. Most I could have tolerated, but the ones I couldn't was weight gain, confusion, and fast progressing blurred vision. Also, I had severe clinical depression over 18 years ago until I received the correct antidepressant. I've had no depression since. However, the Lyrica caused it to return, although not as severe. It also caused anger flareups, very unlike me.",

Day 4, very sleepy and unresponsive, it was so bad that I could not feel my low blood sugar until all my body was shaking and I needed help to take sugar. Day 5, STOP taking the dame thing. Day 6, Pick up the phone, called my doctor and used every word I have learned in English on him and those scientist, who came up with this IDEA.

I thought they were all due to my conditions, but after truly reflecting on my journey Lyrica surely hurt me more than it helped me. I have been off of the medication for about 3 weeks now. I did some research and learned that my detox period would be both difficult and long because 1, I took the medication for several years, I took a high dosage andi stopped the medicatiod cold turkey.

However, when prescribed Lyrica for fibro pain, my headaches were gone to maybe 3 a week. So I highly recommend this for serious headache problems. Does help with Fibro pain. But, weight gain and dry mouth are my biggest side effect and is to the extent that I almost want to go back to 8 Excedrin a day. Hope this helps someone!",

The medicine is astoundingly good for me at combating depression, anxiety, overall body pain & morning stiffness. It takes higher doses of Lyrica to feel pain relief for most people with Fibromyalgia- those who say it doesn't work have often only tried it at <300mg a day. I take 300mg twice a day. The only bad side effect is weight gain- 100lbs. (And I'm naturally overweight to begin with, so this was terrible). It did eventually stop making me gain, but I have to eat less and work out more than everyone else I know, just to maintain my weight, let alone lose.",

Off course this still left me with pain and numbness from my neck down both arms. About a month or so ago I switched to a spine and pain management doctor and he put me on the Lyrica (75mg 3x daily) and a Duragesic patch.

Yesterday I went across the street, came back to my house to get the garden hose, back across the street to water my neighbors plants, and lugged the hose back home. Suddenly I realized, I forgot my walker. I completely forgot it. I wake in the morning, pain free. I am walking now without the walker, it has also improved my mood. I used to cry a lot, because I could not do the \"normal\" things, people my age can do. I am 50 years old, and have been on disability for 8 years. I feel like a new person.",
                    "I have suffered with severe anxiety and depression for years. I tried 6 different antidepressants as well as benzodiazepines and all did nothing for me of any help. Eventually I was put on Pregabalin by a Psychiatrist and it was very helpful almost from day one. We increased my dose until I take the maximum of 300mg twice a day. At this dose my anxiety has been pretty much eliminated, I am happy and now an active person. However a word of warning to anybody taking this medicine for a long time: DO NOT allow yourself to suddenly withdraw from it. I recently had to go a week without it and it was a living hell for me. Withdrawal symptoms for me were as follows: severe anxiety and depression, suicidal ideation, inability to sleep, nausea and vomiting",
                    "I have been on 300 mg of Lyrica a day for a double herniation in my back. The side effects I experienced were dizziness, anxiety and sleeplessness. However, I did not gain weight. Maybe that is because I had read that you could gain weight and I changed my diet so that I would not. In fact, I lost 25 lbs. while on it. I read that I am in the minority with this. I can say for the most part Lyrica helped, but I had to take Advil with it. Overall, it helped.",
                    "I have fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis. I took one Lyrica pill and it caused me to hallucinate. I was afraid to take another one so I had my pharmacist dispose of the medicine for me. ",
                    "Did not work only gained weight",
                    "I feel compelled to write a review on Pregabalin, and having been on the medicine for nearly a year now, I feel I can fully evaluate its effects.  I was put on Pregabalin for generalized anxiety disorder and seasonal affective disorder by my Doctor. At first I was put on a very low dose of 75mg, which did next to nothing. I immediately requested to have the dose increased until finally I reached a dose that was effective enough for me (600mg). For a while the medicine did its job and I actually felt like my anxiety had been reversed. I suffer bad social anxiety, and 300mg of this made me quite extroverted and confident. I would say it was 'pro social' for sure. Alas tolerance set in and now even 800mg doesn't do much of anything apart from prevent withdrawals.",
                    "Been taking lyrica for 4 months now for carpel tunnel and neuropathy in hands and feet. It is no good. It has not stopped the pain at all, makes me so dizzy I am afraid to drive my car, legs swell like balloons, and have gained over 30 pounds in 3 months. A clinical research was recently done in Australia on lyrica (for Acute and Chronic Sciatica) and the findings stated it had the same effect as the research subjects getting placebos or sugar pills. The makers have racked in 3 billion dollars on it. I told my doc it isn't working but he still prescribes it to me, finding another doc this week. I just got a months supply, 90 pills 3 times a day, 150 mg at a cost of $1,111.19. Biggest drug ripoff in history.",
                    "I was in constant pain 24/7, and I used to take so many showers to try to get some relief. Nothing helped and I was in tears, I just could not stand the pain and discomfort any longer. My sister was on Lyrica because she had Fibromyalgia and got relief. So the next time I was at the doctors I asked him about taking Lyrica and he thought that it was a good idea. It took awhile but each day that went by more of my pain left me, and now I am pain free from Fibromyalgia. My side effects was gaining weight and that was about it. Any day I would gain 20-30 lbs. to get rid of that terrible pain. Thank you Lyrica.",
                    "I'm only taking 50 mg at night for my leg sciatica pain and I feel dizzy at times. I'm also using Dr. Ho TENS machine on my lower back for 40 minutes to scramble the signal pain. I think both are helping right now. I was on a higher dose over 300mg a few years ago and my hands and feet swelled up and I gained 30 pounds I can't get rid of now even with water pills, so I had to stop med. I've had shingles right when I turned 50 before I could get the Shingles vaccine which I recommend to everyone as shingles is painful! I took only Lyrica 25mg two or three times a day to stop the shingles pain, A low dose due to side effects from a larger dose.",
                    "Lived with a severe generalized anxiety disorder for the last 10 years, last 5 years particularly full of anguish and \"crippling\" discomfort. Always misdiagnosed as a depression: been on SSRIs for 4 years with no success; also resistant to benzodiazepines. I was starting to believe I'd have to live like this forever until today! I got my very first dose of Lyrica (just a tiny 25mg) and after it kicked in (4 hours) I've been feeling myself, like I didn't since I was a boy! Layers of heavy bricks lifted away from my chest, and I finally feel like any human is supposed to feel. Today is undoubtedly the happiest day of my last 5 years. I feel lighthearted and motivated, serene and willing to restart my life like I was born again.",
                    "After very successful spinal surgery in Thailand, I went without pain for almost 3 years. I was all but in a wheel chair prior to surgery. I then took a bad fall and pain came back. Fully expecting surgery I returned to Thailand and doctor suggested Neurontin. Although I got some relief, the side effects were intolerable. He then put me on Lyrica. It stopped the pain within 24 hours. He said it would take a few days. I was on it about 45 days and then weaned myself off. I think anyone with spinal stenosis should ask your doctor about this. I think they have just approved it for back pain here in the States. My surgery was in 2005, and went back in 2008. It was a miracle for me.",
                    "Lyrica stops the pain in the ball of my feet. It's wonderful to be able to walk without the pain. I am diabetic and take insulin. I too have had a weight gain of 35 lbs over the past 6 months. I seem to suffer from a bit more memory loss than before and I fatigue easily. I have caught myself dozing off in front of the computer at work, so I force myself to get up and walk around a bit. All in all a small price to pay for the relief of the pain in my feet.",
                    "This is very good for my generalized anxiety disorder along with olanzapine. I take 100mg at night, it helps me sleep too.",
                    "After suffering from horrible post herpatic neuralgia in the trigeminal nerves on the left side of my face, I went to a neurologist who put me on Lyrica. A small dose of 50 mg each night keeps my symptoms under control. I tried adding a morning dose, but it made me giggle at inappropriate times, so I went back to only taking it at night. For over two years my pain has been controlled well. One night I forgot to take my medicine and the next day I had a painful attack. I'll never forget it again! I'm so thankful for this medicine. There are so many other medicines that I tried and could not take, but this one works great for me.",
                    "Good for generalized anxiety disorder but side effects were bad.",
                    "Works pretty well for the pain, but having severe side effects (involuntary musclular movement involving jerking of legs and difficulty speaking, urinary retention and inability to urinate, dramatic weight gain of 30 pounds so far)",
                    "Had neuropathic pain in right upper jaw after dental work. Tried many different medicines including tricyclic's eventually put onto Lyrica went up to 900mg as well as Endep 40mg. Couldn't tolerate Endep, worked my way back down to 600mg Lyrica and after 6 months the nerve pain is tolerable. What I didn't' realize was all the side effects that I now believe stems from Lyrica, severe bloating, sore eyes, memory loss, word problems, hand and feet pains, plus more. I have now found that it makes little difference between 75 or 300mg for pain relief. I have difficulty sleeping without any, 75 will eventually help but 300 gets me to sleep faster. After reading so many people complaining about the same side effects, I will be seeing my Dr.",
                    "I just started with this medication. I took one 75 mg pill in the late evening before going to sleep. When I took it I said to myself yea right this little tiny pill will somehow give my life back to me...the next morning when I awoke to my surprise, I felt like I did years ago. I could walk and stand without the aching and hurting. I was not as tired nor as sore in my muscles. What a wonderful little miracle this little pill is!!!",

I have shed many tears in pain and dejection, but not so many lately. Thanks Lyrica.",

An episode of severe pain and nerve issues recently meant I was signed off for 4 weeks to rest, however during this time my whole nervous and neurological pain got worse as well as physical collapse and spread to my face hands, arms and body functionality. The lowest point in five years thus far. I was put on Pregablin 75mg /2x day and although the first week was strange with hyper elation, a foggy mind and some humorous speech issues but when it kicked in the transformation was amazing. 3 months later I'm far more stable and working fulltime. Some back pain has returned with occasional sciatica.",

                    "I just weaned myself off of Cymbalta/Neurontin and started taking 50mg Lyrica capsules twice a day. I have been taking Lyrica for only TWO DAYS and have had amazing results. I may be reporting on this drug too soon but I am finding my pain receding greatly. I am feeling almost \"normal\", my spirits are definitely raising and hope that I can avoid nerve cutting surgery that would be my last choice for relief. I am an optimist by nature and am so hoping that 100mg a day will keep me pain free and away from the scalpel.",
                    "Lyrica has its pros and cons like any other medicine in the market. Lyrica has helped me in many ways including neuropathic pain and depression together with other antidepressants. The only side effect that bothers me a little is the fact that I feel tired most of the time but I can still function with a lot of calmness. On the other hand I have tried every single medicine for insomnia during the last 12 years with not so great results until I found this medicine. Now I sleep like a baby at 150mg twice a day.",
                    "I had minor back surgery and one result was nerve damage to the nerves from my right leg socket to my hip. Severe burning several times per year. Lyrica stops the severe pain slowly and reduces it to tolerable pain. I use 75mg on a nine day regimen - 3x for 3 days, 2x for 3 days and 1x for 3 days. It works good. The pain slowly resides and is gone by 6th day. No serious side effects. Slight vision blurring and minor lack of mental focus. Very minor. Overall, I think it works for me. Has not affected appetite, weight, mental attitude or sleeping habits.",
                    "My own experience was awful. I did not gain weight but I had been suffering with depression because of all the pain I was in. My doctor prescribed these which in my option she should have never done specially when I was very down at the time. I've never experienced such thoughts in my life the only time I got a break from my own thoughts was when I was sleeping. If you are feeling down at all while taking these my advice go see your doctor ASAP do not continue with these not advisable to anyone with depression",

It helped a little, but still had substantial back pain requiring Ultracet 3x per day and Lortabs when pain peaked. Have been on Lyrica 75mg 3x per day for past 11 days. Really reduced the pain the first few days, but pain came back a bit. Still, the Lyrica is helping and I've not had to take the Lortabs since starting Lyrica. I'm going to stick with Lyrica for a few more weeks before deciding to try more injections or other medicines.",
                    "I have been taking Lyrica for about 1 year and I went from hurting all the time to just my occasional spells. I don't know what I would do without it.",
                    "The real problem I had and still do is dosing. I started out on 150mg twice a day and found it too much at first. GP reduced dose to 75mg three times a day and 1 x 75mg when needed. That is my current dose and the side effects are worth it based on the fact that I've had painful neuropathy in both my feet and lower legs. The breakthrough pain was the main issue I was having trouble with and DID NOT want any more narcotics than I currently take...60mg. MS Contin x 24hours and 2 Statex when required per 24 hours. It can mess with your head a little like feeling like you are a bit spaced out. Works wonderfully and I hope I don't build a tolerance. ",

I'm now in the process of gradually reducing the dose over a period of 8 days. My main reaction was a feeling of being drunk. I refused to drive during this time. On a scale of 1-10 I rate the pain relief a 5 or 6.",

                    "I have had fibromyalgia now for more than 20 years and my back pain was getting out of control. I had been taking a low dose of Lyrica (25mg) for some years, along with a cocktail of about 15 other drugs. I did some research, and came up with the fact that Lyrica was licensed for fibromyalgia, and took this to my doctor, who thought it would be an idea to try increasing the dose. After 3 months I am now up to 100mg night and morning, and am getting reasonable pain relief. However, I have severe side effects,the worst one being disturbed sleep every night through foot and leg cramps. I only have to stretch my legs slightly and it starts. Am getting disrupted sleep every night because of it. ",
                    "I really didn't notice much difference after 6 months on Lyrica - still had minor headaches, but apparently swelling went down (MRI). I DID notice the sleepiness at first, followed by insomnia and 30 lbs weight gain in that 6 months and swollen fingers and belly area.",
                    "I didn't even know Lyrica was prescribed as an off lable treatment for anxiety. I was mainly taking it for my fibromyalgia and phantom pain from an amputation. And I didn't realize until now I had full blown GAD and have probably had it since my teens.  I thought it was mostly depression. I journal and I can see that when I have been on Lyrica I didn't reach the extreme kind of depression I've been in. I recently tried to quit again because it causes me to be lethargic and to not be able to lose weight. It may have been some withdrawal symptoms, but within a week I was in grueling depression-anxiety. The DAY I started back on my 75mg/day Lyrica I started feeling better!",
                    "This didn't really change the pain levels but what it did do was make me gain weight substantially. This lead to me getting depressed which made the fibro flare up again. I stopped taking it.",
                    "I was prescribed Lyrica for fibromyalgia. The first hour after I took Lyrica I felt better and at night, I slept like a dream. I was on for a total of two weeks in which time I started feeling bloated and put on weight. I am a heart patient and I started getting angina. My blood pressure started to raise. I started getting headaches. My only wish was that I could have continued taking Lyrica as the fibromyalgia pain was gone. But I'll just have to keep looking. ",
                    "I started taking Lyrica 4 months ago. I am always anxious when taking a new medicine as I am also on Paxil, which is horrible if I do not have a dose within 24 hours. Within an hour I felt 'weird' like I do if i miss a dose of Paxil. That feeling subsided throughout the day. Over the next days I did feel quite vague and forgetful (like I couldn't remember my bank account number, which I use daily). Again I persisted, taking 75mg twice a day, on waking and then at 2pm. I noticed an increase in energy and a decrease in pain. ",

I also get pain \"breakthrough\" where pain attacks can reach up to 10 on a pain scale. I started Lyrica last year, and now am on 225Mg twice a day and have the same amount of pain control as the Gabapentin, but at a much lower dose. My wife says that I am much more \"aware\" and \"responsive\" on Lyrica and my short term memory issues are not quite as severe, however still there. My weight gain has ceased, however I am having a tough time trying to lose all the weight I have gained.",
                    "I began reporting my symptoms of peripheral neuropathy to my doctor in the 90's. My stroke in 2002 finally got my doctor's attention that my nerve pain was real. She dropped me as her patient and subsequent doctors ignored my pain complaints. In 2004 I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia but my Neurologist said not to take Lyrica. Fortunately, I recently got a new Primary Care Physician and new Neurologist. Two weeks ago, my new PCP gave my samples of Lyrica. I am amazed at my improved ability to function already. I think of the years of being bedridden at age 36-41. I can't believe that I wasn't prescribed Lyrica, a decade ago. No side effects so far. I still have pain 24/7, but the relief due to Lyrica, is a miracle.",
                    "I was given Lyrica for my fibromyalgia in 2007. No relief, but gained 30 pounds in 3 months and continued gaining until it reached 55 pounds! I've lost less than 10 pounds, hard weight to lose so be aware.",

The anti depressants had effects but not desirable ones.At times they replaced some anxieties with others and bad side effects. Sleep, sex drive, confusion. From someone who has experimented with recreational drugs including ecstasy the feeling I had from anti depressants was sometimes similar to a moderate come down from recreational drugs. I pretty much gave up on drugs Then along came pregablin which I hadn't spotted before. It is by far the best thing I've taken I started on 150mg a day now on 225mg won't go higher I don't feel as scared anymore I can do things. Try it.",

I also have to take Cymblata and tramadol with morphine but like I said I have full body RSD. Only side effect is my vision and I feel like I'm high but the benefits outweigh the side affects",
                    "I am 36, have a bad case of herniated disc that hits me in the back. Lyrica has helped a lot with pain and overcoming my hernia's crisis twice, at 150-300 mg daily. This is not an example of chronic use, although I might be such one case in the future if the problem persists.  In lower doses it seems to take more time (days) to take effect, in higher doses the side-effects are more pronounced.  My side-effects were: slight sedation, euphoria, strange body coordination, all in all: the psychoactivity. One can have an accident on these, so caution should be exercised and doctors instructions followed strictly. Using cars or other potential dangerous machines should probably be avoided too.  ",

My doctorr tested for inflammatory diseases and autoimmune diseases and nothing showed up. He decided to treat me as if I have fibromyalgia and gave me Lyrica (not sure what dose but supposed to take 2x a day) this little capsule is great. I can move and actually sleep comfortably at night. Only issue is it does make me sleepy so I can only take at night but that's good for me right now.",

Either this, or combined first 3 days muscle relaxant made my pain vanish. I was prescribed for 15 days and after 8 days, I forgot to take one night. I felt much better next day (after not taking).

I still can't believe it. I was sure I had Alzheimers. I now know I don't. I'm 65 and can't believe I may be able to be a normal person after being so mentally ill for more than 20 years.

                    "Lyrica works. Unfortunately, I am on the verge of discontinuing use because of significant side effects. The most troubling for me are the eye disorders (conjunctivitis and blurred vision), and the dementia. I am 53 years old and I have trouble remembering elementary words! It's very embarrassing. I also have a significant taste disorder... many things taste like \"burnt garlic\" to me... that's the best way I can describe it. Finally, I have facial bloating, weight gain, and dizziness. I have been on the maximum dose of Lyrica for chronic pain due to degenerative disc disease in my neck. I was willing to endure the weight and dizziness, but the eye, memory and taste problems are intolerable. Too bad, because Lyrica really helps pain.",

Tried everything, but Lyrica has been the one that worked. Not completely, but they may bump up the dosage, I'm told. Trying for 2 more months til I see my GP again. Lucky my insurance pays- otherwise I'd never be able to afford it.",
                    "The best way to describe how well Lyrica works for me is to say, \"I'm young again! I'm a 50 yr old who has suffered with fibromyalgia for many years. Every morning on waking I would just lay in bed dreading the pain and discomfort of something as simple as getting up and out of bed. I was prescribed Cymbalta, Celebrex and Tramadol which help; but nothing works as well as Lyrica. I am able to get more done now without slowing down. Like I said before, I feel years younger. I have read that Lyrica poses an abuse warning, but what I experience isn't really euphoria (High) as one might experience with opiates. I experience relief of pain and maybe \"light on my feet\" and actually stronger muscles %u2014 but not the euphoria of opiates.",

                    "This is a miracle medicine. My pain prior to taking this medicine was so bad. I was having a hard time waking up in the mornings cause the pain was just wearing me down. It was harder to function at work too. My imagination started running wild as I started wondering if I was going to end up on social security disability. I've had 2 back surgeries C4-C7, and started to have new pain in the T spine below the 3 level fusion. I started taking Neuronton a few months ago for my pain and it did help some, but after a few months it wasn't helping anymore. My pain was strong and deep. I just didn't have much hope in this medicine but it is AMAZING! I have my life back. It helped with my anxiety also.",
                    "Like most others, I've tried everything possible for fibromyalgia over the past several years. I also have 3 herniated discs and chronic back pain. I tried Lyrica in the past and it did not help. Two years later I tried it again and in fact am still on 300 mg/day in combination with Flexeril 10 mg at night. It helped to take the edge off for about a month then suddenly stopped working. As I am going on a vacation soon, I am not beginning to wean off yet as I will wait until we return. Perhaps increasing the dosage would help? We will see. So far all I had was a month with a little less pain and am having a hard time maintaining my weight. My memory loss and grasping for words has also noticeably increased (and I am young). ",
                    "I was taking only 75mg per day of Lyrica for Fibromyalgia pain. I found it to be very helpful to me and helped me to get much needed rest at night. I took my dosage at night 2 - 3 hours before bed. My only issue with it was there were occasions where I felt a little \"spacy\" but overall, the pain left and I was able to carry out most of my day without significant pain. It was a very low dosage, so a lot of the side effects that some people experience could be from taking a much larger dosage. I am no longer taking it because I lost my insurance and can't afford the cost. However, I was told about Neurontin, will be starting it tomorrow and hoping to get some similar relief.",
                    "I was formally diagnosed with fibromyalgia August 2009. After 8 months of trying other medicines and physical therapy I finally gave in to my Doctor and tried Lyrica. I was nervous because I had used Neurontin in the past with bad side effects and thought Lyrica would be the same. I was wrong. Lyrica does make me sleepy but I take 75 mg at night about 2 hours before bed. My Doctor started me out on the lowest dosage and it has worked miracles for me. I have less pain and my muscles don't seem to spasm or twitch as much, I am able to increase my activity levels which helps with the stiff muscles. It also has helped to calm the nerves in my foot that were irritated in an unrelated injury. This medicine has been a miracle for me.",
                    "When I took Lyrica, I gained 40 lbs myself and my eyes were blurry. Once I got off of the medicine it has been still hard to lose the weight. It did work for my leg pain but the side effects were to much!",
                    "I have found I have an increased urge to eat sweet foods. I have tried to control this by eating fruit. However, this does not stop the craving for sweets. Also I have noticed an increased thirst and less urination. Further I have been able to stop using morphine patches and taking Mersyndol Forte since starting Lyrica. The lessening of pain has enabled me to sleep better",
                    "The nerve pain became so unbearable that it forced me to take lyrica despite the bad reviews and long list of negative side effects. I was told by many that it worked a lot better that neurontin with less drastic negative effects. Well, it has eased my pain some, but the side effects have taken my life from me. I'm dizzy at times, my head is always foggy and not clear thinking, I have depression, anger outbursts I've never had before, daily nausea, and am so tired that I can sleep all day and night long and can barely function. Unfortunately the alternative medications have even worse negative side effects, so what are we supposed to do in order to have some normalcy?",
                    "I call it a miracle drug like most others who have shared their comments. I have been taking it now for 7 months, currently 450mg a day (for treatment of fibromyalgia). I gained about 20 pounds within 2 months which I desperately needed to do. Overall, I have a better life now thanks to Lyrica. Nothing that I have been prescribed in the last 14 years has even came close to treating my condition.",
                    "I've suffered from Fibromyalgia since I was 16 years old (I'm now 24). My doctor put me on pain killers/ muscle relaxers, anti-inflammatories, Cymbalta and the list goes on. I've been told to change my diet. Nothing truly worked. Then I saw the Lyrica commercial. Asked my Doctor about it and he told me he had heard great things about it. I was given a free week trial. The FIRST pill- I could tell a slight difference. It's day 7 for me and I LOVE this pill thus far. ",
                    "It works for the muscle aches and it actually makes me a lot calmer. I don't know if that's just because I feel better so I can relax or if it's the medicine. I was so happy and blessed to find a doctor who listened to what was wrong with me and actually followed through with treatment. Hope that it can help more people and that there are no long term side effects but I am happy with the results and how quickly I felt a difference.",
                    "If you are debating on whether to take this, please don't hesitate. I was in car accident Dec 2012 and have whiplash/cervical strain. Injured my neck and shoulder. I was in pain for the past 9 months and no doctor would prescribe me narcotics due to Ohio law. I was miserable, crying, irritable and nothing I took (IB, Tylenol) wouldn't touch the pain. I got a prescription for Gabapentin, which I am allergic to BAD side effects. Finally the doc gave me Lyrica, within 15 min of taking pain GONE. I feel like I'm back to normal again (like the day before accident). Lyrica is a miracle although pricey. There is a program you can get through Lyrica website to qualify for free prescription. Try it.",
                    "Initially, this medicine was a godsend. Burning pain finally fizzled away. Muscle pains, didn't help as much. Still got numb and weak as well. The real problem came months later when I realized I was having memory problems. Had to wean off it. Memory loss was permanent. Chunks of time just gone. I still think because of the state of pain I was in I would do it over. Maybe the pain made me block out the time. I wish I would have just risked stopping it sooner to see if the nerve had healed. I still take them when I am desparate for relief. But just one maybe two until the zingers stop. Oh ya, nerves were damaged from electricity. Hand to my neck and face.",
                    "Hi. I have been on methotrexate 10 pills once a week and embrel injection 50mg once a week and now added Lyrica 50 mg 2 x a day. Told I have RA, and fibromyalgia. But even with these great meds I feel bad. From my waist to botton of my feet I hurt so. I do see my legs are swelling so very large and skin gets tight it hurts to walk. I dont know what else to do. I work and am on my feet all day. I go up and down the stairs at home I try to get extra walks in going around the blocks. But it hurts too bad. Im very tolerant to pain but this is to the point of no return. I feel bad for my family that maybe I'm a burden. And if I feel this way now how will I feel if I'd ever need some one to help me with everyday chores and hygiene. They may not see",
                    "After a head/neck/spine injury I found the drug to be very helpful with the neuropathic pain in my arm, face and various body parts. Weight gain is a minor issue. I don't suffer night terrors but feel as though I've been dragged through a hedge backwards upon awakening. I do NOT feel rested upon awakening. Cognitive issues due to the injury have been exaggerated after taking Lyrica.",
                    "This medicine was my neuropathic calming wonder medicine until my body over the course of several years had progressed to full body pain. I recommend anyone who has new or has out grown their pain medication to talk to your doctor about this.",
                    "The first time I used Lyrica I experienced an amazingly profound reaction; layers of depression and anxiety that had built up over several years melted away within minutes. That was years ago and I have since both weaned myself off the drug and restarted taking it again. One thing I rarely see mentioned is the terrifyingly bad withdrawal effect- missing more than one dose for me throws me into the absolute darkest pits of despair. Has anyone else experienced this? When I went off the drug the first time I felt like I had performed a miracle; so strong was the feeling that it took a long time for me to convince myself that things were bad enough to warrant going back on. It still helps, but nothing as miraculous as the first time.",
                    "Lyrica is the best medication for generalized anxiety disorder. I am on 75mg twice a day and been able to slowly get off my clonazepam without the benzodiazepine withdrawal. Brain fog will go away after being on it for about a month. Only other side effect is the cost.",
                    "Lyrica 25mg has been my beginning dose and I have been sleeping well, waking up feeling no pain, have no pain during the day, have a good mood and best of all no side effects! My doctor says that if I am comfortable on this dose I can stay at this amount and I don't have to go up if I don't need to!",
                    "I have been on Lyrica for a week now, 150 mg only at night and have not felt this good in three years. I am move active. I have not gain any weight yet, but hopefully be as active as I am now I will lose weight.",
                    "I have suffered from panic disorder and GAD for well over 10 years, starting in my early 20s. I finally sought treatment 3 years ago, but nothing helped. CBT, 40mg Citalopram, nothing. I then discovered pregabalin on this website. It was a struggle to get it prescribed on the NHS in the UK, but I'm so glad I persevered. This medicine is nothing short of a miracle. Within 24 hours I was a new person. I've only been taking it a week, but now I feel light and happy, and the anxiety has just faded away. I don't need alcohol any more. In fact, the thought of drinking now makes me feel ill.  If you have GAD - please try this. I'm only on 75mg twice a day as well.",
                    "This gave me incredibly bad nightmares not read other reviews with this problem but main reason I'm coming off it... does help slightly with anxiety but feel a bit too relaxed not good for daytime and work... does 150mg taken at night also causes dizziness and my eyes can't focus extremely groggy in the morning not great for me",
                    "I have been suffering from severe pudendal nerve damage pain and fibromyalgia for over 12 years. Vicodin, Percocet, Duragesic, Oxycontin, injections, you name it. Lyrica 75mg 2-3 x day has made the biggest difference in my life and pain in over 12 years. I can walk without a cane and I feel like doing things. There was some initial weight gain, but that seems to have leveled off. I've been amazed and very pleased.",
                    "I used Hydrocodone and Tramadol for persistent joint and neck/back pain. Didn't appreciate the foggy out of body living experience but it did help the pain. Although with narcotics, I became easily resistant and constant increasing of dosage doesn't seem like the most practical idea for long term pain. Lyrica took about one month to actually show it's benefits, luckily I had gotten free samples for that trial period. After the 1st month I noticed significant relief from my persistent joint pain. I am able to function normally for most of the day without any issues. So happy to have found Lyrica, just wish it wasn't so expensive!",
                    "I have been on lyrica for 1 month, starting at one 75mg twice daily for two weeks, then stayed on 150mg twice daily for two weeks. I had horrible side effect so my doctor told me to split the morning dose that was 150mg in to taking 75mg in the morning and 75mg afternoon, then 150 at nite. So the side effects got better. I suffered from extreme dizziness, increased anxiety, had a feeling my legs couldn't carry me, burning sensation throughout the whole body. After one month of medication, when side effect had gone away a little bit, I talked to my doctor and he told me than since I still suffer from anxiety we should increase the dose to 150/75/150. Side effects are back, I take oxazepam 30 mg to get through the worst side effect and waiting for a better effect on anxiety. However I am better than before.",
                    "My doctor just put me on Lyrica 25 mg tablet twice a day. The first day I took one dose around lunch the other before bedtime and got sleepy in the day. Anyway I emailed doctor he said only take the one at nite but I decided to take both at nite and feel great! I have suffered for years with fibromyalgia and cymbalta was not working for the fibromyalgia but I also take cymbalta for depression so still on that added the Lyrica and feel that the great pain is so much less, my knees and ankle pain, burning sensation all down, and finally get a good sleep without all the leg pain. I am thankful for this drug and finally can get my life back on track and finally see light at the end of my long tunnel of dealing with this horrible condition.",
                    "I have been taking Lyrica for 6 weeks.The first 5 weeks I took 50mg twice daily.Literally at the 5 week mark I had significant improvement.My pain was at a consistent pain level of an 8/9 before starting and now a 5/6.I would like to note I had no side effects at this dose.My doctor increased my dose to 100mg twice daily a week ago and now I have side effects,headaches that last all day,everyday where as before I did have chronic headches that came and went during the day from fibro. Also my fingers and face are very puffy to the point of being uncomfortable.And the worst part is the chronic dry mouth.I have to keep a water bottle on hand to sip on constantly!(Having a chronic dry mouth puts you at a higher risk of cavities.)And weight gain",

I honestly didn't think pregabalin would be effective but I noticed immediately it helping with the pain in my foot where I'm sure there is nerve damage as well as in my arm where I broke it. Later on in the day I set about doing a chore and realized my anxiety was gone. I mean I still had worry but it was managable? Hard to explain. Started off at 300 mg a day and went up to 450 a day then after a few weeks it was like my anxiety worsened.(I have GAD and take Clonazepam) I was going to go off the Pregbalin but I'm down to 100mg in the morning 50mg at dinner and 50 mg at night. Ok so far",
                    "Hello! I have severe Neuropathic pain from spinal injuries. I had a spinal block that worked for a while, but it didn't take care of all the pain. My life was pretty limited as to what I could do, which was pretty much sitting in a chair at the computer or watching tv. My love for the outdoors was pretty much squashed since it requires bending over, which I can't do, due to the rods and screws in my back. I have only taken this medicine for two days, and I have already have noticed a huge difference. I am actually able to move around more. I also have osteoarthritis, and my joints were hurting. Not anymore. This stuff is amazing. The only drawback is the cost. I have to take it three times a day, and it's really expensive.",

Yet nobody knows the source of these symptoms. Due for a muscle biopsy soon. While taking tramadol and hydrocodone had great results for energy and pain, I became dependent. I was prescribed Lyrica 50mg about 2 months ago and felt a little relief. Doctor raised the dosage and now I take 150mg 3 times a day and the results are amazing. I'm alert, energetic, and pain free. Have a little dizziness now and then, but this medicine is great.",
                    "I would just like to say that I know everyone worries about weight gain on this drug so I thought it important to share a positive experience with this drug. I am on 300mg per day and have experienced no side effects and absolutely no weight gain. I am so much calmer and happier, my mood doesn't plummet suddenly, I am not anxious at all anymore and I am sleeping like a log! 10/10 don't let fear of sudden weight gain effect your decision to take this drug, remember that when they test drugs they don't take into consideration the lifestyles of the test subjects, that 1 in 10 person could just eat to much day to day which would result in weight gain and have nothing to do with the drug. Don't worry too much about it!",

Couldn't sleep due to pain took hydrocodone daily which upset my stomach and I became dependant on it every night and morning due to severe pain.

I explained to the dr that I didn't feel depressed but I worried constantly through the night about things, and would also wake suddenly with chest pain. The dr sent me for ECG but I knew the pain was linked to anxiety. Anyway, after the ECG came back clear, he prescribed Pregabalin (a much lower dose than most people on here) and I only take one at night. I now sleep better, I have not woken with a panic attack since taking them, and my anxiety is no longer controlling me. I've been on them 6 months.",

I have found the side effects to be minimal, the most noticeable is mid afternoon drowsiness and a bit of vertigo. This medicine has also helped calm the need for frequent urination. Who knew?",

My feet still sting and burn on and off everyday. One time, I decided to slowly stop taking Pregabalin and take the generic drug, Gabapentin and my feet flared up by a 1000 percent. I asked my doctor if he could prescribe Pregabalin again. I have had zero/none side effects taking Pregabalin but recently I came across reading peoples \"hellish/nightmare\" experiences trying to wean and stop taking this drug. That scares me and I do not want to be dependent on this drug or any drug. I am going to slowly wean myself off and find other ways to deal with my nerve pain. Prayers needed!",

My relationship with my husband and my baby (with whom I have had terrible difficulties bonding/guilt/PND.

Lyrica has been the miracle drug for me and I have been taking it for about 3 years. It takes time for any drug to work properly and I couldn't function with out it. 150mg a day is my dosage.

My head was spacey and I couldn't register what people were saying, and once I realised I couldn't come up with a reply. Today, I woke up and I felt drunk and stoned at the same time but not as severe. I found it hard walk straight, my balance was off. I feel happier but not less anxious?

I am trying it for GAD (general anxiety disorder) after trying antidepressants; I tried SSRI's like Paxil and Lexapro and these were horrible failures. The SSRI's made me suicidal BUT Lyrica seems to really be doing the trick! The weight of anxiety is totally gone, and I feel somehow stronger and more self confident, although the feeling is a little manic at times and irregular, like feeling quite drowsy, then quite manic, in a short period of time. But I am assuming that this might stabilize after a few more days. So far I feel like a new person!",

Sleeping better, emotions have come back and I am not an anxious wreck! very helpful and no side effects.

It helped with some of the fibro pain and I felt tired and a little dizzy along with having dry mouth which I expected as common side effects. What surprised me was I got new pains in new places--my big toe felt like it was on fire and my lower back hurt badly. I started weaning off of Lyrica and the new pains went away. I also had insomnia from weaning process. I think it does work to dull the fibro pain but not sure if it's worth it if there are new pains.",

It definitely relieved my leg pain. I was also taking Tramadol which I decreased because Lyrica does the job as well and I don't like the tramadol as it makes me sleepy. Lyric does not make me sleepy. I have had no problems with Lyrica and been on it several months . Have gone off it also for several weeks with no problems at all. Maybe it helps some people and others not. For me, it really relieved my nerve pain in my legs.",

The thing I didn't like about it though was that it always made me feel like I was in a cloud. My thinking wasn't clear. I would get dizzy. I didn't notice too much of a weight gain, but there was some. In the end, I chose to try a different med (Savella) after my daughter was born and have been happier with that. Still works and fewer side effects.",

I have only been taking it for 3 days and I can already tell a significant difference. My hands and feet have no burning pain and I seem to have less numbness. I have also noticed that it helps tremendously with my anxiety. I was taking Xanax 1mg 3x a day and now I only take it once a day if that. I seem to feel more relaxed and less anxious so maybe this will actually help me stop taking the Xanax which I've tried so many times in the past. So far I am super impressed with this medication.",

Have your Doctor consult with a psychiatrist - because they know effective drugs to layer with this anticonvulsant - and you can continue to reap the benefits of Lyrica. I know it sure worked for me & life is so worth living now.",
                    "I have been having pain in my wrists, hands and elbows for years due to waiting tables and hefting 100 pound trays on one hand. Lately, I was having more pain in those areas, and my hips have started really hurting me. My doctor and I ran tests, and by process of elimination we feel that I have chronic fatigue, which can contribute to a lot of the allergy/asthma symptoms, the pains and exhaustion. I started taking Lyrica and am up to 100mg 3 x daily. I feel great. Everything but my hip is better.",
                    "Definitely helps with anxiety when combined with an SSRI.",
                    "Lyrica was my miracle drug for the first few weeks. I've been living with Fibromyalgia for over 5 years and have tried everything. Anti depressants, exercise, narcotics, you name it. So I was excited about the dramatic pain reduction from Lyrica. But now I have developed severe muscle weakness, headache, abdominal cramping, blurry vision, bad judgement which causes accidents to my fingers and toes I have recently had difficulty thinking clearly. I can barely hold myself up and I can't lift anything over a few pounds. I have asked my doctor if I can safely stop taking it. She said stop daytime and only take at bedtime. every other night till I ween off. My quality of life has worsened. I have started Chondroiden, MSM powder and ALpha Lipoid",
                    "been on Lycria for 6 months 75mg twice daily then 150mg twice daily. Had facet joint injections and spinal block. Found out I had CFS and Fibromyalgia. Tried stopping lycria for 1 day as I gained confidence. Went back on it within 1 day leg and lower back pain unbearable. Sleep much better on it . Would advise anyone to try for chronic pain- side effects much less than Gabapentin by far. Had to stop work lost cognitive ability and brain fog worsened",
                    "I have suffered from progressive neuropathy over the last 5 years to where it finally became intolerable, particularly in my feet and legs, and starting to spread to my arms and even my face. I now have a doctor who has prescribed Lyrica for me for the last 4 months. At a starting dose of 75mgs twice daily there was noticeable relief. Still hurting, however, my dosage was increased to 300 mgs twice daily which has successfully reduced the pain so that I am able to function at a higher level than I have experienced in years with minor side effects, the most annoying of which is sleepiness. I am grateful and relieved to have been introduced to Lyrica and to have insurance that will cover it as it is obscenely expensive.",
                    "I've been diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy and was taking gabapentin switched to lyrica and am now much improved.",
                    "I have had fibroymalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, and was hit by a hit and run driver on my bicycle and have taken many different pain medications including Lortab 10 mg, and have had considerably more pain relief from Lyrica than any other medication I have taken.",
                    "Was on this for about 3 months. First few days I had some coordination issues, which I was warned about, probably on the 4th day something kicked in and I felt wonderful. I have very bad social anxiety but on that day I was not afraid of anything, I felt any goal that I had always wanted to pursue I suddenly could, and even if I failed, I would deal with it. My only fear that day was that this would be temporary, and sadly, it was. The next day I took it, and I got only the slightest hint of what I had the day before, the tiny effect maybe lasted for the next couple days, then nothing, I kept taking it, thinking it might somehow kick in after time, but then I started to notice I was gaining lots of weight I stopped.",
                    "A true miracle! I'm 36 and have been living with pain for years - along with panic attacks and chronic anxiety. Was given various prescriptions and decided I did not want to live dependent on pills - the side effects were just too much. Yesterday my doctor encouraged me to try Lyrica. With hesitation I took the first pill last night and woke up feeling like I did 10 years ago! I'm still shocked. I haven't noticed any side effects, but this is definitely worth every penny!",
                    "I suffer from fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis and surgically induced menopause. I am 40 years old. I have tried all medicines like Cymbalta, etc. but none really helped. My main issue has been a lack of deep restorative healing sleep as it exacerbates the fibromyalgia pain and inability to exercise. My Rhematologist has given me Lyrica to try and I have to say so far so good. I have only taken 3 doses and already I am getting a better quality sleep. So much so that my husband has noticed my improved overall state of mind. I am a little cloudy the next day but I am hoping this will ease over time. Worth the cost of a cup of coffee a day if it helps!",
                    "I was prescribed this for fibromyalgia, I've tried it several times at low doses and have had a horrible experience. I can not explain this but within an hour of taking lyrica I get the most severe tooth pain, like every tooth suddenly has a hole in it ? I went to my dentist the first time NO HOLES?? My doctor thought it was amusing ? Bizarre. My real problem is the next morning after taking lyrica I have horrendous stomach pain for days, hurts to urinate, poop or fart. Feels like I really have to push to urinate, my doctor said sounds like stomach/intestine inflammation which is on the common side, so I've been taken off it. I will say I sleep like a baby after taking it!",
                    "Saw Dr for pain in my wrists forearm burning pain in shoulder has been going on for years! Only recently after an MRI it found nerve compressions at c4/5 c6/7. Pain increasingly has become worse for the past year and a half! Rt arm /fingers numbness tingling and reduced strength of hand! Must say have arthritis at the base of both wrists with pain in wrists!Put on pregabalin! Took it for first time last night woke up at 4 am with pounding headache dry mouth! Took paracetamol! Pounding headache with nausea still on for most of the morning took painkillers with some effect! Head foggy sleepy!!Felt panicky!!!So didn't take pregabalin dose of the morning as became concerned and scared not being able to endure more!! What to do now???not sure???",
                    "I was on Lyrica for a year. Then my insurance decided hey we aren't paying for this anymore and I had to stop. And it was a just stop completely not a wean off of it. Started on. Gabapentin 800 3x a day. Has done Nothing for me. I am miserable. If you need help paying for it go to there website and they will actually pay for the medication for you. For a year then you just reapply. I will be getting mine back finally this week. And I can't wait to get back on it so I can actually be a mom and a wife again. Without laying in bed all day suffering.",
                    "I have had firbo for 16 years. My stupid doctor , who knew nothing about fibro, put me on some opiates and the one that worked was morphine. it was great, I loved it and then 2 months ago my doctor took me off morphine-paranoid I think about people overdosing.. I was furious with her and plan on changing doctors soon. I called Pfizer and qualified for no charge Lyrica . I received it 4 days ago, 150 mg . I sleep great with it and I also take xanex, trazadone, amitriptyline for sleep, I take it in the morning with my antidepressents and feel ok then I take it around noon and sometimes I feel really flaky. I need to gain about 10 pounds so I am not worried about weight gain.So far it is ok, still have pain but its not horrible..",

                    "I've been prescribed Lyrica 300mg morning and night also Amitriptyline 10mg for TN pain. Before taking these meds life was near unbearable to live. The meds do come with some side affects, short term memory loss and sometimes blurred vision being the worse. I've thankfully not had issue with weight gain. You have take the good with the bad sometimes. Without the prescribed meds life would be hell.",
                    "Thus is intended as a warning about sudden cessation of long term Lyrica use. I've been taking 75mg twice daily Lyrica for severe pain resulting from crush fractures in my spine. I started to feel a slight benefit from the drug a few weeks after beginning to take it but it wasn't until I started swimming that my long standing pain completely disappeared. I never missed a dose until a few days ago: just ran out, had to wait til the next day, effectively missing two doses. I went through an incredibly harrowing experience in that time without the drug...it wasn't psychological: I could almost physically feel the chemistry in my brain and body going totally haywire. It was extremely alarming, nothing can describe how nasty it was.",
                    "I have had fibromylgia now for 20 yrs plus lupus and had 7 tumors removed from my body, heart attack at the age of 40 and about died. I was put on Lyrica 5 years ago and I have my life back. I take 100mg twice a day and now I can enjoy my life again.",
                    "Lyrica works very well with pins, needles, tingling and numbness. The negative side effects were \"loopiness\", and inability to feel full after eating. I gained 40 lbs very quickly.",
                    "The needle standing pain was bad, but then I developed this feeling like I dipped my lower legs and feet in frying oil. It all is getting worse. It has really been tough especially at night trying to sleep.",
                    "I have been in pain for years and started Lyrica. I cannot believe the difference. It is shocking. My pain is so much better. My bladder spasms are gone. I sleep so well. Wake up in the morning without hurting my back and ribs to breath. My chronic diarrhea is gone too. The only thing I have noticed on the negative side is I am super hungry, which doesn't surprise me. Overall, loving it and praying it continues to work. No side affects other than being hungry:)",
                    "I was diagnosed with Lupus 3 yrs. ago.Several months ago,during one of my doctor's visits, I discussed feeling more pain. He prescribed Lyrica. I was taking 3x daily, changed to twice daily. (I was experiencing \"foggy\" thinking with 3x daily). I have been VERY pleased with the results I feel.",
                    "I've had Fibromyalgia for ten years now, along with other health problems and up until a week ago I was using Flexerel and Cataflam to help with the pain and discomfort. Until last week, I was under a lot of stress at work, mind you I teach infants and toddlers up to age 3, and I woke up one morning in pain. Pain over my entire body. Pain I have never felt before. I felt like I had a supped up version of the Flu. I went to work in tears and left in tears and headed straight to my doctor. I began Lyrica that day and I was pretty out of it the first night and especially the next day when I took the next dose. I slept most of the first day and the second day I was a little dizzy headed and off balance. So far Lyrica is working well",
                    "I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia about 18 years ago. I stopped working a few years after due to the pain. I tried many medications so I could have some quality of life with my husband and 2 children. I spent most of my time in bed or on the couch because the pain was so debilitating. I was taking Ultram and Zanex but these just didn't take away the pain and then my doctor started me on Lyrica. I started feeling like a new person because slowly the pain started to decrease. The only side effect which could also be part of Fibromyalgia is with speech. I have trouble sometimes finding the words I want to say. I now take 75 mg 3 times per day and have been taking it for over 10 years. I'm so grateful to have my life back.",
                    "I had shingles in January 2014. I have had terrible PHN ever since. 2.5 years of pain. It has been awful!! Shingles is the worst pain I have ever experienced and it isn't going away. I tried everything out there from Gabapentin to acupuncture, to percocet, to injections in my back and nothing helped, or it would help for a few weeks, but the pain always managed to come back strong. I was wary of Lyrica because of the side effects, but I finally decided to try it. It has definitely helped me and I can do things like ride my bike again with little pain. However, I have put on 8 lbs in 6 months and I am an extremely active person, so this is tough for me. I also have pain in my joints and sometimes my hands go numb, but less pain.",
                    "Have had fibromyalgia for about 20 years. Have been on Lyrica 600mg for 2 years. To date this has offered me the best pain relief. I was also taking Zytram, up until 2 months ago. ",
                    "I have been taking Lyrica for three months. I started out with 75mg twice a day. It took the edge off my fibromyalgia pain during the day but at night I would wake up due to muscle pain when laying on one side too long. My doctor increased me to 150mg twice a day and for the first time in months, I was able to sleep through the night. I feel like a new person. It's a wonder drug. For once I am not walking around like a zombie due to pain and lack of sleep. I have gained a couple of pounds but I can live with that.",
                    "The pain from Fibromyalgia comes as MUSCLE cramping, tingling, twitching, spasms, etc. It is not a \"nerve\" illness per se, yet doctors think people are stupid and prescribe this anyway. It does nothing for the pain or fatigue from Fibromyalgia or Chronic Fatigue/M.E. Until people realize that legitimate users of meds such as Hydrocodone, morphine ER, etc are rarely abused by people in genuine chronic pain, doctors will continue to jeopardize patients lives by giving them meds like this as a placebo with nasty side effects. One doctor also put me on Paxil which gave me Serotonin Syndrome and I was in Intensive care for a week! This was when SSRI's first came out and I went into med journals. Avoid this for chronic MUSCLE pain.",
                    "Had migraines for years tried pitzotifen, gabapentin, sodium valporate, triptans, Co coldamol 30/500, toprimate, been on 75mg pregabalin an off the books trial using the docs words. I'm in UK, 7 weeks migraine free, I normally would have had 6 attacks in that time, works for me. A bit of fatigue only side, I'll take that over debilitating effects of a migraine anytime.",
                    "I have suffered pain in my neck, shoulders, jaw, and suffered from migranes. I have tried EVERYTHING (doctors, physical therapy, massage, accupuncture, psychiatrist, many meds). I was prescribed Lyrica for fibromyalgia pain, and chronic fatigue. I was on almost the highest dose for 2 months and did NOTHING for me but make me gain 25 pounds! I am 5'6\" 125 and went up to 150lbs. 125 pounds is a high weight for me so 150 is too much for my frame. ",
                    "I was prescribed Neurontin for anxiety and panic, but it made me a zombie. I am now taking Lyrica and it is amazing! No more anxiety or panic and my mood is greatly improved. Neurontin was like whiskey hit hard and had \"hangover\", Lyrica is like a fine wine, subtle and mellow and doesn't have the zombie effect. DON'T DRINK ALCOHOL WITH IT this was only a reference. I am taking 75mg at night and 50 in the morning. I also don't need the antidepressants anymore.",
                    "I have been on Lyrica for Fybro for 7 weeks now and I sleep great - I can play with my grandchildren and I don't hurt enough to even complain about - I am off the narcotics - was 2-3x's a day with oxy and overall I am more productive at work and I move more and am much happier. Still tired because I move so much",
                    "I have had neuropathic spine pain since 1984. I have triple S curve; had 6 spine surgeries, and have implanted pain relief system for low back pain. Nothing worked, opioids almost led to death. 2 months ago begam Lyrica (100mg, 3x/day). At beginning: brain felt \"foggy\"; walking unstable; total urinary incontinence (some bowel incontinence). To say I was shocked at how the Lyrica relieved my spine pain is an undersatement! I read all the horror stories, but decided to give it time. This is the first time since the early eighties I have had NO pain! The side effects are gone.",
                    "I take 75 mg at bedtime. I started Lyrica in 2015 when I had shingles. I noticed that I wasn't having crippling anxiety. I was able to stop Klonopin. I went back on Klonopin when we moved out of state. I also started Ambien 5mg. For sleep issues. I thought I could stop Lyrica. That was a big mistake. Last night I didn't take the Lyrica and I am so anxiety ridden and feel physically sick. I will definitely take the Lyrica tonight.",
                    "I was taking 50mg Lyrica every 2 hrs or sooner each day; while it did seem like I had more energy and could work a little longer before resting, the pain never stopped or lightened up. Lyrica  amitriptyline did help me sleep better. I quit taking Lyrica and started taking gabapentin 300mg 3Xper day and the pain lessened a lot, and sleep is better and some of the brain fog is gone. ",
                    "I have been on a wide variety of medicines for anxiety over the last 8 years, recently my Dr put me on Gabapentin because I suffer from extreme sensitivity especially when sitting (burning sensations), I tolerated this quite well at 1800 mg but still had anxiety, My Dr changed me over to Pregabalin four days ago, I have had a pressure headache on and off in the left side of my head and quite severe bloating, however the Anxiety seems more under control, has anyone else had these types of side effects and if so do the pass with time.",
                    "I found this to be very effective in treating the after effects of double fusion of cervical vertebrae. Then I found I was having less difficulty with fibromyalgia. I was on 3 a day and only side effect was weight gain.",

It worked for a couple of years but now my body tolerance has reduced its pain killing efect. Don't want to increase dosage and my neurologist seems at a loss as what to prescribe.",
                    "Diagnosed with fibromyalgia 6 years ago, I've tried many antidepressants and pain killers. I have been in withdrawal of Tramal and replacing it with Lyrica. I see it as my salvation when compared to some of the medications I have taken over the years. YES, withdrawal from any form of medication is horrific and with uncertainty and discomfort. I personally am prepared to go through this horrible time to give Lyrica it's chance to work and improve my life, as I have seen an improvement already. Thanks to those who worked so hard to make this medicine for those of us who need it, know that your work is appreciated.",
                    "Have had fms for 8yrs. Have tried all sorts of meds & have been on fentanyl 75mcg every 48 hrs for the last few years. Fentanyl for fms is like a heavy bat for the wrong ball but was the only bat available.  I have been taking Lyrica for 1 1/2 yrs now. Had 1st pain free days in years when 1st started. Unfortantely, still on fentanyl in addition because I cannot take more then 50mg a day of lyrica w/o it knocking me out. Tried to build tolerance over 3 wks w/o success. Have had wild vision changes also.",
                    "My Anxiety had crippled me to a state which my life could no longer function. The first few days on Lyrica I noted a sense of euphoria and confusion but by the 4th day I found myself able to think about trigger points for my anxiety and was almost in awe of how it didn't raise its head. It seemed like anxiety had left my body, to the point where I had to look in a mirror and say \"why did you care about all that so much?\" Almost in disbelief of my previous behaviour, not being able to connect with those feelings or attitudes became freeing. lyrica gave me my life back it seems. Importantly, I'm still me. Friends and family all commented how much better I am without losing personality which i believe is one of the best qualities of the drug.",
                    "On my first day taking Lyrica, it was incredible - I was patient, calm, and chilled out. I could deal with stress better than I have been able to in my entire life. However, I quickly grew a tolerance, and I spent weeks chasing that feeling by upping my dose. When I finally reached 250mg, I was an absolute zombie. I was taking much longer to finish my sentences and I felt like I was constantly in a fog. My depression has reached an all-time high and my anxiety is still present - I'm just not having panic attacks any more. The past few months have been particularly bad and I just don't think it's worth being on any more. I think I'm especially disappointed now because it started out so well and I'm significantly worse off now.",
                    "It makes the pain go away and I can finally sleep at night. I'm so glad they have this medicine. The only side effect that I have had is the weight gain, which is 25 pounds so far and I have only been on it a month. At first I had some dizziness and minor hand and face swelling but that has gone away. If they could only improve so it wouldn't make you gain weight it would be a perfect medicine.",
                    "in april/may of 2011 i my right foot kept falling asleep over a 3 day period & i had a tingling sensation creep across my groin after 3 days of my right foot falling asleep & the tingling sensation creeping across my waist i was numb from the waist down for 2 weeks since then my feet fell asleep & NEVER woke up i finally got on lyrica & and it has help some with the tingling sensations but it has me feeling oh so stoned thankfully i get my lyrica through the county health department and it doesnt cost me",
                    "I have taken just one 75mg yesterday afternoon. It did not take long at all and I noticed a difference in my pain. I felt good. When I went to bed, I drifted off to sleep and woke up this morning feeling refreshed. It was a wonderful experience.",

                    "Only took one prescribed dose with real bad reaction. Ended up in hospital with dangerously slow heart rate. Unable to talk, walk or stand, it felt like I had a stroke. Severe joint pain and urinary retention developed within 24 hours and I found it incredibly difficult to remain conscious. Hospital staff did not recognise the symptoms as an adverse effect of the medication, even though I handed them the advisory notes from the medication, and treated me as though I was just having an anxiety attack or attention seeking. It wasn't until I was discharged and read up on the medication that I was able to confirm that all the symptoms I had were listed as side effects. needless to say I did not take any more.",

I take 150 mg of Lyrica in the morning and 300mg at bedtime. My sleep is better. I still have difficulty moving around in the morning, but within an hour of taking my morning dosage the majority of my pain, etc is gone.",
                    "I have been on Lyrica almost 2 1/2 years. When I first started it I was really skinny so weight gain didn't bother me but now I have gained over 25 lbs which is not good at all. I am going to go back to Gabapentin which helped me get off morphine. My eyes are dry and blurry. I fart all the time and I am fat! I was off of it the beginning of the year and I was hurting but side affects are too much.",
                    "I was experiencing nerve pain from hernia and knee operations, being a single parent and running a business a while back had me run off my feet and feeling nerve pain running up the bottom of my feet and through my knee joints into the groin, Lyrica has so far taken most of that pain away. What I didn't realise was it also helps with anxiety and depression, after 3 weeks I noticed a calmness I thought I could never achieve, did some googling on the benefits of Lyrica last night and was amazed at everyone's experience on Lyrica. This is great stuff, would recommend it highly, thank you Lyrica, back to fun time with the kids again.",

                    "With the recent changes to pain medication guidelines I was reduced from opiates and given Lyrica to try. RUN, don't walk away from this medicine. My memory got fuzzy, I stumbled and fell in injurying my back, it keeps new synapsis from forming in your brain (I.e. brain damage long term), I have rashes, etc. Most importantly, I started having thoughts of death. All of this on 50mg at bed time.  In a few years I'm sure TV lawyers will be soliciting patients for lawsuits. This is a strong chemical to introduce into a already weak person's system.",
                    "I have suffered a very long time to the point where my bones ached so bad that it brought me to a complete halt in life. My mother also suffers as well as my daughter who is showing many of the symptoms that I had at her age. I have been on Lyrica for ten days now and can not believe the difference it has made. I hope that this med can improve other's lives as well as it has mine, because FM is a horrible thing to have to live with. No side effects so far. Here is hoping it is for you..",
                    "My doctor prescribed this for me when I was dealing with pain from a fractured sternum. After dealing with the pain for over a year we tried this. Fantastic results. Required only 3 weeks of treatment and the pain resolved.",
                    "I was prescibed pregabalin for leg pain associated with Spinal Stenosis. The first prescribed was 225 mg daily. Side effects extreme tiredness and swollen ankles. When I tried to stop this drug I experienced severe anxiety and feelings of gloom. Went back on see and say the pain clinic who advised tapering 25mgs every 2 weeks. I am down to 50mgs am and pm. The withdrawal is one of the hardest things I have been through and cannot wait until this drug is totally out of my system. Lesson learnt to research prescribed drugs, their side effects and withdrawal before blindly accepting them.",
                    "I rated Lyrica as \"one\" because IF your prescription plan does not pay for it, it is worth nothing to you UNLESS you are prepared to pay about $350.00 a month out of your own pocket. It's effectiveness for a few of my problems was very good, but since I cannot afford it, it's effectiveness is actually ZERO to me now.  Don't take the free sample that will be offered to you (unless you can afford it later). Stopping Lyrica will be the one of the most miserable things you have ever tried in your life! It is a horrible withdrawal. the company is just like a street dealer of drugs. BOTH give you \"free samples\" to get you dependent on the drug and they charge big money for you to continue taking it.",
                    "Initial euphoric effects wore off so dosage was increased. Was told would treat nerve pain and later told good for anxiety. My anxiety got worse on med as when it was due or late I was ill, it has addictive qualities I do not like. My health took a nose dive on this and I had to come off due to blurred vision, weight gain, blocked bowel. My Doctor advised decreasing of 75mg a week. My first drop was hell completely threw me into panic as I felt so ill, no one explained withdrawal when I saw medics in a state no one comforted me saying it could be the reduction too high/quick for me, after all in hindsight if I felt unwell late taking one dose then dropping 75mg wouldn't be helpful quickly, lower doses not easy to get as more costly to NHS etc",
                    "I'm really waiting for the other shoe to drop with this medicine, because for me it has thus far been thoroughly life saving. I had been in pain every minute of every day, with some days being completely overwhelmed by the pain. Now I feel like I can live again. I just noticed that increased suicide risk was a potential side effect of Lyrica, which might concern me as I've suffered from major depressive disorder for >25 years. But being on this medicine has raised my mood a great deal because I don't have chronic pain to deal with on top of my baseline mood disorder. It is so wonderful. I'm waiting to hear that it causes something dreadful - because isn't that usually the case when something works so well.",
                    "I went from 800 mg of Neurontin a day, with its zombie-like side effects, to 100 mg of Lyrica with no side effects and more effective that Neurontin.",
                    "Didn't do much for my anxiety. I'm taking 150mg two times a day. Can't really feel much difference. I do feel a little bit more \"spacey\" though.",
                    "Diagnosed with fibromyalgia 19 yrs ago, no pain medicines until 5 yrs ago. Electro-acupuncture is great, but hard to find/afford. Heating pads aren't therapeutic, I sleep on 4 ice packs (I know, eeww, but whatever works). They help with inflammation, try them. Lyrica gave me agonizing, shooting pains from deep within shoulder and hip joints down humerus and femur. And unwelcome 35 lb weight gain. And blurry vision that meant I couldn't drive. Lyrica was useless for me, so glad you all have something to fight this fibromyalgia.",
                    "I did not feel it was helping all that well with the pain.[ lower, middle back and rib]  I went from 25 mg to 75, 150 then 225mg.  I found I was tired and lethargic. I had a dry mouth and throat constantly, and my vision was hard to focus, jumpy. I had stopped and restarted after 4 months, still the same. Breathing is harder, so I've noticed this time.   I have stopped for good!",
                    "I have been taking Lyrica for 3 months. I started at 50mg x 3. Increased to 150 x 3 times a day a month later. I have had almost no pain since starting. The side effects have been extreme dizziness, edema in the feet, weight gain (about 15lbs). At my last appointment the Doctor adjusted the dose to 50mg x 4 times a day. The dizziness comes and goes. This is a great medicine for me. I can handle dizziness at this level.",
                    "My doctor prescribed Lyrica for my anxiety, and it has been a God-send. Dump Trazodone. I feel like normal people are supposed to feel - with basically no side effects. In addition, I have Herpes, and since taking Lyrica have had no Herpes break-outs. This drug is incredible.",
                    "Finally, a medicine prescribed by my psychiatrist that is non narcotic and actually works. Due to a severe auto accident fifteen years ago, I am now 40 yrs old, and having suffered a closed head injury, fractured pelvis, 4 fractured ribs and tailbone fracture. I have suffered with chronic pain mostly my adult like. I have undergone nearly every pain management regime one can think of: Epid nerve blocks, rhizotomy, physical therapies and of course every narcotic medicine that was available. Yet within just a few months, and after all these years, Doctor and I have finally found a medication regimen that truly works! Lyrica 75 2x a day and MS 60mg 2x daily. And since starting Lyrica, my acute pain episodes are less frequent.",
                    "I was given this medication for pain after suffering from two herniated disks. The medication worked great, but I did not know how good until my doctor took me off of it and my pain returned to its debilitated state.",
                    "I find it helpful for sleep 150 mg with seroquel and Xanax. Sometimes it makes me dreamy or spacey not unpleasant but maybe for its reputation as a street drug in larger doses I have never tried. I don't have much anxiety so have nothing to add.",
                    "I was already overweight and went on Lyrica because of the tingling in my hands and feet being intolerable. Three weeks later, its like I woke up one morning and none of my clothes fit. I got on the scale and from the time my doctor gave me this pill to current and have gained over 25 lbs. It's a shame I have to decide between being obese or able to sleep and be pain free.",
                    "Brilliant, like an anti depressant but I don't get nervous anymore",
                    "I suffered severe sciatica for two years before my doctor prescribed Lyrica. After a few days of building up in my system, the medication completely killed all of the pain, numbness, and tingling in my right leg. It was so effective, I thought I was suddenly cured! I stopped taking the Lyrica and the symptoms returned after a couple of days. I have now been taking Lyrica for two years and swear it is the best solution available for my bulging disk problem.",
                    "VERY MIXED RESULTS. Had a severe attack of shingles on the face and scalp (3 weeks in most of the hair on one side of my head was literally gone). I refused morphine (in hindsight, I should have taken it) but I did take Percocet which helped the internal pain but not the nerve pain in the skin. For that they gave me Neurontin, but I could not tolerate it due to extreme drowsiness, loss of appetite, loss of concentration and dry mouth (before I could chew food it was too dry to swallow it). Tried Lyrica 75mg 3 times daily. First dose seemed to really work but effect declined significantly so that the fifth dose had no effect. During the fourth week he increased to 100mg 3 times daily. Second dose helped then effects declined.",
                    "I have had chronic pain from Spinal Stenosis for over 25 years. Neck shoulders and lower back. I was on Lyrica 150 mg twice a day a couple years ago & truthfully can not remember why I stopped taking it. Since the \"war on pain meds\" My Dr. ask me to try it again. I took for 2 weeks then I started getting blurred vision, confusion, memory loss, & I would be standing in a store and twice the husband had to catch me because I was just falling over. I felt sick inside, instead of my quality of life improving it went down hill. I will never take this so called med again. I will live with the 10 to 15 pain level somehow if I have to spend the rest of my life just sitting still or in the bed. I also got to the point I was severely depressed. Do NOT take this drug.",
                    "Apart from putting on weight - Lyrica has been great. I sleep (a miracle in itself) and have felt no pain.",
                    "Started using LYRICA about 6 months ago. It seems to have minimized the toe/foot pain I have when I go to bed. This was keeping me awake with pain and restless legs. Now I can get to sleep easier. Did notice some weight gain... but am working on it. No other side effects noted at this time. Sure has helped me at night!",
                    "Lyrica has saved my life, just wish I'd have started taking it sooner and it would have saved my marriage. My pain is completely controlled and I am no longer taking anti-depressants. I didn't realize it helped with GAD, but it does. I actually feel human again and interact with others. It does have some side effects, can't concentrate and a drunk feeling but compared to the pain I was enduring, these side effects are worth it to me.",
                    "600 mg of lyrica works wonders for me. Its a very good drug and completely takes away the pain. Without this drug I would go insane I've gone days with so much pain that I thought of committing suicide. Really awful feeling because I have always enjoyed life and I'm only 38. Nerve pain is by far the most painful pain I have ever had. To all of you who suffer out there, there will always be a medicine that can help you. Don't give up there is a way this horrible condition. I hope everyone find relief",
                    "Started taking Lyrica yesterday for severe diabetic neuropathy in both feet and lower legs. I am currently on Suboxone for a 15 year addiction to opiates and was concerned that Lyrica wouldn't work because my body is so screwed up from all the years of opiate use and most medications do not work well for me. Thirty minutes after the first dose I noticed a significant improvement in the neuropathic pain. My bedtime dose was another 75 milligram capsule and I slept better than I have slept in months! This medicine has been a God send for me so far. Hoping that it continues to work well for me! Thanks Pfizer!",
                    "I'm a 41 year old male and I suffer from diabetic Neuropathy in my feet. It's steadily gotten worse over the last 2 years and wasn't even diagnosed properly until 3 months ago. I've been taking Lyrica started with 75mg twice a day which didn't much of anything. I'm now taking 150mg twice a day, it's somewhat effective but not quite there yet not sure if dosage will have to be increased or I'll have to try something else? I haven't had a lot of the side effects others have mentioned except for memory loss. I've noticed that my short term memory hasn't been the best of late but other than that not really many side effects for me.",
                    "I was just diagnosed with fibromyalgia earlier this year. My old doctor prescribed me Cymbalta and it didn't work. I was off from work for 2 months because of the pain. All I did was layed in bed suffering. Seemed like I would never have my normal life back. I went to another doctor and he prescribed me Lyrica it lessened the pain within a day or two. Now I have some of my life back. I still have a little pain but Lyrica has helped me and changed my life.",
                    "I am 37 with multiple illnesses, fibromyalgia, diabetes, arthritis, and schizophrenia being the tip 4. My Doctor put me on 300 mg of Lyrica 3 times a day. Initially, it stopped my severe symptoms of fibromyalgia, initially. I began to have sleeplessness, which became 3 hrs of sleep every other night. My legs from knee down began to tingle, then it felt like worms crawling in them. I had fuzzy vision, and then 60 voices came out in my head, very loud and clear. My Doctor refused to stop lyrica, I stopped taking it and within a month the side effects disappeared.",
                    "Side effects are worse than Fibromyalgia pain. I've been taking Lyrica for two months. It was a miracle drug for the first few weeks. I've been living with Fibromyalgia for over 35 years and have tried eveything. Anti depressants, excersise, bio-feedback, acupuncture, narcotics, you name it. So I was excited about the dramatic pain reduction from Lyrica.But now I have developed severe muscle weakness, headache, abdominal cramping, acne and difficulty thinking clearly. I can barely hold myself up and I can't lift anything over a few pounds. I have asked my doctor if I can safely stop taking it. I'm just waiting g for him to return my call. I would rather just live with my horrible pain than take any more of these toxic drugs.",
                    "I started with 75 mg of Pregabalin which was raised to 100 mg at bedtime. While it helped me in reducing neck pain and I had substantial reduction in anxiety, it started giving me huge side effects. I started having throat pain, sinusitis, vivid dream early morning and some feeling of dizziness. I also added 5 kg of weight in 2 months. I am now tapering it off gradually. While I would say it worked for my main symptoms, unfortunately it gave me too much side effects.",
                    "For the past year I have suffered pain in calf of leg which travels up theough thigh hips and back on walking it becomes extreme and I have to sit down, awaiting MRI scan on spine... physio say stenosis of spine and that I have a slight curve in spine... After reading reviews I decided to try these tabs I have only taken them for 2 nights ( 1 x 75mg cap) supposed to take 2 daily but I feel I cant wake up in mornings and have to force myself to get out of bed, for a couple hours after i still feel groggy and light headed throughout the day. I dont know whether to perservere with them, I have to say slight improvement with being able to walk with a little less pain. I live in Scotland so my prescription is free for this drug.",
                    "I was on Lyrica until last year until my insurance would not pay for it. They started me on gabapentin which does work very well with me.",
                    "Have been rock bottom down by the river, then re-started Pregabalin. IT IS AMAZING. It only took about 24 hours to notice the difference, and wow. A week later and I am nearly 100%. I knew I was anxious not depressed! It should be prescribed as a first-line choice. Previously on it for 3 yrs. I am a 59yr old housewife.",
                    "I first started taking this for trapped nerve causing cramps in my hand. I started off 25mg 3 times a day for first week. The first thing I felt was calm all my worries went away second week upped to 100mg 3 times a day feel like a lotto winner walking and talking like a new man. No prob with sex its all still working! Slight foggy brain but got my old job back cramps in hand gone all looking well, booking to go away with the wife soon xx",
                    "I couldn't remember the last time I had a \"good\" day since diagnosed having Fibromyalgia until 2010, when I was first told about Lyrica by an emergency doctor. The symptoms & pain had got so bad that I drove myself to a Baylor emergency room. Physically and mentally I just felt defeated. I was so stressed out that I developed an ulcer and my potassium/magnesium levels were so low they admitted me several times for as long as a week on time. Bags of blood had to be given and IV fluids. Ugh..I was a hot mess. I don't recall the doctor that introduced me to Lyrica, cause I was in and out a few times, but all I can say is a BIG thank-you. I've been on Lyrica 300mg a day since 2010. I can get what I need done and function like a normal woman.",
                    "I used this for my last herniated disk issue. I had a sequestered herniated L5 L4 issue and suffered from nerve pain down my left leg and drop foot. Pain Medications (e.g. 10mg Percocet 3-4 times daily) did nothing for my leg pain though helped my back. Lyrica at 150mg twice daily did the trick for my leg nerve pain. The sciatica makes your leg kill while you know nothings wrong with it, so with Lyrica I was amazed to have the leg pain just disappear. No side effects. Sciatica went away by itself after 3 months so no need for Lyrica anymore.",
                    "It's simply a miracle.",
                    "This medicine reduced the pain but immediately caused severe swelling of the legs and feet.I also had constant dizziness.I could not tolerate the swelling and weight gain.",
                    "I had put off taking Lyrica because I was afraid of the side effects. Eventually my nerve pain got to the point where I had no choice. It was completely debilitating. Searing burning pain with no relief. Pain meds didn't touch it. I couldn't sleep because the pain was that bad. My clothes hurt. Soft feather light brushes against my skin stung and BURNED for minutes after contact (more intensely than the consistent present burning). After about three weeks on Lyrica I finally found relief from the worst of it. What I am left with as far as the burning goes is completely tolerable (of course it does nothing for my other symptoms). I'm grateful I caved but am concerned about weight gain & significant cravings for sweets.",
                    "I am a 22 year old female who was in a car accident over a year ago, and 6 months ago started having tension headaches, migraines, and overall muscular pain. I had to quit my job and have barely been able to keep up with school. I took Lyrica for the first time last night. It caused some upset stomach and a weird buzz, but this morning I woke up feeling like a different person. I am still sore from my muscles being weak and tight all the time, but today is the first day I could feel that I was still sick from a headcold. The pain and discomfort had drowned out any other discomfort. I am hopeful for the first time in months.",

I have been on Oxy ER 80mg 2x day and was still not getting full relief (4 out of 10) and having difficulty remembering. Doctor added Lyrica 75mg 2x day three months ago and the day after I felt euphoric. I felt no pain! After one week some pain came back but no peaks as before. Some weight gain. Want to get off of Oxy and try Lyrica or other non-narcotic drugs.",
                    "I have just started lyrica but so far it works great for my anxiety and my back pain. Don't give up when you first start with the side effects they pass and this medication works a lot better than any SSRI or lorazapam which is horribly addictive I think I finally found something that can help and I hope that whoever reads this feels the same",
                    "I use Lyrica 75mg (4 X day), Fentanyl Patch and Percocet up to 8 times a day and I have little times that my feet aren't throbbing. My A1C is 6 and I am not on insulin. There has to be something out there that can help. I have been on Cymbalta, Neurontin,and many others.",
                    "Attackef at age 60. Totally bedridden many years. Husband took me to many neuros who ended up not believing in fibromyalgia. Very insulting suggesting it was\"all in my head\". Many days could just not make myself move or interact. I had great tired feeling and feeling of pain running thru all parts of my body. Oct 2014 I was lucky. Went to another neuro, prescribed 25mg bid lyrica. In 2 weeks I was myself and have not looked back. Befote this I was an avid runner, pilates, overall exerciser. This came fromnowhere. My lyrica is very low but I just needed it evidently.",

I take Pristiq for maintenance depression medicine and I have to say that after only 3 weeks I have had a 8/10 improvement in trigger point pain, no headaches at all. I do have to say that I will probably come off it though because I have probably gained 5-8 lbs and had a lot of edema of hands and feet.",
                    "I take 75 mg. X 2 per day. It seemed to help the first couple of days, now nothing. I have gained 12+ lbs, too. My appetite is getting out of control. I'm going to talk to my doctor about trying something else. Anyone else having problems with weight gain like me? I still need to take an OTC pain medicine with my Lyrica. Anybody ever try muscle relaxers?",

Started Lyrica 7 months ago, now at 75mg x 2, twice daily.  Reduced oxycodone from 80mg daily to 40mg daily, tramadol for breakthrough. Hope to increase Lyrica and further reduce oxy. Still do PT for flares. PT is needling with electricity, like acupuncture with electricity running thru needles. It is amazing. No side effects, no weight gain but possibly weight moved to stomach area, no problem. 5ft 3in, 125 lbs Lyrica is no miracle but finally found combo of therapy, meds (Lyrica inc) for some quality of life.",
                    "I've tried other things for pain. Already take a strong pain medicine, which is getting harder and harder to get, because in my State, one must go to a pain clinic to get it. Pain clinics are horrors. Lyrica seems to work with the amount of pain medicine that I take and seems to have even reduced the \"break through\" pain. No unpleasant symptoms yet.",

                    "I started taking Lyrica after seeing an orthopedic surgeon, for widespread pain and tendinitis. After taking 50 mg a day, I had no difference, then up to 75mg a day, I still had pain in my wrists (most likely because I work on a computer). But MIRACULOUSLY!, I noticed that along with 'Some' pain, my social anxiety is all but GONE! It's not even the reason I started taking it! As for my wrist pain, we've bumped up the mg to 175 per day and it's only been two days, I'm very groggy in the morning. I didn't get that on the 75mg, but I am confident it will subside. I feel like a new person because the easing of the social anxiety was a total surprise! I would recommend this medicine to ANYONE with pain/social anxiety.",
                    "The first time I used Lyrica I experienced an amazingly profound reaction; layers of depression and anxiety that had built up over several years melted away within minutes. That was years ago and I have since both weaned myself off the drug and restarted taking it again. One thing I rarely see mentioned is the terrifyingly bad withdrawal effect- missing more than one dose for me throws me into the absolute darkest pits of despair. Has anyone else experienced this? When I went off the drug the first time I felt like I had performed a miracle; so strong was the feeling that it took a long time for me to convince myself that things were bad enough to warrant going back on. It still helps, but nothing as miraculous as the first time.",
                    "I have taken 3 x 75mg, and amazed at how well Lyrica worked for me after only taking 1 pill. I feel like I can get comfortable for the first time in years. I have high hopes that this doesn't wear off and I can continue to feel so good. I feel like a miracle, really has helped my all over body pain that I live with for years.",
                    "I am suffering from burning pain in my body. I was on the Fentanyl patch for 15 years. That gave me complete relief. Because of drug issues in my state, I tapered off of Fentanyl in Feb. I don't think that Lyrica was around before I started the patch. Since the burning pain came back, I was put on Lyrica. It certainly helped and I can live somewhat pain free. Now the doctor has refused to give me a script for Lyrica because he is afraid of repercussions from authorities. I will have to find another doctor. I am dependent on anything that will take this pain away and I hope I can find a doctor who will give me Lyrica again. It is not giving me a good reputation to be constantly changing doctors.",
                    "I have had Fibromyalgia for 4 years now and recently my doctor put me on Lyrica and Cymbalta. The Lyrica is a true lifesaver, it really helps with the pain. But has a lot of side effects. Cons-Feeling like a zombie, shakes, sick at my stomach, itching and blurry eyes, drowsiness. Pros-My pain is almost all gone, happy mood, and can move free with barely any pain. And I feel like I'm on cloud nine and can't wait to go to sleep. Overall, the Lyrica has really helped me a lot. I have tried the generic gabapentin and Savella. They do not work! I'm so happy that I found this website, for all the people whom have aches and pains as well as I. Thank you.",

I put on over 10 lbs in weight when I first started taking it, but with correct food choices , I lost what I had put on and more. I did at first have an increased balance problem. I now take 200mgs of Lyrica 3 times a day because I have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, I take metformin 500mg twice a day and I've got neuropathy pain. I have no side effects with Lyrica now.The other pain meds I am on is a 500mg Fentanyl patch and Arcoxia and Quinine for leg cramps. I live in the UK and get my pain medication free .",

I am very active in trying to keep the fibromyalgia pain as controlled as possible and just not been able to get to a plateau of any type. After a rough adjustment period of about 5 wks I noticed a drastic change in fibro pain. I have gained a significant amount of weight but over the last three months have been able to maintain. Now I am able to start losing the weight but have to be very careful to not take in complex carbohydrates or sugars in afternoon or evening. I have gone to an almost vegetarian style diet and have noticed that the weight just starts to come off with ease but slowly. My balance and vision are the only consistent side effects that I have.",

I just want to thank all doctors that prescribe this medication because it is a life saver.",

I also have had to raise the dose to 150mg 3 x daily. It really helped with the insomnia that I had suffered with for 10 years. If Lyrica did not have the side effect of weight gain, I would stay on it. Would I recommend this drug, yes I would.",

I researched ways to counteract the negative effects, and started taking a B6 supplement (for weight gain) and an herbal diuretic (for the bloat). I no longer feel bloated, and the headaches are gone. I'm on my 4th (or 5th?) week of lyrica, and am feeling much better. I don't think I'm still gaining weight, but it's too soon to tell. I wasn't eating any more or less than usual, so if the B6 helps, that would be nice.",

                    "I started Lyrica for chronic pain, but realized it was SO great for anxiety - worries disappeared, ruminating thoughts just didn't matter anymore, it was like my troubles were over because none of them mattered anymore (things I should have cared about tho, too). I had been taking 2mg valium everyday for 4 years and was able to taper VERY quickly because of lyrica. Pregabalin helps as a precursor to anxiety; it stops it before it can start, hence the 'PRE'-gabalin. It works on the gaba receptors which are responsible for anxiety. I take 150mg every 8 hours like another reviewer talked about, as I discovered that this was the golden ticket for keeping anxiety away. In Europe, the suggested dose for anxiety is between 400mg-MAX 600mg.",
                    "I was diagnosed with GAD three years ago. It began each morning with a small 'knot' in my stomach and then spread during the day causing tightness if chest, throat and often tension down my arms. It was stupid because there seemed to be no trigger, I just felt tension and worry all day. I was placed on a number of drugs, nothing worked. Busiprone helped but I remained anxious for no valid reason. About 18 months ago my doctor gave me Lyrica to try. Within a couple of days everything returned to normal I was even a bit euphoric but that subsided in a week or so. I started out taking Lyrica 50mg twice a day along with 20mg Busiprone twice a day. I have had to increase dosage over time and now take 200mg a day along with 40mg Busiprone.",

I am Rizwan 32 I had a esvere anxiety disorder 9 years ago I was treated with inderal 40mg b.I. d with paroxetin 25mg I recoverd and temper it off after 6 months gradually But Later on it relapsed wich couldn't coverd resulted in 50 mg of paroxetin initially it helped but relapsed again then I tried several antidepressant like Escitalopram 20 than venlafexine and sertraline and bubropion but none of them worked well than I changed my psychiatrist who put me on Mirtazapine 30mg which has increased to 60mg paroxetine75mg pregabalin450mg Rivotril1mg it helped me well but I am sick to as this also having side effects like this made me lazy, slow and my weight gain from 76kg to 110. Every time I tried to decrease fails badly.",
                    "My doctor calls my Lyrica use a sprint. Week 1 was 50 mg, week 2 - 100mg, the next 4 weeks were 150 mg in the evening. Now we are working our way up to doing the same thing for the second dose in the morning. I must admit I am glad she is doing it this way. The first weekend after I started taking it was the first weekend I actually wanted to do something, like move when I did not have to. I've adjusted slowly to the drowsiness and confusion to where it is not nearly as bad as when I first started taking it. There has been weight gain but I am slowly getting to the point of wanting to get back into that gym. Thank you Lyrica.",

I have also tried muscle relaxants like Soma. All of these helped but I still had painful days. Lyrica gets rid of the pain. I have been on it for 2 months and it is a miracle drug. I have my life back and can be productive. Also controls painful flares. Haven't had a flare yet. Lyrica is great.",

Lyrica although it does help with the pain, the side effects are just too much for me. I have been on it for over 2 years now and the water retention and weight gain is great. I weened down and stopped taking it a week ago and have already lost 10 lbs and the edema in my legs is gone. If I could take the Lyrica without the weight gain and water retention I would in a heart beat. Hopefully something else will work well for me.",
                    "I have been using Pregabalin for about 6 weeks and I have found it highly effective with my anxiety. I have had very little side effects. I have found that as my anxiety is worry,overthinking and my mind constantly racing. It has slowed down my rate of thinking and worrying, whilst I am aware they are there I find I am able to process them easier and thoughts become less irrational. Coupled with some CBT therapy I find this medication highly effective. The only thing to be wary of is on higher doses (I'm on 75mg) they can have a drunk feeling effect and so I asked my Dr to prescribe me with a lower dosage for daytime (incase of driving or working etc) so I take 25mg in the day and the 75mg at night and find this works for me.",
                    "I was on Lyrica for 5 months. It seemed to help with the pain somewhat for a while, but didn't stop it. Also, I GAINED 40 POUNDS. The doctor told me if I was careful about my eating habits that I wouldn't gain too much weight, but this was not true. After I went off it, I lost 22 pounds in 2 weeks - just from water weight. I have yet to be able to lose the rest of the weight.",

Search with google of you dont believe me. I took it for about a year, yes it worked for my problems the first couple but you arent aware yet what it is doing to you. It does permanent brain aging , you will be confused and have terrible memory the rest of your life and this problem becomes very clear to you when you quit. I did for 5 years now and still can't function  That is when you can quit because this drug is highly addictive and the withdrawal when you decide to quit is stuff out of nightmares.

                    "Lyrica is effective against anxiety but I have recently chosen to go off it due to side effects. The side effects are okay (not as bad as the SSRI's) but the main side effects I was concerned about were: Brain Fog (I became much dumber), forgetfulness, loss of physical sensations including less feeling during sex. All in all I would rate it better than any SSRI. ",

I've been taking it at night and experienced involuntary tremors, muscle spasms, twitching of my fingers, arms and legs.The twitching is scary! It's involuntary, I have no control of my body when this happens. My leg started twitching and it stuck straight up, waking me from a deep sleep! The twitching and tremors linger all day. Lyrica caused severe swelling in my feet,ankles and legs. It's very uncomfortable. I also experienced loss of balance, dizziness, blurred vision and ulcer sores on my tongue and in my mouth. I felt far better before taking this medicine. Needless to say I'm no longer taking it.",

He got overruled by a doctor with a brain, but doctor Weisman seems to think Lyrica does't work for the treatment of peripheral neuropathy his reasoning was because the doctor didn't put diabetic in front of peripheral neuropathy. Lyrica won't work the thing this doctors doesn't understand is that the Lyrica is treating only the peripheral neuropathy the diabetic part mean nothing except that the peripheral neuropathy is being cause by the diabetes. If this Doctor had taken just say five minutes and read a little bit more of the notes!",

                    "Was previously taking Lisinopril at the highest dosage and still had blood pressure readings of 160/95. Bincar HCT 40/12.5 (Benicar combined with a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide) is the only drug that has ever gotten my blood pressure fully under control (120/77 at doctor today). I take it with a banana or some orange juice in the morning to ensure my potassium levels don't drop too low. I have no side effects with this pill, other than running to the restroom a bit more during the first couple of days I was taking the medication.",

                    "Benicar is great. I have been using it for 4-5 yrs now. I had an initial period of being light-headed for a few weeks when I first started the medicine, but after that, no problems whatsoever. Keeps my blood pressure around 115-70. My bottom figure had been around 95. Benicar is more expensive than a lot of the other hypertension medicines, but it is well worth it for me.",
                    "Works perfectly. No side affects at all.",

Benicar has actually reduced my dizziness I had prior to taking blood pressure medicines. I tried water pills but blood pressure got worse. My doctor knows I'm the kind of patient that will stop taking medicines that bother me so she skipped the lisinopril and went straight for the Benicar and I'm glad she did although day 4 now and my blood pressure is 124/58 ...sort of low after being in the 100's a few days ago. Maybe I'll need the 20mg but love the focus and energy I have again and the looser bowels are an additional perk! Knees stopped hurting from arthritis too.",
                    "My doctor put me on Benicar HCT about 7 years ago. I was the type of person who hated to take medication so I didn't take it consistently. I think that is why I finally realized every time I would take a pill I would wake up during the night with severe leg cramps. I told my doctor about it and he changed my prescription to plain Benicar. After that I take it regularly and have no side effects or problems at all and it keeps my blood pressure level at 110/70.",
                    "I have been very pleased with the effectiveness of Benicar 20mg. I started out taking Benicar 20/12.5mg and the 12.5 HCTZ caused dizziness and light-headedness after several days of use. So I requested the plain Benicar 20mg without the HCTZ diuretic and I have felt much better, no problems at all. My blood pressure has stayed at 120/78, and often it is even lower. I take it once daily and go about my normal routine.",

It made me eat constantly and I gained like 25 pounds during the 2 mths I was on it. My lower legs and ankles swelled up and I couldn't get the swelling to go down and I tried everything About a wk to 2 wks after quitting benicar 300mg the side effects started subsiding my lower legs and ankles took the longest to go down even my eating has gone back to normal but now I have 25 pounds to loose. I hope this helps anyone thinking about taking it. My mother also worked with a women that took it for about a month and it made her pass out at work one day and she quit taking it too. Hope this helps!!!",

                    "I love this stuff. Works like a charm for someone with hypertension. There are no side effects for me. Also had no migraines while on this one which many others have caused. Great energy and overall condition while taking it.",

                    "Benicar has been a \"wonder\" drug for me. It is the only BP medication that my body will tolerate. I have been on this drug for 10 years. Not only has it stabilized my BP (the original reason it was prescribed for me) but I have ceased having migraine headaches. I haven't even had any regular headaches since I began taking Benicar.",

I was determined to tackle the blood pressure issue. I started exercising and eating healthy (not a diet). A month later, I had dropped 16 lbs and 18 points on my blood pressure; however, the Doctor put me on Benicar (20 mg). It's been a week and about the only side effect has been feeling light headed. Some mornings I also feel sluggish. My pressure has gone down to 148/94. Although I have a way to go, I lost another 4 lbs in this week. The medicine is better than I anticipated but I will keep going and soon hope to be off of it.",
                    "I started taking this med 15 years ago. Have had to take a reflux tablet too since commencing this but unsure if it was related. All in all has kept my Bp in normal range. Just starting to get slight raises now in Bp after 15 years.",
                    "I have been taking Coreg for high blood pressure for 4 years. It slowed my heart rate to low 60s. Even when exercising, rate stayed really low. I've fought my weight every since I started taking it. I started having problems keeping my blood pressure regulated. My doctor added 1 tablet of Benicar HCT 20mg. I couldn't believe how much it dropped my blood pressure. Breathing back to normal. My blood pressure now runs 120's/70's. My heart rate runs in the 70's. When I exercise it raises to 80's. I feel so much better. I think this will allow my body to burn fat and function more normally. Love the way I'm feeling now.",
                    "Once accustomed to Benicar 20 mg., I love it. After trying Lisinopril for just one day, I kissed the bottle of Benicar! But best of all, my arthritis pain in my knees has gone away - an amazing bonus.",

Lots of side effects, going to GP to have change of meds, feel terrible with all these side effects.. Blood pressure lowered as a result on a positive note...",
                    "My blood pressure was high (144/90 -180/110) My doctors tried Alpha and Beta Blockers, Calcium Channel Blockers, Ace Inhibitors, Angiotension II Receptor Blockers, and diuretics. My best pressure was 138/90. The first week we tried Benicar HCT 40/25, I could tell a big difference. My best pressure was 128/78. After losing some weight, pressure dropped as well. 116/68. I started feeling extremely dizzy. Broke the pill in half and dizziness improved. Doctor will need to adjust dosage and hopefully will be able to discontinue use by end of year if weight loss continues. My appointments are now 3 months instead of monthly. Overall, I am pleased with my progress since I started taking Benicar.",
                    "Been on Benicar 40mg for over a year, it keeps my blood pressure down. Only side effect that I am not really sure of, is some more joint pain than usual. But with bad discs in back and neck, who can say for sure? Sad part is, thanks to the cost and loss of job/health insurance, I will have to find something cheaper. ",
                    "I took Benicar for 12 years or more and went through the leg cramps etc. but it worked well on my BP. I would get kidney infections occasionally but didn't know why. One day a few years ago I came down with painful gout. My new doctor took me off Benicar right away. She said it contributed to my gout flare ups because it affected my kidneys. I was so angry because I didn't know and hadn't read up on it. Have your kidneys check regularly while taking this med. Now through diet and another BP med I do well with the Gout, however I wish I hadn't taken Benicar so long and had it affect my kidneys. Be careful!",

                    "Seems to work for everyone but me. Quality of life was seriously affected by the on-going dizziness from this product (20mg). Elevators left me weak-kneed and staggering at work. Daily descending stairs also a vertigo nightmare. Blood pressure can easily go into 214/105s in emergencies, so I would like to find something to reduce those numbers, without the extreme dizziness. I work in a psychiatric setting, so I have to be alert and to move quickly without falling on my face. I didn't notice any appreciable drop in blood pressure either, with numbers still in the 170s most of the time.",
                    "high blood pressure runs in my family and i've had it since i was very young. we never realized it and i could've had a heart attack if it weren't for this drug. after a while my body got used to 10 mg so it was increased to 15, either way it works like a charm. i have so much more energy and migraines are at a minimum.",
                    "I've been taking Benicar for about 2 years now. Every other medicine tended to make my feet and ankles swell badly, but this medicine is great. My blood pressure is consistently about 110/70 (sometimes lower). No side effects. I take it in the mornings and do not have a problem with drowsiness, even though I'm really prone to this side effect with other medicines. I just wish my insurance covered it on their formulary. As it is I pay $45/month. This, in combination with the diabetic medicines and supplies, really takes a toll on my budget. But I guess the results are worth it. As a state worker in California, though, I may have to investigate less expensive options soon! ",
                    "20mg a day has been enough to put me well into the safety zone. I haven't had any side effects, except occasional dizziness when standing. Energy level is great.",
                    "I have no problems with my vision on Benicar 40MG. I have notice that my bowel movements has signifantly inproved, maybe the blood vessels in that area is benefited. I have lots of energy and no side effects.",
                    "Benicar is very effective, but has side effects. It is causing me irritable bowel syndrome and diarrhea. My doctor first put me on Lisinopril, which caused my lungs to feel like they were full of fluid, after having difficulty breathing I stopped that medication. Then the Dr put me on samples of Benicar and it dropped my blood pressure readings to normal and I didn't notice side effects but the insurance wouldn't approve it. So they approved losartan, which seems to have no side effects but barely reduced my blood pressure, it worked but not very well. So they got the insurance to approve Benicar, but after taking it for almost 2 months it has caused me to have irritable bowel syndrome, if I stop taking it, I improve, start taking it it gets worse.",
                    "I see many people have had a very positive effect on their blood pressure. I have been using Benicar HCT for about 2 weeks along with Toprol XL. While the Toprol seems to do it's job (reduce pulse rate), Benicar HCT seems to have no effect. I had changed from Norvasc because of swelling and blood pressure was ~140/80, still uncontrolled. Now it's 160/85. My doctor tells me not to worry, everything will be just fine. ",
                    "I've been taking Benicar 20mg/12.5 HCT for about 7 years and it works great. It keeps my blood pressure down to 120-125/75-80. I do experience dizziness and light-headiness frequently but I sit at a desk most of the day at work so it's no big deal. I also cannot stay out in the sun long at all. I don't know if this is a side effect of Benicar but also 2 years ago I started getting vision \"Floaters\" and had to change to another prescription twice. I'm only 43 and my vision is no longer 20/20 and can only get 20/40 with corrective lenses. Eye doctor doesn't see anything wrong and says 20/40 is okay. I'll get a 2nd opinion just in case. Also I started getting flushing or \"red face and neck\" about 3 years ago. It comes and goes. Benicar is the only medicine I use.",
                    "Came across Olmesartan on this site and impressed by its high rating. Had been on Amlodipine and Ramipril, both caused various side effects including frequent urination, cystitis, itchy scalp and very upsetting thinning my hair to the front top of my head. Also facial flushing, pounding head, sleeping badly with vivid dreaming. Apart from not Iowering my blood pressure, 165/80 I seemed to be getting every side effect and was despairing that this was it for the rest of my life. I spoke with my GP who was unaware of Olmesartan, I think due to the fact that its a more expensive drug, she reluctantly prescribed it for me. Its been a month now my BP averages 115 to 125/60 no side effects apart from slight light headedness. Got my life back !",
                    "I give this medicine a 5 because it does lower your blood pressure but unfortunately the side effects are pretty bad. I was diagnosed with hypertension at 25 and before benicar I never had a dizzy spell in my life. Now dizzy spells are just part of life as well as fatigue and breathing issues. It's not all the time but a few times a week I just feel unwell. I think this is a good medicine for an older person who just needs to get the numbers down but it's terrible for a young active person.",
                    "I have been on Benicar for about a year now and I have to say it has helped my blood pressure. Blood pressure is 120-130 and over 70-75 average. My pressure was not dangerously high but my doctor recommended I go on it since it is in my family history, I am 40.",
                    "Have been taking Benicar for over a year now. Blood pressure is controlled and I have had no side effects that I can tell.",
                    "I have been using Benicar for about a year now and it is great. It is one of those medicines that I can't TELL I'm taking. No real side effects, I was taking it at night before I went to bed but I was waking up to go to the bathroom a lot. Now I take it mid morning and I still have to go to the bathroom a lot but at least it isn't waking me up. On the days I forget I realize it because I'm not going to the bathroom 1/2 as much as when I do. For whatever that's worth. Great medication though and glad I started after being very resistant about going to the doctor.",
                    "This is the 4th anti-hypertensive I've tried and I am happy so far. NO side effects, I feel great! Glad I checked here for reviews before trying this medication.",

                    "My PCP started me on Benicar 20mgs/12.5 HCTZ on November 30th. My blood pressure before I took the medication was 145/84, after that it's 135/83-138/85. So far the only side effect I've had is occasional facial flushing. I'll keep monitoring to see how it goes after a full three months on it.",
                    "When I first started on these medicines they worked fine, but 18 months later the medicines are no longer controlling my blood pressure very well at all.",
                    "I have used Benicar for 8 years with no side effect. Very very satisfied. Blood pressure has been at a constant 125/82.",
                    "Dry, hacking cough! It took about a year for this side effect to develop, and about 6 months to realize it was the Benicar. I should have known, as Lisinopril and Diovan made me cough previously. I had taken Hyzaar for 2 years, but had to switch because of insurance issues. I did not have the coughing with Hyzaar.",
                    "My blood pressure was controlled at 120/80, but... after 18 months on Benicar, I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis (not good). So to remedy the UC, I had to take a drug that cost $8000 per year because doctors did not know at the time that Benicar causes UC in some people.   I think people should be aware of this very BAD side effect before starting Benicar.",
                    "I've been on Benicar HCT 20mg/12.5mg for 3 week now this medicine has some bad side effects I've experienced light headed, dizziness, cough feel like my chest feel tight sometime muscle aches tired all the time..does anybody else experience these side effects..when you tell your doctor what your experience they thinks it's not the medicine we know our bodies..",
                    "Noted that many concerned about the price of Benicar. Go on their website and you can get a coupon that will reduce the co-pay on your Benicar to no more than $25 per month assuming you have health insurance.",
                    "As of today, it's two weeks since I started taking Benicar 40/12.5mg. Wow, what an experience. I don't take any other medicines for ANYTHING. I do take vitamins and supplements. My blood pressure now is so great that it helps me deal with the side effects better. I have lightheadedness, spontaneous increase in heart beats, light muscle aches all of these I didn't have before taking Benicar. It took at least a week and a half for my system to adjust. I'll continue on with it and hopefully after significant weight loss I will come off altogether. Until then, I'll take the 123/75 blood pressure any day!",
                    "Suffered most of the side effects.",
                    "Not compatible with moderate alcohol. I haven't had a hangover in over 10 years. After two pills, I had a doozy.",
                    "I was taking a different pill at first but my doctor decided it wasn't working to lower my pressure enough, so they said we are going to try you on this one. I took one the next day since I had already taken my old pill. The first day the pill did lower my blood pressure with no problems. The second day I took it my pressure was still at a good number. I did not later when I tried to sleep I couldn't. Each time I would fall asleep it was hard for me to breath and a few times that I woke up my heart was beating differently and I had some pain in my chest. I won't be taking this medication anymore. I will lower it the natural way by watching what I eat, walking and with God's help I will be just fine.",
                    "I have taken both Olmesartan (Benicar) and Losartan (generic Angiotensin II receptor antagonists) to replace earlier ACE Inhibitor drugs, which invariably caused a chronic cough for me. I went off Benicar in 2015 because my insurance designated it as non-preferred and it was extremely expensive, but I have recently discovered that it is now available as a generic. Olmesartan has given me better and more stable control of moderately elevated blood pressure than Losartan.",
                    "I have been using this medicine for almost 2 years with no side effects, which I am prone to from drugs, because of multiple organ issues. I take it at night which keeps me from worrying about getting drowsy during the day.",
                    "I have been taking Diovan HCT for the past 10 years; varying doses as my BP continued to increase with age. Diovan was giving me debilitating migraines and the weight gain was out of control; even though I am a vegetarian and walk about 3 miles a day. Life on Diovan was miserable. Two weeks ago I persuaded my doctor to switch me to Benicar HCT and to start me on the lowest dose. My BP while on Diovan HCT hovered around 190/102 the highest was 200/105 which was becoming rather common lately. So my doctor also prescribed Bystolic. Three hours after taking Benicar HCT, my blood pressure slowly dropped to 133/80. I am not used to \"normal\" blood pressure, so I felt like I was drunk. Quite a nice feeling from such a small pill...LOL.",
                    "I have been taking Benicar 40 mg for about 4 years. Dizziness is the only occasional trouble. Never had any problems associated with drinking alcohol even after some all-night vodka binges - no hangovers either. That was some years ago. I don't drink much nowadays. Blood pressure alternates but is never above 130/80. Interestingly, after running 7 miles (I do it once a week or so) systolic count is often below 110 and diastolic in the low sixties within 5 minutes of the run. I am 56. I am thinking of lowering to 20mg. ",

Slight dizziness first week after hard exercise in sun (bike riding up steep hill, singles tennis in 85 degree sun). Doctor suggested taking at night before bedtime. Now no problems. Was 140 /95 . Now 122/70 still exercising (tennis, biking) 3-4 days per week without dizziness. Feels like no side effects. Love it.",
                    "I took 20 MG Benicar as an alternative to Lisinopril which caused a cough. With Benicar, the cough went away after a few weeks but a new side effect took its place: I would wake up in the middle of the night with a sore chest and upper back pain. Its a shame because during the day, Benicar had no apparent side effect and kept BP at 128/79.",
                    "Beware!! This med worked well to lower bp, but I have been on 40mg for 3 years now this slowly caused problems I didn't catch on to immediately such as severe pain in feet top and bottom like planter fasciitis extremely painful to walk on. Stiffness in legs like bad arthritis pains woke up so stiff. Possibly caused depression weight gain and lack of sex drive. Fatigue. No energy also was diagnosed with under active thyroid. Also diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Stopped taking Metformin for 2 weeks now only noticed slight improvement in foot pain. Been off of Benicar for 5 days seeing improvement each day pain in feet going away also stiffness going away I'm 50 y.o female felt like 90 years old body in so much pain.",

Side effects were dizziness, constant sleepiness, and weird heart beats, but it works amazingly. After dropping some weight I have just been dropped down just to regular Benicar and have no complaints. Awesome stuff. Now if they could only make it taste better.",

Feel great, mild sleepiness by end of day - a plus - could not sleep well before, also constipation has disappeared. Cramping in legs below knees at night...somewhat like side effects of statin. Will check with doctor..this is my 2nd week of Benicar..took lisinopril for a month. Hope this continues to work. If I miss a dose I become keenly aware. Seems to take effect within an hour. I feel much better and blood pressure readily stabilizes. ",

My lifestyle has always been healthy (intake-wise) but increasingly sedentary and stressful and I think these factors are what exacerbated my BP. Otherwise I was healthy: non-smoker, low alcohol, average weight etc. My wife finally convinced me to get a routine medical check-up (last check-up approx. 5 or 6 years previously) and the result was the doctor discovered high BP ( Systolic 190, Diastolic I can't remember - but the message was clear - my BP was dangerously high). So the doctor prescribed Olmetec 40mg, once-daily at bed-time - and arranged a follow up appointment for a fortnight later. I went home and immediately ordered a BP monitor",

But arms and legs feel like lead when working out and I tire real easy but I knew taking Bp meds would do this, but at 260/160, that was too risky.

                    "//What is it?//This is an increase in blood pressure above values \u200b\u200bconsidered normal. It occurs when there is excessive pressure of blood on the walls of the arteries during circulation. It can increase at certain times, due to physical or emotional exertion, and it is natural that, after these situations, its values \u200b\u200breturn to normal levels. This condition is only serious and causes health problems when it remains high for months, or when it increases suddenly. It is important to know that tension tends to increase with age. However, hypertension should not be considered normal in the elderly. As a rule, arterial hypertension is considered to be present when the maximum pressure is greater than or equal to 160 mmHge/or the minimum pressure is greater than or equal to 95 mmHge. High blood pressure is associated with coronary heart disease, stroke and heart failure and is the most common modifiable cardiovascular risk factor, which is why its treatment is essential in preventing these pathologies. Cardiovascular diseases are the cause of death for at least 34.1% of the Brazilian population, mainly as a consequence of stroke and coronary disease. It is estimated that the prevalence of high blood pressure in the Portuguese adult population is 42.1%, with only 39.0% of these patients taking antihypertensive drugs and only 11.2% being under control.//Symptoms//In the first few years, it does not cause any symptoms. Over time, blood pressure ends up damaging the blood vessels and the main organs of the body, such as the brain, heart and kidneys, causing headaches, dizziness, tinnitus and increased heart rate. The main diseases associated with high blood pressure are stroke, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, heart and kidney failure.//Causes//Around 90% of cases are related to lifestyle habits. Obesity is one of the important factors. Each pound of fat requires the formation of an additional 1.5 kilometers of small blood vessels to supply the excess adipose tissue. Increased blood pressure is required to pump blood through them. Therefore, being overweight by 20% or more increases the risk of hypertension by five times;;/ Excess salt consumption. It is known that high blood pressure is less frequent in populations where its consumption is low. Our body only needs 1/8 of a teaspoon of salt per day;;/ Tobacco is another cause to consider. Even just one cigarette can increase it for about 30 minutes. A pack-a-day smoker can, through smoking alone, cause an increase in blood pressure for 24 hours;;/ Around 5% to 15% of cases may be related to moderate alcohol consumption. On the other hand, one cup of coffee a day can cause an increase in blood pressure;;/ Physical inactivity and stress are also at its origin;;/ The remaining 10% of high blood pressure cases have organic causes, such as some hormonal changes, kidney or blood vessel diseases.//Diagnosis//It is important to remember that high blood pressure cannot be felt, it must be measured. In order to obtain correct values, it is important to rest in a sitting position for at least five minutes before measuring. You should use the same device and always measure on the same arm. The diagnosis of high blood pressure requires measuring an elevated blood pressure on three separate occasions over a period of a week or more. Once its existence has been confirmed, other tests must also be carried out to help understand its origin and/or the complications associated with it.//Treatment//Treatment depends on the severity of the condition. For example, people with moderate hypertension can control it by simply changing some lifestyle habits, such as reducing salt and alcohol intake, controlling their weight, exercising regularly and stopping smoking. There are several medications available for the treatment of high blood pressure that can be used alone or in combination. It is up to the doctor to decide which is the best treatment for each situation.//Prevention//Since most cases have their origin in lifestyle, it is important that it is healthy. All the recommendations mentioned in the treatment prevent the onset of this disease.

                    "//What is it?//Heart Failure corresponds to a clinical situation in which the heart loses its ability to pump blood to meet the body's oxygen and nutrient needs.\u00a0It can result from various diseases or be a degenerative process associated with age. This is a common problem and it is estimated that, in Portugal, it affects around 4.4% of the adult population. For ages over 80 years, this incidence is around 16%. It is a disease closely associated with other highly prevalent diseases such as diabetes and obesity, therefore, its approach must occur in the context of the patient's overall treatment.//Symptoms//Many of its symptoms are nothing more than the body's attempt to compensate for the heart's increasing inability to circulate blood throughout the body. This compensation involves an increase in the strength and contraction of the heart muscle and its own rhythm, which can generate palpitations; or by greater retention of salt and water in the kidneys in order to increase the volume of circulating blood, which can cause swelling in various parts of the body, depending on the position and the action of gravity (while standing, liquid accumulates). if in the lower limbs; This increase in fluids results in a greater number of urinations during the night. There is also an increase in the thickness of the heart muscle (hypertrophy) which aims to compensate for the lower contractile capacity of this muscle. Although these mechanisms can, at an early stage, compensate for the loss of function of the heart muscle, they tend to introduce additional strain and, as such, contribute to a further deterioration of its function.\u00a0 Heart failure must be promptly diagnosed and treated in order to avoid the development of these mechanisms and all their consequences. In established heart failure, one of the main symptoms is tiredness, which occurs after less and less effort or even at rest. There may also be loss of appetite, coughing or an increase in abdominal volume. The accumulation of fluid in the lungs can cause pulmonary edema, with difficulty breathing and shortness of breath, forcing patients to sleep with the head of the bed elevated or even sitting up.//Causes//Any disease that affects the heart or blood circulation can cause heart failure. One of the most common is coronary artery disease. These arteries supply blood to the heart muscle itself and, therefore, when affected, this muscle cannot perform its function effectively, which can lead to a heart attack. Other causes are myocarditis (inflammatory and/or infectious processes of the heart muscle), pericarditis (inflammation of the membrane surrounding the heart), diabetes, hyperthyroidism or obesity. As well as changes in the heart valves, arrhythmias and uncontrolled hypertension. Furthermore, any disease that causes a marked increase in the body's consumption of oxygen and nutrients will place additional strain on the heart and, if left untreated, may lead to the development of heart failure.//Diagnosis//Diagnosis involves assessing the severity of the condition and its underlying cause. Tests usually requested include a chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram and a laboratory study for a more complete evaluation. In some cases, an angiographic study may be necessary.//Treatment//As a rule, heart failure cannot be reversed and treatment aims to improve quality of life, autonomy and reduce mortality associated with this condition. In addition, it must focus on its cause, which can be medical or surgical, depending on its nature. Blood pressure and cholesterol and diabetes must also be controlled. An adequate diet is essential, as is practicing physical exercises adjusted to each patient's abilities and not smoking. Controlling salt intake is particularly relevant because it is associated with greater fluid retention and, as such, greater stress on the heart. Treatment for heart failure can be done by prescribing: Diuretics, which combat fluid retention;;/ Medicines that increase the strength of the heart muscle contraction and reduce its rhythm, such as digoxin;;/ Vasodilators, which reduce the workload required of the heart. If there is arrhythmia, a pacemaker may need to be implanted;;/ Anticoagulants, as in these patients there is a higher tendency for clots to form inside the heart, which can enter circulation causing distant embolisms.;/ When heart failure is very severe and does not respond adequately to therapy, a heart transplant may be indicated.//Prevention//Prevention involves adopting a healthy lifestyle in terms of diet, physical exercise, weight control and regular medical check-ups, while also avoiding tobacco, alcohol abuse and illicit substances. If there are risk factors, such as high blood pressure, diabetes or coronary heart disease, prevention involves diagnosing and treating these conditions appropriately before the heart muscle becomes overloaded.  If you want to know even more about heart failure, consult the article written by our experts. Manual Merck, 2014 American Heart Association, 2015 National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, 2014 Load more;/ 1 in 6 Portuguese people may have heart failure without knowing it. The prevalence increases with age, but lifestyle helps reduce risk factors. Duarte Cacela and R\u00faben Ramos, CUF cardiologists, explain the advantages of using custom prostheses in the treatment of tricuspid heart failure. Adopting a healthy lifestyle can help keep heart failure under control, preventing hospitalizations and complications. Follow these tips.

I take blood pressure and pulse 2times/ day and it is averaging 107/71, pulse 63- working well. It took me a good 4 weeks to adapt to the tough side effects though. I felt very tired to the point of falling asleep during the day, was worn out if I walked to far or even stood too long, felt lightheadedness, nauseated, was afraid to drive. I'm glad I stuck it out, the side effects finally abated. Hang in there, the bad side effects can go away. For the record I'm a 69 year old woman, 5`4\" 128 lbs. I take the pill at night.",

My BP is very high in the morning, like 167/110, before I take my daily dosage of valsartan. Within 2 hours of taking it my BP hasn't improved, then at about 5 hours after I take my BP med my BP plummets to like 71/54, sometimes lower. I fall asleep without even realizing it when it happens & sleep for about half hour. BP readings, about 4 times daily, shows PVCs at all times with an infrequent no PVC reading.

I had no side effects at ALL from this until the first week of June. Today is July 22nd. The first week of June, I was recovering from a sore throat and cough and then three weeks later, I realized that I was STILL hoarse and my voice was cracking. It is STILL like that as of today.

I still feel a little of that about 12 hours after I take it- I figure that is a slight \" withdrawal\" effect, it lasts about 30-45 min. & I don't have it every day. When I took the generic ( manufacturer, PAR) I felt on a roller coaster, up & down all day. The time release delivery feels to be much smoother with the brand name, toprol- I recommend it.

Cardiologist found source of my chest pain is a narrowed subclavian artery.  The chest pain completely stopped within 24 hours. The only real side effect is difficulty sleeping if instructed to take it at night. I switched to taking it first thing in the morning and I now sleep like a baby. I give it a 9/10 solely for that side effect. I did feel very lethargic when I first took it, but that went away completely after 2 days or so once my body got used to the meds.

After this I went to a cardiologist who gave me 50 mg Metoprolol to take as needed. I am happy that i don't have to take it daily because it does make me sluggish on the very rare times that I do-I am pleased to have a solution when these events happen and my fears of dying suddenly from a heart episode have been drastically reduced.",

Halving the dose has not changed this; I am hoping to be off it, or at least on an even lower dose, after my next cardiology appointment in June. I think it is making me forgetful. That has definitely been a problem since taking it, although I was a bit of an absent-minded professor before.

The medication works great to keep my heart rate and blood pressure down to normal levels, however, for the first month on the medication I constantly fell asleep during daily activity, and even now I maintain a sense of perpetual fatigue. Hard to lose weight, and depression creeps up often. Brain fog has slowed my ability to focus and react swiftly, which is frustrating.

It stayed that way for about a year and a half until I became pregnant and that seemed to trigger it all back. But I did the same thing and am fine now and I never experienced any side effects.",

Heart rate increases, I can feel my blood pressure increase to the point of feeling my pulse in my fingertips for example. I know it is either 7:00 am or 7:00 pm.

I got prescribed Metoprolol Tartrate twice a day at first and it was a nightmare. It actually had like a reverse reaction on me and gave me constant flutters for a whole day. The doctor told me to take Magnesium twice a day with it and it would help and it definitely did. I eventually switched to the extended release, once a day, along with Magnesium and I couldn't be happier. I feel a lot more relaxed and normal. Had few palps still with Tartrate but not with Succinate (yet). I wanted to wait to write a review because I know I relied on reviews. Hope this helps!",

I've never had a problem eating or swallowing in my life. The cardiologist I was seeing ignored me and said that's not a side effect. After two ERr trips w what felt like my throat closing was told to half the pill and wean off, because the drug was causing my issues. I took it for 3 weeks and have been off now now for 10 days but still can't eat. had an endoscopy and they found there is little to no pressure in esophagus & attribute this to the drug.

Read a lot and switched to Toprol XL, no generic!!!! I take 50mg at night slow release. Feel great and few side effects. Pressures are good and heart rate is down.

Came off the opioids and find I have diarrhoea which seems to be the medication. I also developed vertigo 10 days ago. It's reduced in severity, but is still hanging around. Again seems likely to be the medication. Off all things meant to help me sleep, Metoprolol has made for some difficult sleepless nights, not something I've ever had before. At the same time it's controlling my heart rate and BP, and so far no more AF. My first week home from rehab I also suffered the anxious feeling, which was an unpleasant, crawly feeling in my chest. It seems to work though.",

Stupidly, I stopped taking it after the first week, I ended up feeling so bad I had to go to the ER. Since then all my problems have been side-effects. A few hours before I am to take my next dose I begin to feel depressed, very cranky and angry and generally just awful. Once I take the medicine though those feelings tend to go away. It also upsets my stomach and I have had a mild loss of appetite. I have also noticed that some foods taste different. I am also having a problem staying asleep, but I seem to fall asleep easily. So I am up and down all night. I am not happy on it so I will be asking my doctor for something else.",

My one vice is my nightly glass of wine, which looks like I'll have to give up and replace with beer once in a while. Oh well, beats the alternative. No other side effects yet.

At three months of taking the drug, swallowing became very difficult. Food would get stuck in my throat and I would not be able to talk or dislodge food. Then, the insomnia started. I would wake at about 2 am and not be able to go back to sleep for several hours. Always tired, then would want to eat. I gained 20 pounds in a couple of months.

Also it gives me terrible nightmares, very violent. I'll wake up wondering how I could even have such terrible dreams. It also makes me tired. I've stopped it several times and each time the bad symptoms go away completely in about 2 days. I'm going to have to stop taking it for good, the nightmares are just too terrible.",

Suddenly my blood pressure jumped and my heart was beating erratically, chest pains (which I've never had), and I was constantly worn out. I checked the brands of the former medications and the new and found they were different.

It also has had an effect on my ability to have a discussion without forgetting a word or two. My doctor gave me a dosage of 100mg/2x daily. I wound up back in the hospital due to my heart rate being a low 32 beats per minute. The hospital treated it as a failure with the original stent and went back in to check the previous operation. That was over a year ago. We tweaked the prescription down to 50 mg once a day, but I never got out of the lethargic state.",

I had suffered severe chest pain for two hours before going to the ER, which was stupid of me. I have been on Metoprolol Tartrate for 2.5 years now. 25 mg. twice daily. It seems to work fine, as my blood pressure is consistently around 116 over 64, and my heart rate is 54 BPM at last check-up two months ago. Before my heart attack, it was around 150 over 80, so a vast improvement there. I also am on a low dose (10 mg. daily) of Lisinopril, so that may help as well. The only side effect I am experiencing is severe exhaustion following a 10-hour shift at work. Age 57.",

This med caused me to be quite tired/fatigued. In the beginning I was also dizzy but that eventually went away almost completely. The sleepiness has not gone away but it's manageable.

Everyone warned me about how tired I was going to be since this medication would literally be slowing my heart down but I've never experienced that. I don't sleep much and have insomnia so that could be why. I also have experienced crazy dreams and I sleep walk from time to time. I've always had dreams and talked in my sleep but I think the medication makes it a little worse especially if you're taking it closer to bed time. I do get a little light headed if I stand up quick and bend down but it's not bad. The benefit I get from this medication outweighs any of these insignificant side effects.

American doctors refuse to give me the prescription. I finally had to go to another country to obtain the prescrption.I absolutely hate the American medical system.

I haven't felt this calm and comfortable in years! Doctors really need to stop assuming that anxiety is the diagnosis of everyone's problems. There's a bit of drowsiness and fatigue in the beginning but that goes away as your body gets used to it. I am very happy with this medication.",

I figured out the only change I'd made was taking metoprolol so I weaned myself off of it and the depression cleared right up.

                    "I am a 28 year old healthy female. I was diagnosed with Supraventricular Tachycardia just recently and was put on Toprol XL 25 mg. I have only had a few minor attacks since being on this medication however I have side effects - Constantly exhausted and don't feel like myself and I have a heavy feeling in my chest which is extremely uncomfortable. Side effects have not subsided much since I started the medication 5 weeks ago. The side effects are bad enough to where I'm tempted to stop taking it and take my chances with the SVT! My doctor is recommending ablation procedure in hopes of that solving my problem and get me off the medication.",
                    "Been taking this medicine many yrs. I have experienced weight gain, short of breath in exercise, and now I am sweating \"pink\" which is ruining my clothing. It does not wash out even after using laundry \"spot: cleaning. Anyone else experience this?",
                    "I'm a 52 YO male in fairly good shape. I started taking Metoprolol, 50mg twice a day after suffering a cardiac arrest earlier this year, in April. It has been very effective in controlling my blood pressure and keeping my heart rate low. The side effects are becoming unbearable now though. I'm tired, and have a lot of trouble focusing on my work during the day, have a lot of restless nights of tossing and turning, and have now developed a rash under my arms. I think it also contributes to erectile dysfunction. I spoke to my cardiologist about all this today, and he's cutting my dose in half. I'm hoping some of these side effects will diminish when I cut down to 25mg twice a day.",
                    "I am a 70 yr old RN. I started having episodes of near-fainting around 16 yr.old (actually fainted twice). I would go to the nurse & ask to lay down-which helped, but she thought I was faking. Next episode, 25 yr old - saw cardiologist, negative EKG, no treatment. Next 2 episodes, 30 yr old, more severe, ER - negative tests. Next 5 episodes, 40-50 yr old increasing severity, ER. During the last ER visit, I heard about a new type of Doc, an electrocardiophysiologist. I wore a monitor for 6 weeks before it finally \"caught\" the SVT. I started on Toprol 50 mg per day. But then, I had an episode of severe low BP (80/40) - back to the ER. My new Doc said to split dose, take 25 mg AM & PM. No episodes past 20 years. I'm a happy camper !",
                    "It is fourth blood pressure pill for me. It feels like it is only partly working. My blood pressure problems are usually happening after anxiety attacks of which doctors says I have but don't know why."

                    "//What is it?//Headache and migraine are different entities. Migraine is one of the most common and well characterized, but there are 14 broad categories that can be subdivided into more than 200 different forms. Migraine itself has about 20 different genres. In general, headaches are divided into two large groups: primary and secondary. Primary illnesses correspond to a disease, not reflecting other health problems and represent around 90% of the total. Secondary symptoms are symptoms of diseases of the nervous system or other organs of the human body. They can occur in cases of flu, alcohol poisoning or withdrawal, minor head trauma, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels) or a high blood pressure crisis. Migraine is a primary headache in which very intense episodes of pain occur interspersed with periods without symptoms. In general, it begins between the ages of 15 and 40, but it can appear in childhood or shortly after the first menstruation. If it appears for the first time after the age of 45, other causes must be excluded. Some of its characteristics are closely associated with the female reproductive cycle: higher prevalence after the first menstruation or during the menstrual period; occasional worsening due to taking birth control pills or hormone therapy; attenuation or disappearance during pregnancy or menopause. Before adolescence, migraines affect boys and girls equally. From then on, it is two to three times more common in females. It is estimated that 8% to 15% of individuals living in Western countries (including Portugal) suffer from this problem. The fact of reaching people in the productive phase implies large economic, social and family costs.//Symptoms//It appears recurrently, several times throughout life, but always with completely free intervals. If it occurs every day, it is probably overuse of painkillers or other medications. Drug abuse can convert a migraine into a chronic daily headache. There are people who preferably appear on the weekend. These crises can be precipitated by changes in sleep schedule, failure to eat breakfast, reduced stress or alcohol abuse. In these cases, it is important to consider a lifestyle change over the weekend. The symptoms are intense and often prevent work or study. The pain tends to be throbbing, worsening with physical exertion or head movements. In general, it affects only one side of the head, and is accompanied by nausea, vomiting, intolerance to light, noise and some smells. It is not mandatory that all of these elements are present simultaneously. And they can occur twice a week or just a few throughout a lifetime. During attacks, people seek a dark, quiet place to rest or fall asleep. An episode can last from a few hours to three days. Between attacks, there are usually no complaints. Some types of migraines may have more complex symptoms (with aura). These forms are less common, affecting around 15% of people with this problem, and include transient neurological symptoms, originating attributable to certain areas of the brain. The other signs are identical to those of migraine without aura. The most common auras are temporary vision disorders, in the form of loss of vision on one side of the visual field, blurred images, perception of bright points, geometric figures or bright zigzags. Other auras can be translated as tingling or numbness on one side of the face or one of the hands. There are people who have difficulty speaking or even temporary paralysis of their limbs, usually only on one side of the body. These changes last about 10 to 30 minutes and precede the pain. In children, migraines tend to be bilateral, less intense and of shorter duration. Vomiting and dark circles can be exuberant. Disturbances in sleep and meal schedules are common precipitating factors. Treating these crises is easier than in adults. Sleep usually gives good results. At these ages, the occipital location is not normal and, when present, requires a medical consultation. Likewise, the presence of headaches with morning vomiting or other unusual symptoms in very young children should be seen by a healthcare professional.//Causes//It is caused by a combination of brain processes: excitation/depression of cells, dilation of arteries and release of chemicals. People with migraine are more sensitive to certain stimuli, environmental or from their own body, that can trigger these brain processes. It is also thought that there is some genetic susceptibility. Some individuals can identify the signs of their attacks. The most common are cheese, chocolate, strawberries, seafood, wine, artificial sauces, changes in sleep patterns, stress, menstruation, fasting, physical exercise, and minor trauma. Others cannot identify them at all. People who drink coffee regularly may experience headaches when they stop this habit.//Diagnosis//The key to diagnosis lies in the clinical history, physical and neurological examination. Observation of the fundus is a very important part of these procedures. In some cases, it may be necessary to resort to computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to exclude other diseases.//Treatment//Migraines have no cure but can be controlled. There are medications and behaviors that can reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks. Symptomatic treatment, during acute periods, involves resting in a quiet, dark place. Pressure or cold can be applied to the area of \u200b\u200bpain. At this stage, analgesics, anti-inflammatories, antiemetics and triptans are very useful.//Prevention//People with migraines should create calendars that allow them to identify their symptoms and assess their impact on their quality of life. The first step in prevention is to identify and eliminate precipitating factors, whenever possible. In some cases, it is necessary to use daily medication to reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks, but there are no drugs specifically developed for their prevention. However, there are some drugs used in other contexts that have proven to be effective, such as beta-blockers, antidepressants or antiepileptics, and these should always be prescribed by a doctor.

                    "//What is it?//This is an increase in blood pressure above values \u200b\u200bconsidered normal. It occurs when there is excessive pressure of blood on the walls of the arteries during circulation. It can increase at certain times, due to physical or emotional exertion, and it is natural that, after these situations, its values \u200b\u200breturn to normal levels. This condition is only serious and causes health problems when it remains high for months, or when it increases suddenly. It is important to know that tension tends to increase with age. However, hypertension should not be considered normal in the elderly. As a rule, arterial hypertension is considered to be present when the maximum pressure is greater than or equal to 160 mmHge/or the minimum pressure is greater than or equal to 95 mmHge. High blood pressure is associated with coronary heart disease, stroke and heart failure and is the most common modifiable cardiovascular risk factor, which is why its treatment is essential in preventing these pathologies. Cardiovascular diseases are the cause of death for at least 34.1% of the Brazilian population, mainly as a consequence of stroke and coronary disease. It is estimated that the prevalence of high blood pressure in the Portuguese adult population is 42.1%, with only 39.0% of these patients taking antihypertensive drugs and only 11.2% being under control.//Symptoms//In the first few years, it does not cause any symptoms. Over time, blood pressure ends up damaging the blood vessels and the main organs of the body, such as the brain, heart and kidneys, causing headaches, dizziness, tinnitus and increased heart rate. The main diseases associated with high blood pressure are stroke, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, heart and kidney failure.//Causes//Around 90% of cases are related to lifestyle habits. Obesity is one of the important factors. Each pound of fat requires the formation of an additional 1.5 kilometers of small blood vessels to supply the excess adipose tissue. Increased blood pressure is required to pump blood through them. Therefore, being overweight by 20% or more increases the risk of hypertension by five times;;/ Excess salt consumption. It is known that high blood pressure is less frequent in populations where its consumption is low. Our body only needs 1/8 of a teaspoon of salt per day;;/ Tobacco is another cause to consider. Even just one cigarette can increase it for about 30 minutes. A pack-a-day smoker can, through smoking alone, cause an increase in blood pressure for 24 hours;;/ Around 5% to 15% of cases may be related to moderate alcohol consumption. On the other hand, one cup of coffee a day can cause an increase in blood pressure;;/ Physical inactivity and stress are also at its origin;;/ The remaining 10% of high blood pressure cases have organic causes, such as some hormonal changes, kidney or blood vessel diseases.//Diagnosis//It is important to remember that high blood pressure cannot be felt, it must be measured. In order to obtain correct values, it is important to rest in a sitting position for at least five minutes before measuring. You should use the same device and always measure on the same arm. The diagnosis of high blood pressure requires measuring an elevated blood pressure on three separate occasions over a period of a week or more. Once its existence has been confirmed, other tests must also be carried out to help understand its origin and/or the complications associated with it.//Treatment//Treatment depends on the severity of the condition. For example, people with moderate hypertension can control it by simply changing some lifestyle habits, such as reducing salt and alcohol intake, controlling their weight, exercising regularly and stopping smoking. There are several medications available for the treatment of high blood pressure that can be used alone or in combination. It is up to the doctor to decide which is the best treatment for each situation.//Prevention//Since most cases have their origin in lifestyle, it is important that it is healthy. All the recommendations mentioned in the treatment prevent the onset of this disease.

The first month was great then on October 21st my resting heart rate went from 61 to 70 and when I walk it suddenly goes to 140 for no reason. I work out 6 days a week and it doesn't make any sence to me. Going back to my doctor tomorrow to figure it out. I just don't see why all of a sudden it would make things 10x worse. I didn't take it today to see if it would help. I was able to exersice without my heart rate sky rocketing to ridiculous numbers. This is the first medication like this I have ever taken. Plus the weight gain is ridiculous. I lost 15 lbs before starting this medication and less then 2 months I gained it all back.",

I take 25mg. in the morning, and 25mg. about 11 hours later. The medicine has stopped my PVC's, and also slows down my heart rate. When I first started taking Metoprorlol Tartrate, it made me very tired, but after about 2 weeks, my body got used to it, and I was fine.",

He sent me home to suffer with it. A couple of weeks ago I made an appt. with the clinic and the most wonderful nurse practioner started me on Metoprolol 25 mg/2x daily and \"I FEEL GREAT!\" I couldn't believe how my heart calmed down, my anxiety was relieved, I SLEPT BETTER b/c it stopped the night time AFIB attacks which constantly woke me up in the middle of the night and i just feel much more comfortable in my own skin...I actually cleaned the house without any huffing, puffing or the usual AFIB attack.

However, @ 25mg I still have bouts of high readings, so when I see my PCP this week, she might raise it to 50mg. I will say that I prefer to see a Cardiologist for this because I am terrified of exercising. Yes, I know exercise and weight loss can lower my bp to healthy levels, but I can't understand I can exert myself while having high bp. Shouldn't it first be controlled with meds first before exercising?",
                    "I have been taking Metoprolol 25mg once a day for 13 days. It has lowered my heart rate by about 30 beats a minute but I am always tired, get chest pain, headache and numbness. Little to no benefit in lowering my blood pressure (140/95's).",
                    "I have been on some form of metoprolol for seven years. It was actually my first prescribed medication at 28. I never even thought about side effects as being the problems I was experiencing; thought there was always something else that the Doctor's was overlooking. Now that I have read these comments, I suffer from most of the common ones; tiredness, weakness, trouble losing weight, strange dreams, increased sweating, difficulty breathing, etc. Have had numerous tests off and on for the last two years, and nothing is ever found. I have also since then started taking clonidine and amlodipine. Some of these symptoms are probably drug interactions. I noticed a chaotic heartbeat when clonidine was added to the medicines. It has gotten worse for the past two years.",

At times though I have spells that usually run less than a few minutes with a heart rate of around 190 plus and pain. My worst battle with this level lasted about 15 minutes. I take 50mg of Metoprolol 2 times a day on a regular basis but add another 50 if I have the biggies and that settles the heart rate down quickly. Luckily I have no side affects but would love to find something else that quickly slows the heart rate ... mainly to avoid the pain and spooky stuff that goes a;long with it.

I take blood pressure and pulse 2times/ day and it is averaging 107/71, pulse 63- working well. It took me a good 4 weeks to adapt to the tough side effects though. I felt very tired to the point of falling asleep during the day, was worn out if I walked to far or even stood too long, felt lightheadedness, nauseated, was afraid to drive. I'm glad I stuck it out, the side effects finally abated. Hang in there, the bad side effects can go away. For the record I'm a 69 year old woman, 5`4\" 128 lbs. I take the pill at night.",

Been taking for a year now & PVCs are still as often as they were. I see/feel no improvement. Taking at night & valsartan in a.m experiencing BP drops. My BP is very high in the morning, like 167/110, before I take my daily dosage of valsartan. Within 2 hours of taking it my BP hasn't improved, then at about 5 hours after I take my BP med my BP plummets to like 71/54, sometimes lower. I fall asleep without even realizing it when it happens & sleep for about half hour. BP readings, about 4 times daily, shows PVCs at all times with an infrequent no PVC reading. Not convinced this med is doing anything for me.",

The only two side effects I've experienced are shakiness and nervousness when I miss a dose by even a few hours and vague aural hallucinations (hearing things) while on the verge of falling asleep.

My doctor prescribed 25 mg of metoprolol for me and I started taking it in February of this year (2015). My blood pressure was lowered from 140/90 to 125/82, so it DOES work in that respect. I had no side effects at ALL from this until the first week of June. Today is July 22nd. The first week of June, I was recovering from a sore throat and cough and then three weeks later, I realized that I was STILL hoarse and my voice was cracking. It is STILL like that as of today. Indeed, one of the rare side effects is hoarseness! I called my doctor today and he switched me to Amlopidine.",

This has happened to me quite a bit recently, using metroprolol succ ER 25 mg daily, for about 2 years now. I did have great success in reducing my pulse (130 resting pulse for 20 years, adjust to 90 now). Overall I was happy with it, but now somewhat concerned with long term use.",

I still feel a little of that about 12 hours after I take it- I figure that is a slight \" withdrawal\" effect, it lasts about 30-45 min. & I don't have it every day. When I took the generic ( manufacturer, PAR) I felt on a roller coaster, up & down all day. The time release delivery feels to be much smoother with the brand name, toprol- I recommend it. All in all, it works well, keeps my heart in sinus rhythm, but it's a tough drug to have to take.",
                    "This drug has literally changed my life in a very short time. I was having horrible chest pains, with a mixture of general anxiety due to work/home stress. Cardiologist found source of my chest pain is a narrowed subclavian artery.  The chest pain completely stopped within 24 hours. The only real side effect is difficulty sleeping if instructed to take it at night. I switched to taking it first thing in the morning and I now sleep like a baby. I give it a 9/10 solely for that side effect. I did feel very lethargic when I first took it, but that went away completely after 2 days or so once my body got used to the meds.

I feel nervous having my natural rhythm manipulated but when it comes to the heart, I'll just do what they say. Had an attack of pericarditis 3 weeks ago and then Atrial fibrillation two days ago.

Been on it for a year - the side effects are strange dreams (not scary...just strange) and exercise difficulties. My doctor recommended sticking with 80% of exercise target heart rate. If you're having side effects, give this medication a couple months to work. It will get better. Make sure your doctor monitors your triglycerides and blood sugar while on any beta blocker. My triglycerides shot through the roof, but now under control with fish oil. ",

After this I went to a cardiologist who gave me 50 mg Metoprolol to take as needed. I am happy that i don't have to take it daily because it does make me sluggish on the very rare times that I do-I am pleased to have a solution when these events happen and my fears of dying suddenly from a heart episode have been drastically reduced.",

It lowered my b.p. by like 20 points/day, and I was fine for 2 days, but then had episodes of exhaustion to the point where I had to lie on the couch for hours to recover from simple housework like washing pots. Was also short of breath like I'd run 5 miles. Swallowing felt weird. Got disoriented while driving. It's a 9 on effectiveness, but can't tolerate the side effects. Am 63/F.",

No more headaches and anxiety is much, much better. I have a bit of shortness of breath, even when sitting at times, but I have been able to jog at the gym.

At first, it made me very sleepy and dizzy, but I have gotten over that. It lowered my heart rate into the low 60's and 50's, occasionally upper 40's. Halving the dose has not changed this; I am hoping to be off it, or at least on an even lower dose, after my next cardiology appointment in June. I think it is making me forgetful. That has definitely been a problem since taking it, although I was a bit of an absent-minded professor before.

I looked up the side effects of this med and I had 24 of the adverse effects!! I had become so weak that I had to use 2 walking sticks, could hardly get in or out of bed, couldn't walk a 100 ft.

Started out at 50mg, but had breakthroughs regularly, and went up to 100mg after a year. The medication works great to keep my heart rate and blood pressure down to normal levels, however, for the first month on the medication I constantly fell asleep during daily activity, and even now I maintain a sense of perpetual fatigue. Hard to lose weight, and depression creeps up often. Brain fog has slowed my ability to focus and react swiftly, which is frustrating.

I have hardly slept, after taking the medicine I get short of breath and feel like I'm having an anxiety attack, and I take the medicine at bedtime. In the mornings when I wake for the first two to three hours I feel shaky, sweaty, nauseous, and extremely dizzy.

It made me tired. I don't know if part of the problem is the doctors I have been seeing don't know what exactly is wrong with my heart and why it does this.

The longer I took the drug, the more side effects. at two months, my feet and legs developed tingling and numbness. Then, my fingers and hands developed the tingling. At three months of taking the drug, swallowing became very difficult. Food would get stuck in my throat and I would not be able to talk or dislodge food. Then, the insomnia started. I would wake at about 2 am and not be able to go back to sleep for several hours. Always tired, then would want to eat. I gained 20 pounds in a couple of months. When I would wake in the night because my arms would be asleep, that was the last straw. I stopped taking the drug and got a different prescription.",

I have really high blood pressure and it does lower it but the numbness which usually lasts about 30 minutes, but returns throughout the day, is scary.  Also it gives me terrible nightmares, very violent. I'll wake up wondering how I could even have such terrible dreams. It also makes me tired. I've stopped it several times and each time the bad symptoms go away completely in about 2 days. I'm going to have to stop taking it for good, the nightmares are just too terrible.",

The medication works great with one caveat - you MUST check which brand you're getting. The dr. changed my dosage, which resulted in different dosage pills. Suddenly my blood pressure jumped and my heart was beating erratically, chest pains (which I've never had), and I was constantly worn out. I checked the brands of the former medications and the new and found they were different. I switched back to the old meds at the new dosage for a couple of days and within 1 day my blood pressure dropped 20 points and I felt back to normal. Now the pharmacy special orders the Mylan brand, as the Aurobindo doesn't work at all.",

Last week I was sitting with a client and fainted.

They scared me which just increased my anxiety. Finally my dr said I had slight tachycardia, my resting heart rate was usually around 100bpm and prescribed me metoprolol 50mg twice a day. The first week i hated this medicine. Swore it made me feel 'just not right'. I believe it was from reading negative reviews. After a couple weeks, palps gone, rating heart rate a around 60bpm.

Even if they worked for a short time the rebound effect was awful. I have found it very difficult to get a physician to give me a one time dosage of metropolol. One small dose cures me. American doctors refuse to give me the prescription. I finally had to go to another country to obtain the prescrption.I absolutely hate the American medical system. I pay a fortune for insurance only for them to not care for me. I am discusted by our greedy, price fixed, non caring medical system. Why can we not get rid of our awful, overpriced, ineffective medical system? Big pharma bribes physicians with fancy coventions.",

After lots of tests and wearing a heart monitor for a month my cardiologist said I had Supraventricular Tachycardia and I was put on metoprolol 12.5mg twice a day. It's great! I haven't felt this calm and comfortable in years! Doctors really need to stop assuming that anxiety is the diagnosis of everyone's problems. There's a bit of drowsiness and fatigue in the beginning but that goes away as your body gets used to it. I am very happy with this medication.",

                    "//What is it?//Headache and migraine are different entities. Migraine is one of the most common and well characterized, but there are 14 broad categories that can be subdivided into more than 200 different forms. Migraine itself has about 20 different genres. In general, headaches are divided into two large groups: primary and secondary. Primary illnesses correspond to a disease, not reflecting other health problems and represent around 90% of the total. Secondary symptoms are symptoms of diseases of the nervous system or other organs of the human body. They can occur in cases of flu, alcohol poisoning or withdrawal, minor head trauma, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels) or a high blood pressure crisis. Migraine is a primary headache in which very intense episodes of pain occur interspersed with periods without symptoms. In general, it begins between the ages of 15 and 40, but it can appear in childhood or shortly after the first menstruation. If it appears for the first time after the age of 45, other causes must be excluded. Some of its characteristics are closely associated with the female reproductive cycle: higher prevalence after the first menstruation or during the menstrual period; occasional worsening due to taking birth control pills or hormone therapy; attenuation or disappearance during pregnancy or menopause. Before adolescence, migraines affect boys and girls equally. From then on, it is two to three times more common in females. It is estimated that 8% to 15% of individuals living in Western countries (including Portugal) suffer from this problem. The fact of reaching people in the productive phase implies large economic, social and family costs.//Symptoms//It appears recurrently, several times throughout life, but always with completely free intervals. If it occurs every day, it is probably overuse of painkillers or other medications. Drug abuse can convert a migraine into a chronic daily headache. There are people who preferably appear on the weekend. These crises can be precipitated by changes in sleep schedule, failure to eat breakfast, reduced stress or alcohol abuse. In these cases, it is important to consider a lifestyle change over the weekend. The symptoms are intense and often prevent work or study. The pain tends to be throbbing, worsening with physical exertion or head movements. In general, it affects only one side of the head, and is accompanied by nausea, vomiting, intolerance to light, noise and some smells. It is not mandatory that all of these elements are present simultaneously. And they can occur twice a week or just a few throughout a lifetime. During attacks, people seek a dark, quiet place to rest or fall asleep. An episode can last from a few hours to three days. Between attacks, there are usually no complaints. Some types of migraines may have more complex symptoms (with aura). These forms are less common, affecting around 15% of people with this problem, and include transient neurological symptoms, originating attributable to certain areas of the brain. The other signs are identical to those of migraine without aura. The most common auras are temporary vision disorders, in the form of loss of vision on one side of the visual field, blurred images, perception of bright points, geometric figures or bright zigzags. Other auras can be translated as tingling or numbness on one side of the face or one of the hands. There are people who have difficulty speaking or even temporary paralysis of their limbs, usually only on one side of the body. These changes last about 10 to 30 minutes and precede the pain. In children, migraines tend to be bilateral, less intense and of shorter duration. Vomiting and dark circles can be exuberant. Disturbances in sleep and meal schedules are common precipitating factors. Treating these crises is easier than in adults. Sleep usually gives good results. At these ages, the occipital location is not normal and, when present, requires a medical consultation. Likewise, the presence of headaches with morning vomiting or other unusual symptoms in very young children should be seen by a healthcare professional.//Causes//It is caused by a combination of brain processes: excitation/depression of cells, dilation of arteries and release of chemicals. People with migraine are more sensitive to certain stimuli, environmental or from their own body, that can trigger these brain processes. It is also thought that there is some genetic susceptibility. Some individuals can identify the signs of their attacks. The most common are cheese, chocolate, strawberries, seafood, wine, artificial sauces, changes in sleep patterns, stress, menstruation, fasting, physical exercise, and minor trauma. Others cannot identify them at all. People who drink coffee regularly may experience headaches when they stop this habit.//Diagnosis//The key to diagnosis lies in the clinical history, physical and neurological examination. Observation of the fundus is a very important part of these procedures. In some cases, it may be necessary to resort to computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to exclude other diseases.//Treatment//Migraines have no cure but can be controlled. There are medications and behaviors that can reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks. Symptomatic treatment, during acute periods, involves resting in a quiet, dark place. Pressure or cold can be applied to the area of \u200b\u200bpain. At this stage, analgesics, anti-inflammatories, antiemetics and triptans are very useful.//Prevention//People with migraines should create calendars that allow them to identify their symptoms and assess their impact on their quality of life. The first step in prevention is to identify and eliminate precipitating factors, whenever possible. In some cases, it is necessary to use daily medication to reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks, but there are no drugs specifically developed for their prevention. However, there are some drugs used in other contexts that have proven to be effective, such as beta-blockers, antidepressants or antiepileptics, and these should always be prescribed by a doctor.

                    "//What is it?//This is an increase in blood pressure above values \u200b\u200bconsidered normal. It occurs when there is excessive pressure of blood on the walls of the arteries during circulation. It can increase at certain times, due to physical or emotional exertion, and it is natural that, after these situations, its values \u200b\u200breturn to normal levels. This condition is only serious and causes health problems when it remains high for months, or when it increases suddenly. It is important to know that tension tends to increase with age. However, hypertension should not be considered normal in the elderly. As a rule, arterial hypertension is considered to be present when the maximum pressure is greater than or equal to 160 mmHge/or the minimum pressure is greater than or equal to 95 mmHge. High blood pressure is associated with coronary heart disease, stroke and heart failure and is the most common modifiable cardiovascular risk factor, which is why its treatment is essential in preventing these pathologies. Cardiovascular diseases are the cause of death for at least 34.1% of the Brazilian population, mainly as a consequence of stroke and coronary disease. It is estimated that the prevalence of high blood pressure in the Portuguese adult population is 42.1%, with only 39.0% of these patients taking antihypertensive drugs and only 11.2% being under control.//Symptoms//In the first few years, it does not cause any symptoms. Over time, blood pressure ends up damaging the blood vessels and the main organs of the body, such as the brain, heart and kidneys, causing headaches, dizziness, tinnitus and increased heart rate. The main diseases associated with high blood pressure are stroke, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, heart and kidney failure.//Causes//Around 90% of cases are related to lifestyle habits. Obesity is one of the important factors. Each pound of fat requires the formation of an additional 1.5 kilometers of small blood vessels to supply the excess adipose tissue. Increased blood pressure is required to pump blood through them. Therefore, being overweight by 20% or more increases the risk of hypertension by five times;;/ Excess salt consumption. It is known that high blood pressure is less frequent in populations where its consumption is low. Our body only needs 1/8 of a teaspoon of salt per day;;/ Tobacco is another cause to consider. Even just one cigarette can increase it for about 30 minutes. A pack-a-day smoker can, through smoking alone, cause an increase in blood pressure for 24 hours;;/ Around 5% to 15% of cases may be related to moderate alcohol consumption. On the other hand, one cup of coffee a day can cause an increase in blood pressure;;/ Physical inactivity and stress are also at its origin;;/ The remaining 10% of high blood pressure cases have organic causes, such as some hormonal changes, kidney or blood vessel diseases.//Diagnosis//It is important to remember that high blood pressure cannot be felt, it must be measured. In order to obtain correct values, it is important to rest in a sitting position for at least five minutes before measuring. You should use the same device and always measure on the same arm. The diagnosis of high blood pressure requires measuring an elevated blood pressure on three separate occasions over a period of a week or more. Once its existence has been confirmed, other tests must also be carried out to help understand its origin and/or the complications associated with it.//Treatment//Treatment depends on the severity of the condition. For example, people with moderate hypertension can control it by simply changing some lifestyle habits, such as reducing salt and alcohol intake, controlling their weight, exercising regularly and stopping smoking. There are several medications available for the treatment of high blood pressure that can be used alone or in combination. It is up to the doctor to decide which is the best treatment for each situation.//Prevention//Since most cases have their origin in lifestyle, it is important that it is healthy. All the recommendations mentioned in the treatment prevent the onset of this disease.

                    "I have been on metoprolol er 12.5mg since September 20th. The first month was great then on October 21st my resting heart rate went from 61 to 70 and when I walk it suddenly goes to 140 for no reason. I work out 6 days a week and it doesn't make any sence to me. Going back to my doctor tomorrow to figure it out. I just don't see why all of a sudden it would make things 10x worse. I didn't take it today to see if it would help. I was able to exersice without my heart rate sky rocketing to ridiculous numbers. This is the first medication like this I have ever taken. Plus the weight gain is ridiculous. I lost 15 lbs before starting this medication and less then 2 months I gained it all back.",
                    "I took Lopressor for 24 years it worked very well in lowering my blood pressure and even calming my anxiety but lately it doesn't work on me very well as before, I guess the doctor will change it.",
                    "I'm a 72 year 'young' female, and I have been taking Metoprolol Tartrate for 7 years, for PVC's Premature Ventricular Contractions of my heart, and also for Tachycardia. I take 25mg. in the morning, and 25mg. about 11 hours later. The medicine has stopped my PVC's, and also slows down my heart rate. When I first started taking Metoprorlol Tartrate, it made me very tired, but after about 2 weeks, my body got used to it, and I was fine.",
                    "I have been taking Toprol XL for about 2 years. My doctor has now put me on 200mg twice a day, total 400mg a day, this had to be approve by my insurance company and it was. This is working for me, no side effects and my blood pressure is steady at 114/70.",
                    "I was diagnosed with AFIB in 2012 at the age of 43, long sad frustrating story cut short, the doctor said there was nothing he could do about it. He sent me home to suffer with it. A couple of weeks ago I made an appt. with the clinic and the most wonderful nurse practioner started me on Metoprolol 25 mg/2x daily and \"I FEEL GREAT!\" I couldn't believe how my heart calmed down, my anxiety was relieved, I SLEPT BETTER b/c it stopped the night time AFIB attacks which constantly woke me up in the middle of the night and i just feel much more comfortable in my own skin...I actually cleaned the house without any huffing, puffing or the usual AFIB attack. I agree that it makes me drowsy which is becoming less severe I LOVE IT! :)",
                    "I'm giving this med a 7 so far just because I haven't had any real side effects with it, like I did with another bp med (can't remember the name). However, @ 25mg I still have bouts of high readings, so when I see my PCP this week, she might raise it to 50mg. I will say that I prefer to see a Cardiologist for this because I am terrified of exercising. Yes, I know exercise and weight loss can lower my bp to healthy levels, but I can't understand I can exert myself while having high bp. Shouldn't it first be controlled with meds first before exercising?",
                    "I have been taking Metoprolol 25mg once a day for 13 days. It has lowered my heart rate by about 30 beats a minute but I am always tired, get chest pain, headache and numbness. Little to no benefit in lowering my blood pressure (140/95's).",
                    "I have been on some form of metoprolol for seven years. It was actually my first prescribed medication at 28. I never even thought about side effects as being the problems I was experiencing; thought there was always something else that the Doctor's was overlooking. Now that I have read these comments, I suffer from most of the common ones; tiredness, weakness, trouble losing weight, strange dreams, increased sweating, difficulty breathing, etc. Have had numerous tests off and on for the last two years, and nothing is ever found. I have also since then started taking clonidine and amlodipine. Some of these symptoms are probably drug interactions. I noticed a chaotic heartbeat when clonidine was added to the medicines. It has gotten worse for the past two years.",
                    "I have had constant afib for over 2 years though mostly tolerable. At times though I have spells that usually run less than a few minutes with a heart rate of around 190 plus and pain. My worst battle with this level lasted about 15 minutes. I take 50mg of Metoprolol 2 times a day on a regular basis but add another 50 if I have the biggies and that settles the heart rate down quickly. Luckily I have no side affects but would love to find something else that quickly slows the heart rate ... mainly to avoid the pain and spooky stuff that goes a;long with it. I've had 11 angioplasties and 10 stents since 1990 and am 70.",
                    "I started metaprolol 12.5 mg once a day 6 weeks ago after having an electrical cardioconversion for a rapid, irregular heartbeat. I take blood pressure and pulse 2times/ day and it is averaging 107/71, pulse 63- working well. It took me a good 4 weeks to adapt to the tough side effects though. I felt very tired to the point of falling asleep during the day, was worn out if I walked to far or even stood too long, felt lightheadedness, nauseated, was afraid to drive. I'm glad I stuck it out, the side effects finally abated. Hang in there, the bad side effects can go away. For the record I'm a 69 year old woman, 5`4\" 128 lbs. I take the pill at night.",
                    "I had terrible symptoms of MVP that landed me in the hospital for 5 days. I started taking this medicine 25 mg a day and my symptoms are so much better. I used to have shortness of breath, palpitations, chest pain, and weakness but it's so much better now. I only occasionally have some palpitations but nothing like before. Metoprolol works great!",
                    "Have very frequent Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), heart testing said my heart is fine. Put me on metoprolol succinate ER. Been taking for a year now & PVCs are still as often as they were. I see/feel no improvement. Taking at night & valsartan in a.m experiencing BP drops. My BP is very high in the morning, like 167/110, before I take my daily dosage of valsartan. Within 2 hours of taking it my BP hasn't improved, then at about 5 hours after I take my BP med my BP plummets to like 71/54, sometimes lower. I fall asleep without even realizing it when it happens & sleep for about half hour. BP readings, about 4 times daily, shows PVCs at all times with an infrequent no PVC reading. Not convinced this med is doing anything for me.",

Unlike another report posted here, I am sleeping better while taking the medication. The only two side effects I've experienced are shakiness and nervousness when I miss a dose by even a few hours and vague aural hallucinations (hearing things) while on the verge of falling asleep. I've seen the hallucinations reported by other toprol users on other sites.",
                    "DRUG is very effective but I also take 3 other medicines along with this. After evening meal I take 100mg - blood pressure before taking it is 192/112 and 30 minutes after is 152/91.",

My doctor prescribed 25 mg of metoprolol for me and I started taking it in February of this year (2015). My blood pressure was lowered from 140/90 to 125/82, so it DOES work in that respect. I had no side effects at ALL from this until the first week of June. Today is July 22nd. The first week of June, I was recovering from a sore throat and cough and then three weeks later, I realized that I was STILL hoarse and my voice was cracking. It is STILL like that as of today. Indeed, one of the rare side effects is hoarseness! I called my doctor today and he switched me to Amlopidine.",
                    "Reading the mixed reviews here, the first thing that jumped out was people have problems swallowing. This has happened to me quite a bit recently, using metroprolol succ ER 25 mg daily, for about 2 years now. I did have great success in reducing my pulse (130 resting pulse for 20 years, adjust to 90 now). Overall I was happy with it, but now somewhat concerned with long term use.",

So far I've only had two mild headaches that were easily treated with two ibuprofen. I feel like I have my life back. I highly recommend it.",
                    "Very nice, helped heart, now do sports easy, no more hard breathing",
                    "I recently switched from metaprolol, 1/2 of 25 mg/ day to brand name Toprol xl & have found the negative side effects- fatigue, too low blood pressure, dizziness, nausea- to be much less. I still feel a little of that about 12 hours after I take it- I figure that is a slight \" withdrawal\" effect, it lasts about 30-45 min. & I don't have it every day. When I took the generic ( manufacturer, PAR) I felt on a roller coaster, up & down all day. The time release delivery feels to be much smoother with the brand name, toprol- I recommend it. All in all, it works well, keeps my heart in sinus rhythm, but it's a tough drug to have to take.",
                    "This drug has literally changed my life in a very short time. I was having horrible chest pains, with a mixture of general anxiety due to work/home stress. Cardiologist found source of my chest pain is a narrowed subclavian artery.  The chest pain completely stopped within 24 hours. The only real side effect is difficulty sleeping if instructed to take it at night. I switched to taking it first thing in the morning and I now sleep like a baby. I give it a 9/10 solely for that side effect. I did feel very lethargic when I first took it, but that went away completely after 2 days or so once my body got used to the meds. I feel much more calm than I did before so this medication has really changed the way I feel. improvement is noticeable",

I do experience anxiety a lot and tiredness, along with dizziness at times. The medicine does work,just hoping some day my kidneys will mend themselves so I can STOP taking this medicine.",
                    "I'm on my third day of metoprolol and feel very mellow. My heart feels quiet in the way you feel when you finally hit the pavement after a dirt road. I feel nervous having my natural rhythm manipulated but when it comes to the heart, I'll just do what they say. Had an attack of pericarditis 3 weeks ago and then Atrial fibrillation two days ago. I was told that this was normal after pericarditis. Metoprolol is recommended while heart recovers. ",
                    "I have hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and take metoprolol twice a day to keep my heart rate lowered and blood pressure down. It does the job well, but the side affects are rough to handle sometimes. Such as dizziness, sleepless nights, daytime drowsiness, forgetfulness, and depression but, i'm still coping after about four years and i guess on for the rest of my life. But if i can manage after three brother suicides than so can you.",
                    "Elevated blood pressure and increased heart rate due to long term undertreated high blood pressure. Metoprolol worked wonders. Been on it for a year - the side effects are strange dreams (not scary...just strange) and exercise difficulties. My doctor recommended sticking with 80% of exercise target heart rate. If you're having side effects, give this medication a couple months to work. It will get better. Make sure your doctor monitors your triglycerides and blood sugar while on any beta blocker. My triglycerides shot through the roof, but now under control with fish oil. ",
                    "My tachycardia started in my middle 30s, and though they were rare, became more severe as i entered my middle 40's and had to ER visits requiring the injection that stops the heart-no fun and scary. After this I went to a cardiologist who gave me 50 mg Metoprolol to take as needed. I am happy that i don't have to take it daily because it does make me sluggish on the very rare times that I do-I am pleased to have a solution when these events happen and my fears of dying suddenly from a heart episode have been drastically reduced.",
                    "Went to have foot injury x-rayed at urgent care, and spiked a blood pressure of 195/110 maybe due to pain.Was given this by IV in the ER, then pills for 3-4 nights at home. It lowered my b.p. by like 20 points/day, and I was fine for 2 days, but then had episodes of exhaustion to the point where I had to lie on the couch for hours to recover from simple housework like washing pots. Was also short of breath like I'd run 5 miles. Swallowing felt weird. Got disoriented while driving. It's a 9 on effectiveness, but can't tolerate the side effects. Am 63/F.",
                    "Changed from atenolol 50mg to metropolol er succinate 25 mg not by choice. Transition very smooth. Was taking atenolol for SVTs.

                    "I am 54 and had a stent put in with 95% blockage. I was put on Metoprolol 25mg along with atorvastatin and effient. The first month or so was tough as I had headaches, chest pains shortness of breath, etc. I think a large part of it was anxiety from a life changing surprise condition. No more headaches and anxiety is much, much better. I have a bit of shortness of breath, even when sitting at times, but I have been able to jog at the gym. Just started again this week and went 30 minute today. Overall, not sure if anything is working, but I am trying to just trust my Doctor and listen to my body.

                    "I am 14 years old. I once had a moderate heart attack, and afterwards, my heart was constantly hammering away. Just sitting sown my pulse was 180 bpm. This led to enlarged heart and high blood pressure. I've been on this medicine for 3 years now, and it has probably saved my life from another heart attack. I recommend it to anyone with my problem.",
                    "I love this medicine! It has quite literally saved my life, and has made my life much more livable. Whenever I would do anything physical, my heart would beat so fast that I would frequently faint. I went to my cardiologist, and she gave me a holter monitor. She saw what I was talking about and gave me 50mg of Toprol-XL everyday. That was over 3 years ago, still on the same dosage, and it is wonderful. For the first few months, I was a little over tired, but that side effect quickly went away.",
                    "I had all the side effects listed after taking Lopressor for 3 days. they still persist after stopping meds 2 days ago. I was on very low dosage of 12.5 bid",
                    "I was put on 50 mg 3 X a day for rapid, arrhythmic heartbeat and high blood pressure, in November last year. At first, it made me very sleepy and dizzy, but I have gotten over that. It lowered my heart rate into the low 60's and 50's, occasionally upper 40's. Halving the dose has not changed this; I am hoping to be off it, or at least on an even lower dose, after my next cardiology appointment in June. I think it is making me forgetful. That has definitely been a problem since taking it, although I was a bit of an absent-minded professor before. It may also have helped lower my blood pressure, although I have made some diet and lifestyle changes that would affect that, also.",
                    "It stopped my PACs (Preatrial contractions ). I was on this med for 13 years. Over three years ago I started having increased muscle weakness, episodes of collapsing or falling without knowing why or even a warning that I was going to fall, extremely dry eyes (OTC eye drops were ineffective), severe muscle spasms, back pain, increased diarrhea, swelling in hands and feet, and pinpoint red spots on my skin. I looked up the side effects of this med and I had 24 of the adverse effects!! I had become so weak that I had to use 2 walking sticks, could hardly get in or out of bed, couldn't walk a 100 ft. I quit taking this med which I thoroughly believe was killing me. I have begun to feel much better regaining some of my muscle strength and have less back pain.",

I have stopped it and have an appointment with a dermatologist next week. Am scared to death that more is going to fall out! Anybody else experience bald spots?",
                    "I started taking this medicine in 2006. It works to take the pressure off my heart but it has caused me arthritis in my knees, hands and feet. Now I am in pain most of the time. My hands have developed arthritis in both thumbs, my feet have it in my toes. I tried another Astra Zeneca product called Atacand and it works better but is so expensive I can't afford to buy it.",

                    "Started taking metoprolol 8 years ago when I was hospitalized with a bout of of tachycardia that wouldn't go away for hours. Diagnosed with supraventricular tachycardia. Started out at 50mg, but had breakthroughs regularly, and went up to 100mg after a year. The medication works great to keep my heart rate and blood pressure down to normal levels, however, for the first month on the medication I constantly fell asleep during daily activity, and even now I maintain a sense of perpetual fatigue. Hard to lose weight, and depression creeps up often. Brain fog has slowed my ability to focus and react swiftly, which is frustrating. Still, the medication works so well to keep the heart episodes at bay that I haven't tried switching to a new medication.",

It has helped in slowing my rapid heart beat down but the side effects have almost been unbearable. I have hardly slept, after taking the medicine I get short of breath and feel like I'm having an anxiety attack, and I take the medicine at bedtime. In the mornings when I wake for the first two to three hours I feel shaky, sweaty, nauseous, and extremely dizzy. My regular MD took me down to 25mg once daily and I still can't sleep and feel anxious. This is the first day taking 25mg so we'll see how I feel in the morning.",

I told this many times but he still thinking about the BPM..so at the end the BPM decrease but not the blood pressure so is working 50/50. PS I gained more than 10lb after using the metoprolol",

There must be some difference in the release between the two. This med brings the BP into 120's over low to mid 70's range where I was reg 140's/90's.

It made me tired. I don't know if part of the problem is the doctors I have been seeing don't know what exactly is wrong with my heart and why it does this.

I informed my PA of this after my last crisis and she is looking into prescribing a different product (one given at the hospital) but this after a few years on Toprol. I figure that without the change from this medicine I don't stand a chance of reversing my diabetic condition.",

My blood pressure dropped (wasn't high in the first place) and my heart rate dropped to the mid/low 40's. I was also very light-headed, had low energy, some shortness of breath and sometimes nausea.

However, I had soul-crushing fatigue and a foggy brain and couldn't get thru the day, it seriously affected my life. I had trouble regulating my body temperature and was pretty miserable. My heart beat out of my chest when I laid on my left side. I thought these side effects were the result of an acute illness that ended w/ me having HBP, but it turns out they were from Metoprolol. My doc switched me to Bystolic 5mg and I felt better within a couple days! Metoprolol worked to lower my BP, but I didn't like the side effects.",

It takes an act of congress to get an erection, and even when I do somehow get erections, they are very brief and not what it once was. Almost like it has shrunk.

I started taking 25 milligrams of Metoprolol twice a day and a lose dose aspirin once a day. I had another episode last September. They gave me Fleccinide (spelling?) and it reversed on its own. The first time, I had very stressful day, drank huge amount of coffee, and didn't sleep well the night before. The second time, I mowed both the front and back yard and did five minutes on stationary bike. Other than that, the metoprolol has controlled it and I try to avoid stress, sleep well, and don't mow both yards at once. The only side effect I have is fatigue.",

I was constantly under stress, with my body flooded with stress hormones, strong heart-beating etc. Metoprolol helped me a lot in reducing my stress level and adjusting to a more relaxed attitude at work. It calms you down by reducing your heart beat etc. From this perspective it was helpful for getting on a healthier path. It also helped reducing the migraines, even though they stayed. Over the longer run, you need to take higher dosage to achieve a similar effect. at some stage I had the impression the drug didn't help much any longer, so stopped.",

My heart throughout the day kept going into PAT (200+ BPM) No chest pain or anything, but pounding heart/fainting. I was started on Lopressor at that time .... 100mg BID and this is an amazing drug.

I was exercising too. I stopped all meds and no change despite amping up weights and cardio/ no sugar etc.  Nothing. I stopped the metoprolol, and I drop 16 lbs in 1 1/2 months.

While in hospital, a very old fashioned heart doctor got me up to 250 mg/day. Lots of its side effects. Stopped it and went to ER. Went on Coreg. Gave me swelled legs. Back on low dose of metoprolol. Over time, up to 75 mg of metoprolol. Afib stopped mostly with ICD & 2 ablations. Last straw was numbness in feet and back shooting nerve pain.

Before my heart attack, it was around 150 over 80, so a vast improvement there. I also am on a low dose (10 mg. daily) of Lisinopril, so that may help as well.

Lately however, my heart rate has fallen to low 40's taking only 10 mg and my doctor has taken me off it completely. I feel very shaky now. My hands visibly tremble and I notice I get more of an adrenaline rush when under pressure or fear. I need something to replace this because I don't want to experience AF again and I need something to calm me down. Any suggestions would be appreciated.",

I guess you can say that is a not so good thing. But, my symptoms are in check. Refuse to use an alternative medication. The downside to using beta blockers is the side effect.

I was having 10-15 severe migraines per month, causing frequent ER visits, stroke level high blood pressure and severe performance anxiety. Immediately after beginning this medicine I have few headaches and they are rarely severe. My blood pressure is down and my anxiety is significantly improved.  I have no problems exercising.

No problems getting the heart rate up in exercise (still quite the opposite actually! I can reach 180bpm after 5mins) Unfortunately it didnt stop the progression to AF. After 6yrs of SVT & metoprolol I was further diagnosed with AF. Dosage was increased from 25mg to 50-75mg per day. Starting to work a little better now in preventing rapid AF however I still get slow AF. Dry mouth, cold extremities & occasional dizzy spells have been all too common however definitely a small price to pay. 28yo fem",

I immediately improved. I still have them but not as bad. No cardiologist has told me what was wrong. I have a really bad back. In 2011 I got an epidural at T4-5 and that completely cured my rapid and irregular heartbeat for 3 years.

I figured out the only change I'd made was taking metoprolol so I weaned myself off of it and the depression cleared right up. My doctor said he has a lot of patients on this medication and even though depression is a side effect none of them have had this issue. So I'm guessing it's not a common side effect but beware if you're just starting this.",

                    "//What is it?//Headache and migraine are different entities. Migraine is one of the most common and well characterized, but there are 14 broad categories that can be subdivided into more than 200 different forms. Migraine itself has about 20 different genres. In general, headaches are divided into two large groups: primary and secondary. Primary illnesses correspond to a disease, not reflecting other health problems and represent around 90% of the total. Secondary symptoms are symptoms of diseases of the nervous system or other organs of the human body. They can occur in cases of flu, alcohol poisoning or withdrawal, minor head trauma, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels) or a high blood pressure crisis. Migraine is a primary headache in which very intense episodes of pain occur interspersed with periods without symptoms. In general, it begins between the ages of 15 and 40, but it can appear in childhood or shortly after the first menstruation. If it appears for the first time after the age of 45, other causes must be excluded. Some of its characteristics are closely associated with the female reproductive cycle: higher prevalence after the first menstruation or during the menstrual period; occasional worsening due to taking birth control pills or hormone therapy; attenuation or disappearance during pregnancy or menopause. Before adolescence, migraines affect boys and girls equally. From then on, it is two to three times more common in females. It is estimated that 8% to 15% of individuals living in Western countries (including Portugal) suffer from this problem. The fact of reaching people in the productive phase implies large economic, social and family costs.//Symptoms//It appears recurrently, several times throughout life, but always with completely free intervals. If it occurs every day, it is probably overuse of painkillers or other medications. Drug abuse can convert a migraine into a chronic daily headache. There are people who preferably appear on the weekend. These crises can be precipitated by changes in sleep schedule, failure to eat breakfast, reduced stress or alcohol abuse. In these cases, it is important to consider a lifestyle change over the weekend. The symptoms are intense and often prevent work or study. The pain tends to be throbbing, worsening with physical exertion or head movements. In general, it affects only one side of the head, and is accompanied by nausea, vomiting, intolerance to light, noise and some smells. It is not mandatory that all of these elements are present simultaneously. And they can occur twice a week or just a few throughout a lifetime. During attacks, people seek a dark, quiet place to rest or fall asleep. An episode can last from a few hours to three days. Between attacks, there are usually no complaints. Some types of migraines may have more complex symptoms (with aura). These forms are less common, affecting around 15% of people with this problem, and include transient neurological symptoms, originating attributable to certain areas of the brain. The other signs are identical to those of migraine without aura. The most common auras are temporary vision disorders, in the form of loss of vision on one side of the visual field, blurred images, perception of bright points, geometric figures or bright zigzags. Other auras can be translated as tingling or numbness on one side of the face or one of the hands. There are people who have difficulty speaking or even temporary paralysis of their limbs, usually only on one side of the body. These changes last about 10 to 30 minutes and precede the pain. In children, migraines tend to be bilateral, less intense and of shorter duration. Vomiting and dark circles can be exuberant. Disturbances in sleep and meal schedules are common precipitating factors. Treating these crises is easier than in adults. Sleep usually gives good results. At these ages, the occipital location is not normal and, when present, requires a medical consultation. Likewise, the presence of headaches with morning vomiting or other unusual symptoms in very young children should be seen by a healthcare professional.//Causes//It is caused by a combination of brain processes: excitation/depression of cells, dilation of arteries and release of chemicals. People with migraine are more sensitive to certain stimuli, environmental or from their own body, that can trigger these brain processes. It is also thought that there is some genetic susceptibility. Some individuals can identify the signs of their attacks. The most common are cheese, chocolate, strawberries, seafood, wine, artificial sauces, changes in sleep patterns, stress, menstruation, fasting, physical exercise, and minor trauma. Others cannot identify them at all. People who drink coffee regularly may experience headaches when they stop this habit.//Diagnosis//The key to diagnosis lies in the clinical history, physical and neurological examination. Observation of the fundus is a very important part of these procedures. In some cases, it may be necessary to resort to computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to exclude other diseases.//Treatment//Migraines have no cure but can be controlled. There are medications and behaviors that can reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks. Symptomatic treatment, during acute periods, involves resting in a quiet, dark place. Pressure or cold can be applied to the area of \u200b\u200bpain. At this stage, analgesics, anti-inflammatories, antiemetics and triptans are very useful.//Prevention//People with migraines should create calendars that allow them to identify their symptoms and assess their impact on their quality of life. The first step in prevention is to identify and eliminate precipitating factors, whenever possible. In some cases, it is necessary to use daily medication to reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks, but there are no drugs specifically developed for their prevention. However, there are some drugs used in other contexts that have proven to be effective, such as beta-blockers, antidepressants or antiepileptics, and these should always be prescribed by a doctor.

                    "//What is it?//This is an increase in blood pressure above values \u200b\u200bconsidered normal. It occurs when there is excessive pressure of blood on the walls of the arteries during circulation. It can increase at certain times, due to physical or emotional exertion, and it is natural that, after these situations, its values \u200b\u200breturn to normal levels. This condition is only serious and causes health problems when it remains high for months, or when it increases suddenly. It is important to know that tension tends to increase with age. However, hypertension should not be considered normal in the elderly. As a rule, arterial hypertension is considered to be present when the maximum pressure is greater than or equal to 160 mmHge/or the minimum pressure is greater than or equal to 95 mmHge. High blood pressure is associated with coronary heart disease, stroke and heart failure and is the most common modifiable cardiovascular risk factor, which is why its treatment is essential in preventing these pathologies. Cardiovascular diseases are the cause of death for at least 34.1% of the Brazilian population, mainly as a consequence of stroke and coronary disease. It is estimated that the prevalence of high blood pressure in the Portuguese adult population is 42.1%, with only 39.0% of these patients taking antihypertensive drugs and only 11.2% being under control.//Symptoms//In the first few years, it does not cause any symptoms. Over time, blood pressure ends up damaging the blood vessels and the main organs of the body, such as the brain, heart and kidneys, causing headaches, dizziness, tinnitus and increased heart rate. The main diseases associated with high blood pressure are stroke, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, heart and kidney failure.//Causes//Around 90% of cases are related to lifestyle habits. Obesity is one of the important factors. Each pound of fat requires the formation of an additional 1.5 kilometers of small blood vessels to supply the excess adipose tissue. Increased blood pressure is required to pump blood through them. Therefore, being overweight by 20% or more increases the risk of hypertension by five times;;/ Excess salt consumption. It is known that high blood pressure is less frequent in populations where its consumption is low. Our body only needs 1/8 of a teaspoon of salt per day;;/ Tobacco is another cause to consider. Even just one cigarette can increase it for about 30 minutes. A pack-a-day smoker can, through smoking alone, cause an increase in blood pressure for 24 hours;;/ Around 5% to 15% of cases may be related to moderate alcohol consumption. On the other hand, one cup of coffee a day can cause an increase in blood pressure;;/ Physical inactivity and stress are also at its origin;;/ The remaining 10% of high blood pressure cases have organic causes, such as some hormonal changes, kidney or blood vessel diseases.//Diagnosis//It is important to remember that high blood pressure cannot be felt, it must be measured. In order to obtain correct values, it is important to rest in a sitting position for at least five minutes before measuring. You should use the same device and always measure on the same arm. The diagnosis of high blood pressure requires measuring an elevated blood pressure on three separate occasions over a period of a week or more. Once its existence has been confirmed, other tests must also be carried out to help understand its origin and/or the complications associated with it.//Treatment//Treatment depends on the severity of the condition. For example, people with moderate hypertension can control it by simply changing some lifestyle habits, such as reducing salt and alcohol intake, controlling their weight, exercising regularly and stopping smoking. There are several medications available for the treatment of high blood pressure that can be used alone or in combination. It is up to the doctor to decide which is the best treatment for each situation.//Prevention//Since most cases have their origin in lifestyle, it is important that it is healthy. All the recommendations mentioned in the treatment prevent the onset of this disease.

                    "I had my first atrial fibrillation crisis 3 moths ago. They cardioverted me, the doctor put me on metoprolol succinate ER 25mg for the first month and now I'm on on metoprolol tartrate 25mg. ",
                    "I have been on metoprolol er 12.5mg since September 20th. The first month was great then on October 21st my resting heart rate went from 61 to 70 and when I walk it suddenly goes to 140 for no reason. I work out 6 days a week and it doesn't make any sence to me. Going back to my doctor tomorrow to figure it out. I just don't see why all of a sudden it would make things 10x worse. I didn't take it today to see if it would help. I was able to exersice without my heart rate sky rocketing to ridiculous numbers. This is the first medication like this I have ever taken. Plus the weight gain is ridiculous. I lost 15 lbs before starting this medication and less then 2 months I gained it all back.",
                    "I took Lopressor for 24 years it worked very well in lowering my blood pressure and even calming my anxiety but lately it doesn't work on me very well as before, I guess the doctor will change it.",
                    "I'm a 72 year 'young' female, and I have been taking Metoprolol Tartrate for 7 years, for PVC's Premature Ventricular Contractions of my heart, and also for Tachycardia. I take 25mg. in the morning, and 25mg. about 11 hours later. The medicine has stopped my PVC's, and also slows down my heart rate. When I first started taking Metoprorlol Tartrate, it made me very tired, but after about 2 weeks, my body got used to it, and I was fine.",
                    "I have been taking Toprol XL for about 2 years. My doctor has now put me on 200mg twice a day, total 400mg a day, this had to be approve by my insurance company and it was. This is working for me, no side effects and my blood pressure is steady at 114/70.",
                    "I was diagnosed with AFIB in 2012 at the age of 43, long sad frustrating story cut short, the doctor said there was nothing he could do about it. He sent me home to suffer with it. A couple of weeks ago I made an appt. with the clinic and the most wonderful nurse practioner started me on Metoprolol 25 mg/2x daily and \"I FEEL GREAT!\" I couldn't believe how my heart calmed down, my anxiety was relieved, I SLEPT BETTER b/c it stopped the night time AFIB attacks which constantly woke me up in the middle of the night and i just feel much more comfortable in my own skin...I actually cleaned the house without any huffing, puffing or the usual AFIB attack. I agree that it makes me drowsy which is becoming less severe I LOVE IT! :)",
                    "I'm giving this med a 7 so far just because I haven't had any real side effects with it, like I did with another bp med (can't remember the name). However, @ 25mg I still have bouts of high readings, so when I see my PCP this week, she might raise it to 50mg. I will say that I prefer to see a Cardiologist for this because I am terrified of exercising. Yes, I know exercise and weight loss can lower my bp to healthy levels, but I can't understand I can exert myself while having high bp. Shouldn't it first be controlled with meds first before exercising?",
                    "I have been taking Metoprolol 25mg once a day for 13 days. It has lowered my heart rate by about 30 beats a minute but I am always tired, get chest pain, headache and numbness. Little to no benefit in lowering my blood pressure (140/95's).",
                    "I have been on some form of metoprolol for seven years. It was actually my first prescribed medication at 28. I never even thought about side effects as being the problems I was experiencing; thought there was always something else that the Doctor's was overlooking. Now that I have read these comments, I suffer from most of the common ones; tiredness, weakness, trouble losing weight, strange dreams, increased sweating, difficulty breathing, etc. Have had numerous tests off and on for the last two years, and nothing is ever found. I have also since then started taking clonidine and amlodipine. Some of these symptoms are probably drug interactions. I noticed a chaotic heartbeat when clonidine was added to the medicines. It has gotten worse for the past two years.",
                    "I have had constant afib for over 2 years though mostly tolerable. At times though I have spells that usually run less than a few minutes with a heart rate of around 190 plus and pain. My worst battle with this level lasted about 15 minutes. I take 50mg of Metoprolol 2 times a day on a regular basis but add another 50 if I have the biggies and that settles the heart rate down quickly. Luckily I have no side affects but would love to find something else that quickly slows the heart rate ... mainly to avoid the pain and spooky stuff that goes a;long with it. I've had 11 angioplasties and 10 stents since 1990 and am 70.",
                    "I started metaprolol 12.5 mg once a day 6 weeks ago after having an electrical cardioconversion for a rapid, irregular heartbeat. I take blood pressure and pulse 2times/ day and it is averaging 107/71, pulse 63- working well. It took me a good 4 weeks to adapt to the tough side effects though. I felt very tired to the point of falling asleep during the day, was worn out if I walked to far or even stood too long, felt lightheadedness, nauseated, was afraid to drive. I'm glad I stuck it out, the side effects finally abated. Hang in there, the bad side effects can go away. For the record I'm a 69 year old woman, 5`4\" 128 lbs. I take the pill at night.",
                    "I had terrible symptoms of MVP that landed me in the hospital for 5 days. I started taking this medicine 25 mg a day and my symptoms are so much better. I used to have shortness of breath, palpitations, chest pain, and weakness but it's so much better now. I only occasionally have some palpitations but nothing like before. Metoprolol works great!",
                    "Have very frequent Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), heart testing said my heart is fine. Put me on metoprolol succinate ER. Been taking for a year now & PVCs are still as often as they were. I see/feel no improvement. Taking at night & valsartan in a.m experiencing BP drops. My BP is very high in the morning, like 167/110, before I take my daily dosage of valsartan. Within 2 hours of taking it my BP hasn't improved, then at about 5 hours after I take my BP med my BP plummets to like 71/54, sometimes lower. I fall asleep without even realizing it when it happens & sleep for about half hour. BP readings, about 4 times daily, shows PVCs at all times with an infrequent no PVC reading. Not convinced this med is doing anything for me.",

Unlike another report posted here, I am sleeping better while taking the medication. The only two side effects I've experienced are shakiness and nervousness when I miss a dose by even a few hours and vague aural hallucinations (hearing things) while on the verge of falling asleep. I've seen the hallucinations reported by other toprol users on other sites.",
                    "DRUG is very effective but I also take 3 other medicines along with this. After evening meal I take 100mg - blood pressure before taking it is 192/112 and 30 minutes after is 152/91.",

My doctor prescribed 25 mg of metoprolol for me and I started taking it in February of this year (2015). My blood pressure was lowered from 140/90 to 125/82, so it DOES work in that respect. I had no side effects at ALL from this until the first week of June. Today is July 22nd. The first week of June, I was recovering from a sore throat and cough and then three weeks later, I realized that I was STILL hoarse and my voice was cracking. It is STILL like that as of today. Indeed, one of the rare side effects is hoarseness! I called my doctor today and he switched me to Amlopidine.",
                    "Reading the mixed reviews here, the first thing that jumped out was people have problems swallowing. This has happened to me quite a bit recently, using metroprolol succ ER 25 mg daily, for about 2 years now. I did have great success in reducing my pulse (130 resting pulse for 20 years, adjust to 90 now). Overall I was happy with it, but now somewhat concerned with long term use.",
                    "I am so happy to have found a medication that prevents migraines, lowers my blood pressure and curbs anxiety. I was having 20 to 25 migraine days a month. So far I've only had two mild headaches that were easily treated with two ibuprofen. I feel like I have my life back. I highly recommend it.",
                    "Very nice, helped heart, now do sports easy, no more hard breathing",
                    "I recently switched from metaprolol, 1/2 of 25 mg/ day to brand name Toprol xl & have found the negative side effects- fatigue, too low blood pressure, dizziness, nausea- to be much less. I still feel a little of that about 12 hours after I take it- I figure that is a slight \" withdrawal\" effect, it lasts about 30-45 min. & I don't have it every day. When I took the generic ( manufacturer, PAR) I felt on a roller coaster, up & down all day. The time release delivery feels to be much smoother with the brand name, toprol- I recommend it. All in all, it works well, keeps my heart in sinus rhythm, but it's a tough drug to have to take.",
                    "This drug has literally changed my life in a very short time. I was having horrible chest pains, with a mixture of general anxiety due to work/home stress. Cardiologist found source of my chest pain is a narrowed subclavian artery.  The chest pain completely stopped within 24 hours. The only real side effect is difficulty sleeping if instructed to take it at night. I switched to taking it first thing in the morning and I now sleep like a baby. I give it a 9/10 solely for that side effect. I did feel very lethargic when I first took it, but that went away completely after 2 days or so once my body got used to the meds. I feel much more calm than I did before so this medication has really changed the way I feel. improvement is noticeable",

I do experience anxiety a lot and tiredness, along with dizziness at times. The medicine does work,just hoping some day my kidneys will mend themselves so I can STOP taking this medicine.",
                    "I'm on my third day of metoprolol and feel very mellow. My heart feels quiet in the way you feel when you finally hit the pavement after a dirt road. I feel nervous having my natural rhythm manipulated but when it comes to the heart, I'll just do what they say. Had an attack of pericarditis 3 weeks ago and then Atrial fibrillation two days ago. I was told that this was normal after pericarditis. Metoprolol is recommended while heart recovers. ",
                    "I have hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and take metoprolol twice a day to keep my heart rate lowered and blood pressure down. It does the job well, but the side affects are rough to handle sometimes. Such as dizziness, sleepless nights, daytime drowsiness, forgetfulness, and depression but, i'm still coping after about four years and i guess on for the rest of my life. But if i can manage after three brother suicides than so can you.",
                    "Elevated blood pressure and increased heart rate due to long term undertreated high blood pressure. Metoprolol worked wonders. Been on it for a year - the side effects are strange dreams (not scary...just strange) and exercise difficulties. My doctor recommended sticking with 80% of exercise target heart rate. If you're having side effects, give this medication a couple months to work. It will get better. Make sure your doctor monitors your triglycerides and blood sugar while on any beta blocker. My triglycerides shot through the roof, but now under control with fish oil. ",
                    "My tachycardia started in my middle 30s, and though they were rare, became more severe as i entered my middle 40's and had to ER visits requiring the injection that stops the heart-no fun and scary. After this I went to a cardiologist who gave me 50 mg Metoprolol to take as needed. I am happy that i don't have to take it daily because it does make me sluggish on the very rare times that I do-I am pleased to have a solution when these events happen and my fears of dying suddenly from a heart episode have been drastically reduced.",
                    "Went to have foot injury x-rayed at urgent care, and spiked a blood pressure of 195/110 maybe due to pain.Was given this by IV in the ER, then pills for 3-4 nights at home. It lowered my b.p. by like 20 points/day, and I was fine for 2 days, but then had episodes of exhaustion to the point where I had to lie on the couch for hours to recover from simple housework like washing pots. Was also short of breath like I'd run 5 miles. Swallowing felt weird. Got disoriented while driving. It's a 9 on effectiveness, but can't tolerate the side effects. Am 63/F.",
                    "Changed from atenolol 50mg to metropolol er succinate 25 mg not by choice. Transition very smooth. Was taking atenolol for SVTs. I added magnesium to my daily dose after some research on SVTs. Stomach bloating from atenolol reduced and my sleep improved. I'm a mid distance runner with HR in the upper 50s. Feeling very good.",

                    "I am 54 and had a stent put in with 95% blockage. I was put on Metoprolol 25mg along with atorvastatin and effient. The first month or so was tough as I had headaches, chest pains shortness of breath, etc. I think a large part of it was anxiety from a life changing surprise condition. No more headaches and anxiety is much, much better. I have a bit of shortness of breath, even when sitting at times, but I have been able to jog at the gym. Just started again this week and went 30 minute today. Overall, not sure if anything is working, but I am trying to just trust my Doctor and listen to my body. Very tough emotionally, but adjusting.",

                    "I am 14 years old. I once had a moderate heart attack, and afterwards, my heart was constantly hammering away. Just sitting sown my pulse was 180 bpm. This led to enlarged heart and high blood pressure. I've been on this medicine for 3 years now, and it has probably saved my life from another heart attack. I recommend it to anyone with my problem.",
                    "I love this medicine! It has quite literally saved my life, and has made my life much more livable. Whenever I would do anything physical, my heart would beat so fast that I would frequently faint. I went to my cardiologist, and she gave me a holter monitor. She saw what I was talking about and gave me 50mg of Toprol-XL everyday. That was over 3 years ago, still on the same dosage, and it is wonderful. For the first few months, I was a little over tired, but that side effect quickly went away.",
                    "I had all the side effects listed after taking Lopressor for 3 days. they still persist after stopping meds 2 days ago. I was on very low dosage of 12.5 bid",
                    "I was put on 50 mg 3 X a day for rapid, arrhythmic heartbeat and high blood pressure, in November last year. At first, it made me very sleepy and dizzy, but I have gotten over that. It lowered my heart rate into the low 60's and 50's, occasionally upper 40's. Halving the dose has not changed this; I am hoping to be off it, or at least on an even lower dose, after my next cardiology appointment in June. I think it is making me forgetful. That has definitely been a problem since taking it, although I was a bit of an absent-minded professor before. It may also have helped lower my blood pressure, although I have made some diet and lifestyle changes that would affect that, also.",
                    "It stopped my PACs (Preatrial contractions ). I was on this med for 13 years. Over three years ago I started having increased muscle weakness, episodes of collapsing or falling without knowing why or even a warning that I was going to fall, extremely dry eyes (OTC eye drops were ineffective), severe muscle spasms, back pain, increased diarrhea, swelling in hands and feet, and pinpoint red spots on my skin. I looked up the side effects of this med and I had 24 of the adverse effects!! I had become so weak that I had to use 2 walking sticks, could hardly get in or out of bed, couldn't walk a 100 ft. I quit taking this med which I thoroughly believe was killing me. I have begun to feel much better regaining some of my muscle strength and have less back pain.",

I have stopped it and have an appointment with a dermatologist next week. Am scared to death that more is going to fall out! Anybody else experience bald spots?",
                    "I started taking this medicine in 2006. It works to take the pressure off my heart but it has caused me arthritis in my knees, hands and feet. Now I am in pain most of the time. My hands have developed arthritis in both thumbs, my feet have it in my toes. I tried another Astra Zeneca product called Atacand and it works better but is so expensive I can't afford to buy it.",

                    "Started taking metoprolol 8 years ago when I was hospitalized with a bout of of tachycardia that wouldn't go away for hours. Diagnosed with supraventricular tachycardia. Started out at 50mg, but had breakthroughs regularly, and went up to 100mg after a year. The medication works great to keep my heart rate and blood pressure down to normal levels, however, for the first month on the medication I constantly fell asleep during daily activity, and even now I maintain a sense of perpetual fatigue. Hard to lose weight, and depression creeps up often. Brain fog has slowed my ability to focus and react swiftly, which is frustrating. Still, the medication works so well to keep the heart episodes at bay that I haven't tried switching to a new medication.",
                    "I started taking 50mg of Toprol after being admitted to the hospital 6 days ago. I was told I had Mitral Valve Proplase and that I needed to take 50mg daily. It has helped in slowing my rapid heart beat down but the side effects have almost been unbearable. I have hardly slept, after taking the medicine I get short of breath and feel like I'm having an anxiety attack, and I take the medicine at bedtime. In the mornings when I wake for the first two to three hours I feel shaky, sweaty, nauseous, and extremely dizzy. My regular MD took me down to 25mg once daily and I still can't sleep and feel anxious. This is the first day taking 25mg so we'll see how I feel in the morning.",

Seems like the doctor care more about my heart rate (that is Lower than before so is working), but my blood pressure is ever the same, especially the night time is ever 8 around 85/140 (sometimes 150 or 160). I told this many times but he still thinking about the BPM..so at the end the BPM decrease but not the blood pressure so is working 50/50. PS I gained more than 10lb after using the metoprolol",

After a few days it felt like I hadn't taken the medicine. Toprol XL works great, and when i swapped back to the original I felt great again. There must be some difference in the release between the two. This med brings the BP into 120's over low to mid 70's range where I was reg 140's/90's. It also helps bpm from mid 90's down to upper 70's.",

The 50mg helped some but didn't keep it all the way down so then they tried me on 100mg which did the trick while I was moving but then when I wasn't it was dropping between 30-40beats so then they tried just 25mg 4 times a day and I was still having problems. It made me tired. I don't know if part of the problem is the doctors I have been seeing don't know what exactly is wrong with my heart and why it does this. Just yesterday I went to the ER after being in the hospital for a week and the doctor gave me propranolol 10mg 3 times a day which is helping. ",

This is to treat a high systolic pressure that was originally at 145 though my diastolic was at 75. Metoprolol had no effect for 3 weeks until my systolic dropped to 127 from about 137. At the end of that 3 weeks I increased metoprolol to 75 mg/day and by the end of the 6th week my systolic had climed to 134.

I am not wearing the Event Mintor to track my heart rate. It can get high, which can be scary because you don't know what could happen next. Some sleepless night and early morning wakes with anxiety.

I was put on 25 mg metoprolol ER to help the anxiety and PVCs- it helped immediately. I stayed on several years. I continued the dosage, and tried to stay/get in shape. I steadily gained weight, assumed it was age. Exercising felt impossible. After a year or so, I was also having afternoon hypotension upon standing quickly.

I was put on Toprol 50 mg extended release 60 days ago. Simultaneously, I had moderately high blood pressure. This drug is fantastic. In 61 days, I have not had one bad migraine.

Metoprolol seems to have controlled the arrhythmia's, although I will get one from time to time, but nothing of any duration.

I got prescribed Metoprolol Tartrate twice a day at first and it was a nightmare. It actually had like a reverse reaction on me and gave me constant flutters for a whole day. The doctor told me to take Magnesium twice a day with it and it would help and it definitely did. I eventually switched to the extended release, once a day, along with Magnesium and I couldn't be happier. I feel a lot more relaxed and normal.

I've never had a problem eating or swallowing in my life. The cardiologist I was seeing ignored me and said that's not a side effect. After two ERr trips w what felt like my throat closing was told to half the pill and wean off, because the drug was causing my issues.

Came off the opioids and find I have diarrhoea which seems to be the medication. I also developed vertigo 10 days ago. It's reduced in severity, but is still hanging around. Again seems likely to be the medication. Off all things meant to help me sleep, Metoprolol has made for some difficult sleepless nights, not something I've ever had before. At the same time it's controlling my heart rate and BP, and so far no more AF. My first week home from rehab I also suffered the anxious feeling, which was an unpleasant, crawly feeling in my chest.

A few hours before I am to take my next dose I begin to feel depressed, very cranky and angry and generally just awful. Once I take the medicine though those feelings tend to go away. It also upsets my stomach and I have had a mild loss of appetite. I have also noticed that some foods taste different. I am also having a problem staying asleep, but I seem to fall asleep easily.

I would wake at about 2 am and not be able to go back to sleep for several hours. Always tired, then would want to eat. I gained 20 pounds in a couple of months.

Also it gives me terrible nightmares, very violent. I'll wake up wondering how I could even have such terrible dreams. It also makes me tired.

I checked the brands of the former medications and the new and found they were different.

My heart throughout the day kept going into PAT (200+ BPM) No chest pain or anything, but pounding heart/fainting. I was started on Lopressor at that time .... 100mg BID and this is an amazing drug. Sure I still get the odd PAT episode once in a while, but the pounding and skipped beats are greatly reduced. No side effects at all. It actually has a calming effect. Been on Lopressor for 35 years. Great antiarrhythmic.",

I was exercising too. I stopped all meds and no change despite amping up weights and cardio/ no sugar etc.  Nothing. I stopped the metoprolol, and I drop 16 lbs in 1 1/2 months. It also causes depression and weight gain as a side effect. However it is effective in treating many other conditions. I do not condone stopping medications without consulting your physician.",

While in hospital, a very old fashioned heart doctor got me up to 250 mg/day. Lots of its side effects. Stopped it and went to ER. Went on Coreg. Gave me swelled legs. Back on low dose of metoprolol. Over time, up to 75 mg of metoprolol. Afib stopped mostly with ICD & 2 ablations. Last straw was numbness in feet and back shooting nerve pain.

If it laster longer than an hour I was transported to the ER where I was given Adenosine to restart my heart.

I wound up back in the hospital due to my heart rate being a low 32 beats per minute. The hospital treated it as a failure with the original stent and went back in to check the previous operation.

I've always had dreams and talked in my sleep but I think the medication makes it a little worse especially if you're taking it closer to bed time.

Bit foggy too and feel bit nauseous On 1/2 a pill a day  Will see if the side effects go away with time. If not will need to reconsider with the dr if the benefits outweigh the side effects",
                    "53 years old using this medicine for high blood pressure for around 6 years. It controls my blood pressure but I gained weight, specially on my legs, increased urination, no headache, no pain on my chest, breath well in general.

                    "I started toprol back in spring of 2004. I was switched from generic metoprolol, I was on that for borderline hbp. After 4 years on that I developed racing and very irregular heart beats the toprolxl did nothing. they got even worse. My doc took me off saying it was side effects of both drugs. I immediately improved. I still have them but not as bad. No cardiologist has told me what was wrong. I have a really bad back. In 2011 I got an epidural at T4-5 and that completely cured my rapid and irregular heartbeat for 3 years. There are 8 nerves besides the vagas nerve that go to the heart, they are part of the autonomic nervous system. They all come off the spine at C4-5 to T4-5 I have severe stenosis at all those levels.",

                    "I was prescribed metoprolol for tachycardia. I took it for about 6 weeks. I did feel better and not as fatigued, but suddenly I had severe depression. I felt like everything in my life was out of control even though mentally I knew it wasn't. I was sobbing hysterically all day and felt like I was losing my mind! I figured out the only change I'd made was taking metoprolol so I weaned myself off of it and the depression cleared right up. My doctor said he has a lot of patients on this medication and even though depression is a side effect none of them have had this issue. So I'm guessing it's not a common side effect but beware if you're just starting this.",
                    "It's hard for a patient to 'rate' a medication. I have an excellent cardiologist whose job that is. However, I know that Toprol comes with a tendency toward depression for many people, and for me, pre-existing depression has been mildly exacerbated. I also take amlodipine since May of last year, and this is a drug also known to cause/increase depression. I take several other anti-hypertensive drugs therefore it is not easy to tell which is causing what. Welcome to life post-cardiac bypass surgery--a life diminished, trust me, but at least--LIFE.",

I'm tired, and have a lot of trouble focusing on my work during the day, have a lot of restless nights of tossing and turning, and have now developed a rash under my arms. I think it also contributes to erectile dysfunction. I spoke to my cardiologist about all this today, and he's cutting my dose in half.

Next 2 episodes, 30 yr old, more severe, ER - negative tests. Next 5 episodes, 40-50 yr old increasing severity, ER. During the last ER visit, I heard about a new type of Doc, an electrocardiophysiologist. I wore a monitor for 6 weeks before it finally \"caught\" the SVT. I started on Toprol 50 mg per day. But then, I had an episode of severe low BP (80/40) - back to the ER. My new Doc said to split dose, take 25 mg AM & PM. No episodes past 20 years. I'm a happy camper !",

                    "//What is it?//Headache and migraine are different entities. Migraine is one of the most common and well characterized, but there are 14 broad categories that can be subdivided into more than 200 different forms. Migraine itself has about 20 different genres. In general, headaches are divided into two large groups: primary and secondary. Primary illnesses correspond to a disease, not reflecting other health problems and represent around 90% of the total. Secondary symptoms are symptoms of diseases of the nervous system or other organs of the human body. They can occur in cases of flu, alcohol poisoning or withdrawal, minor head trauma, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels) or a high blood pressure crisis. Migraine is a primary headache in which very intense episodes of pain occur interspersed with periods without symptoms. In general, it begins between the ages of 15 and 40, but it can appear in childhood or shortly after the first menstruation. If it appears for the first time after the age of 45, other causes must be excluded. Some of its characteristics are closely associated with the female reproductive cycle: higher prevalence after the first menstruation or during the menstrual period; occasional worsening due to taking birth control pills or hormone therapy; attenuation or disappearance during pregnancy or menopause. Before adolescence, migraines affect boys and girls equally. From then on, it is two to three times more common in females. It is estimated that 8% to 15% of individuals living in Western countries (including Portugal) suffer from this problem. The fact of reaching people in the productive phase implies large economic, social and family costs.//Symptoms//It appears recurrently, several times throughout life, but always with completely free intervals. If it occurs every day, it is probably overuse of painkillers or other medications. Drug abuse can convert a migraine into a chronic daily headache. There are people who preferably appear on the weekend. These crises can be precipitated by changes in sleep schedule, failure to eat breakfast, reduced stress or alcohol abuse. In these cases, it is important to consider a lifestyle change over the weekend. The symptoms are intense and often prevent work or study. The pain tends to be throbbing, worsening with physical exertion or head movements. In general, it affects only one side of the head, and is accompanied by nausea, vomiting, intolerance to light, noise and some smells. It is not mandatory that all of these elements are present simultaneously. And they can occur twice a week or just a few throughout a lifetime. During attacks, people seek a dark, quiet place to rest or fall asleep. An episode can last from a few hours to three days. Between attacks, there are usually no complaints. Some types of migraines may have more complex symptoms (with aura). These forms are less common, affecting around 15% of people with this problem, and include transient neurological symptoms, originating attributable to certain areas of the brain. The other signs are identical to those of migraine without aura. The most common auras are temporary vision disorders, in the form of loss of vision on one side of the visual field, blurred images, perception of bright points, geometric figures or bright zigzags. Other auras can be translated as tingling or numbness on one side of the face or one of the hands. There are people who have difficulty speaking or even temporary paralysis of their limbs, usually only on one side of the body. These changes last about 10 to 30 minutes and precede the pain. In children, migraines tend to be bilateral, less intense and of shorter duration. Vomiting and dark circles can be exuberant. Disturbances in sleep and meal schedules are common precipitating factors. Treating these crises is easier than in adults. Sleep usually gives good results. At these ages, the occipital location is not normal and, when present, requires a medical consultation. Likewise, the presence of headaches with morning vomiting or other unusual symptoms in very young children should be seen by a healthcare professional.//Causes//It is caused by a combination of brain processes: excitation/depression of cells, dilation of arteries and release of chemicals. People with migraine are more sensitive to certain stimuli, environmental or from their own body, that can trigger these brain processes. It is also thought that there is some genetic susceptibility. Some individuals can identify the signs of their attacks. The most common are cheese, chocolate, strawberries, seafood, wine, artificial sauces, changes in sleep patterns, stress, menstruation, fasting, physical exercise, and minor trauma. Others cannot identify them at all. People who drink coffee regularly may experience headaches when they stop this habit.//Diagnosis//The key to diagnosis lies in the clinical history, physical and neurological examination. Observation of the fundus is a very important part of these procedures. In some cases, it may be necessary to resort to computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to exclude other diseases.//Treatment//Migraines have no cure but can be controlled. There are medications and behaviors that can reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks. Symptomatic treatment, during acute periods, involves resting in a quiet, dark place. Pressure or cold can be applied to the area of \u200b\u200bpain. At this stage, analgesics, anti-inflammatories, antiemetics and triptans are very useful.//Prevention//People with migraines should create calendars that allow them to identify their symptoms and assess their impact on their quality of life. The first step in prevention is to identify and eliminate precipitating factors, whenever possible. In some cases, it is necessary to use daily medication to reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks, but there are no drugs specifically developed for their prevention. However, there are some drugs used in other contexts that have proven to be effective, such as beta-blockers, antidepressants or antiepileptics, and these should always be prescribed by a doctor.

                    "//What is it?//This is an increase in blood pressure above values \u200b\u200bconsidered normal. It occurs when there is excessive pressure of blood on the walls of the arteries during circulation. It can increase at certain times, due to physical or emotional exertion, and it is natural that, after these situations, its values \u200b\u200breturn to normal levels. This condition is only serious and causes health problems when it remains high for months, or when it increases suddenly. It is important to know that tension tends to increase with age. However, hypertension should not be considered normal in the elderly. As a rule, arterial hypertension is considered to be present when the maximum pressure is greater than or equal to 160 mmHge/or the minimum pressure is greater than or equal to 95 mmHge. High blood pressure is associated with coronary heart disease, stroke and heart failure and is the most common modifiable cardiovascular risk factor, which is why its treatment is essential in preventing these pathologies. Cardiovascular diseases are the cause of death for at least 34.1% of the Brazilian population, mainly as a consequence of stroke and coronary disease. It is estimated that the prevalence of high blood pressure in the Portuguese adult population is 42.1%, with only 39.0% of these patients taking antihypertensive drugs and only 11.2% being under control.//Symptoms//In the first few years, it does not cause any symptoms. Over time, blood pressure ends up damaging the blood vessels and the main organs of the body, such as the brain, heart and kidneys, causing headaches, dizziness, tinnitus and increased heart rate. The main diseases associated with high blood pressure are stroke, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, heart and kidney failure.//Causes//Around 90% of cases are related to lifestyle habits. Obesity is one of the important factors. Each pound of fat requires the formation of an additional 1.5 kilometers of small blood vessels to supply the excess adipose tissue. Increased blood pressure is required to pump blood through them. Therefore, being overweight by 20% or more increases the risk of hypertension by five times;;/ Excess salt consumption. It is known that high blood pressure is less frequent in populations where its consumption is low. Our body only needs 1/8 of a teaspoon of salt per day;;/ Tobacco is another cause to consider. Even just one cigarette can increase it for about 30 minutes. A pack-a-day smoker can, through smoking alone, cause an increase in blood pressure for 24 hours;;/ Around 5% to 15% of cases may be related to moderate alcohol consumption. On the other hand, one cup of coffee a day can cause an increase in blood pressure;;/ Physical inactivity and stress are also at its origin;;/ The remaining 10% of high blood pressure cases have organic causes, such as some hormonal changes, kidney or blood vessel diseases.//Diagnosis//It is important to remember that high blood pressure cannot be felt, it must be measured. In order to obtain correct values, it is important to rest in a sitting position for at least five minutes before measuring. You should use the same device and always measure on the same arm. The diagnosis of high blood pressure requires measuring an elevated blood pressure on three separate occasions over a period of a week or more. Once its existence has been confirmed, other tests must also be carried out to help understand its origin and/or the complications associated with it.//Treatment//Treatment depends on the severity of the condition. For example, people with moderate hypertension can control it by simply changing some lifestyle habits, such as reducing salt and alcohol intake, controlling their weight, exercising regularly and stopping smoking. There are several medications available for the treatment of high blood pressure that can be used alone or in combination. It is up to the doctor to decide which is the best treatment for each situation.//Prevention//Since most cases have their origin in lifestyle, it is important that it is healthy. All the recommendations mentioned in the treatment prevent the onset of this disease.

I work out 6 days a week and it doesn't make any sence to me. Going back to my doctor tomorrow to figure it out. I just don't see why all of a sudden it would make things 10x worse. I didn't take it today to see if it would help. I was able to exersice without my heart rate sky rocketing to ridiculous numbers. This is the first medication like this I have ever taken.

He sent me home to suffer with it. A couple of weeks ago I made an appt. with the clinic and the most wonderful nurse practioner started me on Metoprolol 25 mg/2x daily and \"I FEEL GREAT!\" I couldn't believe how my heart calmed down, my anxiety was relieved, I SLEPT BETTER b/c it stopped the night time AFIB attacks which constantly woke me up in the middle of the night and i just feel much more comfortable in my own skin...I actually cleaned the house without any huffing, puffing or the usual AFIB attack.

However, @ 25mg I still have bouts of high readings, so when I see my PCP this week, she might raise it to 50mg. I will say that I prefer to see a Cardiologist for this because I am terrified of exercising. Yes, I know exercise and weight loss can lower my bp to healthy levels, but I can't understand I can exert myself while having high bp.

I never even thought about side effects as being the problems I was experiencing; thought there was always something else that the Doctor's was overlooking. Now that I have read these comments, I suffer from most of the common ones; tiredness, weakness, trouble losing weight, strange dreams, increased sweating, difficulty breathing, etc. Have had numerous tests off and on for the last two years, and nothing is ever found. I have also since then started taking clonidine and amlodipine. Some of these symptoms are probably drug interactions. I noticed a chaotic heartbeat when clonidine was added to the medicines. It has gotten worse for the past two years.",

At times though I have spells that usually run less than a few minutes with a heart rate of around 190 plus and pain. My worst battle with this level lasted about 15 minutes. I take 50mg of Metoprolol 2 times a day on a regular basis but add another 50 if I have the biggies and that settles the heart rate down quickly. Luckily I have no side affects but would love to find something else that quickly slows the heart rate ... mainly to avoid the pain and spooky stuff that goes a;long with it. I've had 11 angioplasties and 10 stents since 1990 and am 70.",

I take blood pressure and pulse 2times/ day and it is averaging 107/71, pulse 63- working well. It took me a good 4 weeks to adapt to the tough side effects though. I felt very tired to the point of falling asleep during the day, was worn out if I walked to far or even stood too long, felt lightheadedness, nauseated, was afraid to drive. I'm glad I stuck it out, the side effects finally abated. Hang in there, the bad side effects can go away. For the record I'm a 69 year old woman, 5`4\" 128 lbs. I take the pill at night.",

My BP is very high in the morning, like 167/110, before I take my daily dosage of valsartan. Within 2 hours of taking it my BP hasn't improved, then at about 5 hours after I take my BP med my BP plummets to like 71/54, sometimes lower. I fall asleep without even realizing it when it happens & sleep for about half hour. BP readings, about 4 times daily, shows PVCs at all times with an infrequent no PVC reading. Not convinced this med is doing anything for me.",

Unlike another report posted here, I am sleeping better while taking the medication.

I had no side effects at ALL from this until the first week of June. Today is July 22nd. The first week of June, I was recovering from a sore throat and cough and then three weeks later, I realized that I was STILL hoarse and my voice was cracking. It is STILL like that as of today.

I still feel a little of that about 12 hours after I take it- I figure that is a slight \" withdrawal\" effect, it lasts about 30-45 min. & I don't have it every day. When I took the generic ( manufacturer, PAR) I felt on a roller coaster, up & down all day. The time release delivery feels to be much smoother with the brand name, toprol- I recommend it. All in all, it works well, keeps my heart in sinus rhythm, but it's a tough drug to have to take.",

Cardiologist found source of my chest pain is a narrowed subclavian artery.  The chest pain completely stopped within 24 hours. The only real side effect is difficulty sleeping if instructed to take it at night. I switched to taking it first thing in the morning and I now sleep like a baby. I give it a 9/10 solely for that side effect. I did feel very lethargic when I first took it, but that went away completely after 2 days or so once my body got used to the meds.

After this I went to a cardiologist who gave me 50 mg Metoprolol to take as needed. I am happy that i don't have to take it daily because it does make me sluggish on the very rare times that I do-I am pleased to have a solution when these events happen and my fears of dying suddenly from a heart episode have been drastically reduced.",

Halving the dose has not changed this; I am hoping to be off it, or at least on an even lower dose, after my next cardiology appointment in June. I think it is making me forgetful. That has definitely been a problem since taking it, although I was a bit of an absent-minded professor before.

The medication works great to keep my heart rate and blood pressure down to normal levels, however, for the first month on the medication I constantly fell asleep during daily activity, and even now I maintain a sense of perpetual fatigue. Hard to lose weight, and depression creeps up often. Brain fog has slowed my ability to focus and react swiftly, which is frustrating.

It made me tired. I don't know if part of the problem is the doctors I have been seeing don't know what exactly is wrong with my heart and why it does this.

I've never had a problem eating or swallowing in my life. The cardiologist I was seeing ignored me and said that's not a side effect. After two ERr trips w what felt like my throat closing was told to half the pill and wean off, because the drug was causing my issues. I took it for 3 weeks and have been off now now for 10 days but still can't eat. had an endoscopy and they found there is little to no pressure in esophagus & attribute this to the drug.

Came off the opioids and find I have diarrhoea which seems to be the medication. I also developed vertigo 10 days ago. It's reduced in severity, but is still hanging around. Again seems likely to be the medication. Off all things meant to help me sleep, Metoprolol has made for some difficult sleepless nights, not something I've ever had before. At the same time it's controlling my heart rate and BP, and so far no more AF. My first week home from rehab I also suffered the anxious feeling, which was an unpleasant, crawly feeling in my chest. It seems to work though.",

A few hours before I am to take my next dose I begin to feel depressed, very cranky and angry and generally just awful. Once I take the medicine though those feelings tend to go away. It also upsets my stomach and I have had a mild loss of appetite. I have also noticed that some foods taste different. I am also having a problem staying asleep, but I seem to fall asleep easily.

I checked the brands of the former medications and the new and found they were different.

I had suffered severe chest pain for two hours before going to the ER, which was stupid of me. I have been on Metoprolol Tartrate for 2.5 years now. 25 mg. twice daily. It seems to work fine, as my blood pressure is consistently around 116 over 64, and my heart rate is 54 BPM at last check-up two months ago. Before my heart attack, it was around 150 over 80, so a vast improvement there. I also am on a low dose (10 mg. daily) of Lisinopril, so that may help as well. The only side effect I am experiencing is severe exhaustion following a 10-hour shift at work. Age 57.",

Kept BP at home and was fine. Every time at the Doctor's it was like 150/90 never understood this. Last time was placed on Lisinopril, this kicked my butt, dizziness, ear ringing, dry cough. Said heck with it and found a Cardiologist. He took me off the Ace Inhibitor and put me on Norvasc 10mg, will see how it works.",

This med caused me to be quite tired/fatigued. In the beginning I was also dizzy but that eventually went away almost completely. The sleepiness has not gone away but it's manageable. The good it does for my heart outweighs the side effects for me.",

Everyone warned me about how tired I was going to be since this medication would literally be slowing my heart down but I've never experienced that. I don't sleep much and have insomnia so that could be why. I also have experienced crazy dreams and I sleep walk from time to time. I've always had dreams and talked in my sleep but I think the medication makes it a little worse especially if you're taking it closer to bed time. I do get a little light headed if I stand up quick and bend down but it's not bad. The benefit I get from this medication outweighs any of these insignificant side effects. I would recommend to push through any side effects and let the medication adapt to you!",

American doctors refuse to give me the prescription. I finally had to go to another country to obtain the prescrption.I absolutely hate the American medical system. I pay a fortune for insurance only for them to not care for me. I am discusted by our greedy, price fixed, non caring medical system.

I haven't felt this calm and comfortable in years! Doctors really need to stop assuming that anxiety is the diagnosis of everyone's problems. There's a bit of drowsiness and fatigue in the beginning but that goes away as your body gets used to it. I am very happy with this medication.",

I tried taking it in the morning, but it made me feel weird and heart felt heavy. I switched to night time. It does help me sleep. I was initially tired, but that wore off.

After 6yrs of SVT & metoprolol I was further diagnosed with AF. Dosage was increased from 25mg to 50-75mg per day.

I figured out the only change I'd made was taking metoprolol so I weaned myself off of it and the depression cleared right up.

                    "I am a 70 yr old RN. I started having episodes of near-fainting around 16 yr.old (actually fainted twice). I would go to the nurse & ask to lay down-which helped, but she thought I was faking. Next episode, 25 yr old - saw cardiologist, negative EKG, no treatment. Next 2 episodes, 30 yr old, more severe, ER - negative tests. Next 5 episodes, 40-50 yr old increasing severity, ER. During the last ER visit, I heard about a new type of Doc, an electrocardiophysiologist. I wore a monitor for 6 weeks before it finally \"caught\" the SVT. I started on Toprol 50 mg per day. But then, I had an episode of severe low BP (80/40) - back to the ER. My new Doc said to split dose, take 25 mg AM & PM. No episodes past 20 years. I'm a happy camper !",

                    "//What is it?//Headache and migraine are different entities. Migraine is one of the most common and well characterized, but there are 14 broad categories that can be subdivided into more than 200 different forms. Migraine itself has about 20 different genres. In general, headaches are divided into two large groups: primary and secondary. Primary illnesses correspond to a disease, not reflecting other health problems and represent around 90% of the total. Secondary symptoms are symptoms of diseases of the nervous system or other organs of the human body. They can occur in cases of flu, alcohol poisoning or withdrawal, minor head trauma, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels) or a high blood pressure crisis. Migraine is a primary headache in which very intense episodes of pain occur interspersed with periods without symptoms. In general, it begins between the ages of 15 and 40, but it can appear in childhood or shortly after the first menstruation. If it appears for the first time after the age of 45, other causes must be excluded. Some of its characteristics are closely associated with the female reproductive cycle: higher prevalence after the first menstruation or during the menstrual period; occasional worsening due to taking birth control pills or hormone therapy; attenuation or disappearance during pregnancy or menopause. Before adolescence, migraines affect boys and girls equally. From then on, it is two to three times more common in females. It is estimated that 8% to 15% of individuals living in Western countries (including Portugal) suffer from this problem. The fact of reaching people in the productive phase implies large economic, social and family costs.//Symptoms//It appears recurrently, several times throughout life, but always with completely free intervals. If it occurs every day, it is probably overuse of painkillers or other medications. Drug abuse can convert a migraine into a chronic daily headache. There are people who preferably appear on the weekend. These crises can be precipitated by changes in sleep schedule, failure to eat breakfast, reduced stress or alcohol abuse. In these cases, it is important to consider a lifestyle change over the weekend. The symptoms are intense and often prevent work or study. The pain tends to be throbbing, worsening with physical exertion or head movements. In general, it affects only one side of the head, and is accompanied by nausea, vomiting, intolerance to light, noise and some smells. It is not mandatory that all of these elements are present simultaneously. And they can occur twice a week or just a few throughout a lifetime. During attacks, people seek a dark, quiet place to rest or fall asleep. An episode can last from a few hours to three days. Between attacks, there are usually no complaints. Some types of migraines may have more complex symptoms (with aura). These forms are less common, affecting around 15% of people with this problem, and include transient neurological symptoms, originating attributable to certain areas of the brain. The other signs are identical to those of migraine without aura. The most common auras are temporary vision disorders, in the form of loss of vision on one side of the visual field, blurred images, perception of bright points, geometric figures or bright zigzags. Other auras can be translated as tingling or numbness on one side of the face or one of the hands. There are people who have difficulty speaking or even temporary paralysis of their limbs, usually only on one side of the body. These changes last about 10 to 30 minutes and precede the pain. In children, migraines tend to be bilateral, less intense and of shorter duration. Vomiting and dark circles can be exuberant. Disturbances in sleep and meal schedules are common precipitating factors. Treating these crises is easier than in adults. Sleep usually gives good results. At these ages, the occipital location is not normal and, when present, requires a medical consultation. Likewise, the presence of headaches with morning vomiting or other unusual symptoms in very young children should be seen by a healthcare professional.//Causes//It is caused by a combination of brain processes: excitation/depression of cells, dilation of arteries and release of chemicals. People with migraine are more sensitive to certain stimuli, environmental or from their own body, that can trigger these brain processes. It is also thought that there is some genetic susceptibility. Some individuals can identify the signs of their attacks. The most common are cheese, chocolate, strawberries, seafood, wine, artificial sauces, changes in sleep patterns, stress, menstruation, fasting, physical exercise, and minor trauma. Others cannot identify them at all. People who drink coffee regularly may experience headaches when they stop this habit.//Diagnosis//The key to diagnosis lies in the clinical history, physical and neurological examination. Observation of the fundus is a very important part of these procedures. In some cases, it may be necessary to resort to computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to exclude other diseases.//Treatment//Migraines have no cure but can be controlled. There are medications and behaviors that can reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks. Symptomatic treatment, during acute periods, involves resting in a quiet, dark place. Pressure or cold can be applied to the area of \u200b\u200bpain. At this stage, analgesics, anti-inflammatories, antiemetics and triptans are very useful.//Prevention//People with migraines should create calendars that allow them to identify their symptoms and assess their impact on their quality of life. The first step in prevention is to identify and eliminate precipitating factors, whenever possible. In some cases, it is necessary to use daily medication to reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks, but there are no drugs specifically developed for their prevention. However, there are some drugs used in other contexts that have proven to be effective, such as beta-blockers, antidepressants or antiepileptics, and these should always be prescribed by a doctor.

                    "//What is it?//This is an increase in blood pressure above values \u200b\u200bconsidered normal. It occurs when there is excessive pressure of blood on the walls of the arteries during circulation. It can increase at certain times, due to physical or emotional exertion, and it is natural that, after these situations, its values \u200b\u200breturn to normal levels. This condition is only serious and causes health problems when it remains high for months, or when it increases suddenly. It is important to know that tension tends to increase with age. However, hypertension should not be considered normal in the elderly. As a rule, arterial hypertension is considered to be present when the maximum pressure is greater than or equal to 160 mmHge/or the minimum pressure is greater than or equal to 95 mmHge. High blood pressure is associated with coronary heart disease, stroke and heart failure and is the most common modifiable cardiovascular risk factor, which is why its treatment is essential in preventing these pathologies. Cardiovascular diseases are the cause of death for at least 34.1% of the Brazilian population, mainly as a consequence of stroke and coronary disease. It is estimated that the prevalence of high blood pressure in the Portuguese adult population is 42.1%, with only 39.0% of these patients taking antihypertensive drugs and only 11.2% being under control.//Symptoms//In the first few years, it does not cause any symptoms. Over time, blood pressure ends up damaging the blood vessels and the main organs of the body, such as the brain, heart and kidneys, causing headaches, dizziness, tinnitus and increased heart rate. The main diseases associated with high blood pressure are stroke, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, heart and kidney failure.//Causes//Around 90% of cases are related to lifestyle habits. Obesity is one of the important factors. Each pound of fat requires the formation of an additional 1.5 kilometers of small blood vessels to supply the excess adipose tissue. Increased blood pressure is required to pump blood through them. Therefore, being overweight by 20% or more increases the risk of hypertension by five times;;/ Excess salt consumption. It is known that high blood pressure is less frequent in populations where its consumption is low. Our body only needs 1/8 of a teaspoon of salt per day;;/ Tobacco is another cause to consider. Even just one cigarette can increase it for about 30 minutes. A pack-a-day smoker can, through smoking alone, cause an increase in blood pressure for 24 hours;;/ Around 5% to 15% of cases may be related to moderate alcohol consumption. On the other hand, one cup of coffee a day can cause an increase in blood pressure;;/ Physical inactivity and stress are also at its origin;;/ The remaining 10% of high blood pressure cases have organic causes, such as some hormonal changes, kidney or blood vessel diseases.//Diagnosis//It is important to remember that high blood pressure cannot be felt, it must be measured. In order to obtain correct values, it is important to rest in a sitting position for at least five minutes before measuring. You should use the same device and always measure on the same arm. The diagnosis of high blood pressure requires measuring an elevated blood pressure on three separate occasions over a period of a week or more. Once its existence has been confirmed, other tests must also be carried out to help understand its origin and/or the complications associated with it.//Treatment//Treatment depends on the severity of the condition. For example, people with moderate hypertension can control it by simply changing some lifestyle habits, such as reducing salt and alcohol intake, controlling their weight, exercising regularly and stopping smoking. There are several medications available for the treatment of high blood pressure that can be used alone or in combination. It is up to the doctor to decide which is the best treatment for each situation.//Prevention//Since most cases have their origin in lifestyle, it is important that it is healthy. All the recommendations mentioned in the treatment prevent the onset of this disease.

The first month was great then on October 21st my resting heart rate went from 61 to 70 and when I walk it suddenly goes to 140 for no reason. I work out 6 days a week and it doesn't make any sence to me. Going back to my doctor tomorrow to figure it out. I just don't see why all of a sudden it would make things 10x worse. I didn't take it today to see if it would help. I was able to exersice without my heart rate sky rocketing to ridiculous numbers. This is the first medication like this I have ever taken. Plus the weight gain is ridiculous. I lost 15 lbs before starting this medication and less then 2 months I gained it all back.",

I take 25mg. in the morning, and 25mg. about 11 hours later. The medicine has stopped my PVC's, and also slows down my heart rate.

He sent me home to suffer with it. A couple of weeks ago I made an appt. with the clinic and the most wonderful nurse practioner started me on Metoprolol 25 mg/2x daily and \"I FEEL GREAT!\" I couldn't believe how my heart calmed down, my anxiety was relieved, I SLEPT BETTER b/c it stopped the night time AFIB attacks which constantly woke me up in the middle of the night and i just feel much more comfortable in my own skin...I actually cleaned the house without any huffing, puffing or the usual AFIB attack.

However, @ 25mg I still have bouts of high readings, so when I see my PCP this week, she might raise it to 50mg. I will say that I prefer to see a Cardiologist for this because I am terrified of exercising. Yes, I know exercise and weight loss can lower my bp to healthy levels, but I can't understand I can exert myself while having high bp. Shouldn't it first be controlled with meds first before exercising?",
                    "I have been taking Metoprolol 25mg once a day for 13 days. It has lowered my heart rate by about 30 beats a minute but I am always tired, get chest pain, headache and numbness. Little to no benefit in lowering my blood pressure (140/95's).",
                    "I have been on some form of metoprolol for seven years. It was actually my first prescribed medication at 28. I never even thought about side effects as being the problems I was experiencing; thought there was always something else that the Doctor's was overlooking. Now that I have read these comments, I suffer from most of the common ones; tiredness, weakness, trouble losing weight, strange dreams, increased sweating, difficulty breathing, etc. Have had numerous tests off and on for the last two years, and nothing is ever found. I have also since then started taking clonidine and amlodipine. Some of these symptoms are probably drug interactions. I noticed a chaotic heartbeat when clonidine was added to the medicines. It has gotten worse for the past two years.",

At times though I have spells that usually run less than a few minutes with a heart rate of around 190 plus and pain. My worst battle with this level lasted about 15 minutes. I take 50mg of Metoprolol 2 times a day on a regular basis but add another 50 if I have the biggies and that settles the heart rate down quickly. Luckily I have no side affects but would love to find something else that quickly slows the heart rate ... mainly to avoid the pain and spooky stuff that goes a;long with it.

I take blood pressure and pulse 2times/ day and it is averaging 107/71, pulse 63- working well. It took me a good 4 weeks to adapt to the tough side effects though. I felt very tired to the point of falling asleep during the day, was worn out if I walked to far or even stood too long, felt lightheadedness, nauseated, was afraid to drive. I'm glad I stuck it out, the side effects finally abated. Hang in there, the bad side effects can go away. For the record I'm a 69 year old woman, 5`4\" 128 lbs. I take the pill at night.",

Been taking for a year now & PVCs are still as often as they were. I see/feel no improvement. Taking at night & valsartan in a.m experiencing BP drops. My BP is very high in the morning, like 167/110, before I take my daily dosage of valsartan. Within 2 hours of taking it my BP hasn't improved, then at about 5 hours after I take my BP med my BP plummets to like 71/54, sometimes lower. I fall asleep without even realizing it when it happens & sleep for about half hour. BP readings, about 4 times daily, shows PVCs at all times with an infrequent no PVC reading.

My doctor prescribed 25 mg of metoprolol for me and I started taking it in February of this year (2015). My blood pressure was lowered from 140/90 to 125/82, so it DOES work in that respect. I had no side effects at ALL from this until the first week of June. Today is July 22nd. The first week of June, I was recovering from a sore throat and cough and then three weeks later, I realized that I was STILL hoarse and my voice was cracking. It is STILL like that as of today. Indeed, one of the rare side effects is hoarseness! I called my doctor today and he switched me to Amlopidine.",

This has happened to me quite a bit recently, using metroprolol succ ER 25 mg daily, for about 2 years now.

I still feel a little of that about 12 hours after I take it- I figure that is a slight \" withdrawal\" effect, it lasts about 30-45 min. & I don't have it every day. When I took the generic ( manufacturer, PAR) I felt on a roller coaster, up & down all day. The time release delivery feels to be much smoother with the brand name, toprol- I recommend it. All in all, it works well, keeps my heart in sinus rhythm, but it's a tough drug to have to take.",
                    "This drug has literally changed my life in a very short time. I was having horrible chest pains, with a mixture of general anxiety due to work/home stress. Cardiologist found source of my chest pain is a narrowed subclavian artery.  The chest pain completely stopped within 24 hours. The only real side effect is difficulty sleeping if instructed to take it at night. I switched to taking it first thing in the morning and I now sleep like a baby. I give it a 9/10 solely for that side effect. I did feel very lethargic when I first took it, but that went away completely after 2 days or so once my body got used to the meds.

I feel nervous having my natural rhythm manipulated but when it comes to the heart, I'll just do what they say. Had an attack of pericarditis 3 weeks ago and then Atrial fibrillation two days ago. I was told that this was normal after pericarditis. Metoprolol is recommended while heart recovers. ",

It does the job well, but the side affects are rough to handle sometimes.

Been on it for a year - the side effects are strange dreams (not scary...just strange) and exercise difficulties. My doctor recommended sticking with 80% of exercise target heart rate. If you're having side effects, give this medication a couple months to work. It will get better. Make sure your doctor monitors your triglycerides and blood sugar while on any beta blocker.

After this I went to a cardiologist who gave me 50 mg Metoprolol to take as needed. I am happy that i don't have to take it daily because it does make me sluggish on the very rare times that I do-I am pleased to have a solution when these events happen and my fears of dying suddenly from a heart episode have been drastically reduced.",

It lowered my b.p. by like 20 points/day, and I was fine for 2 days, but then had episodes of exhaustion to the point where I had to lie on the couch for hours to recover from simple housework like washing pots. Was also short of breath like I'd run 5 miles. Swallowing felt weird. Got disoriented while driving. It's a 9 on effectiveness, but can't tolerate the side effects. Am 63/F.",

The first month or so was tough as I had headaches, chest pains shortness of breath, etc. I think a large part of it was anxiety from a life changing surprise condition. No more headaches and anxiety is much, much better. I have a bit of shortness of breath, even when sitting at times, but I have been able to jog at the gym. Just started again this week and went 30 minute today. Overall, not sure if anything is working, but I am trying to just trust my Doctor and listen to my body.

I recommend it to anyone with my problem.",

Whenever I would do anything physical, my heart would beat so fast that I would frequently faint. I went to my cardiologist, and she gave me a holter monitor. She saw what I was talking about and gave me 50mg of Toprol-XL everyday. That was over 3 years ago, still on the same dosage, and it is wonderful. For the first few months, I was a little over tired, but that side effect quickly went away.",

At first, it made me very sleepy and dizzy, but I have gotten over that. It lowered my heart rate into the low 60's and 50's, occasionally upper 40's. Halving the dose has not changed this; I am hoping to be off it, or at least on an even lower dose, after my next cardiology appointment in June. I think it is making me forgetful. That has definitely been a problem since taking it, although I was a bit of an absent-minded professor before. It may also have helped lower my blood pressure, although I have made some diet and lifestyle changes that would affect that, also.",

I looked up the side effects of this med and I had 24 of the adverse effects!! I had become so weak that I had to use 2 walking sticks, could hardly get in or out of bed, couldn't walk a 100 ft.

Started out at 50mg, but had breakthroughs regularly, and went up to 100mg after a year. The medication works great to keep my heart rate and blood pressure down to normal levels, however, for the first month on the medication I constantly fell asleep during daily activity, and even now I maintain a sense of perpetual fatigue. Hard to lose weight, and depression creeps up often. Brain fog has slowed my ability to focus and react swiftly, which is frustrating. Still, the medication works so well to keep the heart episodes at bay that I haven't tried switching to a new medication.",

It has helped in slowing my rapid heart beat down but the side effects have almost been unbearable. I have hardly slept, after taking the medicine I get short of breath and feel like I'm having an anxiety attack, and I take the medicine at bedtime. In the mornings when I wake for the first two to three hours I feel shaky, sweaty, nauseous, and extremely dizzy. My regular MD took me down to 25mg once daily and I still can't sleep and feel anxious. This is the first day taking 25mg so we'll see how I feel in the morning.",

I told this many times but he still thinking about the BPM..so at the end the BPM decrease but not the blood pressure so is working 50/50. PS I gained more than 10lb after using the metoprolol",

After a few days it felt like I hadn't taken the medicine. Toprol XL works great, and when i swapped back to the original I felt great again. There must be some difference in the release between the two. This med brings the BP into 120's over low to mid 70's range where I was reg 140's/90's.

It made me tired. I don't know if part of the problem is the doctors I have been seeing don't know what exactly is wrong with my heart and why it does this.

I am not wearing the Event Mintor to track my heart rate. It can get high, which can be scary because you don't know what could happen next. Some sleepless night and early morning wakes with anxiety.

Also it gives me terrible nightmares, very violent. I'll wake up wondering how I could even have such terrible dreams. It also makes me tired. I've stopped it several times and each time the bad symptoms go away completely in about 2 days. I'm going to have to stop taking it for good, the nightmares are just too terrible.",

Suddenly my blood pressure jumped and my heart was beating erratically, chest pains (which I've never had), and I was constantly worn out. I checked the brands of the former medications and the new and found they were different. I switched back to the old meds at the new dosage for a couple of days and within 1 day my blood pressure dropped 20 points and I felt back to normal.

They scared me which just increased my anxiety. Finally my dr said I had slight tachycardia, my resting heart rate was usually around 100bpm and prescribed me metoprolol 50mg twice a day. The first week i hated this medicine. Swore it made me feel 'just not right'. I believe it was from reading negative reviews. After a couple weeks, palps gone, rating heart rate a around 60bpm.

I pay a fortune for insurance only for them to not care for me. I am discusted by our greedy, price fixed, non caring medical system. Why can we not get rid of our awful, overpriced, ineffective medical system? Big pharma bribes physicians with fancy coventions.",
                    "I started having really bad tachycardia episodes and my primary doctor tried to convince me it was anxiety. After lots of tests and wearing a heart monitor for a month my cardiologist said I had Supraventricular Tachycardia and I was put on metoprolol 12.5mg twice a day. It's great! I haven't felt this calm and comfortable in years! Doctors really need to stop assuming that anxiety is the diagnosis of everyone's problems. There's a bit of drowsiness and fatigue in the beginning but that goes away as your body gets used to it. I am very happy with this medication.",
                    "To those who commented that they cut their dose of XL or ER or CR, you cannot cut extended release or controlled release in half. This is dangerous.

I came back in a month and was up to 233. No change in diet exercise routine, or anything. Came back a month later. She weighed me again and I was up to 238. BP was hardly changed: 155/98.

I held a big bag of apples in each hand at the orchard for about 10 minutes and on the way home noticed more \"bruises\" appearing on both arms. The same thing happened that evening while shopping - I was holding a stack of clothes over my arm and red spots and streaks started appearing on the arm I was holding the clothes over. I have quit taking them until I can contact my doctor.",

I tried taking it in the morning, but it made me feel weird and heart felt heavy. I switched to night time. It does help me sleep. I was initially tired, but that wore off.

I figured out the only change I'd made was taking metoprolol so I weaned myself off of it and the depression cleared right up. My doctor said he has a lot of patients on this medication and even though depression is a side effect none of them have had this issue.

                    "//What is it?//Headache and migraine are different entities. Migraine is one of the most common and well characterized, but there are 14 broad categories that can be subdivided into more than 200 different forms. Migraine itself has about 20 different genres. In general, headaches are divided into two large groups: primary and secondary. Primary illnesses correspond to a disease, not reflecting other health problems and represent around 90% of the total. Secondary symptoms are symptoms of diseases of the nervous system or other organs of the human body. They can occur in cases of flu, alcohol poisoning or withdrawal, minor head trauma, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels) or a high blood pressure crisis. Migraine is a primary headache in which very intense episodes of pain occur interspersed with periods without symptoms. In general, it begins between the ages of 15 and 40, but it can appear in childhood or shortly after the first menstruation. If it appears for the first time after the age of 45, other causes must be excluded. Some of its characteristics are closely associated with the female reproductive cycle: higher prevalence after the first menstruation or during the menstrual period; occasional worsening due to taking birth control pills or hormone therapy; attenuation or disappearance during pregnancy or menopause. Before adolescence, migraines affect boys and girls equally. From then on, it is two to three times more common in females. It is estimated that 8% to 15% of individuals living in Western countries (including Portugal) suffer from this problem. The fact of reaching people in the productive phase implies large economic, social and family costs.//Symptoms//It appears recurrently, several times throughout life, but always with completely free intervals. If it occurs every day, it is probably overuse of painkillers or other medications. Drug abuse can convert a migraine into a chronic daily headache. There are people who preferably appear on the weekend. These crises can be precipitated by changes in sleep schedule, failure to eat breakfast, reduced stress or alcohol abuse. In these cases, it is important to consider a lifestyle change over the weekend. The symptoms are intense and often prevent work or study. The pain tends to be throbbing, worsening with physical exertion or head movements. In general, it affects only one side of the head, and is accompanied by nausea, vomiting, intolerance to light, noise and some smells. It is not mandatory that all of these elements are present simultaneously. And they can occur twice a week or just a few throughout a lifetime. During attacks, people seek a dark, quiet place to rest or fall asleep. An episode can last from a few hours to three days. Between attacks, there are usually no complaints. Some types of migraines may have more complex symptoms (with aura). These forms are less common, affecting around 15% of people with this problem, and include transient neurological symptoms, originating attributable to certain areas of the brain. The other signs are identical to those of migraine without aura. The most common auras are temporary vision disorders, in the form of loss of vision on one side of the visual field, blurred images, perception of bright points, geometric figures or bright zigzags. Other auras can be translated as tingling or numbness on one side of the face or one of the hands. There are people who have difficulty speaking or even temporary paralysis of their limbs, usually only on one side of the body. These changes last about 10 to 30 minutes and precede the pain. In children, migraines tend to be bilateral, less intense and of shorter duration. Vomiting and dark circles can be exuberant. Disturbances in sleep and meal schedules are common precipitating factors. Treating these crises is easier than in adults. Sleep usually gives good results. At these ages, the occipital location is not normal and, when present, requires a medical consultation. Likewise, the presence of headaches with morning vomiting or other unusual symptoms in very young children should be seen by a healthcare professional.//Causes//It is caused by a combination of brain processes: excitation/depression of cells, dilation of arteries and release of chemicals. People with migraine are more sensitive to certain stimuli, environmental or from their own body, that can trigger these brain processes. It is also thought that there is some genetic susceptibility. Some individuals can identify the signs of their attacks. The most common are cheese, chocolate, strawberries, seafood, wine, artificial sauces, changes in sleep patterns, stress, menstruation, fasting, physical exercise, and minor trauma. Others cannot identify them at all. People who drink coffee regularly may experience headaches when they stop this habit.//Diagnosis//The key to diagnosis lies in the clinical history, physical and neurological examination. Observation of the fundus is a very important part of these procedures. In some cases, it may be necessary to resort to computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to exclude other diseases.//Treatment//Migraines have no cure but can be controlled. There are medications and behaviors that can reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks. Symptomatic treatment, during acute periods, involves resting in a quiet, dark place. Pressure or cold can be applied to the area of \u200b\u200bpain. At this stage, analgesics, anti-inflammatories, antiemetics and triptans are very useful.//Prevention//People with migraines should create calendars that allow them to identify their symptoms and assess their impact on their quality of life. The first step in prevention is to identify and eliminate precipitating factors, whenever possible. In some cases, it is necessary to use daily medication to reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks, but there are no drugs specifically developed for their prevention. However, there are some drugs used in other contexts that have proven to be effective, such as beta-blockers, antidepressants or antiepileptics, and these should always be prescribed by a doctor.

                    "//What is it?//This is an increase in blood pressure above values \u200b\u200bconsidered normal. It occurs when there is excessive pressure of blood on the walls of the arteries during circulation. It can increase at certain times, due to physical or emotional exertion, and it is natural that, after these situations, its values \u200b\u200breturn to normal levels. This condition is only serious and causes health problems when it remains high for months, or when it increases suddenly. It is important to know that tension tends to increase with age. However, hypertension should not be considered normal in the elderly. As a rule, arterial hypertension is considered to be present when the maximum pressure is greater than or equal to 160 mmHge/or the minimum pressure is greater than or equal to 95 mmHge. High blood pressure is associated with coronary heart disease, stroke and heart failure and is the most common modifiable cardiovascular risk factor, which is why its treatment is essential in preventing these pathologies. Cardiovascular diseases are the cause of death for at least 34.1% of the Brazilian population, mainly as a consequence of stroke and coronary disease. It is estimated that the prevalence of high blood pressure in the Portuguese adult population is 42.1%, with only 39.0% of these patients taking antihypertensive drugs and only 11.2% being under control.//Symptoms//In the first few years, it does not cause any symptoms. Over time, blood pressure ends up damaging the blood vessels and the main organs of the body, such as the brain, heart and kidneys, causing headaches, dizziness, tinnitus and increased heart rate. The main diseases associated with high blood pressure are stroke, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, heart and kidney failure.//Causes//Around 90% of cases are related to lifestyle habits. Obesity is one of the important factors. Each pound of fat requires the formation of an additional 1.5 kilometers of small blood vessels to supply the excess adipose tissue. Increased blood pressure is required to pump blood through them. Therefore, being overweight by 20% or more increases the risk of hypertension by five times;;/ Excess salt consumption. It is known that high blood pressure is less frequent in populations where its consumption is low. Our body only needs 1/8 of a teaspoon of salt per day;;/ Tobacco is another cause to consider. Even just one cigarette can increase it for about 30 minutes. A pack-a-day smoker can, through smoking alone, cause an increase in blood pressure for 24 hours;;/ Around 5% to 15% of cases may be related to moderate alcohol consumption. On the other hand, one cup of coffee a day can cause an increase in blood pressure;;/ Physical inactivity and stress are also at its origin;;/ The remaining 10% of high blood pressure cases have organic causes, such as some hormonal changes, kidney or blood vessel diseases.//Diagnosis//It is important to remember that high blood pressure cannot be felt, it must be measured. In order to obtain correct values, it is important to rest in a sitting position for at least five minutes before measuring. You should use the same device and always measure on the same arm. The diagnosis of high blood pressure requires measuring an elevated blood pressure on three separate occasions over a period of a week or more. Once its existence has been confirmed, other tests must also be carried out to help understand its origin and/or the complications associated with it.//Treatment//Treatment depends on the severity of the condition. For example, people with moderate hypertension can control it by simply changing some lifestyle habits, such as reducing salt and alcohol intake, controlling their weight, exercising regularly and stopping smoking. There are several medications available for the treatment of high blood pressure that can be used alone or in combination. It is up to the doctor to decide which is the best treatment for each situation.//Prevention//Since most cases have their origin in lifestyle, it is important that it is healthy. All the recommendations mentioned in the treatment prevent the onset of this disease.

                    "I have been on metoprolol er 12.5mg since September 20th. The first month was great then on October 21st my resting heart rate went from 61 to 70 and when I walk it suddenly goes to 140 for no reason. I work out 6 days a week and it doesn't make any sence to me. Going back to my doctor tomorrow to figure it out. I just don't see why all of a sudden it would make things 10x worse. I didn't take it today to see if it would help. I was able to exersice without my heart rate sky rocketing to ridiculous numbers. This is the first medication like this I have ever taken. Plus the weight gain is ridiculous. I lost 15 lbs before starting this medication and less then 2 months I gained it all back.",
                    "I took Lopressor for 24 years it worked very well in lowering my blood pressure and even calming my anxiety but lately it doesn't work on me very well as before, I guess the doctor will change it.",
                    "I'm a 72 year 'young' female, and I have been taking Metoprolol Tartrate for 7 years, for PVC's Premature Ventricular Contractions of my heart, and also for Tachycardia. I take 25mg. in the morning, and 25mg. about 11 hours later. The medicine has stopped my PVC's, and also slows down my heart rate. When I first started taking Metoprorlol Tartrate, it made me very tired, but after about 2 weeks, my body got used to it, and I was fine.",
                    "I have been taking Toprol XL for about 2 years. My doctor has now put me on 200mg twice a day, total 400mg a day, this had to be approve by my insurance company and it was. This is working for me, no side effects and my blood pressure is steady at 114/70.",
                    "I was diagnosed with AFIB in 2012 at the age of 43, long sad frustrating story cut short, the doctor said there was nothing he could do about it. He sent me home to suffer with it. A couple of weeks ago I made an appt. with the clinic and the most wonderful nurse practioner started me on Metoprolol 25 mg/2x daily and \"I FEEL GREAT!\" I couldn't believe how my heart calmed down, my anxiety was relieved, I SLEPT BETTER b/c it stopped the night time AFIB attacks which constantly woke me up in the middle of the night and i just feel much more comfortable in my own skin...I actually cleaned the house without any huffing, puffing or the usual AFIB attack. I agree that it makes me drowsy which is becoming less severe I LOVE IT! :)",
                    "I'm giving this med a 7 so far just because I haven't had any real side effects with it, like I did with another bp med (can't remember the name). However, @ 25mg I still have bouts of high readings, so when I see my PCP this week, she might raise it to 50mg. I will say that I prefer to see a Cardiologist for this because I am terrified of exercising. Yes, I know exercise and weight loss can lower my bp to healthy levels, but I can't understand I can exert myself while having high bp. Shouldn't it first be controlled with meds first before exercising?",
                    "I have been taking Metoprolol 25mg once a day for 13 days. It has lowered my heart rate by about 30 beats a minute but I am always tired, get chest pain, headache and numbness. Little to no benefit in lowering my blood pressure (140/95's).",
                    "I have been on some form of metoprolol for seven years. It was actually my first prescribed medication at 28. I never even thought about side effects as being the problems I was experiencing; thought there was always something else that the Doctor's was overlooking. Now that I have read these comments, I suffer from most of the common ones; tiredness, weakness, trouble losing weight, strange dreams, increased sweating, difficulty breathing, etc. Have had numerous tests off and on for the last two years, and nothing is ever found. I have also since then started taking clonidine and amlodipine. Some of these symptoms are probably drug interactions. I noticed a chaotic heartbeat when clonidine was added to the medicines. It has gotten worse for the past two years.",
                    "I have had constant afib for over 2 years though mostly tolerable. At times though I have spells that usually run less than a few minutes with a heart rate of around 190 plus and pain. My worst battle with this level lasted about 15 minutes. I take 50mg of Metoprolol 2 times a day on a regular basis but add another 50 if I have the biggies and that settles the heart rate down quickly. Luckily I have no side affects but would love to find something else that quickly slows the heart rate ... mainly to avoid the pain and spooky stuff that goes a;long with it. I've had 11 angioplasties and 10 stents since 1990 and am 70.",
                    "I started metaprolol 12.5 mg once a day 6 weeks ago after having an electrical cardioconversion for a rapid, irregular heartbeat. I take blood pressure and pulse 2times/ day and it is averaging 107/71, pulse 63- working well. It took me a good 4 weeks to adapt to the tough side effects though. I felt very tired to the point of falling asleep during the day, was worn out if I walked to far or even stood too long, felt lightheadedness, nauseated, was afraid to drive. I'm glad I stuck it out, the side effects finally abated. Hang in there, the bad side effects can go away. For the record I'm a 69 year old woman, 5`4\" 128 lbs. I take the pill at night.",
                    "I had terrible symptoms of MVP that landed me in the hospital for 5 days. I started taking this medicine 25 mg a day and my symptoms are so much better. I used to have shortness of breath, palpitations, chest pain, and weakness but it's so much better now. I only occasionally have some palpitations but nothing like before. Metoprolol works great!",

Been taking for a year now & PVCs are still as often as they were. I see/feel no improvement. Taking at night & valsartan in a.m experiencing BP drops. My BP is very high in the morning, like 167/110, before I take my daily dosage of valsartan. Within 2 hours of taking it my BP hasn't improved, then at about 5 hours after I take my BP med my BP plummets to like 71/54, sometimes lower. I fall asleep without even realizing it when it happens & sleep for about half hour. BP readings, about 4 times daily, shows PVCs at all times with an infrequent no PVC reading. Not convinced this med is doing anything for me.",

Unlike another report posted here, I am sleeping better while taking the medication. The only two side effects I've experienced are shakiness and nervousness when I miss a dose by even a few hours and vague aural hallucinations (hearing things) while on the verge of falling asleep. I've seen the hallucinations reported by other toprol users on other sites.",

My doctor prescribed 25 mg of metoprolol for me and I started taking it in February of this year (2015). My blood pressure was lowered from 140/90 to 125/82, so it DOES work in that respect. I had no side effects at ALL from this until the first week of June. Today is July 22nd. The first week of June, I was recovering from a sore throat and cough and then three weeks later, I realized that I was STILL hoarse and my voice was cracking. It is STILL like that as of today. Indeed, one of the rare side effects is hoarseness! I called my doctor today and he switched me to Amlopidine.",
                    "Reading the mixed reviews here, the first thing that jumped out was people have problems swallowing. This has happened to me quite a bit recently, using metroprolol succ ER 25 mg daily, for about 2 years now. I did have great success in reducing my pulse (130 resting pulse for 20 years, adjust to 90 now). Overall I was happy with it, but now somewhat concerned with long term use.",

So far I've only had two mild headaches that were easily treated with two ibuprofen. I feel like I have my life back. I highly recommend it.",

                    "I recently switched from metaprolol, 1/2 of 25 mg/ day to brand name Toprol xl & have found the negative side effects- fatigue, too low blood pressure, dizziness, nausea- to be much less. I still feel a little of that about 12 hours after I take it- I figure that is a slight \" withdrawal\" effect, it lasts about 30-45 min. & I don't have it every day. When I took the generic ( manufacturer, PAR) I felt on a roller coaster, up & down all day. The time release delivery feels to be much smoother with the brand name, toprol- I recommend it. All in all, it works well, keeps my heart in sinus rhythm, but it's a tough drug to have to take.",
                    "This drug has literally changed my life in a very short time. I was having horrible chest pains, with a mixture of general anxiety due to work/home stress. Cardiologist found source of my chest pain is a narrowed subclavian artery.  The chest pain completely stopped within 24 hours. The only real side effect is difficulty sleeping if instructed to take it at night. I switched to taking it first thing in the morning and I now sleep like a baby. I give it a 9/10 solely for that side effect. I did feel very lethargic when I first took it, but that went away completely after 2 days or so once my body got used to the meds. I feel much more calm than I did before so this medication has really changed the way I feel. improvement is noticeable",

I feel nervous having my natural rhythm manipulated but when it comes to the heart, I'll just do what they say. Had an attack of pericarditis 3 weeks ago and then Atrial fibrillation two days ago. I was told that this was normal after pericarditis. Metoprolol is recommended while heart recovers. ",

It does the job well, but the side affects are rough to handle sometimes. Such as dizziness, sleepless nights, daytime drowsiness, forgetfulness, and depression but, i'm still coping after about four years and i guess on for the rest of my life. But if i can manage after three brother suicides than so can you.",
                    "Elevated blood pressure and increased heart rate due to long term undertreated high blood pressure. Metoprolol worked wonders. Been on it for a year - the side effects are strange dreams (not scary...just strange) and exercise difficulties. My doctor recommended sticking with 80% of exercise target heart rate. If you're having side effects, give this medication a couple months to work. It will get better. Make sure your doctor monitors your triglycerides and blood sugar while on any beta blocker. My triglycerides shot through the roof, but now under control with fish oil. ",

After this I went to a cardiologist who gave me 50 mg Metoprolol to take as needed. I am happy that i don't have to take it daily because it does make me sluggish on the very rare times that I do-I am pleased to have a solution when these events happen and my fears of dying suddenly from a heart episode have been drastically reduced.",

It lowered my b.p. by like 20 points/day, and I was fine for 2 days, but then had episodes of exhaustion to the point where I had to lie on the couch for hours to recover from simple housework like washing pots. Was also short of breath like I'd run 5 miles. Swallowing felt weird. Got disoriented while driving. It's a 9 on effectiveness, but can't tolerate the side effects. Am 63/F.",

The first month or so was tough as I had headaches, chest pains shortness of breath, etc. I think a large part of it was anxiety from a life changing surprise condition. No more headaches and anxiety is much, much better. I have a bit of shortness of breath, even when sitting at times, but I have been able to jog at the gym. Just started again this week and went 30 minute today. Overall, not sure if anything is working, but I am trying to just trust my Doctor and listen to my body.

This led to enlarged heart and high blood pressure. I've been on this medicine for 3 years now, and it has probably saved my life from another heart attack. I recommend it to anyone with my problem.",
                    "I love this medicine! It has quite literally saved my life, and has made my life much more livable. Whenever I would do anything physical, my heart would beat so fast that I would frequently faint. I went to my cardiologist, and she gave me a holter monitor. She saw what I was talking about and gave me 50mg of Toprol-XL everyday. That was over 3 years ago, still on the same dosage, and it is wonderful. For the first few months, I was a little over tired, but that side effect quickly went away.",

                    "I was put on 50 mg 3 X a day for rapid, arrhythmic heartbeat and high blood pressure, in November last year. At first, it made me very sleepy and dizzy, but I have gotten over that. It lowered my heart rate into the low 60's and 50's, occasionally upper 40's. Halving the dose has not changed this; I am hoping to be off it, or at least on an even lower dose, after my next cardiology appointment in June. I think it is making me forgetful. That has definitely been a problem since taking it, although I was a bit of an absent-minded professor before. It may also have helped lower my blood pressure, although I have made some diet and lifestyle changes that would affect that, also.",
                    "It stopped my PACs (Preatrial contractions ). I was on this med for 13 years. Over three years ago I started having increased muscle weakness, episodes of collapsing or falling without knowing why or even a warning that I was going to fall, extremely dry eyes (OTC eye drops were ineffective), severe muscle spasms, back pain, increased diarrhea, swelling in hands and feet, and pinpoint red spots on my skin. I looked up the side effects of this med and I had 24 of the adverse effects!! I had become so weak that I had to use 2 walking sticks, could hardly get in or out of bed, couldn't walk a 100 ft. I quit taking this med which I thoroughly believe was killing me. I have begun to feel much better regaining some of my muscle strength and have less back pain.",

                    "I started taking this medicine in 2006. It works to take the pressure off my heart but it has caused me arthritis in my knees, hands and feet. Now I am in pain most of the time. My hands have developed arthritis in both thumbs, my feet have it in my toes. I tried another Astra Zeneca product called Atacand and it works better but is so expensive I can't afford to buy it.",

Started out at 50mg, but had breakthroughs regularly, and went up to 100mg after a year. The medication works great to keep my heart rate and blood pressure down to normal levels, however, for the first month on the medication I constantly fell asleep during daily activity, and even now I maintain a sense of perpetual fatigue. Hard to lose weight, and depression creeps up often. Brain fog has slowed my ability to focus and react swiftly, which is frustrating. Still, the medication works so well to keep the heart episodes at bay that I haven't tried switching to a new medication.",

It has helped in slowing my rapid heart beat down but the side effects have almost been unbearable. I have hardly slept, after taking the medicine I get short of breath and feel like I'm having an anxiety attack, and I take the medicine at bedtime. In the mornings when I wake for the first two to three hours I feel shaky, sweaty, nauseous, and extremely dizzy. My regular MD took me down to 25mg once daily and I still can't sleep and feel anxious. This is the first day taking 25mg so we'll see how I feel in the morning.",

I told this many times but he still thinking about the BPM..so at the end the BPM decrease but not the blood pressure so is working 50/50. PS I gained more than 10lb after using the metoprolol",

There must be some difference in the release between the two. This med brings the BP into 120's over low to mid 70's range where I was reg 140's/90's.

It made me tired. I don't know if part of the problem is the doctors I have been seeing don't know what exactly is wrong with my heart and why it does this.

I informed my PA of this after my last crisis and she is looking into prescribing a different product (one given at the hospital) but this after a few years on Toprol. I figure that without the change from this medicine I don't stand a chance of reversing my diabetic condition.",

My blood pressure dropped (wasn't high in the first place) and my heart rate dropped to the mid/low 40's. I was also very light-headed, had low energy, some shortness of breath and sometimes nausea.

However, I had soul-crushing fatigue and a foggy brain and couldn't get thru the day, it seriously affected my life. I had trouble regulating my body temperature and was pretty miserable. My heart beat out of my chest when I laid on my left side. I thought these side effects were the result of an acute illness that ended w/ me having HBP, but it turns out they were from Metoprolol. My doc switched me to Bystolic 5mg and I felt better within a couple days! Metoprolol worked to lower my BP, but I didn't like the side effects.",

It takes an act of congress to get an erection, and even when I do somehow get erections, they are very brief and not what it once was. Almost like it has shrunk.

I started taking 25 milligrams of Metoprolol twice a day and a lose dose aspirin once a day. I had another episode last September. They gave me Fleccinide (spelling?) and it reversed on its own. The first time, I had very stressful day, drank huge amount of coffee, and didn't sleep well the night before. The second time, I mowed both the front and back yard and did five minutes on stationary bike. Other than that, the metoprolol has controlled it and I try to avoid stress, sleep well, and don't mow both yards at once. The only side effect I have is fatigue.",

I was constantly under stress, with my body flooded with stress hormones, strong heart-beating etc. Metoprolol helped me a lot in reducing my stress level and adjusting to a more relaxed attitude at work. It calms you down by reducing your heart beat etc. From this perspective it was helpful for getting on a healthier path. It also helped reducing the migraines, even though they stayed. Over the longer run, you need to take higher dosage to achieve a similar effect. at some stage I had the impression the drug didn't help much any longer, so stopped.",

My heart throughout the day kept going into PAT (200+ BPM) No chest pain or anything, but pounding heart/fainting. I was started on Lopressor at that time .... 100mg BID and this is an amazing drug.

I was exercising too. I stopped all meds and no change despite amping up weights and cardio/ no sugar etc.  Nothing. I stopped the metoprolol, and I drop 16 lbs in 1 1/2 months.

While in hospital, a very old fashioned heart doctor got me up to 250 mg/day. Lots of its side effects. Stopped it and went to ER. Went on Coreg. Gave me swelled legs. Back on low dose of metoprolol. Over time, up to 75 mg of metoprolol. Afib stopped mostly with ICD & 2 ablations. Last straw was numbness in feet and back shooting nerve pain.

Before my heart attack, it was around 150 over 80, so a vast improvement there. I also am on a low dose (10 mg. daily) of Lisinopril, so that may help as well.

Lately however, my heart rate has fallen to low 40's taking only 10 mg and my doctor has taken me off it completely. I feel very shaky now. My hands visibly tremble and I notice I get more of an adrenaline rush when under pressure or fear.

I was having 10-15 severe migraines per month, causing frequent ER visits, stroke level high blood pressure and severe performance anxiety. Immediately after beginning this medicine I have few headaches and they are rarely severe. My blood pressure is down and my anxiety is significantly improved.  I have no problems exercising.

No problems getting the heart rate up in exercise (still quite the opposite actually! I can reach 180bpm after 5mins) Unfortunately it didnt stop the progression to AF. After 6yrs of SVT & metoprolol I was further diagnosed with AF. Dosage was increased from 25mg to 50-75mg per day. Starting to work a little better now in preventing rapid AF however I still get slow AF.

I figured out the only change I'd made was taking metoprolol so I weaned myself off of it and the depression cleared right up. My doctor said he has a lot of patients on this medication and even though depression is a side effect none of them have had this issue. So I'm guessing it's not a common side effect but beware if you're just starting this.",

                    "//What is it?//Headache and migraine are different entities. Migraine is one of the most common and well characterized, but there are 14 broad categories that can be subdivided into more than 200 different forms. Migraine itself has about 20 different genres. In general, headaches are divided into two large groups: primary and secondary. Primary illnesses correspond to a disease, not reflecting other health problems and represent around 90% of the total. Secondary symptoms are symptoms of diseases of the nervous system or other organs of the human body. They can occur in cases of flu, alcohol poisoning or withdrawal, minor head trauma, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels) or a high blood pressure crisis. Migraine is a primary headache in which very intense episodes of pain occur interspersed with periods without symptoms. In general, it begins between the ages of 15 and 40, but it can appear in childhood or shortly after the first menstruation. If it appears for the first time after the age of 45, other causes must be excluded. Some of its characteristics are closely associated with the female reproductive cycle: higher prevalence after the first menstruation or during the menstrual period; occasional worsening due to taking birth control pills or hormone therapy; attenuation or disappearance during pregnancy or menopause. Before adolescence, migraines affect boys and girls equally. From then on, it is two to three times more common in females. It is estimated that 8% to 15% of individuals living in Western countries (including Portugal) suffer from this problem. The fact of reaching people in the productive phase implies large economic, social and family costs.//Symptoms//It appears recurrently, several times throughout life, but always with completely free intervals. If it occurs every day, it is probably overuse of painkillers or other medications. Drug abuse can convert a migraine into a chronic daily headache. There are people who preferably appear on the weekend. These crises can be precipitated by changes in sleep schedule, failure to eat breakfast, reduced stress or alcohol abuse. In these cases, it is important to consider a lifestyle change over the weekend. The symptoms are intense and often prevent work or study. The pain tends to be throbbing, worsening with physical exertion or head movements. In general, it affects only one side of the head, and is accompanied by nausea, vomiting, intolerance to light, noise and some smells. It is not mandatory that all of these elements are present simultaneously. And they can occur twice a week or just a few throughout a lifetime. During attacks, people seek a dark, quiet place to rest or fall asleep. An episode can last from a few hours to three days. Between attacks, there are usually no complaints. Some types of migraines may have more complex symptoms (with aura). These forms are less common, affecting around 15% of people with this problem, and include transient neurological symptoms, originating attributable to certain areas of the brain. The other signs are identical to those of migraine without aura. The most common auras are temporary vision disorders, in the form of loss of vision on one side of the visual field, blurred images, perception of bright points, geometric figures or bright zigzags. Other auras can be translated as tingling or numbness on one side of the face or one of the hands. There are people who have difficulty speaking or even temporary paralysis of their limbs, usually only on one side of the body. These changes last about 10 to 30 minutes and precede the pain. In children, migraines tend to be bilateral, less intense and of shorter duration. Vomiting and dark circles can be exuberant. Disturbances in sleep and meal schedules are common precipitating factors. Treating these crises is easier than in adults. Sleep usually gives good results. At these ages, the occipital location is not normal and, when present, requires a medical consultation. Likewise, the presence of headaches with morning vomiting or other unusual symptoms in very young children should be seen by a healthcare professional.//Causes//It is caused by a combination of brain processes: excitation/depression of cells, dilation of arteries and release of chemicals. People with migraine are more sensitive to certain stimuli, environmental or from their own body, that can trigger these brain processes. It is also thought that there is some genetic susceptibility. Some individuals can identify the signs of their attacks. The most common are cheese, chocolate, strawberries, seafood, wine, artificial sauces, changes in sleep patterns, stress, menstruation, fasting, physical exercise, and minor trauma. Others cannot identify them at all. People who drink coffee regularly may experience headaches when they stop this habit.//Diagnosis//The key to diagnosis lies in the clinical history, physical and neurological examination. Observation of the fundus is a very important part of these procedures. In some cases, it may be necessary to resort to computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to exclude other diseases.//Treatment//Migraines have no cure but can be controlled. There are medications and behaviors that can reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks. Symptomatic treatment, during acute periods, involves resting in a quiet, dark place. Pressure or cold can be applied to the area of \u200b\u200bpain. At this stage, analgesics, anti-inflammatories, antiemetics and triptans are very useful.//Prevention//People with migraines should create calendars that allow them to identify their symptoms and assess their impact on their quality of life. The first step in prevention is to identify and eliminate precipitating factors, whenever possible. In some cases, it is necessary to use daily medication to reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks, but there are no drugs specifically developed for their prevention. However, there are some drugs used in other contexts that have proven to be effective, such as beta-blockers, antidepressants or antiepileptics, and these should always be prescribed by a doctor.

                    "//What is it?//This is an increase in blood pressure above values \u200b\u200bconsidered normal. It occurs when there is excessive pressure of blood on the walls of the arteries during circulation. It can increase at certain times, due to physical or emotional exertion, and it is natural that, after these situations, its values \u200b\u200breturn to normal levels. This condition is only serious and causes health problems when it remains high for months, or when it increases suddenly. It is important to know that tension tends to increase with age. However, hypertension should not be considered normal in the elderly. As a rule, arterial hypertension is considered to be present when the maximum pressure is greater than or equal to 160 mmHge/or the minimum pressure is greater than or equal to 95 mmHge. High blood pressure is associated with coronary heart disease, stroke and heart failure and is the most common modifiable cardiovascular risk factor, which is why its treatment is essential in preventing these pathologies. Cardiovascular diseases are the cause of death for at least 34.1% of the Brazilian population, mainly as a consequence of stroke and coronary disease. It is estimated that the prevalence of high blood pressure in the Portuguese adult population is 42.1%, with only 39.0% of these patients taking antihypertensive drugs and only 11.2% being under control.//Symptoms//In the first few years, it does not cause any symptoms. Over time, blood pressure ends up damaging the blood vessels and the main organs of the body, such as the brain, heart and kidneys, causing headaches, dizziness, tinnitus and increased heart rate. The main diseases associated with high blood pressure are stroke, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, heart and kidney failure.//Causes//Around 90% of cases are related to lifestyle habits. Obesity is one of the important factors. Each pound of fat requires the formation of an additional 1.5 kilometers of small blood vessels to supply the excess adipose tissue. Increased blood pressure is required to pump blood through them. Therefore, being overweight by 20% or more increases the risk of hypertension by five times;;/ Excess salt consumption. It is known that high blood pressure is less frequent in populations where its consumption is low. Our body only needs 1/8 of a teaspoon of salt per day;;/ Tobacco is another cause to consider. Even just one cigarette can increase it for about 30 minutes. A pack-a-day smoker can, through smoking alone, cause an increase in blood pressure for 24 hours;;/ Around 5% to 15% of cases may be related to moderate alcohol consumption. On the other hand, one cup of coffee a day can cause an increase in blood pressure;;/ Physical inactivity and stress are also at its origin;;/ The remaining 10% of high blood pressure cases have organic causes, such as some hormonal changes, kidney or blood vessel diseases.//Diagnosis//It is important to remember that high blood pressure cannot be felt, it must be measured. In order to obtain correct values, it is important to rest in a sitting position for at least five minutes before measuring. You should use the same device and always measure on the same arm. The diagnosis of high blood pressure requires measuring an elevated blood pressure on three separate occasions over a period of a week or more. Once its existence has been confirmed, other tests must also be carried out to help understand its origin and/or the complications associated with it.//Treatment//Treatment depends on the severity of the condition. For example, people with moderate hypertension can control it by simply changing some lifestyle habits, such as reducing salt and alcohol intake, controlling their weight, exercising regularly and stopping smoking. There are several medications available for the treatment of high blood pressure that can be used alone or in combination. It is up to the doctor to decide which is the best treatment for each situation.//Prevention//Since most cases have their origin in lifestyle, it is important that it is healthy. All the recommendations mentioned in the treatment prevent the onset of this disease.

                    "I have been on metoprolol er 12.5mg since September 20th. The first month was great then on October 21st my resting heart rate went from 61 to 70 and when I walk it suddenly goes to 140 for no reason. I work out 6 days a week and it doesn't make any sence to me. Going back to my doctor tomorrow to figure it out. I just don't see why all of a sudden it would make things 10x worse. I didn't take it today to see if it would help. I was able to exersice without my heart rate sky rocketing to ridiculous numbers. This is the first medication like this I have ever taken. Plus the weight gain is ridiculous. I lost 15 lbs before starting this medication and less then 2 months I gained it all back.",
                    "I took Lopressor for 24 years it worked very well in lowering my blood pressure and even calming my anxiety but lately it doesn't work on me very well as before, I guess the doctor will change it.",
                    "I'm a 72 year 'young' female, and I have been taking Metoprolol Tartrate for 7 years, for PVC's Premature Ventricular Contractions of my heart, and also for Tachycardia. I take 25mg. in the morning, and 25mg. about 11 hours later. The medicine has stopped my PVC's, and also slows down my heart rate. When I first started taking Metoprorlol Tartrate, it made me very tired, but after about 2 weeks, my body got used to it, and I was fine.",
                    "I have been taking Toprol XL for about 2 years. My doctor has now put me on 200mg twice a day, total 400mg a day, this had to be approve by my insurance company and it was. This is working for me, no side effects and my blood pressure is steady at 114/70.",
                    "I was diagnosed with AFIB in 2012 at the age of 43, long sad frustrating story cut short, the doctor said there was nothing he could do about it. He sent me home to suffer with it. A couple of weeks ago I made an appt. with the clinic and the most wonderful nurse practioner started me on Metoprolol 25 mg/2x daily and \"I FEEL GREAT!\" I couldn't believe how my heart calmed down, my anxiety was relieved, I SLEPT BETTER b/c it stopped the night time AFIB attacks which constantly woke me up in the middle of the night and i just feel much more comfortable in my own skin...I actually cleaned the house without any huffing, puffing or the usual AFIB attack. I agree that it makes me drowsy which is becoming less severe I LOVE IT! :)",
                    "I'm giving this med a 7 so far just because I haven't had any real side effects with it, like I did with another bp med (can't remember the name). However, @ 25mg I still have bouts of high readings, so when I see my PCP this week, she might raise it to 50mg. I will say that I prefer to see a Cardiologist for this because I am terrified of exercising. Yes, I know exercise and weight loss can lower my bp to healthy levels, but I can't understand I can exert myself while having high bp. Shouldn't it first be controlled with meds first before exercising?",
                    "I have been taking Metoprolol 25mg once a day for 13 days. It has lowered my heart rate by about 30 beats a minute but I am always tired, get chest pain, headache and numbness. Little to no benefit in lowering my blood pressure (140/95's).",
                    "I have been on some form of metoprolol for seven years. It was actually my first prescribed medication at 28. I never even thought about side effects as being the problems I was experiencing; thought there was always something else that the Doctor's was overlooking. Now that I have read these comments, I suffer from most of the common ones; tiredness, weakness, trouble losing weight, strange dreams, increased sweating, difficulty breathing, etc. Have had numerous tests off and on for the last two years, and nothing is ever found. I have also since then started taking clonidine and amlodipine. Some of these symptoms are probably drug interactions. I noticed a chaotic heartbeat when clonidine was added to the medicines. It has gotten worse for the past two years.",

At times though I have spells that usually run less than a few minutes with a heart rate of around 190 plus and pain. My worst battle with this level lasted about 15 minutes. I take 50mg of Metoprolol 2 times a day on a regular basis but add another 50 if I have the biggies and that settles the heart rate down quickly. Luckily I have no side affects but would love to find something else that quickly slows the heart rate ... mainly to avoid the pain and spooky stuff that goes a;long with it. I've had 11 angioplasties and 10 stents since 1990 and am 70.",

I take blood pressure and pulse 2times/ day and it is averaging 107/71, pulse 63- working well. It took me a good 4 weeks to adapt to the tough side effects though. I felt very tired to the point of falling asleep during the day, was worn out if I walked to far or even stood too long, felt lightheadedness, nauseated, was afraid to drive. I'm glad I stuck it out, the side effects finally abated. Hang in there, the bad side effects can go away. For the record I'm a 69 year old woman, 5`4\" 128 lbs. I take the pill at night.",

I used to have shortness of breath, palpitations, chest pain, and weakness but it's so much better now. I only occasionally have some palpitations but nothing like before. Metoprolol works great!",

My BP is very high in the morning, like 167/110, before I take my daily dosage of valsartan. Within 2 hours of taking it my BP hasn't improved, then at about 5 hours after I take my BP med my BP plummets to like 71/54, sometimes lower. I fall asleep without even realizing it when it happens & sleep for about half hour. BP readings, about 4 times daily, shows PVCs at all times with an infrequent no PVC reading.

Unlike another report posted here, I am sleeping better while taking the medication. The only two side effects I've experienced are shakiness and nervousness when I miss a dose by even a few hours and vague aural hallucinations (hearing things) while on the verge of falling asleep. I've seen the hallucinations reported by other toprol users on other sites.",

My doctor prescribed 25 mg of metoprolol for me and I started taking it in February of this year (2015). My blood pressure was lowered from 140/90 to 125/82, so it DOES work in that respect. I had no side effects at ALL from this until the first week of June. Today is July 22nd. The first week of June, I was recovering from a sore throat and cough and then three weeks later, I realized that I was STILL hoarse and my voice was cracking. It is STILL like that as of today. Indeed, one of the rare side effects is hoarseness! I called my doctor today and he switched me to Amlopidine.",
                    "Reading the mixed reviews here, the first thing that jumped out was people have problems swallowing. This has happened to me quite a bit recently, using metroprolol succ ER 25 mg daily, for about 2 years now. I did have great success in reducing my pulse (130 resting pulse for 20 years, adjust to 90 now). Overall I was happy with it, but now somewhat concerned with long term use.",

I still feel a little of that about 12 hours after I take it- I figure that is a slight \" withdrawal\" effect, it lasts about 30-45 min. & I don't have it every day. When I took the generic ( manufacturer, PAR) I felt on a roller coaster, up & down all day. The time release delivery feels to be much smoother with the brand name, toprol- I recommend it. All in all, it works well, keeps my heart in sinus rhythm, but it's a tough drug to have to take.",
                    "This drug has literally changed my life in a very short time. I was having horrible chest pains, with a mixture of general anxiety due to work/home stress. Cardiologist found source of my chest pain is a narrowed subclavian artery.  The chest pain completely stopped within 24 hours. The only real side effect is difficulty sleeping if instructed to take it at night. I switched to taking it first thing in the morning and I now sleep like a baby. I give it a 9/10 solely for that side effect. I did feel very lethargic when I first took it, but that went away completely after 2 days or so once my body got used to the meds. I feel much more calm than I did before so this medication has really changed the way I feel. improvement is noticeable",

I feel nervous having my natural rhythm manipulated but when it comes to the heart, I'll just do what they say. Had an attack of pericarditis 3 weeks ago and then Atrial fibrillation two days ago. I was told that this was normal after pericarditis. Metoprolol is recommended while heart recovers. ",

It does the job well, but the side affects are rough to handle sometimes. Such as dizziness, sleepless nights, daytime drowsiness, forgetfulness, and depression but, i'm still coping after about four years and i guess on for the rest of my life. But if i can manage after three brother suicides than so can you.",
                    "Elevated blood pressure and increased heart rate due to long term undertreated high blood pressure. Metoprolol worked wonders. Been on it for a year - the side effects are strange dreams (not scary...just strange) and exercise difficulties. My doctor recommended sticking with 80% of exercise target heart rate. If you're having side effects, give this medication a couple months to work. It will get better. Make sure your doctor monitors your triglycerides and blood sugar while on any beta blocker. My triglycerides shot through the roof, but now under control with fish oil. ",
                    "My tachycardia started in my middle 30s, and though they were rare, became more severe as i entered my middle 40's and had to ER visits requiring the injection that stops the heart-no fun and scary. After this I went to a cardiologist who gave me 50 mg Metoprolol to take as needed. I am happy that i don't have to take it daily because it does make me sluggish on the very rare times that I do-I am pleased to have a solution when these events happen and my fears of dying suddenly from a heart episode have been drastically reduced.",
                    "Went to have foot injury x-rayed at urgent care, and spiked a blood pressure of 195/110 maybe due to pain.Was given this by IV in the ER, then pills for 3-4 nights at home. It lowered my b.p. by like 20 points/day, and I was fine for 2 days, but then had episodes of exhaustion to the point where I had to lie on the couch for hours to recover from simple housework like washing pots. Was also short of breath like I'd run 5 miles. Swallowing felt weird. Got disoriented while driving. It's a 9 on effectiveness, but can't tolerate the side effects. Am 63/F.",

The first month or so was tough as I had headaches, chest pains shortness of breath, etc. I think a large part of it was anxiety from a life changing surprise condition. No more headaches and anxiety is much, much better. I have a bit of shortness of breath, even when sitting at times, but I have been able to jog at the gym. Just started again this week and went 30 minute today. Overall, not sure if anything is working, but I am trying to just trust my Doctor and listen to my body.

This led to enlarged heart and high blood pressure. I've been on this medicine for 3 years now, and it has probably saved my life from another heart attack. I recommend it to anyone with my problem.",
                    "I love this medicine! It has quite literally saved my life, and has made my life much more livable. Whenever I would do anything physical, my heart would beat so fast that I would frequently faint. I went to my cardiologist, and she gave me a holter monitor. She saw what I was talking about and gave me 50mg of Toprol-XL everyday. That was over 3 years ago, still on the same dosage, and it is wonderful. For the first few months, I was a little over tired, but that side effect quickly went away.",
                    "I had all the side effects listed after taking Lopressor for 3 days. they still persist after stopping meds 2 days ago. I was on very low dosage of 12.5 bid",
                    "I was put on 50 mg 3 X a day for rapid, arrhythmic heartbeat and high blood pressure, in November last year. At first, it made me very sleepy and dizzy, but I have gotten over that. It lowered my heart rate into the low 60's and 50's, occasionally upper 40's. Halving the dose has not changed this; I am hoping to be off it, or at least on an even lower dose, after my next cardiology appointment in June. I think it is making me forgetful. That has definitely been a problem since taking it, although I was a bit of an absent-minded professor before. It may also have helped lower my blood pressure, although I have made some diet and lifestyle changes that would affect that, also.",
                    "It stopped my PACs (Preatrial contractions ). I was on this med for 13 years. Over three years ago I started having increased muscle weakness, episodes of collapsing or falling without knowing why or even a warning that I was going to fall, extremely dry eyes (OTC eye drops were ineffective), severe muscle spasms, back pain, increased diarrhea, swelling in hands and feet, and pinpoint red spots on my skin. I looked up the side effects of this med and I had 24 of the adverse effects!! I had become so weak that I had to use 2 walking sticks, could hardly get in or out of bed, couldn't walk a 100 ft. I quit taking this med which I thoroughly believe was killing me. I have begun to feel much better regaining some of my muscle strength and have less back pain.",

My hands have developed arthritis in both thumbs, my feet have it in my toes. I tried another Astra Zeneca product called Atacand and it works better but is so expensive I can't afford to buy it.",

Started out at 50mg, but had breakthroughs regularly, and went up to 100mg after a year. The medication works great to keep my heart rate and blood pressure down to normal levels, however, for the first month on the medication I constantly fell asleep during daily activity, and even now I maintain a sense of perpetual fatigue. Hard to lose weight, and depression creeps up often. Brain fog has slowed my ability to focus and react swiftly, which is frustrating. Still, the medication works so well to keep the heart episodes at bay that I haven't tried switching to a new medication.",

It has helped in slowing my rapid heart beat down but the side effects have almost been unbearable. I have hardly slept, after taking the medicine I get short of breath and feel like I'm having an anxiety attack, and I take the medicine at bedtime. In the mornings when I wake for the first two to three hours I feel shaky, sweaty, nauseous, and extremely dizzy. My regular MD took me down to 25mg once daily and I still can't sleep and feel anxious. This is the first day taking 25mg so we'll see how I feel in the morning.",

I told this many times but he still thinking about the BPM..so at the end the BPM decrease but not the blood pressure so is working 50/50. PS I gained more than 10lb after using the metoprolol",

After a few days it felt like I hadn't taken the medicine. Toprol XL works great, and when i swapped back to the original I felt great again. There must be some difference in the release between the two. This med brings the BP into 120's over low to mid 70's range where I was reg 140's/90's. It also helps bpm from mid 90's down to upper 70's.",

It made me tired. I don't know if part of the problem is the doctors I have been seeing don't know what exactly is wrong with my heart and why it does this. Just yesterday I went to the ER after being in the hospital for a week and the doctor gave me propranolol 10mg 3 times a day which is helping. ",

This is to treat a high systolic pressure that was originally at 145 though my diastolic was at 75. Metoprolol had no effect for 3 weeks until my systolic dropped to 127 from about 137. At the end of that 3 weeks I increased metoprolol to 75 mg/day and by the end of the 6th week my systolic had climed to 134.

I am not wearing the Event Mintor to track my heart rate. It can get high, which can be scary because you don't know what could happen next. Some sleepless night and early morning wakes with anxiety.

I was put on 25 mg metoprolol ER to help the anxiety and PVCs- it helped immediately. I stayed on several years. I continued the dosage, and tried to stay/get in shape.

I was given Amerge for acute migraines which works fantastic (as opposed to Maxalt; more tired/ does not last as long as Amerge or work as well). I was put on Toprol 50 mg extended release 60 days ago. Simultaneously, I had moderately high blood pressure. This drug is fantastic. In 61 days, I have not had one bad migraine. I had a minor last week and once I took a half of an Amerge, it was gone immediately. I did though develop strange dreams which I have read reviews about. However, they are tolerable. With any drug, you have to weigh the benefits vs. the risks. Try it. It works!",

Came off the opioids and find I have diarrhoea which seems to be the medication. I also developed vertigo 10 days ago. It's reduced in severity, but is still hanging around. Again seems likely to be the medication. Off all things meant to help me sleep, Metoprolol has made for some difficult sleepless nights, not something I've ever had before. At the same time it's controlling my heart rate and BP, and so far no more AF. My first week home from rehab I also suffered the anxious feeling, which was an unpleasant, crawly feeling in my chest.

A few hours before I am to take my next dose I begin to feel depressed, very cranky and angry and generally just awful. Once I take the medicine though those feelings tend to go away. It also upsets my stomach and I have had a mild loss of appetite. I have also noticed that some foods taste different. I am also having a problem staying asleep, but I seem to fall asleep easily.

I would wake at about 2 am and not be able to go back to sleep for several hours. Always tired, then would want to eat. I gained 20 pounds in a couple of months.

Also it gives me terrible nightmares, very violent. I'll wake up wondering how I could even have such terrible dreams. It also makes me tired.

I checked the brands of the former medications and the new and found they were different.

Went to the ER, converted myself via Valsalva Maneuver -- went to my MD the next day/had an echocardiogram done and was diagnosed with Mitral Valve Prolapse. My heart throughout the day kept going into PAT (200+ BPM) No chest pain or anything, but pounding heart/fainting. I was started on Lopressor at that time .... 100mg BID and this is an amazing drug. Sure I still get the odd PAT episode once in a while, but the pounding and skipped beats are greatly reduced. No side effects at all. It actually has a calming effect. Been on Lopressor for 35 years.

I was exercising too. I stopped all meds and no change despite amping up weights and cardio/ no sugar etc.  Nothing. I stopped the metoprolol, and I drop 16 lbs in 1 1/2 months. It also causes depression and weight gain as a side effect. However it is effective in treating many other conditions. I do not condone stopping medications without consulting your physician.",

While in hospital, a very old fashioned heart doctor got me up to 250 mg/day. Lots of its side effects. Stopped it and went to ER. Went on Coreg. Gave me swelled legs. Back on low dose of metoprolol. Over time, up to 75 mg of metoprolol. Afib stopped mostly with ICD & 2 ablations. Last straw was numbness in feet and back shooting nerve pain.

If it laster longer than an hour I was transported to the ER where I was given Adenosine to restart my heart.

I've always had dreams and talked in my sleep but I think the medication makes it a little worse especially if you're taking it closer to bed time.

No side effects to speak of thus far about 2 months in. 90mg immediate release once per day.",
                    "Had first bypass op in 1982, second a triple in 1992. I have been taking 50 mg tablet per day (for 25 years now age 84. I take half the tablet in morning and half at night ( my own method ) have found this best for me. Have a little Fibrillation from time to time, in the form of hard heavy beat lasting about half hour. My blood pressure is good tending a little to the low side, pulse normally around 55-60. Have not had side affects that I am aware of ?",
                    "Started taking this 3 days ago for AF and find that it makes me really tired few hours after I take it. Bit foggy too and feel bit nauseous On 1/2 a pill a day  Will see if the side effects go away with time. If not will need to reconsider with the dr if the benefits outweigh the side effects",
                    "53 years old using this medicine for high blood pressure for around 6 years. It controls my blood pressure but I gained weight, specially on my legs, increased urination, no headache, no pain on my chest, breath well in general. It is better than other medicine I have been on before.",
                    "Diarrhea and rash",
                    "This medication has helped my tremors immensely. Before, I was afraid to walk down a flight of stairs. Another bonus has been the frequency and severity of my migraines. It does make me drowsy and if I skip a dose or two, my migraines and shakes will increase dramatically. With this medicine my quality of life has improved so much.",
                    "A health care professional and a person who takes this medication .",
                    "I started toprol back in spring of 2004. I was switched from generic metoprolol, I was on that for borderline hbp. After 4 years on that I developed racing and very irregular heart beats the toprolxl did nothing. they got even worse. My doc took me off saying it was side effects of both drugs. I immediately improved. I still have them but not as bad. No cardiologist has told me what was wrong. I have a really bad back. In 2011 I got an epidural at T4-5 and that completely cured my rapid and irregular heartbeat for 3 years. There are 8 nerves besides the vagas nerve that go to the heart, they are part of the autonomic nervous system. They all come off the spine at C4-5 to T4-5 I have severe stenosis at all those levels.",
                    "The best.",
                    "I was prescribed metoprolol for tachycardia. I took it for about 6 weeks. I did feel better and not as fatigued, but suddenly I had severe depression. I felt like everything in my life was out of control even though mentally I knew it wasn't. I was sobbing hysterically all day and felt like I was losing my mind! I figured out the only change I'd made was taking metoprolol so I weaned myself off of it and the depression cleared right up. My doctor said he has a lot of patients on this medication and even though depression is a side effect none of them have had this issue. So I'm guessing it's not a common side effect but beware if you're just starting this.",
                    "It's hard for a patient to 'rate' a medication. I have an excellent cardiologist whose job that is. However, I know that Toprol comes with a tendency toward depression for many people, and for me, pre-existing depression has been mildly exacerbated. I also take amlodipine since May of last year, and this is a drug also known to cause/increase depression. I take several other anti-hypertensive drugs therefore it is not easy to tell which is causing what. Welcome to life post-cardiac bypass surgery--a life diminished, trust me, but at least--LIFE.",
                    "PCP (primary care physician) put me on Metoprolol ER Succinate 50 mg after Atrial Flutter of 136 bpm. After on it for 16 weeks, I developed heart block (a side effect). Heart got screwed up and pulse went down to 40 bpm. Had to get a pacemaker. A totally risky drug.",
                    "Wow!!!!! I have not been feeling well for a long time. Until Toprol lx 25mg. My head is clear. I can think straight. I dont have any anxiety. My work performance is at it greatest level. Even my sexual drive is back. I get up rested in the morning and fell no fatigue. I dont know about anyone else but I'm glad to take this medication.",
                    "This is a real good medicine. It controls my blood pressure and I like the way it works.",
                    "I do not like this medicine I have gained a lot of weight, runny nose, tired all the time and very bad and crazy dreams.",
                    "I had a quadruple bypass and I have been taking metropolol for 9 years now and have just recently had to up my dose to 50 milligrams 3 times a day because I moved to a high altitude location. This drug has worked for me just fine and I never want to switch. Hope it helps someone else out there.",
                    "The medicine works great for high blood pressure, BUT.... I'm a college student in school for criminal justice. Ever since taking this medication I can't seem to keep my eyes open to study and I can't focus on course material. Where as I was so motivated until metroprolol.",

I have only had a few minor attacks since being on this medication however I have side effects - Constantly exhausted and don't feel like myself and I have a heavy feeling in my chest which is extremely uncomfortable. Side effects have not subsided much since I started the medication 5 weeks ago. The side effects are bad enough to where I'm tempted to stop taking it and take my chances with the SVT! My doctor is recommending ablation procedure in hopes of that solving my problem and get me off the medication.",

                    "I'm a 52 YO male in fairly good shape. I started taking Metoprolol, 50mg twice a day after suffering a cardiac arrest earlier this year, in April. It has been very effective in controlling my blood pressure and keeping my heart rate low. The side effects are becoming unbearable now though. I'm tired, and have a lot of trouble focusing on my work during the day, have a lot of restless nights of tossing and turning, and have now developed a rash under my arms. I think it also contributes to erectile dysfunction. I spoke to my cardiologist about all this today, and he's cutting my dose in half. I'm hoping some of these side effects will diminish when I cut down to 25mg twice a day.",
                    "I am a 70 yr old RN. I started having episodes of near-fainting around 16 yr.old (actually fainted twice). I would go to the nurse & ask to lay down-which helped, but she thought I was faking. Next episode, 25 yr old - saw cardiologist, negative EKG, no treatment. Next 2 episodes, 30 yr old, more severe, ER - negative tests. Next 5 episodes, 40-50 yr old increasing severity, ER. During the last ER visit, I heard about a new type of Doc, an electrocardiophysiologist. I wore a monitor for 6 weeks before it finally \"caught\" the SVT. I started on Toprol 50 mg per day. But then, I had an episode of severe low BP (80/40) - back to the ER. My new Doc said to split dose, take 25 mg AM & PM. No episodes past 20 years. I'm a happy camper !",

                    "//What is it?//Headache and migraine are different entities. Migraine is one of the most common and well characterized, but there are 14 broad categories that can be subdivided into more than 200 different forms. Migraine itself has about 20 different genres. In general, headaches are divided into two large groups: primary and secondary. Primary illnesses correspond to a disease, not reflecting other health problems and represent around 90% of the total. Secondary symptoms are symptoms of diseases of the nervous system or other organs of the human body. They can occur in cases of flu, alcohol poisoning or withdrawal, minor head trauma, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels) or a high blood pressure crisis. Migraine is a primary headache in which very intense episodes of pain occur interspersed with periods without symptoms. In general, it begins between the ages of 15 and 40, but it can appear in childhood or shortly after the first menstruation. If it appears for the first time after the age of 45, other causes must be excluded. Some of its characteristics are closely associated with the female reproductive cycle: higher prevalence after the first menstruation or during the menstrual period; occasional worsening due to taking birth control pills or hormone therapy; attenuation or disappearance during pregnancy or menopause. Before adolescence, migraines affect boys and girls equally. From then on, it is two to three times more common in females. It is estimated that 8% to 15% of individuals living in Western countries (including Portugal) suffer from this problem. The fact of reaching people in the productive phase implies large economic, social and family costs.//Symptoms//It appears recurrently, several times throughout life, but always with completely free intervals. If it occurs every day, it is probably overuse of painkillers or other medications. Drug abuse can convert a migraine into a chronic daily headache. There are people who preferably appear on the weekend. These crises can be precipitated by changes in sleep schedule, failure to eat breakfast, reduced stress or alcohol abuse. In these cases, it is important to consider a lifestyle change over the weekend. The symptoms are intense and often prevent work or study. The pain tends to be throbbing, worsening with physical exertion or head movements. In general, it affects only one side of the head, and is accompanied by nausea, vomiting, intolerance to light, noise and some smells. It is not mandatory that all of these elements are present simultaneously. And they can occur twice a week or just a few throughout a lifetime. During attacks, people seek a dark, quiet place to rest or fall asleep. An episode can last from a few hours to three days. Between attacks, there are usually no complaints. Some types of migraines may have more complex symptoms (with aura). These forms are less common, affecting around 15% of people with this problem, and include transient neurological symptoms, originating attributable to certain areas of the brain. The other signs are identical to those of migraine without aura. The most common auras are temporary vision disorders, in the form of loss of vision on one side of the visual field, blurred images, perception of bright points, geometric figures or bright zigzags. Other auras can be translated as tingling or numbness on one side of the face or one of the hands. There are people who have difficulty speaking or even temporary paralysis of their limbs, usually only on one side of the body. These changes last about 10 to 30 minutes and precede the pain. In children, migraines tend to be bilateral, less intense and of shorter duration. Vomiting and dark circles can be exuberant. Disturbances in sleep and meal schedules are common precipitating factors. Treating these crises is easier than in adults. Sleep usually gives good results. At these ages, the occipital location is not normal and, when present, requires a medical consultation. Likewise, the presence of headaches with morning vomiting or other unusual symptoms in very young children should be seen by a healthcare professional.//Causes//It is caused by a combination of brain processes: excitation/depression of cells, dilation of arteries and release of chemicals. People with migraine are more sensitive to certain stimuli, environmental or from their own body, that can trigger these brain processes. It is also thought that there is some genetic susceptibility. Some individuals can identify the signs of their attacks. The most common are cheese, chocolate, strawberries, seafood, wine, artificial sauces, changes in sleep patterns, stress, menstruation, fasting, physical exercise, and minor trauma. Others cannot identify them at all. People who drink coffee regularly may experience headaches when they stop this habit.//Diagnosis//The key to diagnosis lies in the clinical history, physical and neurological examination. Observation of the fundus is a very important part of these procedures. In some cases, it may be necessary to resort to computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to exclude other diseases.//Treatment//Migraines have no cure but can be controlled. There are medications and behaviors that can reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks. Symptomatic treatment, during acute periods, involves resting in a quiet, dark place. Pressure or cold can be applied to the area of \u200b\u200bpain. At this stage, analgesics, anti-inflammatories, antiemetics and triptans are very useful.//Prevention//People with migraines should create calendars that allow them to identify their symptoms and assess their impact on their quality of life. The first step in prevention is to identify and eliminate precipitating factors, whenever possible. In some cases, it is necessary to use daily medication to reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks, but there are no drugs specifically developed for their prevention. However, there are some drugs used in other contexts that have proven to be effective, such as beta-blockers, antidepressants or antiepileptics, and these should always be prescribed by a doctor.

                    "//What is it?//This is an increase in blood pressure above values \u200b\u200bconsidered normal. It occurs when there is excessive pressure of blood on the walls of the arteries during circulation. It can increase at certain times, due to physical or emotional exertion, and it is natural that, after these situations, its values \u200b\u200breturn to normal levels. This condition is only serious and causes health problems when it remains high for months, or when it increases suddenly. It is important to know that tension tends to increase with age. However, hypertension should not be considered normal in the elderly. As a rule, arterial hypertension is considered to be present when the maximum pressure is greater than or equal to 160 mmHge/or the minimum pressure is greater than or equal to 95 mmHge. High blood pressure is associated with coronary heart disease, stroke and heart failure and is the most common modifiable cardiovascular risk factor, which is why its treatment is essential in preventing these pathologies. Cardiovascular diseases are the cause of death for at least 34.1% of the Brazilian population, mainly as a consequence of stroke and coronary disease. It is estimated that the prevalence of high blood pressure in the Portuguese adult population is 42.1%, with only 39.0% of these patients taking antihypertensive drugs and only 11.2% being under control.//Symptoms//In the first few years, it does not cause any symptoms. Over time, blood pressure ends up damaging the blood vessels and the main organs of the body, such as the brain, heart and kidneys, causing headaches, dizziness, tinnitus and increased heart rate. The main diseases associated with high blood pressure are stroke, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, heart and kidney failure.//Causes//Around 90% of cases are related to lifestyle habits. Obesity is one of the important factors. Each pound of fat requires the formation of an additional 1.5 kilometers of small blood vessels to supply the excess adipose tissue. Increased blood pressure is required to pump blood through them. Therefore, being overweight by 20% or more increases the risk of hypertension by five times;;/ Excess salt consumption. It is known that high blood pressure is less frequent in populations where its consumption is low. Our body only needs 1/8 of a teaspoon of salt per day;;/ Tobacco is another cause to consider. Even just one cigarette can increase it for about 30 minutes. A pack-a-day smoker can, through smoking alone, cause an increase in blood pressure for 24 hours;;/ Around 5% to 15% of cases may be related to moderate alcohol consumption. On the other hand, one cup of coffee a day can cause an increase in blood pressure;;/ Physical inactivity and stress are also at its origin;;/ The remaining 10% of high blood pressure cases have organic causes, such as some hormonal changes, kidney or blood vessel diseases.//Diagnosis//It is important to remember that high blood pressure cannot be felt, it must be measured. In order to obtain correct values, it is important to rest in a sitting position for at least five minutes before measuring. You should use the same device and always measure on the same arm. The diagnosis of high blood pressure requires measuring an elevated blood pressure on three separate occasions over a period of a week or more. Once its existence has been confirmed, other tests must also be carried out to help understand its origin and/or the complications associated with it.//Treatment//Treatment depends on the severity of the condition. For example, people with moderate hypertension can control it by simply changing some lifestyle habits, such as reducing salt and alcohol intake, controlling their weight, exercising regularly and stopping smoking. There are several medications available for the treatment of high blood pressure that can be used alone or in combination. It is up to the doctor to decide which is the best treatment for each situation.//Prevention//Since most cases have their origin in lifestyle, it is important that it is healthy. All the recommendations mentioned in the treatment prevent the onset of this disease.
