                    "This medication has been a life saver. I am a 23 year old female and was diagnosed with Irritable Bowel Syndrome 10 years ago. It wasn't until 2 years ago that my primary care doctor suggested this medication after finding success with another patient. Only 10 mg a day at bedtime and I am IBS symptom free. I used to have 5 bowel motions a day and now I am very regular. My life is so different now that I am on this medication. When I started the medication I had extreme dry mouth that went away after a couple of months and now I sometimes become constipated (which is something I've never had in my life).",
                    "I am 56 years old who with severe chronic nerve pain in my neck from herniation at C6-C7 and C4-C5. I opted no surgery and I have had zero quality of life and on bed rest for 4 years. Started PT with pain meds neurotin 600mg and I was slowly able to function in a brain fog but free from strong narcotics. Went to amitriptyline 40mg at night slept great but next day brain fog with memory lapses and always tired. Now on 10mg nortriptyline I take in the morning Because it affects me like a stimulate and hard to sleep at night but been on for a week. I have constipation but I take fiber in water helps. I love been alert with a clear head! So far no pain on 10mg so I won't increase unless I have pain. A very livable dose.",
                    "Although it helped with the headaches associated with a concussion it caused major itching and hives.",
                    "Been taking this for over 2 years now for extreme basilar artery migraines. started at 75mg. recently was upped to 125mg. If I miss a dose boy can I tell. This med works.",
                    "I suffered from debilitating IBS and was on the brink of having to leave my job on disability as a result. I also had developed severe anxiety. After over a year and many trips to a gastro, I went to a psychiatrist to treat my IBS induced anxiety who prescribed nortriptyline. It was a life saver. I have been on it for 2 years and am completely symptom free. Truly a miracle drug for me.  Only reason for a 9 -- on the two occasions when I forgot to take the medicine I felt very sick. Must be taken EVERY day.",
                    "I was prescribed this drug for pain from osteoarthritis. It made no difference to my pain and even after upping it to 40mg I was still unable to sleep.",
                    "Nortriptyline did not work for me. The first month I took it I gained 15 lbs, the second month I gained 10 lbs, the third month I gained 5 lbs., total of 30 lbs in 3 months and cholesterol way above heart attack level. I stopped taking it because I still had migraines and because of the rapid weight gain. I have never gained more than 5lbs. I was 120-125 most of my life. I gained 5 lbs after having 4 kids. I gained 20lbs each time I was pregnant and lost it quickly. I still have these 30 lbs that I can't lose from this damn nortriptyline. I've been walking 3-4 miles every day for a month now and eat organic when I can. I lost 7lbs. It's taking forever. I don't recommend nortriptyline to anyone. Try something else!!",
                    "I've suffered with depression for most of my life. I'd taken prozac for almost 20 years and decided to try something else because of the sexual side effects. That started a 5 year nightmare of drugs and severe side effects. So I quit taking pills and tried to go it alone. After a year without medication I lost contact with my friends and most of my family, no longer went out for enjoyment, stopped writing and generally just comforted myself with TV. I finally went back to my doctor a week ago and he put me on Nortriptyline 10mg. The first two days were a painful introduction of lethargy and dizzyspells. On the third day my world had changed. I'm talking to people, making plans, cleaning. After a week the sadness and death fantasy's are gone",
                    "I used to have headaches for many years and I visited a lots of doctors and got no results. My last doctor gave me Nortriptyline(25) and Propranol(40) for every night. Since then my headache is about once in a month. I am very happy. The side effects are dry mouth and weight gain.",
                    "I have been taking 10mg then upped it to 25mg nightly since October. Now I'm not sure if it was migraines I was actually having. I am on holiday in Australia from New Zealand and was on a short trip on the plane from Sydenham to the Gold Coast, 10 minutes in and the light through the bind was too bright so I took 100 mg Sumitriptan as they are pretty fast working but not this time. I lost my vision straight away and ended up having emergency surgery up my nose on a burst pituarty gland so close to my Brain it was bleeding and only so much removed, it benign thank goodness but I'm blind in my right eye possibly permanent and only about 20% vision in my left eye with no left vision and it could take at least a year to function properly.",
                    "I titrated up over two months, 10 mg at a time until I reached 50 mg. The side effects for me were: bad dreams, increased appetite, tiredness, heartburn, decreased sex drive, and sadness. I began taking the medicine at 7 PM and that eliminated the bad dreams. However, the medicine made me feel depressed. I would feel sad and start crying for no reason. This was all in the first 2 months and then the side effects went away. I have been at 50 mg for almost 3 months now and I feel normal! While it was hard for me in the first few months, I stuck with it and sure enough the side effects went away.  Unfortunately, I've been getting more migraines recently, and so I'm instructed to titrate up to 90 mg... So I'm not sure if it works yet",
                    "I'm 61 yrs old and have been taking Nortriptyline for about 30 years for depression. I believe I was depressed most of my life before being diagnosed. Initially, it took about 4 weeks before I started feeling the effects of the drug, but once it kicked in it made all the difference in the world. After many years, my doctor had me try some of the newer SSRI drugs (while still on Nortriptyline) and with each one I didn't feel at all like myself (like I was watching my life from outside myself), so with each attempt at trying a new drug, I kept going back to what worked best. Nortriptyline. I guess I'd consider myself a poster child for the drug, because it's always given me a level mood and I've never experienced deep depression while on it.",
                    "This medicine changed my life in a sense. I am on Latuda (an antipsychotic) and a lot of Wellbutrin, but I was still depressed and having migraines almost every day. I was put on only 30 mg a night to prevent headaches and to help me sleep. It certainly made me sleep a lot the first few nights. At first I was afraid it was a dud, but then 2 weeks later my migraines were less frequent; after 2 months on it, I have about 20 percent of the migraines I used to have. I get great sleep, and the best (and most surprising) part was that although it is a tiny dose, it was just what I needed to finally not be depressed and anxious. I only gave it 9 starts instead of ten because sometimes the dry mouth is unbearable at times.",
                    "I've suffered from chronic migraines since I was a kid and been on Nortriptyline for about a month now. The first two weeks are hard to gauge the effect of it because for the first week I was in a much higher altitude than normal, and the second week was my schools finals. So far very unhappy with the drug as I am still getting 4-5 headaches a week, even during \"normal life\" with nothing going on. Will be talking to my doctor to see what can be done about it, maybe a different dosage or time taking it will change my opinion. Willing to try anything to reduce headache frequency and severity.",
                    "It took four months before I could titrate up from 50mg to 75mg. I'm on it for Dysautonomia, nuerolgia, fibromyalgia, depression. At that point I felt significant improvement from the depression and panic attacks. I weaned myself off at one point for fear that I was having a bad side effect. I had forgotten how much pain relief it provided until I was off of it. This is one of the most helpful medications I've ever taken! It helps with pain, dysautonomia and depression! I don't think it gives me bad side effects. I've had serious bad side effects from SSRI's so I was very nervous but had to try something. I'm also on Gabapentin which helps with sleep and pain but coupled with this drug I've done so much better.",
                    "I'm 50 and attributed my pain to chronic sinusitis, having had two surgeries and what seemed endless infections. My ENT doctor recommended seeing a neurologist to determine if migraines were affecting me. I'd have 8/9 pain 3 to 4 times a month, 4/5 pain often and 2/3 pain almost constantly. I've had it so long that I'd routinely work through it, but it's taken a toll periodically on my personal and professional lives. I'm currently taking 30mg nightly and am virtually headache free. It's great having relief after so long. Research in the last five years indicates that migraines are often misdiagnosed as sinusitis also if you know someone suffering with what seems be sinus pain, have them get an opinion from a neurologist.",
                    "I posted about 2 months ago when I first started taking Nortriptyline, 25mg, once a day. I had a continuous headache day in and out. After taking multiple drugs, Imitrex, Prodrin, Midrin, not much relief. After about 2 weeks on Nortriptyline my continuous headache had diminished, \"almost\" entirely. I did notice though many afternoons my headache return and I had to take other meds to help reduce the discomfort. I talked to my doctor and he agreed maybe 2x a day would be best. 25mg in the morning and again at night. That was about 3 weeks ago and now, very rarely do I have any headaches, at any time of day. I hope this continues. What a relief. To me, this has been a true wonder drug for my 24 hour headache! No side effects.",
                    "About 25 years ago I suffered from debilitating headaches that lasted for days on end with varying intensity, but never quite gone. Upon visiting a neurologist I was told I suffer from Cluster headaches and he prescribed Nortriptyline. I have been taking 50 mg daily at bedtime for the 25 years since. I very rarely suffer from any headache at all as long as I remember to take my pill at bedtime and yes, I do sleep great. Nortriptyine was a godsend for me!",
                    "I'm taking Pamelor (that's the generic name) primarily for migraine prevention but it also helps my depression. It's been about three months since I started this and my migraines have reduced a lot. I rarely get them now. I'm also feeling much better since my depression. The only side effect I have is sleepiness in the mornings. Other than that it's a charm.",
                    "I had no problem with Nortriptyline. I had to take it in conjunction with Lithium for depression. My problem was when I QUIT taking it. I'm dizzy, sick to my stomach, I have ringing in my ears, I'm irritated all the time and I can't sleep. Just be prepared in case you stop taking it too.",
                    "A neurologist prescribed this for me several years ago because of the terrible debilitating headaches I was having. The kind that puts you in the bed because you can't function. It really did help. I tried awhile back to go off of it and the headaches returned so I started back and they subsided again. I won't try stopping taking it again as long as I stay headache-free.",
                    "I've had \"a\" really bad headache for over 6 weeks now. On my right side.  I say \"a\" because it is almost constant, day and night every day. Seldom have I had headaches my entire life. I'm now 60. After 4 visits to a doctor, (the first one prescribed antibiotics saying I had a sinus infection-no help what so ever, the second guy Midrin, same thing). I was prescribed nortriptyline at 25mg once a day by my last visit with a new doctor. It has been 3 days, so not much change, yet. I can put up with any/all the side effects mentioned, if I get relief. I will repost in a week or 2, when hopefully it has kicked in. Scheduled for a CAT scan in 2 days.....we'll see. Reading these posts has given me some hope.",
                    "I agree - a small dose keeps me virtually symptom free for 5 years. Only side effect is mild sleepiness, but I take it at bedtime, so it's not a problem.",
                    "Really good and old prescription medicine. Helped my neuralgia a great deal with NO side effects.",
                    "I have a love/hate relationship with this drug. When I take it i am headache free but if i forget to take it just one time I have the worst headache imaginable the next day. Like a hangover headache with nausea and dizziness. It is worse than the headaches I had before I started taking the medication. I've also noticed my energy levels are way lower and I am super constipated everyday. Dr did advise me about the constipation but not the lack of interest in doing things. I am super slow and have literally no energy to do anything. So I am not sure if it is related. I want to try to get off medicine but dr advises against this. I am not sure what to do.",
                    "I started suffering from migraines in my early 30's. I had tried everything you could think of. I was missing work 4-5 times a month. I ended up in th emergency room and was given Diloaudi several times (they call this percription heroin because its so very strong. A few weeks back I went to another doctor who gave me Nortriyptyline! He told me my Migraines could be due to stress. For example, I know I have to go to work, I get ready, but then I decide to take the day off. I get a migraine. I work well under pressure, so my brain gets amped up for one thing and it's suddenly changed. Not that anyone asked for my medical history Ha. This medication works wonders!",
                    "I was switched from amitriptyline to nortriptyline and noticed an immediate improvement the following morning. I'm sold.",
                    "After taking this medicine for 4 weeks I noticed no help will my depression",
                    "Had a few panic attacks, which later lead to constant panic attacks. This caused Agoraphobia. Suffered for 3 years and nortriptyline cured me from them 100%. Stopped the Doom and the attacks. I was on it 3 years and all was perfect. Later, I tired many SSRI's and all on them seemed to induce or create panic attacks. When I stopped the SSR's they went away. I have been free from Panic attacks since. It has now been 10 years clear. Thank you nortriptyline..",
                    "This did the job in removing nerve pain (50mg) BUT I couldn't sleep because I was hyper. Wild dreams, sweats, and constantly waking. Being hyper was super in the day as it completely removed my severe fatigue. Dropped to half dose 25mg to see if it helped. The hyperness continued unfortunately though less, but the nerve pain also returned, though not as severe. Other side effects which are a little worrying: Woke one morning with massive pain in one eye/side of head unlike anything I've had before. Scary. Also a constant eye tic has developed plus a constant weird dizzy ringing feeling in the head and vertigo when standing. I'm thinking of stopping though love the extra energy and effect on nerve pain.",
                    "Doctor Prescribed this to me after I was diagnosed with IBS. It seemed to work, but I didn't believe I was getting full effect. The doctor said at my young age of 17 (I'm now 18 since August 2017) I should not take as high as a dosage as some people but my pain I had told them I needed more so I moved from 10mg to 20mg. I often get very thirsty as a side affect and I'm almost always constipated. I'm actually typing this up as I'm in the bathroom right now, constipated. I don't believe I should be taking other medicines like laxatives or probiotics just to make up for this medicine that should be helping me.",
                    "I've smoked 40 years. Tried to quit before and never was successful. Somehow taking this medication it seemed easier. I have been smoke free now 2 months. I took the medication for 1 month prior to quitting and then went cold turkey. I take 75 mg daily when I go to bed. I have been instructed to take this medication for full 6 months after quitting. Cons: dry mouth, flatulence, lower sex drive, some weight gain, groggy in the morning, increased appetite, harder to urinate (dribbling). Pros: No anxiety around quitting smoking, seemed easier this time, medication is covered on drug plan, I feel committed and have been (no bargaining with myself to have 'just one'), It works! Pro's outweigh the cons because I have quit. Cons are temporary!",
                    "this drug has changed my life in the worst way ever .i feel like im going to die almost every single day . the only thing that i do now is dround my self in water sit in front of my air conditioner . also i started drinkingto get the feeling to calm down that im about to die . my heart rate is going so fast when i wake up and threwout my day if i dont have a drink of my new pill they gave me xanex i feel like my chest is going to explode . i had a head injury and told my dr that i was feeling edgy not myself ..that i was feeling slightly angry about my situation . this is the drug he put me on for that . now im not sure how to stop taking it he tells me just stop taking it and i have read a thousand things that say do not stop taking it ..",
                    "I have been having headaches everyday for the past 4 years. Doctors have put me on several different medicines that did not help until I started seeing a new neurologist. I was prescribed nortriptyline. The side effects for me were extreme fatigue but that did go away. I feel better than I have been in the past years.",
                    "I have been on nortriptyline for 6 years with two breaks in the middle. I have had severe migraines since I was 13 and have tried several treatment options. The two times I stopped were because it was no longer effective in preventing migraines. During those times my doctor increased beta blockers for 6 months then went back to the regular dosage with nortriptyline. I take up to 100 mg a day but average 50mg. Sometimes I take for granted how well this medication has worked for me. The downsides are weight gain, restlessness and vivid dreams. If you suffer from migraines to the extent I have it is well worth the side effects.",
                    "It made it hard to sleep and I'm groggy all day long. I'm not a fan. 25mg at night.",
                    "I have been on this medicine for migraine prevention for just over a year now. I LOVE IT! I used to have chronic daily migraine (8 to 9 intensity) and multiple unexplained body pains and weakness (docs just thought it was part of the migraines because I tested negative for MS, lupus, Fibromyalgia), my migraines are now down to 1 to 3 a month and the body pains are gone! I ended up having a 4 week period where I didn't have any medicine due to a mailing issue and the migraines were back full force, along with the body pains. Been back on it for about a week and I feel like I'm slowly getting better again. ",
                    "I suffer from depression, back pain and anxiety that has been gradually getting worse. I started taking nortriptyline and noticed a number of changes within 24 hours. I finally slept through the night. My back pain dramatically improved and my anxiety lessened. Sounds amazing right? Well yes, but I was also crying all the time and felt even more depressed. I also began having bad thoughts about hurting myself. I have had bad thoughts in the past, but always had control of them. These felt very different, I had no control of them.  For some people this medicine is a miracle, but if you start to have thoughts that don%u2019t feel right when you start taking this medication, go to your doctor immediately.",
                    "I've suffered from migraines for 25  years. I had my first appointment with a headache specialist /neurologist this month and she started me on nortriptyline (Pamelor) 10 mg, 1 x day for a week and step up to 30 mg daily. That was a Monday. I had a severe migraine from Monday night until Saturday as my last dose was Thur night and headache carried over into Friday. Saturday was much better. I also experienced a terrible pressure in my neck and head like my BP was elevated (normally my BP is great unless I'm in pain). I was incredibly irritable as well. In short.... No. Just no. I won't take it ever again.",
                    "The first few months being on this drug, it did not work at all. Before taking the drug I would get approximately a headache every other day and a migraine once a week. This continued a couple months after starting the drug at 10 mg. Now, after being on it for 6 months, it is working wonders. I have only gotten 10 headaches in the past 90 days and 1 migraine.",
                    "I am 27 yrs old and suffered from horrible migraine headaches since I was 15. I had the kind of headaches that caused uncontrollable vomiting and kept me in a dark room for days. I felt like I couldn't have a normal life because I would always think twice about going out fearing a migraine would ruin the day. I am currently on 75mg/day and it has made a significant difference. I no longer have the 9/10 severity migraines for 4-5 days at a time several times per month. I still get headaches but they will go away with something as simple as resting for 20 minutes with my eyes closed. I'm not afraid to go out anymore. The side effects that I have struggled a bit with are weight gain and dry mouth but I will take those any day over the migraines.",
                    "Started taking it for depression, (150mg) but have had IBS with diarrhea and cramping pain starting about 10 years ago. Taking immodium/loperamide at least every other day kept it under control since then, but after going on nortriptyline I've noticed it's improved this to where I only need to take immodium like once a week now to be completely symptom free.",
                    "Very effective as long as it is taken like clockwork.",
                    "Very bad, Was given for pain by doctor .Dr told me make sleepy does opposite. Gave me anger and made me depressed. Kinda mad at Dr. My be it's a side affects lol",
                    "I'm only 19 years old and I'm taking nortriptyline to prevent my migraines . I get these bad migraines everyday and at times I feel like shaving my whole head off because I feel like it's my hair causing it but it's not . Well I've been on nortripyline for 6 months now I still get migraines but not as bad as I use too but I still get them everyday which sucks . But I hate it because I'm suppose to take it right before I go to sleep and when I do I can't sleep anymore like it wakes me up and then I'm up the whole night and I start crying at times because I just want my migraines to go away so I could live a happy normal teenage life . I'm on every day medication I take nortriplyine 10 mg and ibuprofen 600 mg It sucks I hope I get better soon",
                    "I smoked for 7 years. I took this medicine and stopped smoking cold turkey and haven't thought of it since.",
                    "I have suffered with Fibromyaliga for nearly 25 years. This is the only medication that helped with my pain; helped with sleep and did not make me feel \"dopey\" all day. I can't say it will work for everyone, but it has helped me. I have been on it for 20 years. I take 50Mg at night about an hour before bed. When there are weather changes coming through, my pain gets worse, I take 60Mg.",
                    "It helps me. ",
                    "Quick background about me-Female, 23, 5'8\" ,122lbs. Started Nortripyline for fibromyalgia and chronic pain. I started off at a low dose, 10mgs, increasing by 10mgs weekly. When I first started it, I was jolted with energy throughout the whole day (which was great because fibro has been causing SO much fatigue) and I had a SUPER dry mouth. The first couple weeks... no other side affects, also was mildly helpful but not entirely. By the time I got to 60mgs, I was disassociating from my body, felt like I was going to crash my car when I drove it, dropped things, couldn't focus, couldn't speak without slurring my words, and I was extremely depressed...so I dropped down to 50mgs and everything is great now. I am also starting Lyrica.",
                    "I'm being treated with nortriptyline for abdominal wall pain due to having irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) for almost 40 years now. I still have pain in other areas but this does the trick for the abdominal pain, which is like the pain you get in your side after you've been running for a long time. It wasn't just a stabbing pain, though, it came, it stayed and wouldn't go away. I only take 10mg and my prescription says to increase as necessary, but I've been on it successfully for over a year now. I stopped it once with the ok of the doctor but within three weeks the pain returned, so I started back up on it. I do have the dry mouth and sometimes restless sleep but I can handle that...I couldn't handle the abdominal pain..this worked!",

I have tried so many drugs, herbal supplements, chiropractor, massage, acupuncture etc. have been hospitalized before for my migraines, and at some periods had them everyday. I thought if this is the reality of my life being in pain everyday, what is the point? This is the only drug which works and has almost no side effects except for at first a dry, nasty tasting mouth which has gone away for the most part. It took a couple days to kick in and I'm on a very low dose of 10 mg which I take at night. It's been almost a week pain free! I feel like a new person and it finally feels like the miracle I've been looking for, so don't give up!",

Frustrating because doctors won't prescribe my OxyContin I've been on for 9 years ( that completely helped my back after 3 failed surgeries) anymore because of all the irresponsible people abusing it! HOW IS THAT FAIR!? So annoyed that people who really need it have to pay the price! So I've been trying all this junk that has terrible side effects.",

So my doctor prescribed me nortriptyline. It really helped almost immediately. However, about 1 month in I got super groggy and lethargic during the day for no reason. I decided that I would just stay on the medication anyway. I am so glad I did because this medication helps so much with my migraines. I am now on 20 mg and I only get a migraine once a month or less. I would highly recommend for people with chronic migraines.",

Although I still feel pain, it is not continuous in all areas of my back. It is now just if I tweak the source. I did not heed the warning to avoid alcohol the first week and was very ill as a consequence. I was vomiting for 2 days afterwards and very dehydrated. My own fault. I am going to speak to my doctor to see if we should add to the dosage to try and get rid of the pain completely. I am currently on 10mg per night. Although I don't drink much, I do feel that I don't have the freedom to choose if I would like to drink. So, this is the down side to this medication. However, I would love to get rid of back pain for good!",

Last night I took my 10th dose and I am awake 2 hours after falling asleep then having a horrible, horrible nightmare about sexual situations, being part of murders, and my son being kidnapped by a killer clown. I know that sounds dumb, but it was extremely realistic and now I can't go back to sleep. I will call my doc in a few hours to discuss tapering off and quitting this med all together.

Since taking this medication for the past month, I have slept throught the night and it is easy for me to fall back asleep if I wake up to use the bathroom. I am so glad my doctor suggested this. After 13+ years of bad sleep and increase of migraines, I think I found something that works without any side effects (thus far). I take about 1 hour before bed and it has worked like a charm.",

He could not see me for weeks, but I was told his nurse could. I was hesitant, but did go in & see her the next day. She prescribed 10 mg. Pamelor at bedtime (name brand for nortriptyline).

However, after 2 months, the medicine doesn't seem to be working. I've started getting weekly migraines again that last 4-5 days.

Definitely never had one that lasted the entire day. So after four doctor visits, three blood test and six months of non-stop migraines, I was prescribed Nortriptyline. Only after two weeks I was waking up with out a headache. By the time I had got up to 40 milligrams, I was headache free. I'm so happy and relieved.

When I got married and my husband found me curled in a ball of pain, he didn't take \"I'm okay\" for an answer and took me to his family GP. The first day I took Nortripylene my migraines vanished. I didn't even know life could be so pain free! It's been 8 years now and I'll happily take it forever to be free from the wracking pain. If I stop, they come back and remind me to get my refill.

Also, I'm on 450 mg of Wellbutrin but was still depressed; this tiny dose of Nortriptyline for about 3 weeks has made all the difference and I'm happier.

I had a severe migraine from Monday night until Saturday as my last dose was Thur night and headache carried over into Friday. Saturday was much better. I also experienced a terrible pressure in my neck and head like my BP was elevated (normally my BP is great unless I'm in pain). I was incredibly irritable as well. After stopping nortriptyline, the daily headache issue subsided as well as the pressure in neck and head. I still have migraines and will find something else. In short.... No. I won't take it again.",

I have about 2-3 headaches a week, but instead of rating the pain a 8,9,or 10 I'm now in a pain range of 3 or 4, sometimes 5.

I convinced my doctor to let me try nortriptyline and it works very well with very mild side effects. I had dry mouth which is not very noticeable now, higher incidence of heartburn than normal, firmer stools, and frequent \"weird\", vivid dreams. Relief started at 25 mg but I now take 75 mg daily. Migraine frequency is down from 20+ days a month to 1-2. I still avoid most triggers to be safe but this has helped tremendously",

                    "I had a car accident two years ago and the back, neck and leg pain crippled me untill I tried nortriptyline. I am pain free and take 50mg which I build up too. After 6 weeks the only down side is I cannot drink alcohol but a small price to pay and if I try to reduce them I go back to the same conditions I had before taking them. I take it at night and actually sleep for 6 hours straight pain free which I could not do before. This medicine has given me back my life.",
                    "I suffered with migraines for years because doctors weren't able to diagnose them. They thought my headaches were related to sinus problems. I got headaches 4-5 times a week. Finally a neurologist prescribed 25mg nortriptyline daily. It took a few weeks to take effect but now I have been nearly headache free for four years. I do still occasionally get headaches every few months but they never last more than a few hours and generic Imitrex helps. I asked the doctor about going off the nortriptyline but she said if not's broken why fix it. So I am going to stay on this wonder drug. Best of luck to anyone suffering with headaches. It's a tough time.",
                    "I suffered depression and anxiety at a young age due to a stuttering problem but I never knew at that time what caused it. I went to a Dr. at the age of 22 and he put me on Pamelor. I was afraid to take it but I did. The first few days it made me feel weird. I felt like a zombie at first for maybe 3 days but then it went away. In 6 weeks my depression was gone and I felt like a normal person. I was normal. I think my does at one point was 100 which is moderate. People need to know that this type of med takes 6-8 weeks to work and when it does its like a fog has lifted, for me at least. You have to be careful with weight gain because it does increase your appetite. It helped me sleep at night. 6-8 weeks to work.",
                    "I have suffered with A-typical facial neuralgia for over 12 years and nothing but nothing has helped me like Nortriptyline. I was prescribed this by a professor of Pain Management at Walton Hospital and I can honestly say he saved my life. It is a wonder pill that seems to work alone. Previously I was on a cocktail of Tegretol, amitriptyline and gabapentin which completely left me like a zombie. After being 'pain free' for 7 years, I began to wean myself off them but only recently the pain has begun to return so I'm going go back to the doctor for my script. Sometimes it's better to carry on taking the tablets even if you think the pain has gone as they cannot cure you, they merely mask the pain, which is good enough for me.",
                    "I have been on Nortriptyline for 3 months now and I couldn't be happier. I have been suffering with migraines since I was 16 and I am now 31. I have been on a number of medicines for prevention but this is the first time I can say that my migraines are under control. After being on this for 2 months I missed 2 days and woke up to a horrible migraine. Since then I have been right back on and not missing any dosages. If you haven't tried this for migraines and are still suffering I highly recommend you talk to your doctor about it.",
                    "I have been living with chronic back and hip pain for 12 years. I have had many surgeries with little to no relief of pain. After being in the pain management program at Kaiser for 2 months the doctor prescribed nortriptyline and within days I felt like a new person. Even just sitting doing nothing was painful and now I can do my daily household chores with little pain. Some things are still difficult but my daily life has improved substantially.",
                    "Three years ago, after a hospitalization for a severe ischemic colitis episode, I had severe and unremitting nerve pain. I tried gabapentin which did work initially. After about 6 months, the pain gradually returned. I then was put on 10 mg of nortriptyline, which was like a miracle, no more pain. I take it at night and have no residual effects the next day. I wish I had tried it sooner!",
                    "After years of disc/nerve pain, I have been on these tablets for around 3 months and the pain has reduced considerably and I sleep much better too. I have been taking 25mg, but have now upped the dose to 50mg and it appears to be working even better. Fingers crossed.",
                    "Have been taking 10mg a day to counter the effects of neuralgia following a severe attack of shingles. The medicine has given me complete freedom from pain with no side effects except possibly ringing in one ear, which may of course be co-incidental.",

                    "This drug has changed my life. I used to get at least 1 headache per week, often up to 3 or 4, with nausea and extreme fatigue. I have been on the 10 mg about 3 months now and it has seriously given me my life back. I still get headaches (maybe twice per month) but they are very mild and usually really late at night. I had side effects (pretty annoying constipation and mood swings) but this has subsided almost completely. I haven't felt this good in years and I highly recommend trying this drug.",

They have increased in frequency and duration over the last 2years to the point where I sought preventive therapy. I tried propanolol, various muscle relaxers and most recently nortriptyline. I started with 10mg taken at bedtime with little relief. Eventually, increased dose to 75mg and am happy to report migraines have decreased from 2-3 week to 2/mo. Still have to stay away from triggers such as alcohol and chocolate. Only side effect seems to be short term memory loss.",

I use Imitrex and Relpax at onset, and this usually takes care of the headache. I would go through several \"stints\" where I would wake up with a headache every day . I am on Propranolol for HBP and migraine maint.). I tried several other maint. meds like topamax and amitriptyline. Topamax made my hands tingle. Amitriptyline didn't work.  I've been on Nortriptyline for 2 months and WOW, what a difference. The first night I took it, I woke up without a headache. I probably only get 1 a week now, if that. Try this med if you haven't already, maybe it will help you too!",

But I started feeling depressed (which I never am), extreme irritability and a low to no sex drive. I stopped taking the medicine after two months and gave myself a 3 month break. I just started taking them again and all the side effects came racing back! I would much rather have headaches than deal with the side effects. The depression feeling is so horrible.",
                    "I was given this medicine to take daily to prevent migraines, and I don't know if it worked because it threw me into the WORST depression I've ever dealt with in my life. At the peak of this I had a panic attack so bad I was considering dropping out of college! Luckily I realized that the pill was making me feel this way and as SOON as I stopped it the depressive episodes and anxiety went away. I was on a small dose too. TERRIBLE.

Having hell of a time falling asleep, low grade headaches and blurred vision. But the worst is the sexual side effect of ED. Had been on 10mg of amitriptyline for years previously. Slept great on that and had no ED problems. Had the fogginess the next day though I had gotten used to that. Planning to switch back but Doc wants me to wait two weeks in hope that side effects will lessen. Have DDD in lower back 4+ years and chronic foot pain from super high arches for 17 years. Pain had increased recently so doc thought Nortriptyline might help better. Also on 900mg Neurontin a day",

I'm able to fight most of my headaches with an Aleve that would have spiraled into a migraine before. The one and only negative, I've been so hungry! Gained at least 5lbs. But I'd rather be a little fat and happy mommy of four boys than the skinny, miserable mom in pain I was before. I did get cotton mouth at first but it went away.",
                    "This is month 3 and the headaches I lived many years with have vanished with a 30 mg dose every night. I sleep well. Dry mouth is tolerable and treated with an oral rinse. I never thought I could feel this good!",

He suggested trying either an anti-depressant or anti-seizure medication because both are known to help alleviate migraine suffering in some people. I wanted to go the anti-depressant route since I am also chronically depressed, and since counseling and other medications I have tried did not help. After the first week on Pamelor the migraines were drastically reduced in both frequency and severity, and I went the next three weeks without any pain in my head. My mood is stabilized, I have a clarity that I have never had, and getting out of bed in the morning is no longer excruciating. I am on 10 mg to start and will go higher if it is an option at next appointment.",

I'm now on 20 mg. only downside is sleeping issues. But hey, I can deal with that!",

However, I had to go off it, due to a rare side effect, that my neurologist hadn't even seen, called Serotonin syndrome. It's something to watch out for. I'm on gabapentin now for neuralgia and neuropathic pain.",

I've been on it over 10 years, but unfortunately about five years ago the side effects started to get a lot worse. Urinary retention is quite a plaque to have in your life. A year ago I also developed tinnitus. I have recently started weaning off and the tinnitus and retention is improving. If it wasn't for the side effects increasing, this would be a perfect drug. It fixed my insomonia and gave me 8 perfect hours of sleep for the past 12 years. It also helps a lot with my nerve pain. It's not a 100% but compared to other drugs its top of class for me. I'm not giving Tradazone and Ativan a try.",

A specialist that I saw a couple of months suggested that I try Nortriptylene because even though it is in the same family as Amitriptylene sometimes it has a different effect. I have taken it for 4 nights now and have noticed a huge difference in the way my bladder feels. Spasms are gone and the heaviness and burning have gone as well. I haven't slept well since taking it but was having trouble sleeping through the night anyway. No day grogginess though.",

I now get a migraine perhaps five or six times a year compared with one a week previously. It did cause dry mouth at first, though that has abated. And my mood is much improved, possibly because I have fewer headaches and possibly because of the drug's antidepressive effects. The main problem is weight gain. I feel hungry almost all the time. That said, I'm not ready to return to pre-nortriptyline days and, instead, will work on diet and exercise.",

Lucky for me nortriptyline was the first one I was prescribed. I was getting migraines 4/5 times a week and it was REALLY getting in the way of my life. Within the first 2 weeks the migraines stopped!! I didn't get one again until 3 months of being on nortriptyline and it was a mild headache that I managed perfectly with Excedrine! Now I manage about one headache a month with Excedrine and take 30mg of nortriptyline daily before bed. Only side effect I have is hair loss.",

I had nearly given up hope. The only thing that seemed to help at all was activated charcoal.  One day a nurse practitioner prescribed me nortriptyline to trial. She told me that it wasn't for IBS but it may help with some of its symptoms. Within a week my pains went away and have been gone now for 2 years. I take one pill every night before bed.

The second was so bad I was directly admitted from my first neurology appointment to the hospital for 14 DHE treatments (yuck).

I spent lots of time researching online and trying various treatments including elimination diets, supplements, various exercises etc.. My GP recommended I try Nortriptyline at nights starting at 10mg dosage and said that it'd take around a month to kick in.

The first 3 weeks were great because I had gone from 2-3 days a week of migraines to not a single episode. It was very hard to deal with the daytime fatigue and this was only on a 25 mg dose, but two cups of coffee took care of that. I stopped taking it suddenly after 1.5 months due to a change in mood/angry/depressed feelings which I've never experienced, and sure enough I was in bed for 3 days with a migraine. So, I'm back on the medicine, have been almost migraine free for 3 months, the fatigue has gone away, and as long as I remember to read my \"positive thoughts/positive things in my life\" when I feel a little depressed (this medicine or at least 25mg a day hasn't helped depression) I'm fine.

But by the fourth or fifth day, all of that was gone, and my headaches went too. I'm glad I stuck it out, because I had had headaches that interfered with my daily life. It made me very drowsy at first, and still does act as a bit of a sedative, so I only take it if I plan to sleep very soon. Also, it really lowered my alcohol tolerance, so watch out for that.",

The pros outweigh the cons of taking this medication so I continue to use it up to now.",
                    "I am 40 year old woman and I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia and Myofascial pain syndrome around 2 years ago and had symptoms for about 3 years before that. This medication was my doctor's first choice. I am a member of one of leading health care providers in CA, and she said that they have had much success prescribing this medication to patients with nerve pain disorders. This medicine made a considerable difference in my quality of life, improving my sleep, pain, stiffness, and tenderness. I take 30mg every evening before bed and make sure that I get about 8-9 hours sleep. I can always tell the next day if I've forgotten my dose. I plan on taking it for as long as it helps.",
                    "I also took nortriptyline for irritable bowel syndrome. It did work within a couple of days, however it also came with side effects. I would wake in the middle of the night and not be able to go back to sleep. The worst side effect was a marked decrease in sexual performance. I discontinued the medication after two weeks. Within a few days the IBS was back, but the side effects were gone.",

                    "I've suffered from chronic pain my entire life and often haven't been able to sleep as a result. I found this medication to often be very helpful. Though it took several weeks to really work, it definitely helped me sleep and my pain has decreased. I was started at a very low dose, which gave me a lot of flexibility to move up and down as the situation required. Taking the medication coincided with some slight weight gain, but this could have been due to a vareity of other factors. Overall I found it very helpful!",
                    "Successfully reduced migraines from 1-2 a week to 1-2 a month. Discontinued for a year and migraines resumed, so I'm back on it for good. 60mg daily.",

                    "Started having pain, continuous in gall bladder area, felt as if I had a spider running under my skin and caused pain in a localized area. After several visits to several doctors, a digestive Doctor explained to me that prolonged stress could cause a localized pain in the body that was not found medically. Have taken anti-depressants on/off for 12 years. Stopped those and started nortriptyline 10mg at night. The spiders stopped crawling completely during the day, so the pain associated with it stopped. I take this 10mg only at night, within 15mins off to bed I go and sleep through the whole night. Could not imagine taking during the day. Overall, the medication has stopped the pain and this causes my day to be much more productive.",
                    "I have Stage 5 CRPS and have been taking 75MG of Nortriptyline (Generic for Pamelor) at bedtime for a few years now. I feel that I have been taking it long enough to say for sure that it helps with my treatment. I recommend this drug, but everyone is different and we all respond to medication differently, I hope Nortriptyline give's you the same hope in your treatment that it has given me.",

I am now 44yrs. old and have had constant, localized pain and spider crawling feeling in the gall bladder area. Everything with me physically checked out fine. Prescribed the medication for the persistent pain/depression/anxiety, etc. Only take 10mg. at night, the pain and spider crawling has stopped but still experience the ears ringing.",
                    "I've had chronic headaches for 4-5 years and was treating symptoms with OTC meds which eventually became ineffective. Started having severe migraines about once a week for which I finally sought a more permanent treatment. Had some undesirable side effects to a few of the initial prescriptions. Hair loss, nausea, insomnia, etc. I had a rough start with Nortriptyline. As I increased the dosage I experienced prolonged drowsiness and some constipation. After a few weeks the symptoms decreased and my head aches stopped being a daily occurrence. I have had a few migraines since starting but these have also become less frequent. Maybe from once a week to once a month now. Hoping this works for me long-term and doesn't become ineffective.",
                    "I have suffered for years with migraines. I calculated that I lost 1 year completely to migraines every 6 years. I started Nortriptyline in Dec 2010 and have not had one migraine since then. Even with my job stress (nursing) no headaches. Finally at 49 I have a life. The dry mouth can be difficult at times but dry mouth or migraines, I pick dry mouth.",
                    "Took the edge of the pain. Did boost my mood, and the tiredness took a day or two to adjust too. The worst was the dry mouth- I couldn't go anywhere without a bottle of water- and my blood pressure dropped to a dangerous low. When my doctor took me off it, I ended up in the ER with a Flare up I hadn't experienced since being on the medicine.",
                    "So I read some of these experiences and was doubtful it could help my lower back pain, tried pain killers and months of physical therapy to no avail, my primary finally sent me to a neurologist (already had x-rays, and went through that tube, in agony I may add because I could not lay flat) they quickly put me on the Nortriptyline at 10mg dose, one week I did not feel any relief, they upped my dose to 25mg and same thing not much relief at all, went to 50mg and felt better really dulled the shooting pains down my left leg and foot, went to 100mg with better results. Now I'm at 125mg and life is much better, I can walk in a mall, drive my car and get back to a normal life again. This is supposed to break my pain cycle and so far so good.",
                    "This medication has been very effective by almost eliminating my daily pain. When I do experience headache, jaw and neck pain, it's now usually milder than before and easily treated with a pain reliever.  Additional benefits include helping me fall asleep easier and reducing the symptoms of a serious sleep disorder. The only negative side effect directly related to this med has been severe thirst requiring me to drink water and urinate very frequently. However this annoying and inconvenient side effect is well worth it. I'm also at high risk for angle closure, but am unsure if it's related. I lived with chronic pain from my mid 20s through my late 30s before starting this medication. I only wish I started taking it earlier in life.",

Already experiencing horrible side effects: ongoing ringing ears; constantly nauseous; slughish tired during the day; Light headed throughout the day; rapid heart beat; had 2 nightmares which I woke up catching my own breath because I thought I was dying. That same night I had that dream twice; still cannot sleep more than 4 1/2 pushing 5. Hrs of sleep. with 10mg. Still having migraines. Called my Dr. Office 2 days ago and have not received a call back yet. I am supposed to go up to 30 or 40mg. But with these side effects I just want to get off of 10mg.",
                    "I started on 60 MG of noritripteline at the age of 65 as a replacement for Cymbalta, which I could no longer afford. I found that when it was combined with 100 MG of sertaline (zoloft). This combination gave me the greatest relief from the chronic depression I have suffered from since the age of 15. But I was not aware of its anticholinergic effects on older people which manifested at age 67 when I began to experience problems walking, repeated falls, lethargy, mental confusion and memory problems. In addition to the noritripteline, I was also taking benadryl (over the counter) to aid with sleep at night, another anticholinergic drug. Both medications can be detrimental in older population groups and result in my symptoms.",
                    "For the last 10 years my fibromyalgia has has gone down hill. This medicine has given me some of my life back. I had horrible pain in my neck and back, fatigue, not sleeping, migraines, nervous stomach, and several other problems. I was ran though a battery of tests and no one could figure out why I was having all these problems and finally a DR said it sounded like Fibromyalgia. I was put on a small dose of nortiptyline (20MG) and within a week I was feeling somewhat better and within 2 weeks I felt almost normal again. This medicine has changed my life. I can finally do the things I used to do. I still get migraines and sometimes feel icky again but its not very often. I do get dry mouth a lot but I can deal with that over feeling like crap.",

I could not get to sleep and in the morning I experienced sadness, anxiety, increased heart rate, irritability, dizziness, brain fog. One time was enough I have a family and can't ride these symptoms out ( if they ever actually would decrease). The negative effects out weighed any benefits.",

Then the resident neurologist gave me prescription for Nortriptyline 10mg (increasing the dose every week by 10mg till it reaches 40mg). It is two weeks now (20mg), I didn't have any migraine headache but for some reason I have this fear of being on a medicine for the rest of my life. However I'm very, very excited to live two weeks without migraine.",

I still have headaches but nothing I need to run to urgent care for injection. I've taken Imitrex as needed for a couple yrs and it stopped working. I noticed lots of posts from people who work in healthcare as I do, very stressful at times. I pray over time I will not have migraines. The Anxiety of them popping up at work is aweful.

Nortriptyline was the 7th Med prescribed (after Lexapro, Beta Blockers, Zoloft, etc.) and for me it was radically better than all the other Meds. Tried to take at night but was too activating.  Started taking 10 mg in the AM and another 10 mg in the afternoon (if needed). Completely controlled my Anxiety, gave me more energy, improved sex drive, and cleared-up both Acne & Rosacea. EXCELLENT Drug...worth a try. Due to the low dose, I had none of the typical side effects (dry mouth, etc.)",

Last year I eventually had an operation to resolve the problem of a chipped bone and a release but it did not help me with the constant stabbing pain which I was told was my nerve and tendons being in a knot. After numerous attempts through physiotherapy, massages, pain killers and injections, none of them worked until I was prescribed nortriptyline. What a difference, I am hardly in any pain now and feel much better.",

About two hours after taking it and still not able to sleep I began to feel slightly nervous and sad. I couldn't stop thinking about killing myself. I had to wake up my husband at 2 AM to help snap me out of it and I never did get to sleep that night. Needless to say I will never take this garbage again.",

After a week or so I realized that it helped with my nerve pain in my back and neck. It was amazing, I was able to wean myself off of prescription Motrin (600-800 Mg) several times a day for 24 years. I take 30 mg nortriptyline before bed. For those of you who feel out of it, you must take it with the intent of getting a full nights sleep, 8 hours and more if you're taking a high dose otherwise you will not feel right.",

I have tried so many meds and combination of meds and they made the migraines more tolerable for awhile. I even tried Botox. I saw a new neurologist on April 4/13, and he asked me to try nortriptyline 10mg at bedtime, increasing to 20mg after a week. I have had only 2 migraines since Apr 4, and the pain is mild to moderate. I am hoping for more improvement. So far no side effects at all.",

We did 10mg at night for a few months and stopped it worked well. When the migraines became more frequent a few years later we switched to continued use and 20mg a night. Migraines are now rare unless I am dealing with serious stress. Headaches in general have been reduced in number.",

A few smaller ones get through that ibuprofen will take care of but the amount of serious headaches and migraines have decreased significantly. The only difficulty is because the pills are so lightweight they do not go down easily. I have to chase it with food (such as taking it during dinner) or else the pills get stuck and cause pretty bad heartburn-type difficulties.",
                    "I suffered lower back pain for 15 years and finally my \"Pain Specialist\" gave me a prescription for a starter of Nortriptyline. 1 week 10mg, 1 week 20mg, 1 week 30mg, 1 week of 40mg and 1 week of 50 mg and the pain was gone. It made me very hyper, but I was out of pain and happy. I was on it for 6 months and a change in insurance forced me to taper back off. Basically the starter in reverse. As each week ended I kept wondering when the pain would come back. It was amazing because it never did come back. I had lost some weight and built up my core muscles, so that helped. After 15 years of daily pain, the kind that makes you think oh no when someone invites you anywhere, I have been pain free for over a year.",

I'd suffer migraines at least 4 times a week and the pain would be excruciating. I'd suffer from rebound migraines as well and it turned out that I can't take medicines like Excedrin because they actually worsen my migraines. Imitrex stopped working. Once I started Nortriptyline, I started seeing relief within the first two months. I'm on a steady 30mg and as long as I eat right, keep active and reduce stress [a big factor to how they'd start at first], I only get level 8/9 migraines 2/3 a month, usually at the start and end of my menstrual cycle, and take Treximet for them.",

I have been getting migraines since I was 8 or 9 and it eventually got to the point where migraines were a daily thing for me. After seeing a neurologist & trying out 2 or 3 other perscriptions, my neurologist prescribed nortriptyline. It worked for a while then my dosage needed to be increased, however I still take it to this day, once before bed every single night. The only time I get a migraine now is if I'm sick, skip two or more doses, or encounter a trigger, such as prolonged sun exposure, dehydration, large caffeine amounts, etc.",

Im not sure if this helps or if its my other medications. I feel like this stuff makes me dizzy when outside in the heat, I have a constant dry mouth, my sex drive in no longer alive, I cant remember things and get confused easy.

I've also had two serious incidents in combat and two vehicle accidents in the states. I have been on everything I think, no help so far and recently 3 months ago put on stepped into nortriptolyne 50 mg along with gabapentin. I must say I'm a bit better as I'm not on bed rest as I used to not be able to get up. I have also been forced to carry a Tens unit which helps with spasms along with Robaxin and at times have to take Norco when it gets bad.  I'm hoping for the best and hoping to just be on one pill or none soon. Oh, and therapy weekly. So far I can only say : I think nortriptyline helps.",

One of the better medications I have tried. Others have either not worked or have had horrible side effects. I tried to go off of Nortriptyline twice now because I do feel it increases my appetite, but both times the headaches got worse. So for me Nortriptyline and Botox shots have been the most helpful.",

My back kills me. I take 30 MG throughout the day now. Taking it with tramadol decreases the effectiveness of the drug.  Nortryptilline is a tricyclic antidepressant. It blocks the receptors in the cerebellum so pain signals cannot be received. This is not FDA approved because being an antidepressant when one is it depressed can be very risky and cause serious side effects. For those of you who are waking up on this medication, you could be low on serotonin and those that are falling asleep you could have too much. It will also make you very constipated. Be careful.",

I feel better mentally, and the medicine somehow \"soothes\" inflamed spinal-cord areas. NOT my imagination-over the years, doctors tried several medicines for this, none worked.

I kept getting nightmares that were so horrific, I eventually started sleeping with the lights on & thus not sleeping as good. Within 6 months I gained 20 lbs without changing my eating habits nor physical activity. Looking back, there was a short period of time when my vision was affected as I had trouble focusing. At the time, I just thought my contacts prescription was getting too strong for me. I decided to revisit the list of side effects and sure enough there they all were. I quit taking Nortriptyline that day and eventually the nightmares, blurred vision, & weight gain went away.",

I hate to be skeptical but it's almost too good to believe for me since I've been sick so long, so I will be reporting back soon. But I even feel differently just how my brain feels.

I have progressed to 50mg as although the migranes went away I was still suffering with headaches at least 4 times a week. I am happy and only suffering irregular heart palpitations and night terrors. But overall I am extremely happy and am so thankful that life is back to normal. I can now function and go about my daily activities without constant pain.",

I have tried Tramadol (sometimes REALLY good but other times gave me a worse headache), Amitriptyline (no impact) and now Nortriptyline. I started on 10mg in the morning and 20mg at night. I had to go up to 20mg twice a day to see any effect. My headaches are now down to about one a week, which I can take pain killers for, so this medication has been amazing for me. The only downside for me is the extremely dry mouth, but that pales in comparison to the positives. I have also seen that Nortriptyline has lead to weight gain for some. I am fortunate in that it actually keeps hunger at bay. I have only been on the medication for 8 weeks.",

I am now going to ask doctor for antidepressants. 15-20 minutes after I take my pill each night I get really itchy all over my body for about 10 minutes and then it suddenly stops. I have also found that I have really vivid and scary dreams now of being chased. I also take Tramadols to manage pain levels but have found that since starting Nortripine l can no longer drive after taking Tramadol, previously l managed fine. I have found no improvement in my pain levels",

One downfall is that I seem to craves snacks much more since I've been on this drug. I'll take that side-effect over chronic headache.",

I still have problems with dry mouth and I personally think it makes me a little forgetful (short term memory). I was a little lazy about taking it a few months ago and was wondering if it was still affective after 7 YEARS, and yes it is. One week after not taking it I got vertigo again which I haven't had in 3 years. So I'll be on this for life. I only get breakthrough migraines during my period for which I take a ketaprofen.",

I am sleeping great, too. The dry mouth usually comes for me after I up the dose, one thing though, I had a numb spot right above my right knee which is caused by a pinched nerve in my pelvic region- the numbness has turned to a fullness in my knee now...weird but I can live with it.",
                    "I have had a headache upon waking every day for 40 years. I always took Excedrin and when it was taken off the market my headaches became much more frequent and migraines were a weekly occurrence. Nothing helped so my neurologist put me on Nortriptyline 10mg but I can take up to 3 if needed. First time taking it I didn't have a headache in the morning. It has been a Godsend. My only side effects are that I oversleep. I take it at bedtime, which is the morning since I work nights, but it made my mind \"wake up\" so I take my Lunesta with it. I have to force myself to get up after 8 hours so that I don't sleep 10 hours or more which is easily done. It's been 3 months with a rare minor headache that OTC aspirin takes care of.",
                    "I thought I'd share my experience as I was madly reading all the reviews on this website before starting this drug. I get it on the NHS in the UK and I take 20mg a day. Taking this drug and combining it with the plan in Dr David Buccholz' book Heal Your Headache has been the closest I've got to a total cure for my chronic severe migraines. There are almost no side effects. It's amazing.  A word of caution. At one point when I tried increasing to higher doses above 20mg I had very bad mood swings for a few days. Even when I started from 0 to 10mg I had very bad mood swings for a few days but then it evens out and becomes unnoticeable.",
                    "I was given nortriptyline by a pain doctor 7 years ago. It did help somewhat with the pain. However the side effects have been giving me problems ever since. I have problems concentrating but worse than that I daydream constantly. I can't shut it off. It lasts for hours. It is like it turned on a daydreaming switch in my brain and I can't shut it off. I went off of it expecting it to stop. It never has. It gets more unmanageable. I do not know what to do.",
                    "I'm 21 years old and have been suffering from chronic abdominal pain and Irritable Bowel Syndrome for almost two years now. I started the nortriptyline about a year ago after countless trips to the hospital to get a grip on my pain. Since last summer, I've noticed a HUGE difference since being on the nortriptyline. There is still some pain, but the medicine really calmed everything down. The only thing that I frown upon is the fact that it makes me very tired. Even though I take it at bedtime. I take 75mg every night and I wake up feeling groggy every day. I'm not sure if anyone else has had this experience and side effect. But I'd rather be tired than in pain, good luck to everyone!",
                    "I was first put on this med because I suffer with migraines and the doctor wanted to see if it would help with them. Far as my IBS goes I was put on Dicyclomine which wasn't helping me at all. After being on Nortriptyline for my migraines I stared taking noticed that it was helping me with my IBS. I wasn't having the sharp pains anymore and didn't have to worry about staying near a bathroom. Seeing that Nortriptyline wasn't helping me with my migraines the doctor took me off of the meds. I've been off of it for a month and since then my IBS has been in full effect. So my family doctor put me back on them which I will start tonight. Can't wait for it to get back into my system so it will get it back straight",

                    "Never really had headaches until after brain surgery for a cavernous malformation. After the surgery was okay for about a month and then had headaches everyday. I was just learning how to live with them but somedays I just needed to stay in bed. Had a neurologist try one med that knocked me out and switched to a new neurologist that put me on this med. After one week I was a new person. Have been on it for several months with maybe one headache and I think that trigger was lack of food. I am sold on this medication it has been life changing. I did notice there were lots of side effects and was nervous at first but the benefits totally out weigh the dry mouth I get. Trying Biotine mouth was for that. Sleeping well too",
                    "When I was 47 I was diagnosed with arthritis in my neck which was triggering migraines and shoulder pain. Even 800 mg of Motrin didn't help. Nortriptyline was a miracle and I am migraine free. I tried going off of it about 4 times, and every time I had headaches and shoulder pain the next day. I am so thankful for Nortriptyline because I can go to work and think clearly without a headache clouding my thoughts.",

It worked well for each attack, but had a lot of side effects. I would get migraine episodes from once a week to 3 or 4 times a week. While employed, I would have to go to the ladies lounge and rest for the period it too to alleviate the pain. Then my blood pressure got out of control, thereby creating another problem. I was having a lot of nausea and vomiting also. After retiring at 50, a new doctor prescribed Amytriptilyne. Recently a new doc took me off it and migraine returned with a vengeance. I'm now taking Nortriptyline and it has worked wonders! No more migraine at all.",

                    "I have calf pain (mainly when sitting) due to small fiber neuropathy. I tried Neurontin, Lyrica, Cymbalta...without any luck. Tramadol provided limited relief, but not nearly enough. Finally I tried Pamelor and after a few weeks the calf pain started to dissipate. I take 100mg/day and the side effects have been pretty mild. The drowsiness tapered off after a few days, but the dry mouth and constipation go with the territory. I get occasional tinnitus as well.",
                    "Three years ago I started having atypical migraines. It felt like the world was spinning in all directions at once. I would throw up until my stomach was empty and then some. Finally, after hours of this I would pass out, almost coma like. The recovery was long and slow after each attack. I was sent to a neurologist who prescribed Nortriptyline. It was amazing! They did start out with a low dose but it only had marginal effect. They increased it to 75 mg daily and now I only have an atypical migraine every few months. And they are not as severe and recovery is quicker. So thankful for this drug.",
                    "This has helped reduce the severity of my attacks. They are still incapacitating, but the vomiting is not as severe. Unfortunately, it has not affected the amount of attacks I get.",
                    "I've suffered from migraines for 14 years and have taken numerous medications for prevention including Topamax (Topamax caused MANY bad, undetermined health issues). My Internal Medicine physician took me off Topamax and put me on 25 mg of Nortriptyline for migraine prevention. Almost immediately, I had relief from migraines, had clarity of mind even better than ever before, had a great attitude. I felt \"normal\" for the first time in my life. This medication caused noticeable urinary retention, constipation and increased appetite which caused weight gain. Due to weight gain, I was changed to Pristiq. Migraines have returned. I intend to ask to be put back on Nortriptyline and will have to alter diet and exercise.",
                    "52 year old female. I had recurring mid range to severe headaches which became migraines for several years. I had them so often, I was taking tons of over the counter headache pills, which then damaged my stomach after long term excessive use. After finally telling my doctor about them, he put me on Nortiptyline, (2) 10mg pills every night, so 20mg total daily. It was like a miracle for me! Within a very short time, I was 95% migraine free. It has no side effects for me and I have eliminated my excessively large intake of over the counter pills almost entirely. What a huge impact this medication has made for me.",
                    "Side effects are a bit annoying sometimes, but it's working for me so I'll put up with it. A side note- I'm taking this in addition to Wellbutrin and Cymbalta. All for my RSD... I have only had intermittent pain and it was extremely mild in comparison to before this combination.",
                    "I have suffered severe pain for 20 years following a motorcycle accident. During this time I have tried every sort of pain relief available to me, mainly narcotic drugs which I found as bad as the pain itself. Earlier this year I was prescribed Lyrica as far as pain relief goes...fantastic. After a few months (1x 75mg cap per day) I experienced total confusion and was unable to perform my daily tasks at work or at home. I was becoming agitated and experienced suicidal thoughts. Things returned to normal after a week or so of not taking Lyrica. Because it worked so well I am tempted to give it another go. It was just so good to not feel the pain anymore.",

Nothing really helped unless I was a zombie. I am allergic to a lot of medications including Tegretol and Neurontin. So when my neurologist suggested I try this medication I was VERY skeptical. I have been on this medicaton for a week now. I started on 25mg twice a day and felt some relief. I thought it was in my head. Now I am on 50mg twice a day and I can't believe the difference. I am relieved I can finally get my life back. I am a mother of 2. I did not realize how much the pain had taken over my life until now.",

I got up to 150 mgs twice a day with no positive effect. I am now down to 100 mgs twice a day. I have had no weight gain. I am on a few other meds but I still suffer daily with this awful anxiety. I am trying transcranial magnetic simulation right now and have about 3 weeks of treatments left, it hasn't helped me yet. The only thing that works for me is benzodiazepines and I become tolerant very quickly.",

After being on different narcotics that didn't work, I gave up and just lived with the aching in my arm that never stopped. My Doctor put me on Lyrica, and I swear, I started crying because I had NO pain in my arm for the first time since my accident: 5 years. Lyrica has been a God send for me. It helps both my back and my arm. When my Doctor increases the dose, the side effects go away after 2 weeks. I recommend this medicine to anybody with nerve damage.",

Underwent a laminotomy for spinal compression due to synovial cyst and facet joint disease. Have a couple herniated discs, but left alone in surgery...felt I would recover from this on its own as I have very mild degenerative disc disease.. Since taking Lyrica for only 3 days at a low dose my pain has subsided enough so I could actually leave my home to go out to dinner. Pain went from about \"10\" at its worst down to about a m \"2-3\".  I would say try it as it may work for you. Side effects are less than gabapention.",
                    "I have had fibromyalgia for as long as I can remember. The pain was so bad 6 months ago from too much stress that I wasn't sleeping which made it worse. I had to quit my job and I would just lay in bed and cry moving my heating pad all around my body. It was a nightmare. I wanted my life back. I found a doctor to do all the tests and diagnose me. I tried gabapentin first and did nothing for me and I was a zombie so we switched to Lyrica. I take 300mg a day. It's not perfect ALL the time. Some days I am back in pain. And three days before my period I'm in a lot of pain. It has also helped my anxiety and insomnia. For me, the dizziness went away after a month. And the other side effects are minimal.",
                    "I was prescribed Lyrica (pregabalin) about 6 months ago. I was so shocked by the feelings of unreality it initially caused that I quickly stopped taking it. My fibromyalgia got so bad at the end of the year, that I decided to try it again.  I take low doses, 25 mg 2x a day, sometimes a 50 mg. The effect sets in within hours. My fibromyalgia pain is almost completely gone. A late evening dose allows me to sleep longer. I do feel strange when I take it and my intellectual capacity is quite affected, but the lack of distraction by the pain and a better social interaction with increased confidence levels makes up for that. I have to make sure that authorities and decision-making bodies are aware of my reduced competence, and close friends should know of these side effects, so that they can make allowances for any out-of-character behaviour on my part i.e. my inability to repair their car stereo.",

I know the Doctors say meds arent the answer for GAD but they are for me, I have had CBT, counselling, hypnotherapy, and nothing worked. But with pre gablin I have been on holiday with no probs, was actually able to relax for the first time in 8 years. I can go into any social scene and be really calm and enjoy it. All I hope is that it lasts and I dont get used to it. All my friends and family have said how well i am and relaxed and happy I appear. And I really am.",

Everything about this drug was far worse than the problems it was supposed to address.  Do not take this toxic garbage. My Dr insisted I had to give it time to work...

IMO this med s/b taken off the market!",

I've been on it for approximately 8 years before the side effects really started kicking in. Began as morning anxiety attacks, severe GI upset, mood swings and low to mid level depression. Tried changing the schedule from twice a day to three times a day. It helped at first but about two months later my body began anticipating new schedule and the side effects would start kicking in about an hour before next dose. Its taken me 8 months to get dosage down from 225 mg a day to 75mg a day and every step down has been sheer hell. Every step down leads to a period of depression, and it gets worse the closer you get to zero.",

I developed a problem with my kidneys, not from Lyrica, and had to decrease the dose to 300 mg twice a day. I have to say that I get little pain relief from this med but do get a feeling of well-being, or contentment. So, I call it my little happy pill. When I miss a dose, I notice I'm a bit depressed. It's not an antidepressant but it works that way for me. Thank you",

I suffer quite badly from anxiety and agitation and I can't tell you just how much this medication has helped. Even if I could just about get through the daytime without it, when I am asleep and my mind can follow any path it wishes to, it chooses to go down really bad avenues and I wake up feeling absolutely dreadful and this reached a terrible climax 8 years ago and resulted in me not eating at all and therefore losing a frightening amount of weight. However on my last pharmacy visit, I was a generic version of the drug which has not worked at all and so I am hoping my GP will put me back on Lyrica. If not, I am very fearful for the future.",

It did nothing for that or my sciatica. Finally I was bumped up to high dose, but do to other things in life I had to stop because of financial difficulties. I couldn't even afford copays. So I'm on gabapentin and it barely works. If I could, I would get back on Lyrica!                Thank you all for sharing your experiences!",

It relieved the aches and body spasms almost instantly. I could sleep at night, and woke up pain free and was able to live a somewhat normal life. I did however gain 40 lbs. I am now experiencing severe depression, and I feel it is the Lyrica. I ran out once and experienced the worst withdrawal symptoms. I felt like I was dying and the pain was severe. This medicine is wonderful, but getting off of it is very hard. ",

I'm constantly hungry, sleepy, dizzy and I feel like I'm drunk. I worked VERY hard to lose the weight that I gained when I was pregnant and since I've been on this medication, I've put it all back on and then some (40 lbs). It's hard to say if the pain is better or if I'm so caught up with the side effects that I don't care. I'm being weened off of it right now and being put on a different medicine.

I take hydrocodone to deal with the body ache/back pain. I have good days and bad days still, but when the day is good, very little muscle pain. Downside: I have gained a great deal of weight.

I still have good and bad days, but I can bear the bad days because of Lyrica. It gave me my life back. When I first took it, I did have the \"high\" feeling the side effects mention, but it was only my first two doses. Also, I HAVE to take it with food, otherwise I get extremely nauseous and dizzy.

Can talk to people can go for hair cut can sit in the same room as people look at there face when talking to me. With out almost passing out.

It has been about 2 months now and I just wish I could figure out if it is the Lyrica causing the fatigue. I ache too much without it to test the theory.",
                    "I was taking Lyrica for several years. I stopped taking it because of the price. My prescription medications are covered by Medicare & other insurance, but I do not believe in indiscriminately spending Medicare money. So, again, only because of the cost, I stopped. My feet went wild, burning pain, could not even have the bed covers on them at night. I got my Rx for Lyrica renewed and when it came I first took 2 caps in order to see if it would get started again. It did! I'm going to be doing a bit of research on the internet for a lower cost alternative. Gabapentin looks good at the moment, maybe on my next doc appt. I'll try it. I gave it only a 9 because of the cost, but for effectiveness I'd give it as high a number as allowed.",
                    "Lyrica has been a life saver for me. Prior to being prescribed Lyrica, I was living with terrible burning pain because of vulvodynia. Lyrica provided me with the relief I did not get from any other drugs. I can now enjoy life with little to no pain. I am so thankful that I was prescribed Lyrica.",

When I first started the pain I was in was about a 9 out of 10 in intensity. After a year of being on the Lyrica it might have gone to a 7 or 8 but it caused me to put on about 40 lbs, my skin changed, and caused a lot of other side effects. I finally told my doctor it wasn't worth all the side effects if it wasn't going to help the pain.",
                    "Lyrica put me into a more restful sleep. Waking up at 5:30am for work is very difficult on this medication and I feel fatigued still throughout the day. I still ache from my fibromyaliga on this medication. I can't remember how long I was on this medication. I went off it and started taking Savella. Savella took care of the pain from the condition but now I'm having side effects from the medicine. Now I don't know what I'm going to take.",
                    "I am 51 yrs old and I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia about a month ago. My doctor prescribed Lyrica. My Mother also had fibromyalgia and was taking Lyrica. She suffered a lot of the sleepy/out of it side effect and didn't like that at all. It did ease some of her pain, but she was not willing to increase the dosage. I started taking Lyrica when diagnosed, and within just a day or two I felt incredible! I didn't hurt when I woke up in the morning. I could move and do regular activities around the house without the horrible pain I had before. I did have some of the loopy/confusion/unable to focus for a short time, but that went away. I'm so thankful for Lyrica. I can live and not just exist.",
                    "I started taking Lyrica about 5 months ago. It has worked great for relieving my pain from fibro, however I have experienced bladder retention at times and since I also suffer from anxiety, depression, and PTSD, over the last couple months, I have been having really scary thoughts of suicide. (I would never, ever do that. I know myself well enough to know that I would never do anything. I lost my husband that way.) I feel like it has increased my symptoms of depression and PTSD. I stopped taking it 2 days ago and while I am in a lot of pain, it's better than the side effects of this medicine. I'm going to my Dr in a couple days and I'm going to talk to her about another option.",

After fighting with my insurance company for two weeks I was approved. Within one week I have minimal pain! It is a miracle for me. I take 25mg three times a day. Love it! Thank you!",

My Doctor decided to try me on Lyrica and I can say with 100% truth and honesty that 4 days after I started it, on just 75mgs a day, I can walk again. I am still walking now in 2013 but just in short jaunts. I'm glad this pill exists.",

I got anxious, depressed, confused, blurred vision, and a general \"high\" (not a good high) feeling. I felt very dumb and had a lot of trouble articulating my thoughts. Overall a terrible drug for me. The side effects out weighed the benefits of this medication. ",

Also driving the car my leg was in so much pain I had to lift it up with my hand to ease the pain. No medication I had taken stopped the pain which was unbearable and I couldn't sleep at night, My Doctor prescribed Lyrica and at first I did not like it because it made my feet puffy however I went back on it with the prescribed dose of 150mg twice a day. Now I have to try to recall the pain because I have no sciatic pain at all with this drug.  It also had the side effect of making me a bit \"dreamy\" which I rather like but I do forget names and things I am saying which I do not like. Can't have it all though!",

One day it would be in my legs, then my torso, then my arm, my throat, my ear and then shingles surfaced on my torso-right side. I took an antiviral for the shingles, and Neurontin for pain. The blisters were painful and they went away in a couple weeks but the pain remained and I took Neurontin in high doses, with Tylenol so I could sleep but my right leg hurt all the time. I couldn't walk up/down stairs on that leg, or sleep on either of side without pain and I am a side sleeper so I was miserable. A neurologist was skeptical that the cause was shingles but prescribed Lyrica and it was magic! 75 mg once a day and the pain is 95% gone, 6 months later still works.",

I got leg spasms at night after not taking it. Walking around a little stopped the spasms. I'd like to give it a better try, but the side effects prevent me from functioning.",

Currently I'm feeling spaced all the time, gaining weight each day, and kind of depressed, but my psychiatrist said that could be anxiety coming through. I have been taking Xanax also for about 6 years, before that I was tried on Lexapro and went crazy on it. Also the Xanax was a disaster long term, as they become very addictive. Well the moral of the story is I'm praying for the Lyrica to work.",

I got a new Auto CPAP last week as well as started taking Lyrics 75mg twice a day and I already notice a difference. So far my appetite has decreased. The first 3 days I was only taking one a day and incredibly tired having to take naps on my lunch hour. The extra sleepiness has subsided substantially even while increasing the dose. It has not been a week yet but I can feel a difference. The numbness, tingling and muscle spasms that keep me awake or start by the time I get out of bed have decreased as well as the pain. I'm looking forward and hoping it works out.",

The surgeon removed the cyst, realigned my vertebrae and used instrumentation to hold the vertebrae in place. Unfortunately, after the surgery, the most painful part was the pain in my arms. I had taken Lyrica in the past for a very short time and it caused weight gain. I kept the medication on hand because it was expensive. After 2 trips back into the ER, the surgeon wanted me to take the Lyrica. His RN said that I will know if it will work in 1 1/2 - 2 days. She was right, thank God! The pain decreased dramatically. I'll deal with the weight gain later.",

Now I take 225mg in the morning and another 225mg at bedtime. It has helped me sleep at night a little better but other than that, I haven't had the relief as some have described here. It's frustrating to say the least. Considering the fact that I am also on Xanax, Clonazepam, Hydrocodone, Tramadol, Trazadone and Savella. Some I only take 1 x per day, others 3 x per day and a couple 2x per day. Lyrica was added after Tramadol. I had no side effects from it and it did not interfere with the other medicines that I am on. I was losing weight easily before, but now it is a bit harder. I'm staying on it.",

Unlike SSRI's it gives me no sexual side effects and no feelings of apathy.  It's highly effective for anxiety. I take 300mg daily. At this dose I still have some anxiety but it is greatly reduced.  I have no serious side effects other than an increase in appetite which may lead to weight gain. Dizziness and feelings of being 'high' pass in a week. I highly recommend giving Lyrica a go. Having your life back is worth the cost.",

Took Lyrica (300mg/day) for 3 years & it worked initially to calm the aching but became less effective after a few months. It helped me get restful sleep & calmed my anxiety but I couldn't think, had very poor memory & felt very depressed (got worse overtime). When I stopped taking it I had the worst withdrawal symptoms imaginable (way worse than benzos). I literally felt worse than dying & all I could think of was when the hellish experience would stop . Took about a month to start feeling better & several months to really feel better. Doctors say that Lyrica doesn't have withdrawal (or it should be minor) but that's rubbish. Withdrawal eventually passes",

A week ago my dosage increased to 150mg twice a day and my back pain is good and sciatica is gone. Additionally my general anxiety is eased. There's no worsening of my depression symptoms (I manage depression/anxiety with efexor). Aside from mild sedation I've had a great result from lyrica so far. Hope it continues working this well! :)",

The pain was unbearable from the swelling and in the end I had a lot of broken veins. If you're swelling up and your doctor says \"oh, you just ate too much salt this week\" get another opinion to get off Lyrica and see if the swelling doesn't stop. I wish I could take it, it really did help. Good luck to all with Fibromyalgia, it's an awful and painful disease.",

Prior to Lyrica I was taking 60mg/day of methadone with significant relief but with plenty of room for improvement. With the addition of Lyrica to my Methadone regimen, my relief now stands at approx. 80% analgesia which is a God send considering the severity of my pain. As a welcome side benefit, significant anxiety, hot flushes and insomnia were relieved as well. For me, Lyrica has been something of a miracle drug.",

Doc finally had me gave me lyrica (after I had to try everything else first) ams at first, it worked. I did feel \"high\" but that slowly went away. After approx. 2 weeks of 75mg a day, I had horrible side effects..feeling depressed, like people were talking about me or didnt like me, had no memory or wasn't able to concentrate but what finally got me to stop was I had thoughts of driving my car off of a hill that i drive down daily. I may suffer from pain so intensely that I cry all the time, can't leave my home at times or feel blue because of it, but I had never thought of taking my own life.

The doctor had said that it was the worse shingles he had seen. After the scabs had gone I was Prescribed lyrica.  I take 300mg at night and 25mg in the morning. It has been 5 weeks since I developed shingles and my face and scalp are still numb. I have intermittent pain shocks. I believe the lyrica is effective as I can't imagine what it would be like if I didn't take it. I'm not sure how long I am suppose to take this but I imagine by other feedbacks that it could be months.",

My doctor originally prescribed Vicodin, then switched me to Lyrica in anticipation of my return to work. Lyrica was very effective at reducing the severity of the pain, but it caused me to be very drowsy. I slept for 14 hours a night, and had difficulty concentrating during the day. I would also have trouble remembering things I had done while taking Lyrica. I had to discontinue using it.",

I have suffered on and off for years and a few months ago I was bed/couch ridden and found it impossible to even leave my house. My family has told me I am a completely different person since starting it. I feel alive again. I also used to take Xanax for years for social and general anxiety and I have found that it is helping with that also. Only side effect was feeling high the first two doses but now I just feel like a normal person, which is what I have always wished for. I hope it continues to work and gets better as I up my dose. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who suffers from fibromyalgia. Good luck to all.",

Doctor came in and sat down looking worried. \"There's probably nothing more you can do for me.\" I said \"No, there's not.\" She sent me home with maximum doses of every painkiller on the planet-nothing got rid of the deep burning aching pain. It hurt to stand, sit, walk, lie down. I laid in bed for days not knowing what to do. I tried Lyrica. That pain has been gone ever since. I got my life back.",

                    "I've been struggling with deep muscle and bone pain. After trying Vicodin, tramadol, gabapentin and more I can't even remember, my new doctor gave me a Lyrica sample. For the first time in four years, I was able to get out of bed with no pain. It's changed my life.",
                    "I had lumbar decompression surgery in July for a herniated disk (L4,L5) and spinal stenosis. A week after the surgery, the nerve in my left leg and foot \"woke\" up and the pain was severe. My left foot was constantly burning, with feelings of electric shock 24 hours a day. I couldn't wear my shoe and I was very depressed by the pain - I couldn't walk barely without pain. My surgeon put me on Lyrica and within a week, almost all of the burning disappeared. I get a random \"shock\" in my toes, a spasm in my arch and part of my foot is still numb, but I can function again. The pain is manageable and minor. I'm told it will heal but will take months. I've had some blurred vision, but that's better than the pain. Lyrica was a life saver.",
                    "I was diagnosed with fobromyalgia in 1997, but wasn't prescribed lyrica until 2007. What a difference. Until lyrica I was in bed and couldn't do anything!!I was vomiting every day and had to be hospitalized several times and had lost several pounds. Now I'm back to work full time which i'd never thought i'd be able to do again. Doing more than simple tasks is a joy, and being able to play with my grand kids is more enjoyable than I can say. I do have to say I have to take pain medicines and muscle relaxers and had a pain pump placed inside my stomach, but with everything I'm almost back to normal. The only negative is the weight gain, but i'll take that. My husband said I needed it anyway. But I can't tell you how happy I am with the lyrica.",

                    "Y'all, like so many others have said, this is a life saver! It got me off my addiction to benzos. I had the \"euphoric\" feeling after a couple of days which unfortunately went away but I'm still happy all the time. I'm no longer having extreme emotions. I thought something was wrong bc I've never felt this way! It's been 4 months and I take 100mg 3x day. I may have had side effects in the beginning but they've gone away. I have however gained 30 pounds in 4 months. That is NOT normal. So it's come to the point that I'm gaining weight too rapidly to control and I must stop the meds. I'm very sad about this, except I'm not bc the lyrica will not allow me to be sad. So yeah. EXTREME WEIGHT GAIN. But amazing drug.",
                    "Lyrica is about as effective as opiates without the baggage that comes with the latter. Lyrica has it's own side effects for me while working up to 450 mg/day including a floaty spaced out sensation, INSANE appetite, and constipation - these side effects largely disappeared at the 2-week point. Pain relief was fairly quick, at about the third or fourth day.",
                    "I have had nerve pain for years. I've had 3 back surgeries from 2011-2014. Also FM and MPS diagnosed in mid 1990s. PAIN has controlled my life for years. I have been on all the opiates and muscle relaxers and anti-anxiety drugs and Neurontin, etc that doctors thought might help. I am very sensitive to medications and the side effects from anti-depressants cause more depression than relief. So, to try another drug was scary for me. I saw a Rheumatologist, and he dx my Arthritis called DISH in my spine. He recommended Lyrica. I finally saw my PCP MD and said let's try this drug. From the 1st pill I had almost total nerve pain relief. I am so amazed! After all these years I feel wonderful. The side effect of being \"Happy\" has been a new feeling",

After trying pregabalin over a two years, with limited success. 150mg once a day (which I was advised, but its not right dosage as it dissipates in 12 hours as I understand it). I then tried 150mg twice a day with limited success and then 300mg twice a day (this had no different). But then I hit on, the idea of taking it, three times, a day, exactly every eight hours (8am, 4pm, 12am) and this completely eliminated my GAD, making me functional, but I have to be very careful to stick to the correct times to take the dose, out by an hour and my GAD returns with vengeance.",

                    "Lyrica has been incredible for my anxiety! Within just a couple days I was running errands without needing to have someone with me due to anxiety, I was doing chores which I without a second thought often delayed and I was enjoying my life and time with my children. I was prescribed pregablin for Fibromyalgia pain and I can't say I've noticed a difference with pain but its done EVERYTHING for my anxiety! I am way less irritable and moody and feel like I can actually enjoy living a happy and complete life for once without worry, fear or nervousness. I went from being a procrastinating home body to a normal feeling, confident person! My side effects have been blurred vision, sometimes a little sleepy and dizziness. Its 100% worth trying!!",
                    "I hate this medication because it hasn't helped any of my joints or nerve pain. The only positive side is it helped my IBS and I don't get stomach attacks anymore. I still have so bad joint and muscle pain all the time, I take 75 mg twice a day and nothing seems to do the trick. I hate the side effects I get a real bad headache too.",
                    "Was put on Lyrica for recurring hip pain (& lower back pain). By one month I was on 2x75mg morning & night. Greatly reduced the pain, but I felt like I was constantly forgetful & would have brain fogs constantly. Have gained just a little weight, but can't do much with my hip anyway. The one thing that has made my Dr decrease the dose back to one a night very quickly, was I became depressive. Unfortunately, would prefer to deal with the pain & find something else, than feel that way. It is effective for pain relief (I found), but unfortunately I suffered some of the bad side effects.",

Since about the third day of taking the low dose of this medication I suddenly began to be extremely tired. I was not feeling like myself at all. I had to leave work early one day and was off for the rest of the week. I also slept for about one whole day. My doctor is aware and wants me to stick with the low dose for now since I am still feeling pretty lethargic during the 3rd week. I hope that it will get better soon. ",

While an active AA member over these years I've found that I still suffered from extreme shyness and anxiety around others. Doctor gave me some samples of Lyrica for Restless Leg Syndrome and I found that it made me quite sociable, talkative and able to let go some of my inhibitions, but without the sloppiness and horrible side effects as something like alcohol. I've tried Benzos and found they just made me feel dulled out and depressed. Lyrica, used periodically (a few times a month) never fails to brighten my mood and make me feel a bit closer to people. On the downside it also makes me feel closer to food. It's very helpful for me.",

Numbing/tingling/foot drop /balance issues all standard with MS. 75 Mg per day and already noticed difference...I can move my toes! Pain is reduced. Gabapentin did not help, baclofen or flexeril same. So far lyrica is doing the trick for me. Dr increasing Lyrica slowly each week to find the right dosage.",
                    "This used in conjunction with Cymbalta is about as good as it gets for nerve pain. In the past I was given Neurontin, Gabapentin, and many others but none were as effective. On the down side I found that the Lyrica in higher doses (150MG - 600MG) left me tired and unable to enjoy my days. I found that I received no greater pain relief taking the larger doses, just more / worse side effects. Even with Lyrica and the Cymbalta some people with extreme pain may still need to use some other type of pain relief in addition to this drug. I take 300MG of Lyrica spread over 4 doses per day and the Cymbalta, and 120MG of OxyContin and up to 40MG Oxycodone for breakthrough pain. In severe cases, a second anti-depressant may be needed in addition to The Cymbalta to help fight the depression that comes with chronic pain. The big down side to both of these name brand medicines is the cost. A months supply of Lyrica with no insurance is over $330 and the Cymbalta will set you back just over $300 each month. Even with insurance these both will end up on the top tier (My co-pay is $50.00 each) and neither of them has a generic equivalent.",

For years after surgery I have had acupuncture, chiropractic care, physical therapy and medications. I have taken methadone, morphine and oxycodone for 4 years. Now I have been taking Lyrica for a year. For the first 6-7 months it was like a wonder drug. It worked as well as anything else aside from dry mouth, weight gain and blurred vision. Now it's not working so well. An MRI showed I have many broad based disc bulges, spondyliosis, stenosis and arthritis. Now looking at a fusion surgery.

It's my 3rd day on it and I am taking 100 mg's now and in two more days will be on 150mg. So far this is amazing. I went golfing today and I had no pain in my swing.

I have lost weight on Lyrica, by been more positive and active. I ignore the increase in appetite and just drink water and it works. Pain is still there but not as bad. It is truly a miracle.",

Neurontin was effective, but only at 1800 mg./day, which left me drowsy (fell asleep anytime I wasn't moving). My MD switched me to Lyrica (75 mg), but when I got to 3 per day, I rapidly gained weight - 10 lbs. in 2 wks!  As a med student, I knew the two meds worked in a similar way and were metabolized similarly. I decreased the Lyrica to 1/ day, which stopped the weight gain, but didn't control the nerve pain, so I added back in one 300 mg. Neurontin per day (both at bedtime, to minimize drowsiness) - still not enough pain control. I added another Neurontin, and that was optimal for me. I take it all at bedtime.",

I started noticing red spots and my head, arms and back wouldn't stop itching. I got Benadryl and after 20 days, the itching is still here, but not as much as when I was taking lyrica.

I am a healthy 46 year old male. The side effects were some fuzziness and weight gain. This may have been due to lack of movement and also the Christmas eating but I put on 3 kilos in two weeks which is a lot for me. I am feeling that I would like to come off it so will reduce dosage and see what happens. At first I was nervous about taking this but it has notably reduced the pain to practically nothing.",

Much lower doses prescribed in Europe to limit side effects listed in some cases here. Seems to help getting to sleep and sleeping through night, wake early though with less of that anxious feeling in stomach. Take 10mg escitalopram (should be on 20 but want to limit the cocktail). Focus here is to be less dependent on benzos which seem less defective.

By the 4th day and 4th dose, I couldn't function.

There were people begging to get back on it. I was on it for four years and by the time the clinical trial ended, and i went through a divorce, I had weaned myself off and didnt need it again until several years later when the fibromyagia became increadably painful. it took YEARS to go through the crappy drugs the insurance co. made me go thru with adverse reactions to get back to Lyrica !",

Then I read about Lyrica, talked to my Doctor got some and stopped my flair-ups. It saved me. Lyrica cut my pain by about 40% and stopped my flair-ups by about 80%. It kind of acts like an anti-depressant for me and makes me a bit hyper-(Good thing) But kills my sex drive and I stopped it for a week, it was hard on me and pain and flair-ups came back. I built a fast resistance to Lyrica fast, I went from 100mg to now 600 mg.

Combined with a good sleep-initiating medicine (i.e. trazodone), pregabalin is an even better lifesaver than alone. Next, pregabalin works quite well for benzodiazepine withdrawals. Lastly, it does work well for depression and anxiety. The downside is that it will dull cognition greatly and can also greatly increase depression at certain doses. For me, the best dose for sleep isn't great for those reasons however lowering the dosage (after a break) has provided better results. Takes experimenting with dosages.",

I have PTSD, insomnia and a history of drug abuse as I was always using drugs to try and help me feel better not to get high. My problem with pregabalin started about 4 days after starting them, I done tons of research and took two 300mg the first time, too much, yeah I felt great but like I said don't want to be high just well.

Was taking gabapentin but only helped a bit, still found walking uncomfortable. Am now taking pregabalin 75mg three times a day and have found this wonderful. I work full time in a busy pharmacy, this has helped me to continue my work and improved my life considerably. Am struggling with weight gain but it's worth it.",

I now take 225 mg twice daily and cannot miss one dose. Nothing else worked. I took up to 600 mg but found no difference in relief so I am on the 225 twice daily. This is one medication that does not mix well with alcohol. It induces a coma like state that lasts for 30 minutes and longer. I was drinking beer and only had 3 beers in 2 hours. Then BOOM goes the dynamite! But am aware of everything going around me but can't move or respond. When it's over, it's over and I am vertical again. So now I know why the ad states avoid alcohol!",

I also take Lamotrigine 100 mg am and pm so perhaps some sort of interaction? I have Bipolar 2 depressive emphasis and traits of BPD. I stopped taking the Lyrica and asked my GP for 50mg. I have been taking 50 mg morning an evening for about three weeks and I have never felt better. Took about a week to really feel a difference.  I cannot remember a time when I felt so good. Well I can but I had to give up sugar, carbs, alchohol, practice meditation and exercise.... I am calmer and I sleep so well, seven hour stretches!!! I'm also finding my mood lifting and so am more productive a appropriatly sociable. Helenx",

I woke up on day 3 - No relief. Lyrica just completely stopped working by day 3 & I was back to agony. I continued on my dose of 75mg each night for over 3 weeks, I then upped the dose to one 75mg in the morning & two 75mg at night. I've been on this higher dose now for a few weeks and still absolutely no relief. I must say that I've experienced little side effects - Some memory loss & tiredness. No weight gain at all. If Lyrica had have kept working I would have been really happy but unfortunately it just stopped working for me! I'd recommend at least trying it for anyone that's considering",

I have tried everything from trigger point injections to high doses of opioids. Nothing really worked on the underlying pain. Yes I would have some relief but the nerve pain was always there. So now after being on maintanence methadone for a year I have started taking lyrica for the past month with really good results. Now I am starting to slowly to come down off the methadone because of the great results from this medication. I was pleasantly surprised. I just hope it can continue the good work.",

                    "I will start off by saying it did cause weight gain. My clothes fit the same but the number on the scale went up about 7-10 pounds depending on the day. I cannot say this is solely because the drug- I think I can safely say that this is because my pain has improved so drastically that I have appetite again. I can keep the weight off if I really want to, but I am not overweight and I am content with my appetite finally being back after years of struggles that I don't think it's a problem. Regardless, I have been on lyrica for almost a year now. It has drastically improved my nerve pain, joint stiffness and swelling (along with a gallon of water a day), appetite, energy, and sleep. I am not pain free but no fibromyalgia patient truly ever is pain free but my pain has gone from an average of 8-9 down to a 4-5 on my good days. My flare ups are far less frequent and I only experience them once every two or so months which is a huge improvement over every other week. The length of the flare ups is also shortened from 3-5 days down to 2 days maximum. At the beginning of taking the medicine I was slightly drowsy but nothing dangerous. I only take it once a day and I am trying to keep it that way to avoid moving up to 2 doses a day. Lyrica is my miracle drug and has definitely given me my life back. My biggest complaint is the cost and insurance but it could be worse. It costs me $2 a day to feel normal again.",

I use cannibis oil CBD form it helps with inflammation , it sure helps considerably better with no side effects! The cbd form does NOT get you 'stoned, high, or buzzed' it removes the pain. I am extremely grateful for my Cannibis oil, the effects last longer then lyrica tooo! I can enjoy my grandkids again!",

Anyone who is looking into this medication PLEASE at least try it, take it as you told to by your DR. and give it four weeks to fully work it's magic, I almost asked my DR. to take me off it, three weeks into taking it, but my wife told me to give it one more week and BOOM! she was right.

After 11 operations I was depressed and very very sore. both in the abdomen and of course the spine . I drank and drank . It seemed like the only thing that would ameliorate the pain. Three months ago my GP started me on Lyrica . After 3 days , pain was gone, also my anxiety seemed to just hop up and walk away . Im only drinking a few beers on a saturday now. Lyrica saved my life . I dont say that flippantly .",

Upped it to 150mg twice daily and yes, it definitely works to eliminate \"one level of pain\", while leaving some \"levels of pain\" still there. I do feel side effects of feeling calm while having more motivation for projects, some slight feeling of alcohol-like impairment (not so much after less than a week of 300mg/day). I also occasionally use oral cannabis and the Lyrica potentiates it quite a bit. I'm feeling very positive about this medicine, even though it doesn't get at all levels of my pain, I like what it does do for me.",

The pain is not as bad as it was in the beginning, but I am in constant pain and, according to my pain management and spinal and lower limb reconstruction consultants, this will probably always be the case. Initially I thought if I found the right combination of medications I could stop it and so I tried all of the other drugs prescribed for neuropathy, as well as some more experimental ones. Without Lyric I spent a lot of time crying and ended up in hospital a few times because the pain was so bad.",

Weird in that I just felt SO GOOD, almost too good, Then side effects hit. Bad dizziness, but still felt good mentally. Cut the dose to 100mg. Over the next 2 weeks side effects resolved themselves. No weight gain. The artificial high dissipated. What I'm left with is this...NORMAL LIFE. Lyrica gave me my life back. Pray it works for others as well as it's worked for me.",

However, after some time I grew tolerant to it and my pains and anxiety started coming back slowly, so my dose got upped to 150mg twice a day. It works for my anxiety and pains but it makes me really sleepy now. Side effects were only at first weeks, some stomach troubles which disappeared. PS! This is a temporary solution, since you get tolerant to it. Antidepressant is still needed for anxiety.",

The problem is the side effects, the worst being that after three days my eyesight is so degraded that I can not drive, I cannot read anything on the television 6 feet away, there is some eye pain and my eyes seem dry and burning.

Doc then changed prescription to 50mg twice daily. As a painkiller it is fantastic. I've never known a painkiller like it, however one bad side effect is my swollen feet. I fear that I will have to change to something else if it continues to make my feet swell, because it is extremely uncomfortable. Another side effect is the feeling of being drunk. It does however help me to sleep. I haven't slept this well in years, though I wake up feeling groggy. I could live with all these side effects, if I could overcome the swollen feet.",

I have been able to keep the weight off by being very mindful of my hunger, or mindless eating. I am 5'10\" 185lbs. Without Lyrica I don't really get hungry. Mind is bigger than the belly when I order food. With Lyrica I find I could eat a horse, and a cow and maybe a squirl as an after dinner snack ..LOL. It makes me lose what ever normal appetite suppresent that I may have. It does wonders for my nerve pain that started 6 months ago and seems to get worse without Lyrica.",
                    "I am a 39 year old male and sustained a fall back in October shattering both heels and ankles and have been diagnosed with RSD (Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy)and my pain management doctor prescribed Lyrica 300mg twice a day for the burning and pain. I have had 4 epidurals and 1 nerve block and have found that the lyrica works best for me and it works well with the other medicines I take on a daily basis. I have been taking for almost a year now and I have not had any side effects!",
                    "I was prescribed Lyrica (pregabalin) about 6 months ago. I was so shocked by the feelings of unreality it initially caused that I quickly stopped taking it. My fibromyalgia got so bad at the end of the year, that I decided to try it again.  I take low doses, 25 mg 2x a day, sometimes a 50 mg. The effect sets in within hours. My fibromyalgia pain is almost completely gone. A late evening dose allows me to sleep longer. I do feel strange when I take it and my intellectual capacity is quite affected, but the lack of distraction by the pain and a better social interaction with increased confidence levels makes up for that. I have to make sure that authorities and decision-making bodies are aware of my reduced competence.",
                    "I had a Triple Arthrodesis (triple fusion in my foot), and because so many nerves had to be cut, my foot was on fire. I was originally given Nuerotin, which I took, and it bottomed out my blood pressure, I was rushed to the ER unconscious, and kept there until I was okay. Needless to say, I discontinued it, and was given Lyrica....but that made me nervous as well. With my pain over a 10, and the inability to sleep, I decided to try it. I slept well, my pain is decreased some, but isn't gone. I'm only at day 3, and I'm pretty dizzy, sick to my stomach, and sleepy, but that's all so far. I do hope it helps my pain a little more, it's about an 8 now, so we shall see! I'm glad to hear some good stories.",
                    "I had to stop taking Cymbalta because my insurance would no longer cover it. After 2 months of increasing pain to the point I cried all day my Dr prescribed Lyrica after my suggestion. I think after about the 3rd day my pain had decreased dramatically. On the day I went to the Dr, my pain level was 10 and after 4 days of 75mg in morning and evening I would probably rate my pain level of 2. I hope this continues.",
                    "Been on Lyrica for 6 months now. 100mg 2x daily. Has worked great for pain relief. Side effects for me include dizziness and blurred vision. Have tried to change to Savella to see if same relief would happen without side effects, but after 3 days off Lyrica started to feel really bad. No weight gain but I do stay very active.",
                    "Severe neck pain was causing migraines, took several narcotics with no relief. Dr. switched me to Lyrica, pain was gone in three days after two years of terrible pain. Lyrica improved my quality of life to say the least.",
                    "I developed shingles in my face, scalp, and eye in 2005. The initial pain was treated with gabapentin, which didn't work very well. The doc wouldn't prescribe anything stronger. In fact, she hardly recognized that shingles pain was significant. My PHN kicked in when the rash disappeared. I've still got it. I monitored the internet for PHN meds and when Lyrica came out I notified my new doc immediately. He started me out at 100 mg three times a day and when that was only modestly effective he kicked it up to 150 mg X 3. It works very nicely. However there are side effects. My weight gain has been significant. Brain fog happens. I get double vision on an irregular basis. I feel tired. Now my liver values are increasing.",
                    "My husband suffers from neuropathy and his Dr put him on Lyrica 75mg twice a day. The side effects were horrible, he had to stop taking it immediately. He was dizzy, had headaches, off balance, couldn't judge distance, and it looked to him like the walls and floors were moving.",
                    "My doctor prescribed Lyrica for fibromyalgia. As I am very sensitive to medication, I was prescribed 75 mg at bedtime each night.  The first month, I did feel better taking Lyrica. However, after about 4 months I began experiencing strange symptoms.  I could not remember things. My brain was foggy. I wasn't myself and my pain returned. It was a no brainer, so I informed my doctor that I wanted off of this medication.  I've been off Lyrica now for two months and my brain is back to normal. It was very scary to even think how little I was taking and what an impact it made on me.   I am taking apple cider vinegar with honey every morning, exercising a little day, even if I don't want to, and resting when my body needs it.",
                    "Lyrica was the first medication that helped with the nerve pains. It calmed down some of the burning in my toes, especially. It also gave me some hope in addition to pain relief.",
                    "I was prescribed Lyrica nine months ago and ever since I've been on this drug my quality of life has greatly increased because not only does it greatly relieve me of muscle tension and pain it greatly improves my mood and makes me feel like doing things that I normally wouldn't have the energy for.",
                    "My husband was perscribed Lyrica for neuropathic pain. He has been in pain with low back issues since 2005. He has had shots, surgeries, a stim unit inplant. The pain continues to get increase. The lyrica within three days made him completely crazy. Couldn't sleep, very emotional. Started weaning right away. He had side effects all the way to cold and flu like symtoms. This Lyica is horrible, worst medicine he has ever taken and now we're stuck for $100.00",
                    "Made my feet swell",
                    "I have been dealing with Fibromyalgia for many years and my doctor was so excited when Lyrica came out, like it was going to be the cure or something; but it did not help my FMS at all. Not to mention, I had horrific fluid retention! I couldn't wear normal shoes, my hands so swollen I couldn't get my wedding ring on. The swelling lasted for a while even after I discontinued the medication.",
                    "I've tried sertraline, amitriptyline and trazodone for depression and anxiety in the past, but none helped my anxiety as much as this. I was told I couldn't use other anxiety meds because I have low blood pressure, but I can use pregablin. It has helped tremendously. I still have panic attacks but instead of many times daily, it's the odd one here and there when something has particularly stressed me out. It doesn't take away the anxiety completely, it's still there and I have really bad days still and it doesn't help depression, but it's much more manageable than before, likewise my OCD isn't as bad either. The only side effect I experience is weird dreams, insomnia and poor memory/memory loss. I recommend!!!",
                    "Works pretty well for nerve pain and numbness. I have degenerative disc disease along with several other cervical and spinal issues. I started at higher dose that had too many side effects but when my dosage was lowered I had a lot of relief.",
                    "I had been quite a bit of pain for a little over four months. We couldn't figure out what was causing the pain in my face. My doctor figured out that I had Trigeminal Euralgea Facial Nerve Pain. So he started my on Lyrica. We started at 75mg x 2 times a day, and then had to move up to 150mg x 2 times a day. Lyrica really helps to keep the pain away. My chiropractor has said that since taking Lyrica that my back and neck can be manipulated easier than before. I love being able to feel better!",
                    "Helped TREMENDOUSLY with my pain, which is not cured of course, but at LEAST cut my daily pain in half. My old boyfriend is also on this and feels the same way as I do.",
                    "I started taking pregabalin yesterday - start at a low dose 75mg in morning, then 75mg in the evening. The effect was pretty much instant I swear.  I went from being hypersensitive, worrying, stressing and having all these horrible physical symptoms ( from the anxiety disorder I have been diagnosed with ) to being calm, having a subtle feeling of well being... my acid reflux stopped, my muscles have started to lose their tension, the tension headaches are lifting too. Side effects ? a little sleepy, but nothing too severe. I haven't listened to music for months and been able to enjoy it, but today I AM ! ... amazing ! I feel like a normal person, its like the volume has been turned down on life to a level I can manage :)",
                    "I recently stopped taking lyrica after 6 months. I was taking lyrica for nerve pain following a terrible car accident. I wish I had never started taking lyrica. It not only did not help with the pain but only made my condition worse, not to mention the 30 pounds of weight I put on. Also the horrible withdrawal's was worse than I ever could of imagined. I absolutely do not recommend ever starting lyrica",
                    "It didn't work.",
                    "I was on this drug for many years and while in the beginning I felt it helped with both the frequency of headaches and fibromyalgia associated with ME, over time it stopped working. On the flip side, it definitely had a negative effect on my memory. I VERY slowly weaned myself off of it and most of my memory has returned. My insurance only paid a small part of the cost and it is very expensive. I would not use it again. No upside and plenty of downside.",
                    "This drug changed my life with unexpected benefits. I started taking for herniated disc and a lot of nerve damage. I started feeling pain relief immediately. It made me feel very high the first week and I had to be careful how and when I would take it / 150MGs 3xs a day. The high feeling eventually, gradually dissipated  After a week, I noticed my wife smiling a lot with great caution I asked her why and she said she likes how calm and relaxed I am. I'm naturally a very high strung, intense person. I thought about what she said and noticed I actually was very relaxed and things that typically set me off they just didn't anymore. I then read about how the drug helps with anxiety. My insurance doesn't really cover it...I pay 50 for a months",
                    "For 18 months have had severe lumbar, butt and leg pain. Got spinal injections that helped some, but leg pain still was especially bad. Finally had back surgery, which helped the lower back, but not the pain in my hips and legs, which was intense. As usual, had physical therapy, massage, and finally acupuncture. Nothing worked. My doctor finally started me on Lyrica at 50 mg before bed, then 100, and finally at 200 mg before bedtime. It has reduced the pain about 70 percent. It also helps me sleep like a log, and the only side effects are some dizziness in the morning, but by around 10 AM that goes away. Great stuff!",
                    "I too progressed from Gabapentin to Lyrica, 100mg 3x a day. I have chemically-induced neuropathy from 6 months of chemo. My hands and feet are numb, tingling, like they are asleep. Lyrica is supposed to be an advanced form of the Gabapentin, though I have seen little difference. I have increased appetite and some swelling in my hands and ankles. I continue using Lyrica because I need something for the hot shooting pain. This was the last med prescribed for my neuropathy.",
                    "This is poison, destroyed my life, horrible side effects and made my pain so much worse. Detoxing is a living hell and makes coming off narcotics a walk in the park. It's horrible and should be taken off the market.",
                    "On narcotics, muscle relaxers for neuropathic pain from inoperable herniated discs, arthritis in back. Narcotics cut in half by doctor and prescribed Lyrica, 75mg once at night, then 75mg am and pm and on til taking 150mg am, pm. Nothing. Today an additional 75 mg to be added midday.  Decided to check here before taking more. Wow. I have had left hand/arm jerks where my arm just flies up, once throwing iPad mini across the room, another time scatting nuts everywhere while chopping them. I now realize this condition started with Lyric and gets worse with increased dosage. I am going to slowly stop this drug because a) it does nothing for pain, and b) what has it done to my brain?",
                    "It helps with my seizures as well as my fibromyalgia so I've always been really happy with my Lyrica. I've been on it for years now.",
                    "Had a slipped disc with sciatic pain diagnosed before new year.  Had been having heart palpitations, anxiousness, blurry vision and having suicidal thoughts. Felt could be due to the drugs I'm taking and turns out... it's all from lyrica. ",
                    "I've used Lyrica for a while now and it seems that my body is getting so used to the drug that it's not working like it first did. I take 75mg in the morning and 75mg at bedtime. I either need to increase my dose or find something else that will work. It's hard to function during my days because of the pain.",
                    "I suffer from severe peripheral neuropathy. It is unusual in the sense that it is not diabetes caused, but is apparently idiopathic and hereditary. I have excellent relief from Lyrica with few side effects. I find myself nodding out occasionally at my computer or watching TV. I exercise more, drink more coffee, and allow more time for sleep. The more I take, the greater the relief. I take 400mg per day. ",
                    "Instant joint pain gone....anxiety gone....only been 1 week...hopeful it lasts...so far it's a miracle for me..I'm also on cymbalta and klonipin",
                    "I was given this medicine from my Dr. I told her I would research it but I paid $25 and picked it up. What a waste of money, I should've researched first. After reading this I'm deathly afraid to take this drug so I won't be. Thank you for all the reviews.",
                    "I have only been diagnosed for about a year now. I have completely lost my life due to fibromyalgia pain. My doctor started me on Cymbalta, which worked for awhile but then stopped, then put me on Lyrica without weaning me off Cymbalta....WITHDRAWALS hello. Had to start again and wean off while also taking Lyrica. The Lyrica seemed to help at first too, then wham just like everything else, stopped working....EXCEPT on weight gain and brain fog. I was a zombie. So now I'm worsening day by day even though I try to stay active have cut all caffeine, etc. because my doctors just don't believe pain medicines help and say there isn't much else they can do for me. Glad for the people it has helped.",
                    "I have Fibromyalgia and developed horrific back/sciatic pain last year. I started taking lyrica about 3 months ago and within a week,I could walk properly. I could sleep, I could exercise and I thought it had fixed everything.  Then my elbow started hurting. I just thought I'd strained it at the gym. The pain became excruciating. Then it hit the other arm until 3 days ago when it got so bad, I couldn't move my arms properly. It felt like my arms were inflamed from my shoulders to my finger tips. I stopped taking it 2 days ago and the arm pain is starting to go. But the back pain is starting to come back. I also have had no idea what day it is for the last 3 weeks which I thought was stress but suspect is the lyrica.",
                    "When I first started Lyrica, my pain almost totally disappeared. After about 3 weeks, my pain started returning. My tongue started to tingle and was sore.",
                    "I was prescribed Pregabalin by my GP for anxiety disorder. I am 27 and have had anxiety since a teenager. I have never tried meds before. I have just gone up to 600mg. I have definitely experienced side effects (blurred vision/dizziness/drowsiness). The side effects do wear off but it does take some perseverance in the beginning to get to grips with it. I felt 'out of it' for a few days. I definitely feel less anxious. It's hard to tell how well it is working but I definitely have the ability to look at 'stressful' and 'anxious' situations with far more clarity. I am a designer and I always worried if taking meds would suppress my creativity but in fact - I think it helps me to have more confidence in my ideas.",
                    "I was diagnosed with adult onset Diabetes last Dec. I started on Metformin 750 and almost immediately my fasting glucose dropped to 94. That is what it has been since but I have been bothered with neuropathy for months. I tried Lyrica for 3 months and it did absolutely nothing for the pain. I am presently taking gabapentin 300 mg at bedtime and it helps slightly. The cost for the Lyrica was money out the window.",
                    "I am glad that Lyrica has helped many, just did nothing for my nerve pain and tons of side effects.",
                    "Just started Lyrica 75mg twice a day yesterday. My first dose, I felt extremely drunk, and could not function. I took my second dose at bedtime, and slept through the night, and woke up refreshed! I had no aches or pain. My 3rd dose, this morning, again feeling a little drunk, and off balance... but again, I feel good. I can actually sit still at work, without having to move around and try to be comfortable. I am going to stick with this medication, and hope that the side effects go away in a couple of days.",
                    "I had been experiencing major depressive disorder and I have an anxiety disorder. I have tried every antidepressant on earth and had suicidal ideation with each one, even after one pill! I have some nerve pain so I tried gabapentin but didn't really get any relief from it so I asked my doctor for some lyrica. The NEXT DAY I felt the depression lift and the anxiety came to a manageable level where I felt I could function well and go out in public. I recently started vaping nicotine and the anxiety is back. I am going to quit and continue to take the lyrica. When I feel really anxious I take 10 mg of valium with it and I am in heavenly bliss. No pain, no worries, just normal albeit a bit sedated but still very functional.",
                    "I had an accident in April 2016. Riding lawnmower fell on top of me in a deep ditch. It knocked me out and caused severe lumbar spinal stenosis , pinched nerves . Up until this year I was in a lot of pain due to the nerves being pinched by my spine. All this time I have seen 3 doctors, really 4, one neurologist, 2 neurosurgeons, internist. No one even suggested Lyrica for my pain...except the neurologist who did the nerve conduction study. He said it worked for restless leg syndrome which I also have. I go some Lyrica and tried it. It has brought me from 10 pain level to a 2 or 3. I get up early now like I used to, I have the will to do things on my property etc. I had lost the desire to even get out of bed, I wish I had tried Lyrica a lot sooner, it gave me my life back.",

I am getting as good or better pain control with the Lyrica alone as I was with the Duragesic patch and without the added fatigue.",
                    "I couldn't make it without my Lyrica! This medicine has absolutely changed my life. I was hurting all the time and used all my energy just to work. There was no joy in my life until I was prescribed this medicine. Now I work and feel like doing the things I enjoy, like working in my flower garden. I thank God everyday for this medication!",

After many years of being tried on just about every drug out there FINALLY a drug that actually helped me!..I now drive again and sometimes leave the house alone and even on occasion brave the supermarket ALONE..After 3 years on the same dose and with its effect starting to wane I am now on 150mg twice a day..And yes I am very tired, vague and spaced out, but this will wear of with time as my body adjusts..And regarding the weight gain, I have lost 5 stone, and have regained some control.",
                    "I was prescribe Lyrica for a pinched nerve in my elbow after a dislocation. The pain made physical therapy intolerable. With just one dose of 75mg of Lyrica, I could bend my elbow without wincing. Absolutely marvelous. Unfortunately there were 2 side effects that make me stop taking it. First one was that I fell asleep almost immediately after taking it for about 2 hours and my brain felt very foggy after I woke up. Second issue was a slight tightness in the chest and feeling a little out of breath. Not severe, but enough to let me know that I couldn't take it again. Made me sad because it really worked.",

Once could top out any IQ tests but my husband says I can't even find my \"behind\" anymore. Taking it for neuropathy & came home from complete knee surgery with foot drop in leg operated on. Now the other foot has dropped half way so I am all but an invalid. No more going outside for me to enjoy our horses on our farm. The dry mouth I got with Lyrica also frightens me as afraid I will lose my teeth as others have. Lyrica also causes severe sleepiness. I guess it MIGHT have stopped the shooting pains in my feet at night?",

I think the Lyrica is really working. I am still tired, but I feel it is a normal tired from having two kids and running around with them. The way I felt before, I couldn't move. I really don't want to use the Neurontin, I don't want to lose the benefits that I have gained.",
                    "Lyrica works well on my chronic neck pain which I have had for 4 years. But I have gained about 30 pounds so am considering trying Neurontin to see if effects are the same but without the weight gain!",

Doctors put me on Neurontin which just made me neurotic...and did not help the pain. A month after switching to Lyrica, I was able to lose the crutches, and a few weeks later the prosthetic supporting my leg. After four months, yes I still have a crushed nerve, but pain and hypersensitivity dropped to bearable levels and after six months off all medication but Motrin. Four years later... I have a resurgence of RSD due to a back injury. Lyrica had me back walking in two weeks and has continued to reduce the pain levels.",

                    "I was on Lyrica for 2 years. At first it was fabulous! But over time I needed to keep increasing the dosage to get the same result. The side effects were bad for me. In the two years I was on it I gained 60 lbs and my hair started falling out. I have since switched to Neurontin with no side effects and my hair is slowly coming back. Lyrica was a miracle for me for about 18 months but as they say all good things must come to an end.",
                    "I would give it a 10, then a 1. At first the medicine worked GREAT but then 30 days later it just quit. After a few months I gave up on it, I occasionally retry the medicine but no luck.",
                    "Taking Lyrica hasn't helped my Fibrmyalgia symptoms at all, and even though I'm on a starter dose of 75 mg once per day the side effects are terrible! I tremble so badly it appears as if I have Parkinson's disease. I can't hand write at all and let alone many other daily functions. It has affected my thinking terribly and makes my mind race and my thoughts are very jumbled which makes me feel extremely anxious, plus when talking my speech is very shaky sounding and very fast and slurry. I also have a lot of trouble urinating. I find it extremely difficult to empty my bladder and at times very painful. I was already taking sleeping tablets ( Temazipan), but Lyrica has made getting to sleep even worse. My chest and nose both feel congested.",

I suffer from back, buttock, leg & feet pain from a 360 degree double spinal fusion of L4-L5 & L5 & S1 done 20 years ago. Nerve pain is now ruining my life. However since being on this medicine my pain is now around a 2-3 out of 10 from being anywhere between 5-9. The only real side effect I am having is feeling \"High\" 24 hrs a day. Supposedly this will go away in time. I also feel uplifted and it has helped with my depression. I do feel a bit aggressive at times too. I have been keeping a close check on my weight too but nothing has changed. My normal weight is 75 kgs and I'm fit & strong as I workout in the gym regularly which helps control back pain.",

I had previously taken Cymbalta 60mg for 7/8 years and was feeling that it was no longer as effective so my doctor prescribed Lyrica. I noticed a large amount of weight gain (which I would not have minded if helped the pain!) about 50 pounds over 6 months before it stabilized. After some time of taking the medication (9 months or a year I forget) I was always complaining to my doctor about pain and fatigue being bad so he switched me to Savella. I noticed a huge difference and I lost the weight!",
                    "Lyrica was great as a pain reliever. It is not a pain killer. The side effects were brutal - weight gain, swelling, water retention yikes. I only stayed on Lyrica a few months. I am now trying Robaxasil.",

I've been on lorazepam, alprazolam, and clonazepam and all 3 became ineffective after 6 months to 1 year and were extremely difficult to get off of. I don't notice any tolerance issues with pregabalin either. I've been on the same dose for about 2 years. Better than any of the benzodiazepines and other medications I've tried for anxiety. Only side effects I've noticed are calmness, sedation, and increased appetite but exercise and healthy eating take care of any weight gain.",
                    "I was prescribed Lyrica for nerve pain as well as tingling/numbness/electricity feeling in my legs. Since I have been taking it (about 6 months now) these symptoms are all but gone. The only side effects I have are short term memory loss and concentration issues but I am able to work around these in most cases. Lyrica has been amazing for me.",

I still have pain but it has been knocked down some and it does help me sleep. I have fibromyalgia, small fiber neuropathy, scoliosis, osteoarthritis, collapsed discs, disc disease.",
                    "I've been on lryica for a month now. 150 mg 2x a day. It works wonders for the awful muscle spasms and fibromyalgia pain but I do have side effects. I have to do every thing from chores to running errands before I take it. Once I take I become unbalanced, forget words and become extremely tired. I sleep a lot and very heavy and usually can't remember the previous day. I definitely cannot function after I take it. I don't care for the side effects but so far has been the only thing that has worked for me. I tried cymbalta, neurton, zanaflex, flexeral lots of things. To me its worth taking the lryica as those terrible rib and back spasms keep at bay..and after two years of dealing with those I don't ever want to again. btw does kill my appetite.",

I finally see the world again the way it was supposed to be seen and can enjoy the grass under my feet in the park. Honestly these little things make a world of difference and move me like nothing else. I feel connected with the world yet again.",

I lost those yrs of my life sleeping 17 hours a day and the pain was horrible even taking 90mg a day and 30mg of Valium. I went to Wilmington Treatment Center to stop the medicines & so they started me on the Lyrica 450mg per day. It saved my life. Without the Lyrica I was awake for 3 days crying in pain, could not lay in a bed due to the sheets touching me, my core temperature would not come up, I was freezing but everything burned my skin if it touched me. The Lyrica within 2 hours gave me hope and I started turning around for the better. My life is so much better now. My family is glad to have me back!",
                    "I JUST started using this drug 3 days ago. I have been suffering with horrible pain from a herniated disc over the past 2 months. Tried hydrocortisone shots in my back and the pain went away for 3-4 days. I've been on vicodin and skelaxin as well as Aleve twice a day. I've had to take my vicodin every 4 hours instead of every 6 hours because the pain has been so bad. Just in the last 48 hours, I've noticed such a difference with Lyrica. I keep waiting for the pain to be there, but it is NOT. I'm still titrating my way up on the dosage, but in another day or two, my maximum dose will be 50 mg 3 times a day. Currently, I'm taking 50 mg 2 times a day. It really works.",

The things that bothered me before no longer bother me. I am a smoker and since starting Lyrica I no longer crave cigarettes. I have had severe back pain due to arthritis and I no longer have back pain! It does however make me hyper. I can live with that, and it makes me hungry, but this stuff works really well for me.",
                    "Worked wonders at the start. Was up to 600mg a day. I don't eat the best but I do think this did make me gain weight. I live in the great white north but I struggled with balance, fell often, and also had trouble putting my thoughts into words. These side effects are now gone now that I'm off this. Balance and communication much better now that I'm off.",
                    "I recently started taking Lyrica for two herniated discs. The doctor said I have massive nerve damage that will result in surgery but suggested taking this medication temporarily until surgery because my pain was unbearable! At first I was a little off balance but within a week I wasn't constantly in pain....within a month my pain was almost gone and I refuse to do surgery now! Thanks Lyrica for making this happen!",
                    "75mg x2 daily - no noticeable effect. 150mg x2 daily - slight effect of calm, not really therapeutic. 300mg x2 daily - feeling calm, a little sleepy, but I quite like that... it is still early days, but I don't feel the need to take any valium anymore. I stopped it weeks ago. I like being in this calm fluffy state, rather than sweating and thinking 100 miles an hour and stressing out. I am taking this medication for an anxiety disorder, panic attacks and lower limbs pain and walking problems...supposedly they are all linked.",

Over the few months however I have had increased swelling in my joints and gained 15 lbs with no change in eating habits. I started feeling confused with memory loss, then two weeks ago I started feeling suicidal. I did not ever suffer from depression but could not get the thought of just taking a bottle of pills. Due to my experience of working with mental health I knew something was not right so I am now working at reducing Lyrica and going off of it . I think it was amazing for the pain but not worth the risk with the change in my mental state.",

I tried nuerotin years ago but after the second day I could not function, so any one with nerve pain should give this a try. .it sure has helped me",

I started taking Lyrica for some unresolved jaw pain thought to have arisen from my wisdom tooth extraction. It was like a switch had been flipped, the next morning I woke up completely refreshed; a feeling I hadn't experienced in years. I experimented on-and-off to determine whether Lyrica was indeed the reason for this change in energy and mood. Indeed, nights that I took Lyrica (75mg) I was completely refreshed and motivated the next day. This contrasted my normal routine greatly, where I would typically take high doses of vyvanse (75mg-max dose) at 5 am just to wake up. Game changer for depression.",

Over the next 5 months it pretty much stopped working for the pain and the side effects became very worrying. I could not think straight and was dangerously clumbsy. I was is a malaise and did not wish to do anything so I decided to quit. I followed the instructions to taper over at least a week, then the real problems began. This is a horrendous drug to come off, I had to reinstate as I went out of my mind. I am now tapering at 10% as and when I can. I feel so unwell, anxiety has spiralled, depression, suicidal thoughts, insomnia, lack of appetite, sweats, the list could go on it has been a hellish period.",

I was diagnosed with bipolar II, GAD and mixed anxiety and depressive disorder, all I can say week 2 on this medication has saved my life! I'm on 75mg twice a day and can increase if I wish too, but with the way I am feeling at the moment I feel I don't need too. I can leave the house, I'm going back to work next week, and my girls have their mummy back, also suffer from damaged nerves in my lower back, it's helped so much with the pain. It's a miracle",

                    "I started taking lyrica about 4 years ago for fibromyalgia and found it lowered my daily pain by about 60%. While I do not suffer from GAD, I have always had feelings of anxiousness and physical feeling of restless uneasiness, and also restless leg syndrome. It was an unexpected side benefit that the lyrica helped control these feelings. After about a year and a half of taking 150 mg twice a day, I began to worry about addiction, and decided to cut back in an effort to possibly quit altogether. I soon found that my anxiousness and restlessness seemed worse than before, so I went back to my full 300mg per day dose, and have remained at that dosage. While on lyrica, I intentionally lost 35 lbs, and have not gained any weight back for 3 years",

After surgery I was also experiencing new pain of stabbing, electrical sensations in addition to the pain I previously had. I was prescribed Neurontin and the doctor kept raising the dose with no difference in my pain. I heard of similar experiences and being switched to Lyrica and it made a huge difference. I was in so much pain day after day. I switched to Lyrica and I have had nearly full relief of the pain I was having. I can't even describe how much this medication has helped me.

I don't have the side effects from it that most have, and it works to control the pain, although I do have neuropathy flare ups from time to time. I'm taking it as a result of neuropathy from spinal chord injury. and my insurance pays for it so no out of pocket costs. I recommend this to people who have nerve pain.",
                    "Like many others, my pain doctor had me on gabapentin first, then after several months without relief, switched me to Lyrica. Without a generic version available, it can cost a small fortune depending on your insurance. Without any insurance, 100mg capsules 3X daily, 90 pills will cost upward of $600! With my Part D, and not qualifying for \"Extra Help\" through the state, I'm now paying $140 for a 2 week supply, $280 monthly. That's a car payment! I have no idea what to do once the free samples run out, it's a very good medication but unaffordable. If your doctor tells you gabapentin (Neurontin) works the same, chemically there's no difference, that just isn't true. It may be similar, but Lyrica works much better with significantly less mg's",

This pill made it worse. I took 50 mg at bedtime for about a week. The doctor said it takes a while to get into the system. I'm not waiting that long.

The dose increased again with good effect. I do notice if I am late on a dose or miss a dose, sure pay for it, takes some time for pain to come back under control. I say as I write this at 5 am having not slept a wink. I'm currently on 150 mg twice daily. I'm gaining a belly but have not gotten on the scales, initially giddy and absent minded but that has subsided even with dosage increases. I think its a good drug choice for me. here hoping.",

So last year I stopped taking it as I still had a lot of nerve pain. But since I have been off it I realized just how much it actually did for me. I started suffering from crippling anxiety, my pain has gotten progressively worse and my hand tremors have returned. So after 9 months off it I am back on it again as I need a quality of life and Lyrica gives me that. It may not work for everyone but it does for me. I have fibromyalgia and General Anxiety.",

I just feel normal. My anxiety got so bad it was causing severe stomach problems, I almost had my gallbladder removed. Not only did it cure my anxiety, my stomach issues are gone, as well as my IBS that was a seperate issue, my restless legs are gone!!! GONE, RLS was torture, it stopped me from going to movies or on planes.. but that's not even the best part!

The only side effect that MAY have been due to Lyrica is vision loss, but I have worn glasses for 30 years, so no big deal for my eyesight to slightly worsen over 2 yrs on the drug. Some of the side effects that people mention could be due to menopause rather than Lyrica. I gladly spend $60 for a monthly supply. Other meds I took previously left me like a zombie.

For 6 years, everyday I would have to lay in the tub and the shower hit my back or lay on a heating pad and even at night just to fall asleep I use sleep aids and constant showers or heating pads to get the muscles to stop hurting and spasms and then I couldn't take it anymore. The muscle relaxers wouldn't work and my back and neck were burning and stiff and spasms all day and night and I couldn't sleep and went desperately to a my new doctor that I was seeing and got his associate.

At first probably the first 2 months only side effect I had was a little swelling of my hands. Lyrica was a wonder miracle for me. The doctor had me on it for over 3 years with no problems, then my insurance refuses to pay for it now, because a 30 day supply is $900.00. They wanted to give me Neurontin, which I am allergic too. Now all the nerve pain is back and worse. I want the Lyrica back and would recommend it to any one.",

Lyrica helped a lot, with much less frequency and severity of burning. Finally some relief. Unfortunately, I had to discontinue because of side effects. I had almost all side effects listed in the info sheet. Most I could have tolerated, but the ones I couldn't was weight gain, confusion, and fast progressing blurred vision. Also, I had severe clinical depression over 18 years ago until I received the correct antidepressant. I've had no depression since. However, the Lyrica caused it to return, although not as severe. It also caused anger flareups, very unlike me.",

Day 4, very sleepy and unresponsive, it was so bad that I could not feel my low blood sugar until all my body was shaking and I needed help to take sugar. Day 5, STOP taking the dame thing. Day 6, Pick up the phone, called my doctor and used every word I have learned in English on him and those scientist, who came up with this IDEA.

I thought they were all due to my conditions, but after truly reflecting on my journey Lyrica surely hurt me more than it helped me. I have been off of the medication for about 3 weeks now. I did some research and learned that my detox period would be both difficult and long because 1, I took the medication for several years, I took a high dosage andi stopped the medicatiod cold turkey.

However, when prescribed Lyrica for fibro pain, my headaches were gone to maybe 3 a week. So I highly recommend this for serious headache problems. Does help with Fibro pain. But, weight gain and dry mouth are my biggest side effect and is to the extent that I almost want to go back to 8 Excedrin a day. Hope this helps someone!",

The medicine is astoundingly good for me at combating depression, anxiety, overall body pain & morning stiffness. It takes higher doses of Lyrica to feel pain relief for most people with Fibromyalgia- those who say it doesn't work have often only tried it at <300mg a day. I take 300mg twice a day. The only bad side effect is weight gain- 100lbs. (And I'm naturally overweight to begin with, so this was terrible). It did eventually stop making me gain, but I have to eat less and work out more than everyone else I know, just to maintain my weight, let alone lose.",

Off course this still left me with pain and numbness from my neck down both arms. About a month or so ago I switched to a spine and pain management doctor and he put me on the Lyrica (75mg 3x daily) and a Duragesic patch.

Yesterday I went across the street, came back to my house to get the garden hose, back across the street to water my neighbors plants, and lugged the hose back home. Suddenly I realized, I forgot my walker. I completely forgot it. I wake in the morning, pain free. I am walking now without the walker, it has also improved my mood. I used to cry a lot, because I could not do the \"normal\" things, people my age can do. I am 50 years old, and have been on disability for 8 years. I feel like a new person.",
                    "I have suffered with severe anxiety and depression for years. I tried 6 different antidepressants as well as benzodiazepines and all did nothing for me of any help. Eventually I was put on Pregabalin by a Psychiatrist and it was very helpful almost from day one. We increased my dose until I take the maximum of 300mg twice a day. At this dose my anxiety has been pretty much eliminated, I am happy and now an active person. However a word of warning to anybody taking this medicine for a long time: DO NOT allow yourself to suddenly withdraw from it. I recently had to go a week without it and it was a living hell for me. Withdrawal symptoms for me were as follows: severe anxiety and depression, suicidal ideation, inability to sleep, nausea and vomiting",
                    "I have been on 300 mg of Lyrica a day for a double herniation in my back. The side effects I experienced were dizziness, anxiety and sleeplessness. However, I did not gain weight. Maybe that is because I had read that you could gain weight and I changed my diet so that I would not. In fact, I lost 25 lbs. while on it. I read that I am in the minority with this. I can say for the most part Lyrica helped, but I had to take Advil with it. Overall, it helped.",
                    "I have fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis. I took one Lyrica pill and it caused me to hallucinate. I was afraid to take another one so I had my pharmacist dispose of the medicine for me. ",
                    "Did not work only gained weight",
                    "I feel compelled to write a review on Pregabalin, and having been on the medicine for nearly a year now, I feel I can fully evaluate its effects.  I was put on Pregabalin for generalized anxiety disorder and seasonal affective disorder by my Doctor. At first I was put on a very low dose of 75mg, which did next to nothing. I immediately requested to have the dose increased until finally I reached a dose that was effective enough for me (600mg). For a while the medicine did its job and I actually felt like my anxiety had been reversed. I suffer bad social anxiety, and 300mg of this made me quite extroverted and confident. I would say it was 'pro social' for sure. Alas tolerance set in and now even 800mg doesn't do much of anything apart from prevent withdrawals.",
                    "Been taking lyrica for 4 months now for carpel tunnel and neuropathy in hands and feet. It is no good. It has not stopped the pain at all, makes me so dizzy I am afraid to drive my car, legs swell like balloons, and have gained over 30 pounds in 3 months. A clinical research was recently done in Australia on lyrica (for Acute and Chronic Sciatica) and the findings stated it had the same effect as the research subjects getting placebos or sugar pills. The makers have racked in 3 billion dollars on it. I told my doc it isn't working but he still prescribes it to me, finding another doc this week. I just got a months supply, 90 pills 3 times a day, 150 mg at a cost of $1,111.19. Biggest drug ripoff in history.",
                    "I was in constant pain 24/7, and I used to take so many showers to try to get some relief. Nothing helped and I was in tears, I just could not stand the pain and discomfort any longer. My sister was on Lyrica because she had Fibromyalgia and got relief. So the next time I was at the doctors I asked him about taking Lyrica and he thought that it was a good idea. It took awhile but each day that went by more of my pain left me, and now I am pain free from Fibromyalgia. My side effects was gaining weight and that was about it. Any day I would gain 20-30 lbs. to get rid of that terrible pain. Thank you Lyrica.",
                    "I'm only taking 50 mg at night for my leg sciatica pain and I feel dizzy at times. I'm also using Dr. Ho TENS machine on my lower back for 40 minutes to scramble the signal pain. I think both are helping right now. I was on a higher dose over 300mg a few years ago and my hands and feet swelled up and I gained 30 pounds I can't get rid of now even with water pills, so I had to stop med. I've had shingles right when I turned 50 before I could get the Shingles vaccine which I recommend to everyone as shingles is painful! I took only Lyrica 25mg two or three times a day to stop the shingles pain, A low dose due to side effects from a larger dose.",
                    "Lived with a severe generalized anxiety disorder for the last 10 years, last 5 years particularly full of anguish and \"crippling\" discomfort. Always misdiagnosed as a depression: been on SSRIs for 4 years with no success; also resistant to benzodiazepines. I was starting to believe I'd have to live like this forever until today! I got my very first dose of Lyrica (just a tiny 25mg) and after it kicked in (4 hours) I've been feeling myself, like I didn't since I was a boy! Layers of heavy bricks lifted away from my chest, and I finally feel like any human is supposed to feel. Today is undoubtedly the happiest day of my last 5 years. I feel lighthearted and motivated, serene and willing to restart my life like I was born again.",
                    "After very successful spinal surgery in Thailand, I went without pain for almost 3 years. I was all but in a wheel chair prior to surgery. I then took a bad fall and pain came back. Fully expecting surgery I returned to Thailand and doctor suggested Neurontin. Although I got some relief, the side effects were intolerable. He then put me on Lyrica. It stopped the pain within 24 hours. He said it would take a few days. I was on it about 45 days and then weaned myself off. I think anyone with spinal stenosis should ask your doctor about this. I think they have just approved it for back pain here in the States. My surgery was in 2005, and went back in 2008. It was a miracle for me.",
                    "Lyrica stops the pain in the ball of my feet. It's wonderful to be able to walk without the pain. I am diabetic and take insulin. I too have had a weight gain of 35 lbs over the past 6 months. I seem to suffer from a bit more memory loss than before and I fatigue easily. I have caught myself dozing off in front of the computer at work, so I force myself to get up and walk around a bit. All in all a small price to pay for the relief of the pain in my feet.",
                    "This is very good for my generalized anxiety disorder along with olanzapine. I take 100mg at night, it helps me sleep too.",
                    "After suffering from horrible post herpatic neuralgia in the trigeminal nerves on the left side of my face, I went to a neurologist who put me on Lyrica. A small dose of 50 mg each night keeps my symptoms under control. I tried adding a morning dose, but it made me giggle at inappropriate times, so I went back to only taking it at night. For over two years my pain has been controlled well. One night I forgot to take my medicine and the next day I had a painful attack. I'll never forget it again! I'm so thankful for this medicine. There are so many other medicines that I tried and could not take, but this one works great for me.",
                    "Good for generalized anxiety disorder but side effects were bad.",
                    "Works pretty well for the pain, but having severe side effects (involuntary musclular movement involving jerking of legs and difficulty speaking, urinary retention and inability to urinate, dramatic weight gain of 30 pounds so far)",
                    "Had neuropathic pain in right upper jaw after dental work. Tried many different medicines including tricyclic's eventually put onto Lyrica went up to 900mg as well as Endep 40mg. Couldn't tolerate Endep, worked my way back down to 600mg Lyrica and after 6 months the nerve pain is tolerable. What I didn't' realize was all the side effects that I now believe stems from Lyrica, severe bloating, sore eyes, memory loss, word problems, hand and feet pains, plus more. I have now found that it makes little difference between 75 or 300mg for pain relief. I have difficulty sleeping without any, 75 will eventually help but 300 gets me to sleep faster. After reading so many people complaining about the same side effects, I will be seeing my Dr.",
                    "I just started with this medication. I took one 75 mg pill in the late evening before going to sleep. When I took it I said to myself yea right this little tiny pill will somehow give my life back to me...the next morning when I awoke to my surprise, I felt like I did years ago. I could walk and stand without the aching and hurting. I was not as tired nor as sore in my muscles. What a wonderful little miracle this little pill is!!!",

I have shed many tears in pain and dejection, but not so many lately. Thanks Lyrica.",

An episode of severe pain and nerve issues recently meant I was signed off for 4 weeks to rest, however during this time my whole nervous and neurological pain got worse as well as physical collapse and spread to my face hands, arms and body functionality. The lowest point in five years thus far. I was put on Pregablin 75mg /2x day and although the first week was strange with hyper elation, a foggy mind and some humorous speech issues but when it kicked in the transformation was amazing. 3 months later I'm far more stable and working fulltime. Some back pain has returned with occasional sciatica.",

                    "I just weaned myself off of Cymbalta/Neurontin and started taking 50mg Lyrica capsules twice a day. I have been taking Lyrica for only TWO DAYS and have had amazing results. I may be reporting on this drug too soon but I am finding my pain receding greatly. I am feeling almost \"normal\", my spirits are definitely raising and hope that I can avoid nerve cutting surgery that would be my last choice for relief. I am an optimist by nature and am so hoping that 100mg a day will keep me pain free and away from the scalpel.",
                    "Lyrica has its pros and cons like any other medicine in the market. Lyrica has helped me in many ways including neuropathic pain and depression together with other antidepressants. The only side effect that bothers me a little is the fact that I feel tired most of the time but I can still function with a lot of calmness. On the other hand I have tried every single medicine for insomnia during the last 12 years with not so great results until I found this medicine. Now I sleep like a baby at 150mg twice a day.",
                    "I had minor back surgery and one result was nerve damage to the nerves from my right leg socket to my hip. Severe burning several times per year. Lyrica stops the severe pain slowly and reduces it to tolerable pain. I use 75mg on a nine day regimen - 3x for 3 days, 2x for 3 days and 1x for 3 days. It works good. The pain slowly resides and is gone by 6th day. No serious side effects. Slight vision blurring and minor lack of mental focus. Very minor. Overall, I think it works for me. Has not affected appetite, weight, mental attitude or sleeping habits.",
                    "My own experience was awful. I did not gain weight but I had been suffering with depression because of all the pain I was in. My doctor prescribed these which in my option she should have never done specially when I was very down at the time. I've never experienced such thoughts in my life the only time I got a break from my own thoughts was when I was sleeping. If you are feeling down at all while taking these my advice go see your doctor ASAP do not continue with these not advisable to anyone with depression",

It helped a little, but still had substantial back pain requiring Ultracet 3x per day and Lortabs when pain peaked. Have been on Lyrica 75mg 3x per day for past 11 days. Really reduced the pain the first few days, but pain came back a bit. Still, the Lyrica is helping and I've not had to take the Lortabs since starting Lyrica. I'm going to stick with Lyrica for a few more weeks before deciding to try more injections or other medicines.",
                    "I have been taking Lyrica for about 1 year and I went from hurting all the time to just my occasional spells. I don't know what I would do without it.",
                    "The real problem I had and still do is dosing. I started out on 150mg twice a day and found it too much at first. GP reduced dose to 75mg three times a day and 1 x 75mg when needed. That is my current dose and the side effects are worth it based on the fact that I've had painful neuropathy in both my feet and lower legs. The breakthrough pain was the main issue I was having trouble with and DID NOT want any more narcotics than I currently take...60mg. MS Contin x 24hours and 2 Statex when required per 24 hours. It can mess with your head a little like feeling like you are a bit spaced out. Works wonderfully and I hope I don't build a tolerance. ",

I'm now in the process of gradually reducing the dose over a period of 8 days. My main reaction was a feeling of being drunk. I refused to drive during this time. On a scale of 1-10 I rate the pain relief a 5 or 6.",

                    "I have had fibromyalgia now for more than 20 years and my back pain was getting out of control. I had been taking a low dose of Lyrica (25mg) for some years, along with a cocktail of about 15 other drugs. I did some research, and came up with the fact that Lyrica was licensed for fibromyalgia, and took this to my doctor, who thought it would be an idea to try increasing the dose. After 3 months I am now up to 100mg night and morning, and am getting reasonable pain relief. However, I have severe side effects,the worst one being disturbed sleep every night through foot and leg cramps. I only have to stretch my legs slightly and it starts. Am getting disrupted sleep every night because of it. ",
                    "I really didn't notice much difference after 6 months on Lyrica - still had minor headaches, but apparently swelling went down (MRI). I DID notice the sleepiness at first, followed by insomnia and 30 lbs weight gain in that 6 months and swollen fingers and belly area.",
                    "I didn't even know Lyrica was prescribed as an off lable treatment for anxiety. I was mainly taking it for my fibromyalgia and phantom pain from an amputation. And I didn't realize until now I had full blown GAD and have probably had it since my teens.  I thought it was mostly depression. I journal and I can see that when I have been on Lyrica I didn't reach the extreme kind of depression I've been in. I recently tried to quit again because it causes me to be lethargic and to not be able to lose weight. It may have been some withdrawal symptoms, but within a week I was in grueling depression-anxiety. The DAY I started back on my 75mg/day Lyrica I started feeling better!",
                    "This didn't really change the pain levels but what it did do was make me gain weight substantially. This lead to me getting depressed which made the fibro flare up again. I stopped taking it.",
                    "I was prescribed Lyrica for fibromyalgia. The first hour after I took Lyrica I felt better and at night, I slept like a dream. I was on for a total of two weeks in which time I started feeling bloated and put on weight. I am a heart patient and I started getting angina. My blood pressure started to raise. I started getting headaches. My only wish was that I could have continued taking Lyrica as the fibromyalgia pain was gone. But I'll just have to keep looking. ",
                    "I started taking Lyrica 4 months ago. I am always anxious when taking a new medicine as I am also on Paxil, which is horrible if I do not have a dose within 24 hours. Within an hour I felt 'weird' like I do if i miss a dose of Paxil. That feeling subsided throughout the day. Over the next days I did feel quite vague and forgetful (like I couldn't remember my bank account number, which I use daily). Again I persisted, taking 75mg twice a day, on waking and then at 2pm. I noticed an increase in energy and a decrease in pain. ",

I also get pain \"breakthrough\" where pain attacks can reach up to 10 on a pain scale. I started Lyrica last year, and now am on 225Mg twice a day and have the same amount of pain control as the Gabapentin, but at a much lower dose. My wife says that I am much more \"aware\" and \"responsive\" on Lyrica and my short term memory issues are not quite as severe, however still there. My weight gain has ceased, however I am having a tough time trying to lose all the weight I have gained.",
                    "I began reporting my symptoms of peripheral neuropathy to my doctor in the 90's. My stroke in 2002 finally got my doctor's attention that my nerve pain was real. She dropped me as her patient and subsequent doctors ignored my pain complaints. In 2004 I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia but my Neurologist said not to take Lyrica. Fortunately, I recently got a new Primary Care Physician and new Neurologist. Two weeks ago, my new PCP gave my samples of Lyrica. I am amazed at my improved ability to function already. I think of the years of being bedridden at age 36-41. I can't believe that I wasn't prescribed Lyrica, a decade ago. No side effects so far. I still have pain 24/7, but the relief due to Lyrica, is a miracle.",
                    "I was given Lyrica for my fibromyalgia in 2007. No relief, but gained 30 pounds in 3 months and continued gaining until it reached 55 pounds! I've lost less than 10 pounds, hard weight to lose so be aware.",

The anti depressants had effects but not desirable ones.At times they replaced some anxieties with others and bad side effects. Sleep, sex drive, confusion. From someone who has experimented with recreational drugs including ecstasy the feeling I had from anti depressants was sometimes similar to a moderate come down from recreational drugs. I pretty much gave up on drugs Then along came pregablin which I hadn't spotted before. It is by far the best thing I've taken I started on 150mg a day now on 225mg won't go higher I don't feel as scared anymore I can do things. Try it.",

I also have to take Cymblata and tramadol with morphine but like I said I have full body RSD. Only side effect is my vision and I feel like I'm high but the benefits outweigh the side affects",
                    "I am 36, have a bad case of herniated disc that hits me in the back. Lyrica has helped a lot with pain and overcoming my hernia's crisis twice, at 150-300 mg daily. This is not an example of chronic use, although I might be such one case in the future if the problem persists.  In lower doses it seems to take more time (days) to take effect, in higher doses the side-effects are more pronounced.  My side-effects were: slight sedation, euphoria, strange body coordination, all in all: the psychoactivity. One can have an accident on these, so caution should be exercised and doctors instructions followed strictly. Using cars or other potential dangerous machines should probably be avoided too.  ",

My doctorr tested for inflammatory diseases and autoimmune diseases and nothing showed up. He decided to treat me as if I have fibromyalgia and gave me Lyrica (not sure what dose but supposed to take 2x a day) this little capsule is great. I can move and actually sleep comfortably at night. Only issue is it does make me sleepy so I can only take at night but that's good for me right now.",

Either this, or combined first 3 days muscle relaxant made my pain vanish. I was prescribed for 15 days and after 8 days, I forgot to take one night. I felt much better next day (after not taking).

I still can't believe it. I was sure I had Alzheimers. I now know I don't. I'm 65 and can't believe I may be able to be a normal person after being so mentally ill for more than 20 years.

                    "Lyrica works. Unfortunately, I am on the verge of discontinuing use because of significant side effects. The most troubling for me are the eye disorders (conjunctivitis and blurred vision), and the dementia. I am 53 years old and I have trouble remembering elementary words! It's very embarrassing. I also have a significant taste disorder... many things taste like \"burnt garlic\" to me... that's the best way I can describe it. Finally, I have facial bloating, weight gain, and dizziness. I have been on the maximum dose of Lyrica for chronic pain due to degenerative disc disease in my neck. I was willing to endure the weight and dizziness, but the eye, memory and taste problems are intolerable. Too bad, because Lyrica really helps pain.",

Tried everything, but Lyrica has been the one that worked. Not completely, but they may bump up the dosage, I'm told. Trying for 2 more months til I see my GP again. Lucky my insurance pays- otherwise I'd never be able to afford it.",
                    "The best way to describe how well Lyrica works for me is to say, \"I'm young again! I'm a 50 yr old who has suffered with fibromyalgia for many years. Every morning on waking I would just lay in bed dreading the pain and discomfort of something as simple as getting up and out of bed. I was prescribed Cymbalta, Celebrex and Tramadol which help; but nothing works as well as Lyrica. I am able to get more done now without slowing down. Like I said before, I feel years younger. I have read that Lyrica poses an abuse warning, but what I experience isn't really euphoria (High) as one might experience with opiates. I experience relief of pain and maybe \"light on my feet\" and actually stronger muscles %u2014 but not the euphoria of opiates.",

                    "This is a miracle medicine. My pain prior to taking this medicine was so bad. I was having a hard time waking up in the mornings cause the pain was just wearing me down. It was harder to function at work too. My imagination started running wild as I started wondering if I was going to end up on social security disability. I've had 2 back surgeries C4-C7, and started to have new pain in the T spine below the 3 level fusion. I started taking Neuronton a few months ago for my pain and it did help some, but after a few months it wasn't helping anymore. My pain was strong and deep. I just didn't have much hope in this medicine but it is AMAZING! I have my life back. It helped with my anxiety also.",
                    "Like most others, I've tried everything possible for fibromyalgia over the past several years. I also have 3 herniated discs and chronic back pain. I tried Lyrica in the past and it did not help. Two years later I tried it again and in fact am still on 300 mg/day in combination with Flexeril 10 mg at night. It helped to take the edge off for about a month then suddenly stopped working. As I am going on a vacation soon, I am not beginning to wean off yet as I will wait until we return. Perhaps increasing the dosage would help? We will see. So far all I had was a month with a little less pain and am having a hard time maintaining my weight. My memory loss and grasping for words has also noticeably increased (and I am young). ",
                    "I was taking only 75mg per day of Lyrica for Fibromyalgia pain. I found it to be very helpful to me and helped me to get much needed rest at night. I took my dosage at night 2 - 3 hours before bed. My only issue with it was there were occasions where I felt a little \"spacy\" but overall, the pain left and I was able to carry out most of my day without significant pain. It was a very low dosage, so a lot of the side effects that some people experience could be from taking a much larger dosage. I am no longer taking it because I lost my insurance and can't afford the cost. However, I was told about Neurontin, will be starting it tomorrow and hoping to get some similar relief.",
                    "I was formally diagnosed with fibromyalgia August 2009. After 8 months of trying other medicines and physical therapy I finally gave in to my Doctor and tried Lyrica. I was nervous because I had used Neurontin in the past with bad side effects and thought Lyrica would be the same. I was wrong. Lyrica does make me sleepy but I take 75 mg at night about 2 hours before bed. My Doctor started me out on the lowest dosage and it has worked miracles for me. I have less pain and my muscles don't seem to spasm or twitch as much, I am able to increase my activity levels which helps with the stiff muscles. It also has helped to calm the nerves in my foot that were irritated in an unrelated injury. This medicine has been a miracle for me.",
                    "When I took Lyrica, I gained 40 lbs myself and my eyes were blurry. Once I got off of the medicine it has been still hard to lose the weight. It did work for my leg pain but the side effects were to much!",
                    "I have found I have an increased urge to eat sweet foods. I have tried to control this by eating fruit. However, this does not stop the craving for sweets. Also I have noticed an increased thirst and less urination. Further I have been able to stop using morphine patches and taking Mersyndol Forte since starting Lyrica. The lessening of pain has enabled me to sleep better",
                    "The nerve pain became so unbearable that it forced me to take lyrica despite the bad reviews and long list of negative side effects. I was told by many that it worked a lot better that neurontin with less drastic negative effects. Well, it has eased my pain some, but the side effects have taken my life from me. I'm dizzy at times, my head is always foggy and not clear thinking, I have depression, anger outbursts I've never had before, daily nausea, and am so tired that I can sleep all day and night long and can barely function. Unfortunately the alternative medications have even worse negative side effects, so what are we supposed to do in order to have some normalcy?",
                    "I call it a miracle drug like most others who have shared their comments. I have been taking it now for 7 months, currently 450mg a day (for treatment of fibromyalgia). I gained about 20 pounds within 2 months which I desperately needed to do. Overall, I have a better life now thanks to Lyrica. Nothing that I have been prescribed in the last 14 years has even came close to treating my condition.",
                    "I've suffered from Fibromyalgia since I was 16 years old (I'm now 24). My doctor put me on pain killers/ muscle relaxers, anti-inflammatories, Cymbalta and the list goes on. I've been told to change my diet. Nothing truly worked. Then I saw the Lyrica commercial. Asked my Doctor about it and he told me he had heard great things about it. I was given a free week trial. The FIRST pill- I could tell a slight difference. It's day 7 for me and I LOVE this pill thus far. ",
                    "It works for the muscle aches and it actually makes me a lot calmer. I don't know if that's just because I feel better so I can relax or if it's the medicine. I was so happy and blessed to find a doctor who listened to what was wrong with me and actually followed through with treatment. Hope that it can help more people and that there are no long term side effects but I am happy with the results and how quickly I felt a difference.",
                    "If you are debating on whether to take this, please don't hesitate. I was in car accident Dec 2012 and have whiplash/cervical strain. Injured my neck and shoulder. I was in pain for the past 9 months and no doctor would prescribe me narcotics due to Ohio law. I was miserable, crying, irritable and nothing I took (IB, Tylenol) wouldn't touch the pain. I got a prescription for Gabapentin, which I am allergic to BAD side effects. Finally the doc gave me Lyrica, within 15 min of taking pain GONE. I feel like I'm back to normal again (like the day before accident). Lyrica is a miracle although pricey. There is a program you can get through Lyrica website to qualify for free prescription. Try it.",
                    "Initially, this medicine was a godsend. Burning pain finally fizzled away. Muscle pains, didn't help as much. Still got numb and weak as well. The real problem came months later when I realized I was having memory problems. Had to wean off it. Memory loss was permanent. Chunks of time just gone. I still think because of the state of pain I was in I would do it over. Maybe the pain made me block out the time. I wish I would have just risked stopping it sooner to see if the nerve had healed. I still take them when I am desparate for relief. But just one maybe two until the zingers stop. Oh ya, nerves were damaged from electricity. Hand to my neck and face.",
                    "Hi. I have been on methotrexate 10 pills once a week and embrel injection 50mg once a week and now added Lyrica 50 mg 2 x a day. Told I have RA, and fibromyalgia. But even with these great meds I feel bad. From my waist to botton of my feet I hurt so. I do see my legs are swelling so very large and skin gets tight it hurts to walk. I dont know what else to do. I work and am on my feet all day. I go up and down the stairs at home I try to get extra walks in going around the blocks. But it hurts too bad. Im very tolerant to pain but this is to the point of no return. I feel bad for my family that maybe I'm a burden. And if I feel this way now how will I feel if I'd ever need some one to help me with everyday chores and hygiene. They may not see",
                    "After a head/neck/spine injury I found the drug to be very helpful with the neuropathic pain in my arm, face and various body parts. Weight gain is a minor issue. I don't suffer night terrors but feel as though I've been dragged through a hedge backwards upon awakening. I do NOT feel rested upon awakening. Cognitive issues due to the injury have been exaggerated after taking Lyrica.",
                    "This medicine was my neuropathic calming wonder medicine until my body over the course of several years had progressed to full body pain. I recommend anyone who has new or has out grown their pain medication to talk to your doctor about this.",
                    "The first time I used Lyrica I experienced an amazingly profound reaction; layers of depression and anxiety that had built up over several years melted away within minutes. That was years ago and I have since both weaned myself off the drug and restarted taking it again. One thing I rarely see mentioned is the terrifyingly bad withdrawal effect- missing more than one dose for me throws me into the absolute darkest pits of despair. Has anyone else experienced this? When I went off the drug the first time I felt like I had performed a miracle; so strong was the feeling that it took a long time for me to convince myself that things were bad enough to warrant going back on. It still helps, but nothing as miraculous as the first time.",
                    "Lyrica is the best medication for generalized anxiety disorder. I am on 75mg twice a day and been able to slowly get off my clonazepam without the benzodiazepine withdrawal. Brain fog will go away after being on it for about a month. Only other side effect is the cost.",
                    "Lyrica 25mg has been my beginning dose and I have been sleeping well, waking up feeling no pain, have no pain during the day, have a good mood and best of all no side effects! My doctor says that if I am comfortable on this dose I can stay at this amount and I don't have to go up if I don't need to!",
                    "I have been on Lyrica for a week now, 150 mg only at night and have not felt this good in three years. I am move active. I have not gain any weight yet, but hopefully be as active as I am now I will lose weight.",
                    "I have suffered from panic disorder and GAD for well over 10 years, starting in my early 20s. I finally sought treatment 3 years ago, but nothing helped. CBT, 40mg Citalopram, nothing. I then discovered pregabalin on this website. It was a struggle to get it prescribed on the NHS in the UK, but I'm so glad I persevered. This medicine is nothing short of a miracle. Within 24 hours I was a new person. I've only been taking it a week, but now I feel light and happy, and the anxiety has just faded away. I don't need alcohol any more. In fact, the thought of drinking now makes me feel ill.  If you have GAD - please try this. I'm only on 75mg twice a day as well.",
                    "This gave me incredibly bad nightmares not read other reviews with this problem but main reason I'm coming off it... does help slightly with anxiety but feel a bit too relaxed not good for daytime and work... does 150mg taken at night also causes dizziness and my eyes can't focus extremely groggy in the morning not great for me",
                    "I have been suffering from severe pudendal nerve damage pain and fibromyalgia for over 12 years. Vicodin, Percocet, Duragesic, Oxycontin, injections, you name it. Lyrica 75mg 2-3 x day has made the biggest difference in my life and pain in over 12 years. I can walk without a cane and I feel like doing things. There was some initial weight gain, but that seems to have leveled off. I've been amazed and very pleased.",
                    "I used Hydrocodone and Tramadol for persistent joint and neck/back pain. Didn't appreciate the foggy out of body living experience but it did help the pain. Although with narcotics, I became easily resistant and constant increasing of dosage doesn't seem like the most practical idea for long term pain. Lyrica took about one month to actually show it's benefits, luckily I had gotten free samples for that trial period. After the 1st month I noticed significant relief from my persistent joint pain. I am able to function normally for most of the day without any issues. So happy to have found Lyrica, just wish it wasn't so expensive!",
                    "I have been on lyrica for 1 month, starting at one 75mg twice daily for two weeks, then stayed on 150mg twice daily for two weeks. I had horrible side effect so my doctor told me to split the morning dose that was 150mg in to taking 75mg in the morning and 75mg afternoon, then 150 at nite. So the side effects got better. I suffered from extreme dizziness, increased anxiety, had a feeling my legs couldn't carry me, burning sensation throughout the whole body. After one month of medication, when side effect had gone away a little bit, I talked to my doctor and he told me than since I still suffer from anxiety we should increase the dose to 150/75/150. Side effects are back, I take oxazepam 30 mg to get through the worst side effect and waiting for a better effect on anxiety. However I am better than before.",
                    "My doctor just put me on Lyrica 25 mg tablet twice a day. The first day I took one dose around lunch the other before bedtime and got sleepy in the day. Anyway I emailed doctor he said only take the one at nite but I decided to take both at nite and feel great! I have suffered for years with fibromyalgia and cymbalta was not working for the fibromyalgia but I also take cymbalta for depression so still on that added the Lyrica and feel that the great pain is so much less, my knees and ankle pain, burning sensation all down, and finally get a good sleep without all the leg pain. I am thankful for this drug and finally can get my life back on track and finally see light at the end of my long tunnel of dealing with this horrible condition.",
                    "I have been taking Lyrica for 6 weeks.The first 5 weeks I took 50mg twice daily.Literally at the 5 week mark I had significant improvement.My pain was at a consistent pain level of an 8/9 before starting and now a 5/6.I would like to note I had no side effects at this dose.My doctor increased my dose to 100mg twice daily a week ago and now I have side effects,headaches that last all day,everyday where as before I did have chronic headches that came and went during the day from fibro. Also my fingers and face are very puffy to the point of being uncomfortable.And the worst part is the chronic dry mouth.I have to keep a water bottle on hand to sip on constantly!(Having a chronic dry mouth puts you at a higher risk of cavities.)And weight gain",

I honestly didn't think pregabalin would be effective but I noticed immediately it helping with the pain in my foot where I'm sure there is nerve damage as well as in my arm where I broke it. Later on in the day I set about doing a chore and realized my anxiety was gone. I mean I still had worry but it was managable? Hard to explain. Started off at 300 mg a day and went up to 450 a day then after a few weeks it was like my anxiety worsened.(I have GAD and take Clonazepam) I was going to go off the Pregbalin but I'm down to 100mg in the morning 50mg at dinner and 50 mg at night. Ok so far",
                    "Hello! I have severe Neuropathic pain from spinal injuries. I had a spinal block that worked for a while, but it didn't take care of all the pain. My life was pretty limited as to what I could do, which was pretty much sitting in a chair at the computer or watching tv. My love for the outdoors was pretty much squashed since it requires bending over, which I can't do, due to the rods and screws in my back. I have only taken this medicine for two days, and I have already have noticed a huge difference. I am actually able to move around more. I also have osteoarthritis, and my joints were hurting. Not anymore. This stuff is amazing. The only drawback is the cost. I have to take it three times a day, and it's really expensive.",

Yet nobody knows the source of these symptoms. Due for a muscle biopsy soon. While taking tramadol and hydrocodone had great results for energy and pain, I became dependent. I was prescribed Lyrica 50mg about 2 months ago and felt a little relief. Doctor raised the dosage and now I take 150mg 3 times a day and the results are amazing. I'm alert, energetic, and pain free. Have a little dizziness now and then, but this medicine is great.",
                    "I would just like to say that I know everyone worries about weight gain on this drug so I thought it important to share a positive experience with this drug. I am on 300mg per day and have experienced no side effects and absolutely no weight gain. I am so much calmer and happier, my mood doesn't plummet suddenly, I am not anxious at all anymore and I am sleeping like a log! 10/10 don't let fear of sudden weight gain effect your decision to take this drug, remember that when they test drugs they don't take into consideration the lifestyles of the test subjects, that 1 in 10 person could just eat to much day to day which would result in weight gain and have nothing to do with the drug. Don't worry too much about it!",

Couldn't sleep due to pain took hydrocodone daily which upset my stomach and I became dependant on it every night and morning due to severe pain.

I explained to the dr that I didn't feel depressed but I worried constantly through the night about things, and would also wake suddenly with chest pain. The dr sent me for ECG but I knew the pain was linked to anxiety. Anyway, after the ECG came back clear, he prescribed Pregabalin (a much lower dose than most people on here) and I only take one at night. I now sleep better, I have not woken with a panic attack since taking them, and my anxiety is no longer controlling me. I've been on them 6 months.",

I have found the side effects to be minimal, the most noticeable is mid afternoon drowsiness and a bit of vertigo. This medicine has also helped calm the need for frequent urination. Who knew?",

My feet still sting and burn on and off everyday. One time, I decided to slowly stop taking Pregabalin and take the generic drug, Gabapentin and my feet flared up by a 1000 percent. I asked my doctor if he could prescribe Pregabalin again. I have had zero/none side effects taking Pregabalin but recently I came across reading peoples \"hellish/nightmare\" experiences trying to wean and stop taking this drug. That scares me and I do not want to be dependent on this drug or any drug. I am going to slowly wean myself off and find other ways to deal with my nerve pain. Prayers needed!",

My relationship with my husband and my baby (with whom I have had terrible difficulties bonding/guilt/PND.

Lyrica has been the miracle drug for me and I have been taking it for about 3 years. It takes time for any drug to work properly and I couldn't function with out it. 150mg a day is my dosage.

My head was spacey and I couldn't register what people were saying, and once I realised I couldn't come up with a reply. Today, I woke up and I felt drunk and stoned at the same time but not as severe. I found it hard walk straight, my balance was off. I feel happier but not less anxious?

I am trying it for GAD (general anxiety disorder) after trying antidepressants; I tried SSRI's like Paxil and Lexapro and these were horrible failures. The SSRI's made me suicidal BUT Lyrica seems to really be doing the trick! The weight of anxiety is totally gone, and I feel somehow stronger and more self confident, although the feeling is a little manic at times and irregular, like feeling quite drowsy, then quite manic, in a short period of time. But I am assuming that this might stabilize after a few more days. So far I feel like a new person!",

Sleeping better, emotions have come back and I am not an anxious wreck! very helpful and no side effects.

It helped with some of the fibro pain and I felt tired and a little dizzy along with having dry mouth which I expected as common side effects. What surprised me was I got new pains in new places--my big toe felt like it was on fire and my lower back hurt badly. I started weaning off of Lyrica and the new pains went away. I also had insomnia from weaning process. I think it does work to dull the fibro pain but not sure if it's worth it if there are new pains.",

It definitely relieved my leg pain. I was also taking Tramadol which I decreased because Lyrica does the job as well and I don't like the tramadol as it makes me sleepy. Lyric does not make me sleepy. I have had no problems with Lyrica and been on it several months . Have gone off it also for several weeks with no problems at all. Maybe it helps some people and others not. For me, it really relieved my nerve pain in my legs.",

The thing I didn't like about it though was that it always made me feel like I was in a cloud. My thinking wasn't clear. I would get dizzy. I didn't notice too much of a weight gain, but there was some. In the end, I chose to try a different med (Savella) after my daughter was born and have been happier with that. Still works and fewer side effects.",

I have only been taking it for 3 days and I can already tell a significant difference. My hands and feet have no burning pain and I seem to have less numbness. I have also noticed that it helps tremendously with my anxiety. I was taking Xanax 1mg 3x a day and now I only take it once a day if that. I seem to feel more relaxed and less anxious so maybe this will actually help me stop taking the Xanax which I've tried so many times in the past. So far I am super impressed with this medication.",

Have your Doctor consult with a psychiatrist - because they know effective drugs to layer with this anticonvulsant - and you can continue to reap the benefits of Lyrica. I know it sure worked for me & life is so worth living now.",
                    "I have been having pain in my wrists, hands and elbows for years due to waiting tables and hefting 100 pound trays on one hand. Lately, I was having more pain in those areas, and my hips have started really hurting me. My doctor and I ran tests, and by process of elimination we feel that I have chronic fatigue, which can contribute to a lot of the allergy/asthma symptoms, the pains and exhaustion. I started taking Lyrica and am up to 100mg 3 x daily. I feel great. Everything but my hip is better.",
                    "Definitely helps with anxiety when combined with an SSRI.",
                    "Lyrica was my miracle drug for the first few weeks. I've been living with Fibromyalgia for over 5 years and have tried everything. Anti depressants, exercise, narcotics, you name it. So I was excited about the dramatic pain reduction from Lyrica. But now I have developed severe muscle weakness, headache, abdominal cramping, blurry vision, bad judgement which causes accidents to my fingers and toes I have recently had difficulty thinking clearly. I can barely hold myself up and I can't lift anything over a few pounds. I have asked my doctor if I can safely stop taking it. She said stop daytime and only take at bedtime. every other night till I ween off. My quality of life has worsened. I have started Chondroiden, MSM powder and ALpha Lipoid",
                    "been on Lycria for 6 months 75mg twice daily then 150mg twice daily. Had facet joint injections and spinal block. Found out I had CFS and Fibromyalgia. Tried stopping lycria for 1 day as I gained confidence. Went back on it within 1 day leg and lower back pain unbearable. Sleep much better on it . Would advise anyone to try for chronic pain- side effects much less than Gabapentin by far. Had to stop work lost cognitive ability and brain fog worsened",
                    "I have suffered from progressive neuropathy over the last 5 years to where it finally became intolerable, particularly in my feet and legs, and starting to spread to my arms and even my face. I now have a doctor who has prescribed Lyrica for me for the last 4 months. At a starting dose of 75mgs twice daily there was noticeable relief. Still hurting, however, my dosage was increased to 300 mgs twice daily which has successfully reduced the pain so that I am able to function at a higher level than I have experienced in years with minor side effects, the most annoying of which is sleepiness. I am grateful and relieved to have been introduced to Lyrica and to have insurance that will cover it as it is obscenely expensive.",
                    "I've been diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy and was taking gabapentin switched to lyrica and am now much improved.",
                    "I have had fibroymalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, and was hit by a hit and run driver on my bicycle and have taken many different pain medications including Lortab 10 mg, and have had considerably more pain relief from Lyrica than any other medication I have taken.",
                    "Was on this for about 3 months. First few days I had some coordination issues, which I was warned about, probably on the 4th day something kicked in and I felt wonderful. I have very bad social anxiety but on that day I was not afraid of anything, I felt any goal that I had always wanted to pursue I suddenly could, and even if I failed, I would deal with it. My only fear that day was that this would be temporary, and sadly, it was. The next day I took it, and I got only the slightest hint of what I had the day before, the tiny effect maybe lasted for the next couple days, then nothing, I kept taking it, thinking it might somehow kick in after time, but then I started to notice I was gaining lots of weight I stopped.",
                    "A true miracle! I'm 36 and have been living with pain for years - along with panic attacks and chronic anxiety. Was given various prescriptions and decided I did not want to live dependent on pills - the side effects were just too much. Yesterday my doctor encouraged me to try Lyrica. With hesitation I took the first pill last night and woke up feeling like I did 10 years ago! I'm still shocked. I haven't noticed any side effects, but this is definitely worth every penny!",
                    "I suffer from fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis and surgically induced menopause. I am 40 years old. I have tried all medicines like Cymbalta, etc. but none really helped. My main issue has been a lack of deep restorative healing sleep as it exacerbates the fibromyalgia pain and inability to exercise. My Rhematologist has given me Lyrica to try and I have to say so far so good. I have only taken 3 doses and already I am getting a better quality sleep. So much so that my husband has noticed my improved overall state of mind. I am a little cloudy the next day but I am hoping this will ease over time. Worth the cost of a cup of coffee a day if it helps!",
                    "I was prescribed this for fibromyalgia, I've tried it several times at low doses and have had a horrible experience. I can not explain this but within an hour of taking lyrica I get the most severe tooth pain, like every tooth suddenly has a hole in it ? I went to my dentist the first time NO HOLES?? My doctor thought it was amusing ? Bizarre. My real problem is the next morning after taking lyrica I have horrendous stomach pain for days, hurts to urinate, poop or fart. Feels like I really have to push to urinate, my doctor said sounds like stomach/intestine inflammation which is on the common side, so I've been taken off it. I will say I sleep like a baby after taking it!",
                    "Saw Dr for pain in my wrists forearm burning pain in shoulder has been going on for years! Only recently after an MRI it found nerve compressions at c4/5 c6/7. Pain increasingly has become worse for the past year and a half! Rt arm /fingers numbness tingling and reduced strength of hand! Must say have arthritis at the base of both wrists with pain in wrists!Put on pregabalin! Took it for first time last night woke up at 4 am with pounding headache dry mouth! Took paracetamol! Pounding headache with nausea still on for most of the morning took painkillers with some effect! Head foggy sleepy!!Felt panicky!!!So didn't take pregabalin dose of the morning as became concerned and scared not being able to endure more!! What to do now???not sure???",
                    "I was on Lyrica for a year. Then my insurance decided hey we aren't paying for this anymore and I had to stop. And it was a just stop completely not a wean off of it. Started on. Gabapentin 800 3x a day. Has done Nothing for me. I am miserable. If you need help paying for it go to there website and they will actually pay for the medication for you. For a year then you just reapply. I will be getting mine back finally this week. And I can't wait to get back on it so I can actually be a mom and a wife again. Without laying in bed all day suffering.",
                    "I have had firbo for 16 years. My stupid doctor , who knew nothing about fibro, put me on some opiates and the one that worked was morphine. it was great, I loved it and then 2 months ago my doctor took me off morphine-paranoid I think about people overdosing.. I was furious with her and plan on changing doctors soon. I called Pfizer and qualified for no charge Lyrica . I received it 4 days ago, 150 mg . I sleep great with it and I also take xanex, trazadone, amitriptyline for sleep, I take it in the morning with my antidepressents and feel ok then I take it around noon and sometimes I feel really flaky. I need to gain about 10 pounds so I am not worried about weight gain.So far it is ok, still have pain but its not horrible..",

                    "I've been prescribed Lyrica 300mg morning and night also Amitriptyline 10mg for TN pain. Before taking these meds life was near unbearable to live. The meds do come with some side affects, short term memory loss and sometimes blurred vision being the worse. I've thankfully not had issue with weight gain. You have take the good with the bad sometimes. Without the prescribed meds life would be hell.",
                    "Thus is intended as a warning about sudden cessation of long term Lyrica use. I've been taking 75mg twice daily Lyrica for severe pain resulting from crush fractures in my spine. I started to feel a slight benefit from the drug a few weeks after beginning to take it but it wasn't until I started swimming that my long standing pain completely disappeared. I never missed a dose until a few days ago: just ran out, had to wait til the next day, effectively missing two doses. I went through an incredibly harrowing experience in that time without the drug...it wasn't psychological: I could almost physically feel the chemistry in my brain and body going totally haywire. It was extremely alarming, nothing can describe how nasty it was.",
                    "I have had fibromylgia now for 20 yrs plus lupus and had 7 tumors removed from my body, heart attack at the age of 40 and about died. I was put on Lyrica 5 years ago and I have my life back. I take 100mg twice a day and now I can enjoy my life again.",
                    "Lyrica works very well with pins, needles, tingling and numbness. The negative side effects were \"loopiness\", and inability to feel full after eating. I gained 40 lbs very quickly.",
                    "The needle standing pain was bad, but then I developed this feeling like I dipped my lower legs and feet in frying oil. It all is getting worse. It has really been tough especially at night trying to sleep.",
                    "I have been in pain for years and started Lyrica. I cannot believe the difference. It is shocking. My pain is so much better. My bladder spasms are gone. I sleep so well. Wake up in the morning without hurting my back and ribs to breath. My chronic diarrhea is gone too. The only thing I have noticed on the negative side is I am super hungry, which doesn't surprise me. Overall, loving it and praying it continues to work. No side affects other than being hungry:)",
                    "I was diagnosed with Lupus 3 yrs. ago.Several months ago,during one of my doctor's visits, I discussed feeling more pain. He prescribed Lyrica. I was taking 3x daily, changed to twice daily. (I was experiencing \"foggy\" thinking with 3x daily). I have been VERY pleased with the results I feel.",
                    "I've had Fibromyalgia for ten years now, along with other health problems and up until a week ago I was using Flexerel and Cataflam to help with the pain and discomfort. Until last week, I was under a lot of stress at work, mind you I teach infants and toddlers up to age 3, and I woke up one morning in pain. Pain over my entire body. Pain I have never felt before. I felt like I had a supped up version of the Flu. I went to work in tears and left in tears and headed straight to my doctor. I began Lyrica that day and I was pretty out of it the first night and especially the next day when I took the next dose. I slept most of the first day and the second day I was a little dizzy headed and off balance. So far Lyrica is working well",
                    "I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia about 18 years ago. I stopped working a few years after due to the pain. I tried many medications so I could have some quality of life with my husband and 2 children. I spent most of my time in bed or on the couch because the pain was so debilitating. I was taking Ultram and Zanex but these just didn't take away the pain and then my doctor started me on Lyrica. I started feeling like a new person because slowly the pain started to decrease. The only side effect which could also be part of Fibromyalgia is with speech. I have trouble sometimes finding the words I want to say. I now take 75 mg 3 times per day and have been taking it for over 10 years. I'm so grateful to have my life back.",
                    "I had shingles in January 2014. I have had terrible PHN ever since. 2.5 years of pain. It has been awful!! Shingles is the worst pain I have ever experienced and it isn't going away. I tried everything out there from Gabapentin to acupuncture, to percocet, to injections in my back and nothing helped, or it would help for a few weeks, but the pain always managed to come back strong. I was wary of Lyrica because of the side effects, but I finally decided to try it. It has definitely helped me and I can do things like ride my bike again with little pain. However, I have put on 8 lbs in 6 months and I am an extremely active person, so this is tough for me. I also have pain in my joints and sometimes my hands go numb, but less pain.",
                    "Have had fibromyalgia for about 20 years. Have been on Lyrica 600mg for 2 years. To date this has offered me the best pain relief. I was also taking Zytram, up until 2 months ago. ",
                    "I have been taking Lyrica for three months. I started out with 75mg twice a day. It took the edge off my fibromyalgia pain during the day but at night I would wake up due to muscle pain when laying on one side too long. My doctor increased me to 150mg twice a day and for the first time in months, I was able to sleep through the night. I feel like a new person. It's a wonder drug. For once I am not walking around like a zombie due to pain and lack of sleep. I have gained a couple of pounds but I can live with that.",
                    "The pain from Fibromyalgia comes as MUSCLE cramping, tingling, twitching, spasms, etc. It is not a \"nerve\" illness per se, yet doctors think people are stupid and prescribe this anyway. It does nothing for the pain or fatigue from Fibromyalgia or Chronic Fatigue/M.E. Until people realize that legitimate users of meds such as Hydrocodone, morphine ER, etc are rarely abused by people in genuine chronic pain, doctors will continue to jeopardize patients lives by giving them meds like this as a placebo with nasty side effects. One doctor also put me on Paxil which gave me Serotonin Syndrome and I was in Intensive care for a week! This was when SSRI's first came out and I went into med journals. Avoid this for chronic MUSCLE pain.",
                    "Had migraines for years tried pitzotifen, gabapentin, sodium valporate, triptans, Co coldamol 30/500, toprimate, been on 75mg pregabalin an off the books trial using the docs words. I'm in UK, 7 weeks migraine free, I normally would have had 6 attacks in that time, works for me. A bit of fatigue only side, I'll take that over debilitating effects of a migraine anytime.",
                    "I have suffered pain in my neck, shoulders, jaw, and suffered from migranes. I have tried EVERYTHING (doctors, physical therapy, massage, accupuncture, psychiatrist, many meds). I was prescribed Lyrica for fibromyalgia pain, and chronic fatigue. I was on almost the highest dose for 2 months and did NOTHING for me but make me gain 25 pounds! I am 5'6\" 125 and went up to 150lbs. 125 pounds is a high weight for me so 150 is too much for my frame. ",
                    "I was prescribed Neurontin for anxiety and panic, but it made me a zombie. I am now taking Lyrica and it is amazing! No more anxiety or panic and my mood is greatly improved. Neurontin was like whiskey hit hard and had \"hangover\", Lyrica is like a fine wine, subtle and mellow and doesn't have the zombie effect. DON'T DRINK ALCOHOL WITH IT this was only a reference. I am taking 75mg at night and 50 in the morning. I also don't need the antidepressants anymore.",
                    "I have been on Lyrica for Fybro for 7 weeks now and I sleep great - I can play with my grandchildren and I don't hurt enough to even complain about - I am off the narcotics - was 2-3x's a day with oxy and overall I am more productive at work and I move more and am much happier. Still tired because I move so much",
                    "I have had neuropathic spine pain since 1984. I have triple S curve; had 6 spine surgeries, and have implanted pain relief system for low back pain. Nothing worked, opioids almost led to death. 2 months ago begam Lyrica (100mg, 3x/day). At beginning: brain felt \"foggy\"; walking unstable; total urinary incontinence (some bowel incontinence). To say I was shocked at how the Lyrica relieved my spine pain is an undersatement! I read all the horror stories, but decided to give it time. This is the first time since the early eighties I have had NO pain! The side effects are gone.",
                    "I take 75 mg at bedtime. I started Lyrica in 2015 when I had shingles. I noticed that I wasn't having crippling anxiety. I was able to stop Klonopin. I went back on Klonopin when we moved out of state. I also started Ambien 5mg. For sleep issues. I thought I could stop Lyrica. That was a big mistake. Last night I didn't take the Lyrica and I am so anxiety ridden and feel physically sick. I will definitely take the Lyrica tonight.",
                    "I was taking 50mg Lyrica every 2 hrs or sooner each day; while it did seem like I had more energy and could work a little longer before resting, the pain never stopped or lightened up. Lyrica  amitriptyline did help me sleep better. I quit taking Lyrica and started taking gabapentin 300mg 3Xper day and the pain lessened a lot, and sleep is better and some of the brain fog is gone. ",
                    "I have been on a wide variety of medicines for anxiety over the last 8 years, recently my Dr put me on Gabapentin because I suffer from extreme sensitivity especially when sitting (burning sensations), I tolerated this quite well at 1800 mg but still had anxiety, My Dr changed me over to Pregabalin four days ago, I have had a pressure headache on and off in the left side of my head and quite severe bloating, however the Anxiety seems more under control, has anyone else had these types of side effects and if so do the pass with time.",
                    "I found this to be very effective in treating the after effects of double fusion of cervical vertebrae. Then I found I was having less difficulty with fibromyalgia. I was on 3 a day and only side effect was weight gain.",

It worked for a couple of years but now my body tolerance has reduced its pain killing efect. Don't want to increase dosage and my neurologist seems at a loss as what to prescribe.",
                    "Diagnosed with fibromyalgia 6 years ago, I've tried many antidepressants and pain killers. I have been in withdrawal of Tramal and replacing it with Lyrica. I see it as my salvation when compared to some of the medications I have taken over the years. YES, withdrawal from any form of medication is horrific and with uncertainty and discomfort. I personally am prepared to go through this horrible time to give Lyrica it's chance to work and improve my life, as I have seen an improvement already. Thanks to those who worked so hard to make this medicine for those of us who need it, know that your work is appreciated.",
                    "Have had fms for 8yrs. Have tried all sorts of meds & have been on fentanyl 75mcg every 48 hrs for the last few years. Fentanyl for fms is like a heavy bat for the wrong ball but was the only bat available.  I have been taking Lyrica for 1 1/2 yrs now. Had 1st pain free days in years when 1st started. Unfortantely, still on fentanyl in addition because I cannot take more then 50mg a day of lyrica w/o it knocking me out. Tried to build tolerance over 3 wks w/o success. Have had wild vision changes also.",
                    "My Anxiety had crippled me to a state which my life could no longer function. The first few days on Lyrica I noted a sense of euphoria and confusion but by the 4th day I found myself able to think about trigger points for my anxiety and was almost in awe of how it didn't raise its head. It seemed like anxiety had left my body, to the point where I had to look in a mirror and say \"why did you care about all that so much?\" Almost in disbelief of my previous behaviour, not being able to connect with those feelings or attitudes became freeing. lyrica gave me my life back it seems. Importantly, I'm still me. Friends and family all commented how much better I am without losing personality which i believe is one of the best qualities of the drug.",
                    "On my first day taking Lyrica, it was incredible - I was patient, calm, and chilled out. I could deal with stress better than I have been able to in my entire life. However, I quickly grew a tolerance, and I spent weeks chasing that feeling by upping my dose. When I finally reached 250mg, I was an absolute zombie. I was taking much longer to finish my sentences and I felt like I was constantly in a fog. My depression has reached an all-time high and my anxiety is still present - I'm just not having panic attacks any more. The past few months have been particularly bad and I just don't think it's worth being on any more. I think I'm especially disappointed now because it started out so well and I'm significantly worse off now.",
                    "It makes the pain go away and I can finally sleep at night. I'm so glad they have this medicine. The only side effect that I have had is the weight gain, which is 25 pounds so far and I have only been on it a month. At first I had some dizziness and minor hand and face swelling but that has gone away. If they could only improve so it wouldn't make you gain weight it would be a perfect medicine.",
                    "in april/may of 2011 i my right foot kept falling asleep over a 3 day period & i had a tingling sensation creep across my groin after 3 days of my right foot falling asleep & the tingling sensation creeping across my waist i was numb from the waist down for 2 weeks since then my feet fell asleep & NEVER woke up i finally got on lyrica & and it has help some with the tingling sensations but it has me feeling oh so stoned thankfully i get my lyrica through the county health department and it doesnt cost me",
                    "I have taken just one 75mg yesterday afternoon. It did not take long at all and I noticed a difference in my pain. I felt good. When I went to bed, I drifted off to sleep and woke up this morning feeling refreshed. It was a wonderful experience.",

                    "Only took one prescribed dose with real bad reaction. Ended up in hospital with dangerously slow heart rate. Unable to talk, walk or stand, it felt like I had a stroke. Severe joint pain and urinary retention developed within 24 hours and I found it incredibly difficult to remain conscious. Hospital staff did not recognise the symptoms as an adverse effect of the medication, even though I handed them the advisory notes from the medication, and treated me as though I was just having an anxiety attack or attention seeking. It wasn't until I was discharged and read up on the medication that I was able to confirm that all the symptoms I had were listed as side effects. needless to say I did not take any more.",

I take 150 mg of Lyrica in the morning and 300mg at bedtime. My sleep is better. I still have difficulty moving around in the morning, but within an hour of taking my morning dosage the majority of my pain, etc is gone.",
                    "I have been on Lyrica almost 2 1/2 years. When I first started it I was really skinny so weight gain didn't bother me but now I have gained over 25 lbs which is not good at all. I am going to go back to Gabapentin which helped me get off morphine. My eyes are dry and blurry. I fart all the time and I am fat! I was off of it the beginning of the year and I was hurting but side affects are too much.",
                    "I was experiencing nerve pain from hernia and knee operations, being a single parent and running a business a while back had me run off my feet and feeling nerve pain running up the bottom of my feet and through my knee joints into the groin, Lyrica has so far taken most of that pain away. What I didn't realise was it also helps with anxiety and depression, after 3 weeks I noticed a calmness I thought I could never achieve, did some googling on the benefits of Lyrica last night and was amazed at everyone's experience on Lyrica. This is great stuff, would recommend it highly, thank you Lyrica, back to fun time with the kids again.",

                    "With the recent changes to pain medication guidelines I was reduced from opiates and given Lyrica to try. RUN, don't walk away from this medicine. My memory got fuzzy, I stumbled and fell in injurying my back, it keeps new synapsis from forming in your brain (I.e. brain damage long term), I have rashes, etc. Most importantly, I started having thoughts of death. All of this on 50mg at bed time.  In a few years I'm sure TV lawyers will be soliciting patients for lawsuits. This is a strong chemical to introduce into a already weak person's system.",
                    "I have suffered a very long time to the point where my bones ached so bad that it brought me to a complete halt in life. My mother also suffers as well as my daughter who is showing many of the symptoms that I had at her age. I have been on Lyrica for ten days now and can not believe the difference it has made. I hope that this med can improve other's lives as well as it has mine, because FM is a horrible thing to have to live with. No side effects so far. Here is hoping it is for you..",
                    "My doctor prescribed this for me when I was dealing with pain from a fractured sternum. After dealing with the pain for over a year we tried this. Fantastic results. Required only 3 weeks of treatment and the pain resolved.",
                    "I was prescibed pregabalin for leg pain associated with Spinal Stenosis. The first prescribed was 225 mg daily. Side effects extreme tiredness and swollen ankles. When I tried to stop this drug I experienced severe anxiety and feelings of gloom. Went back on see and say the pain clinic who advised tapering 25mgs every 2 weeks. I am down to 50mgs am and pm. The withdrawal is one of the hardest things I have been through and cannot wait until this drug is totally out of my system. Lesson learnt to research prescribed drugs, their side effects and withdrawal before blindly accepting them.",
                    "I rated Lyrica as \"one\" because IF your prescription plan does not pay for it, it is worth nothing to you UNLESS you are prepared to pay about $350.00 a month out of your own pocket. It's effectiveness for a few of my problems was very good, but since I cannot afford it, it's effectiveness is actually ZERO to me now.  Don't take the free sample that will be offered to you (unless you can afford it later). Stopping Lyrica will be the one of the most miserable things you have ever tried in your life! It is a horrible withdrawal. the company is just like a street dealer of drugs. BOTH give you \"free samples\" to get you dependent on the drug and they charge big money for you to continue taking it.",
                    "Initial euphoric effects wore off so dosage was increased. Was told would treat nerve pain and later told good for anxiety. My anxiety got worse on med as when it was due or late I was ill, it has addictive qualities I do not like. My health took a nose dive on this and I had to come off due to blurred vision, weight gain, blocked bowel. My Doctor advised decreasing of 75mg a week. My first drop was hell completely threw me into panic as I felt so ill, no one explained withdrawal when I saw medics in a state no one comforted me saying it could be the reduction too high/quick for me, after all in hindsight if I felt unwell late taking one dose then dropping 75mg wouldn't be helpful quickly, lower doses not easy to get as more costly to NHS etc",
                    "I'm really waiting for the other shoe to drop with this medicine, because for me it has thus far been thoroughly life saving. I had been in pain every minute of every day, with some days being completely overwhelmed by the pain. Now I feel like I can live again. I just noticed that increased suicide risk was a potential side effect of Lyrica, which might concern me as I've suffered from major depressive disorder for >25 years. But being on this medicine has raised my mood a great deal because I don't have chronic pain to deal with on top of my baseline mood disorder. It is so wonderful. I'm waiting to hear that it causes something dreadful - because isn't that usually the case when something works so well.",
                    "I went from 800 mg of Neurontin a day, with its zombie-like side effects, to 100 mg of Lyrica with no side effects and more effective that Neurontin.",
                    "Didn't do much for my anxiety. I'm taking 150mg two times a day. Can't really feel much difference. I do feel a little bit more \"spacey\" though.",
                    "Diagnosed with fibromyalgia 19 yrs ago, no pain medicines until 5 yrs ago. Electro-acupuncture is great, but hard to find/afford. Heating pads aren't therapeutic, I sleep on 4 ice packs (I know, eeww, but whatever works). They help with inflammation, try them. Lyrica gave me agonizing, shooting pains from deep within shoulder and hip joints down humerus and femur. And unwelcome 35 lb weight gain. And blurry vision that meant I couldn't drive. Lyrica was useless for me, so glad you all have something to fight this fibromyalgia.",
                    "I did not feel it was helping all that well with the pain.[ lower, middle back and rib]  I went from 25 mg to 75, 150 then 225mg.  I found I was tired and lethargic. I had a dry mouth and throat constantly, and my vision was hard to focus, jumpy. I had stopped and restarted after 4 months, still the same. Breathing is harder, so I've noticed this time.   I have stopped for good!",
                    "I have been taking Lyrica for 3 months. I started at 50mg x 3. Increased to 150 x 3 times a day a month later. I have had almost no pain since starting. The side effects have been extreme dizziness, edema in the feet, weight gain (about 15lbs). At my last appointment the Doctor adjusted the dose to 50mg x 4 times a day. The dizziness comes and goes. This is a great medicine for me. I can handle dizziness at this level.",
                    "My doctor prescribed Lyrica for my anxiety, and it has been a God-send. Dump Trazodone. I feel like normal people are supposed to feel - with basically no side effects. In addition, I have Herpes, and since taking Lyrica have had no Herpes break-outs. This drug is incredible.",
                    "Finally, a medicine prescribed by my psychiatrist that is non narcotic and actually works. Due to a severe auto accident fifteen years ago, I am now 40 yrs old, and having suffered a closed head injury, fractured pelvis, 4 fractured ribs and tailbone fracture. I have suffered with chronic pain mostly my adult like. I have undergone nearly every pain management regime one can think of: Epid nerve blocks, rhizotomy, physical therapies and of course every narcotic medicine that was available. Yet within just a few months, and after all these years, Doctor and I have finally found a medication regimen that truly works! Lyrica 75 2x a day and MS 60mg 2x daily. And since starting Lyrica, my acute pain episodes are less frequent.",
                    "I was given this medication for pain after suffering from two herniated disks. The medication worked great, but I did not know how good until my doctor took me off of it and my pain returned to its debilitated state.",
                    "I find it helpful for sleep 150 mg with seroquel and Xanax. Sometimes it makes me dreamy or spacey not unpleasant but maybe for its reputation as a street drug in larger doses I have never tried. I don't have much anxiety so have nothing to add.",
                    "I was already overweight and went on Lyrica because of the tingling in my hands and feet being intolerable. Three weeks later, its like I woke up one morning and none of my clothes fit. I got on the scale and from the time my doctor gave me this pill to current and have gained over 25 lbs. It's a shame I have to decide between being obese or able to sleep and be pain free.",
                    "Brilliant, like an anti depressant but I don't get nervous anymore",
                    "I suffered severe sciatica for two years before my doctor prescribed Lyrica. After a few days of building up in my system, the medication completely killed all of the pain, numbness, and tingling in my right leg. It was so effective, I thought I was suddenly cured! I stopped taking the Lyrica and the symptoms returned after a couple of days. I have now been taking Lyrica for two years and swear it is the best solution available for my bulging disk problem.",
                    "VERY MIXED RESULTS. Had a severe attack of shingles on the face and scalp (3 weeks in most of the hair on one side of my head was literally gone). I refused morphine (in hindsight, I should have taken it) but I did take Percocet which helped the internal pain but not the nerve pain in the skin. For that they gave me Neurontin, but I could not tolerate it due to extreme drowsiness, loss of appetite, loss of concentration and dry mouth (before I could chew food it was too dry to swallow it). Tried Lyrica 75mg 3 times daily. First dose seemed to really work but effect declined significantly so that the fifth dose had no effect. During the fourth week he increased to 100mg 3 times daily. Second dose helped then effects declined.",
                    "I have had chronic pain from Spinal Stenosis for over 25 years. Neck shoulders and lower back. I was on Lyrica 150 mg twice a day a couple years ago & truthfully can not remember why I stopped taking it. Since the \"war on pain meds\" My Dr. ask me to try it again. I took for 2 weeks then I started getting blurred vision, confusion, memory loss, & I would be standing in a store and twice the husband had to catch me because I was just falling over. I felt sick inside, instead of my quality of life improving it went down hill. I will never take this so called med again. I will live with the 10 to 15 pain level somehow if I have to spend the rest of my life just sitting still or in the bed. I also got to the point I was severely depressed. Do NOT take this drug.",
                    "Apart from putting on weight - Lyrica has been great. I sleep (a miracle in itself) and have felt no pain.",
                    "Started using LYRICA about 6 months ago. It seems to have minimized the toe/foot pain I have when I go to bed. This was keeping me awake with pain and restless legs. Now I can get to sleep easier. Did notice some weight gain... but am working on it. No other side effects noted at this time. Sure has helped me at night!",
                    "Lyrica has saved my life, just wish I'd have started taking it sooner and it would have saved my marriage. My pain is completely controlled and I am no longer taking anti-depressants. I didn't realize it helped with GAD, but it does. I actually feel human again and interact with others. It does have some side effects, can't concentrate and a drunk feeling but compared to the pain I was enduring, these side effects are worth it to me.",
                    "600 mg of lyrica works wonders for me. Its a very good drug and completely takes away the pain. Without this drug I would go insane I've gone days with so much pain that I thought of committing suicide. Really awful feeling because I have always enjoyed life and I'm only 38. Nerve pain is by far the most painful pain I have ever had. To all of you who suffer out there, there will always be a medicine that can help you. Don't give up there is a way this horrible condition. I hope everyone find relief",
                    "Started taking Lyrica yesterday for severe diabetic neuropathy in both feet and lower legs. I am currently on Suboxone for a 15 year addiction to opiates and was concerned that Lyrica wouldn't work because my body is so screwed up from all the years of opiate use and most medications do not work well for me. Thirty minutes after the first dose I noticed a significant improvement in the neuropathic pain. My bedtime dose was another 75 milligram capsule and I slept better than I have slept in months! This medicine has been a God send for me so far. Hoping that it continues to work well for me! Thanks Pfizer!",
                    "I'm a 41 year old male and I suffer from diabetic Neuropathy in my feet. It's steadily gotten worse over the last 2 years and wasn't even diagnosed properly until 3 months ago. I've been taking Lyrica started with 75mg twice a day which didn't much of anything. I'm now taking 150mg twice a day, it's somewhat effective but not quite there yet not sure if dosage will have to be increased or I'll have to try something else? I haven't had a lot of the side effects others have mentioned except for memory loss. I've noticed that my short term memory hasn't been the best of late but other than that not really many side effects for me.",
                    "I was just diagnosed with fibromyalgia earlier this year. My old doctor prescribed me Cymbalta and it didn't work. I was off from work for 2 months because of the pain. All I did was layed in bed suffering. Seemed like I would never have my normal life back. I went to another doctor and he prescribed me Lyrica it lessened the pain within a day or two. Now I have some of my life back. I still have a little pain but Lyrica has helped me and changed my life.",
                    "I am 37 with multiple illnesses, fibromyalgia, diabetes, arthritis, and schizophrenia being the tip 4. My Doctor put me on 300 mg of Lyrica 3 times a day. Initially, it stopped my severe symptoms of fibromyalgia, initially. I began to have sleeplessness, which became 3 hrs of sleep every other night. My legs from knee down began to tingle, then it felt like worms crawling in them. I had fuzzy vision, and then 60 voices came out in my head, very loud and clear. My Doctor refused to stop lyrica, I stopped taking it and within a month the side effects disappeared.",
                    "Side effects are worse than Fibromyalgia pain. I've been taking Lyrica for two months. It was a miracle drug for the first few weeks. I've been living with Fibromyalgia for over 35 years and have tried eveything. Anti depressants, excersise, bio-feedback, acupuncture, narcotics, you name it. So I was excited about the dramatic pain reduction from Lyrica.But now I have developed severe muscle weakness, headache, abdominal cramping, acne and difficulty thinking clearly. I can barely hold myself up and I can't lift anything over a few pounds. I have asked my doctor if I can safely stop taking it. I'm just waiting g for him to return my call. I would rather just live with my horrible pain than take any more of these toxic drugs.",
                    "I started with 75 mg of Pregabalin which was raised to 100 mg at bedtime. While it helped me in reducing neck pain and I had substantial reduction in anxiety, it started giving me huge side effects. I started having throat pain, sinusitis, vivid dream early morning and some feeling of dizziness. I also added 5 kg of weight in 2 months. I am now tapering it off gradually. While I would say it worked for my main symptoms, unfortunately it gave me too much side effects.",
                    "For the past year I have suffered pain in calf of leg which travels up theough thigh hips and back on walking it becomes extreme and I have to sit down, awaiting MRI scan on spine... physio say stenosis of spine and that I have a slight curve in spine... After reading reviews I decided to try these tabs I have only taken them for 2 nights ( 1 x 75mg cap) supposed to take 2 daily but I feel I cant wake up in mornings and have to force myself to get out of bed, for a couple hours after i still feel groggy and light headed throughout the day. I dont know whether to perservere with them, I have to say slight improvement with being able to walk with a little less pain. I live in Scotland so my prescription is free for this drug.",
                    "I was on Lyrica until last year until my insurance would not pay for it. They started me on gabapentin which does work very well with me.",
                    "Have been rock bottom down by the river, then re-started Pregabalin. IT IS AMAZING. It only took about 24 hours to notice the difference, and wow. A week later and I am nearly 100%. I knew I was anxious not depressed! It should be prescribed as a first-line choice. Previously on it for 3 yrs. I am a 59yr old housewife.",
                    "I first started taking this for trapped nerve causing cramps in my hand. I started off 25mg 3 times a day for first week. The first thing I felt was calm all my worries went away second week upped to 100mg 3 times a day feel like a lotto winner walking and talking like a new man. No prob with sex its all still working! Slight foggy brain but got my old job back cramps in hand gone all looking well, booking to go away with the wife soon xx",
                    "I couldn't remember the last time I had a \"good\" day since diagnosed having Fibromyalgia until 2010, when I was first told about Lyrica by an emergency doctor. The symptoms & pain had got so bad that I drove myself to a Baylor emergency room. Physically and mentally I just felt defeated. I was so stressed out that I developed an ulcer and my potassium/magnesium levels were so low they admitted me several times for as long as a week on time. Bags of blood had to be given and IV fluids. Ugh..I was a hot mess. I don't recall the doctor that introduced me to Lyrica, cause I was in and out a few times, but all I can say is a BIG thank-you. I've been on Lyrica 300mg a day since 2010. I can get what I need done and function like a normal woman.",
                    "I used this for my last herniated disk issue. I had a sequestered herniated L5 L4 issue and suffered from nerve pain down my left leg and drop foot. Pain Medications (e.g. 10mg Percocet 3-4 times daily) did nothing for my leg pain though helped my back. Lyrica at 150mg twice daily did the trick for my leg nerve pain. The sciatica makes your leg kill while you know nothings wrong with it, so with Lyrica I was amazed to have the leg pain just disappear. No side effects. Sciatica went away by itself after 3 months so no need for Lyrica anymore.",
                    "It's simply a miracle.",
                    "This medicine reduced the pain but immediately caused severe swelling of the legs and feet.I also had constant dizziness.I could not tolerate the swelling and weight gain.",
                    "I had put off taking Lyrica because I was afraid of the side effects. Eventually my nerve pain got to the point where I had no choice. It was completely debilitating. Searing burning pain with no relief. Pain meds didn't touch it. I couldn't sleep because the pain was that bad. My clothes hurt. Soft feather light brushes against my skin stung and BURNED for minutes after contact (more intensely than the consistent present burning). After about three weeks on Lyrica I finally found relief from the worst of it. What I am left with as far as the burning goes is completely tolerable (of course it does nothing for my other symptoms). I'm grateful I caved but am concerned about weight gain & significant cravings for sweets.",
                    "I am a 22 year old female who was in a car accident over a year ago, and 6 months ago started having tension headaches, migraines, and overall muscular pain. I had to quit my job and have barely been able to keep up with school. I took Lyrica for the first time last night. It caused some upset stomach and a weird buzz, but this morning I woke up feeling like a different person. I am still sore from my muscles being weak and tight all the time, but today is the first day I could feel that I was still sick from a headcold. The pain and discomfort had drowned out any other discomfort. I am hopeful for the first time in months.",

I have been on Oxy ER 80mg 2x day and was still not getting full relief (4 out of 10) and having difficulty remembering. Doctor added Lyrica 75mg 2x day three months ago and the day after I felt euphoric. I felt no pain! After one week some pain came back but no peaks as before. Some weight gain. Want to get off of Oxy and try Lyrica or other non-narcotic drugs.",
                    "I have just started lyrica but so far it works great for my anxiety and my back pain. Don't give up when you first start with the side effects they pass and this medication works a lot better than any SSRI or lorazapam which is horribly addictive I think I finally found something that can help and I hope that whoever reads this feels the same",
                    "I use Lyrica 75mg (4 X day), Fentanyl Patch and Percocet up to 8 times a day and I have little times that my feet aren't throbbing. My A1C is 6 and I am not on insulin. There has to be something out there that can help. I have been on Cymbalta, Neurontin,and many others.",
                    "Attackef at age 60. Totally bedridden many years. Husband took me to many neuros who ended up not believing in fibromyalgia. Very insulting suggesting it was\"all in my head\". Many days could just not make myself move or interact. I had great tired feeling and feeling of pain running thru all parts of my body. Oct 2014 I was lucky. Went to another neuro, prescribed 25mg bid lyrica. In 2 weeks I was myself and have not looked back. Befote this I was an avid runner, pilates, overall exerciser. This came fromnowhere. My lyrica is very low but I just needed it evidently.",

I take Pristiq for maintenance depression medicine and I have to say that after only 3 weeks I have had a 8/10 improvement in trigger point pain, no headaches at all. I do have to say that I will probably come off it though because I have probably gained 5-8 lbs and had a lot of edema of hands and feet.",
                    "I take 75 mg. X 2 per day. It seemed to help the first couple of days, now nothing. I have gained 12+ lbs, too. My appetite is getting out of control. I'm going to talk to my doctor about trying something else. Anyone else having problems with weight gain like me? I still need to take an OTC pain medicine with my Lyrica. Anybody ever try muscle relaxers?",

Started Lyrica 7 months ago, now at 75mg x 2, twice daily.  Reduced oxycodone from 80mg daily to 40mg daily, tramadol for breakthrough. Hope to increase Lyrica and further reduce oxy. Still do PT for flares. PT is needling with electricity, like acupuncture with electricity running thru needles. It is amazing. No side effects, no weight gain but possibly weight moved to stomach area, no problem. 5ft 3in, 125 lbs Lyrica is no miracle but finally found combo of therapy, meds (Lyrica inc) for some quality of life.",
                    "I've tried other things for pain. Already take a strong pain medicine, which is getting harder and harder to get, because in my State, one must go to a pain clinic to get it. Pain clinics are horrors. Lyrica seems to work with the amount of pain medicine that I take and seems to have even reduced the \"break through\" pain. No unpleasant symptoms yet.",

                    "I started taking Lyrica after seeing an orthopedic surgeon, for widespread pain and tendinitis. After taking 50 mg a day, I had no difference, then up to 75mg a day, I still had pain in my wrists (most likely because I work on a computer). But MIRACULOUSLY!, I noticed that along with 'Some' pain, my social anxiety is all but GONE! It's not even the reason I started taking it! As for my wrist pain, we've bumped up the mg to 175 per day and it's only been two days, I'm very groggy in the morning. I didn't get that on the 75mg, but I am confident it will subside. I feel like a new person because the easing of the social anxiety was a total surprise! I would recommend this medicine to ANYONE with pain/social anxiety.",
                    "The first time I used Lyrica I experienced an amazingly profound reaction; layers of depression and anxiety that had built up over several years melted away within minutes. That was years ago and I have since both weaned myself off the drug and restarted taking it again. One thing I rarely see mentioned is the terrifyingly bad withdrawal effect- missing more than one dose for me throws me into the absolute darkest pits of despair. Has anyone else experienced this? When I went off the drug the first time I felt like I had performed a miracle; so strong was the feeling that it took a long time for me to convince myself that things were bad enough to warrant going back on. It still helps, but nothing as miraculous as the first time.",
                    "I have taken 3 x 75mg, and amazed at how well Lyrica worked for me after only taking 1 pill. I feel like I can get comfortable for the first time in years. I have high hopes that this doesn't wear off and I can continue to feel so good. I feel like a miracle, really has helped my all over body pain that I live with for years.",
                    "I am suffering from burning pain in my body. I was on the Fentanyl patch for 15 years. That gave me complete relief. Because of drug issues in my state, I tapered off of Fentanyl in Feb. I don't think that Lyrica was around before I started the patch. Since the burning pain came back, I was put on Lyrica. It certainly helped and I can live somewhat pain free. Now the doctor has refused to give me a script for Lyrica because he is afraid of repercussions from authorities. I will have to find another doctor. I am dependent on anything that will take this pain away and I hope I can find a doctor who will give me Lyrica again. It is not giving me a good reputation to be constantly changing doctors.",
                    "I have had Fibromyalgia for 4 years now and recently my doctor put me on Lyrica and Cymbalta. The Lyrica is a true lifesaver, it really helps with the pain. But has a lot of side effects. Cons-Feeling like a zombie, shakes, sick at my stomach, itching and blurry eyes, drowsiness. Pros-My pain is almost all gone, happy mood, and can move free with barely any pain. And I feel like I'm on cloud nine and can't wait to go to sleep. Overall, the Lyrica has really helped me a lot. I have tried the generic gabapentin and Savella. They do not work! I'm so happy that I found this website, for all the people whom have aches and pains as well as I. Thank you.",

I put on over 10 lbs in weight when I first started taking it, but with correct food choices , I lost what I had put on and more. I did at first have an increased balance problem. I now take 200mgs of Lyrica 3 times a day because I have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, I take metformin 500mg twice a day and I've got neuropathy pain. I have no side effects with Lyrica now.The other pain meds I am on is a 500mg Fentanyl patch and Arcoxia and Quinine for leg cramps. I live in the UK and get my pain medication free .",

I am very active in trying to keep the fibromyalgia pain as controlled as possible and just not been able to get to a plateau of any type. After a rough adjustment period of about 5 wks I noticed a drastic change in fibro pain. I have gained a significant amount of weight but over the last three months have been able to maintain. Now I am able to start losing the weight but have to be very careful to not take in complex carbohydrates or sugars in afternoon or evening. I have gone to an almost vegetarian style diet and have noticed that the weight just starts to come off with ease but slowly. My balance and vision are the only consistent side effects that I have.",

I just want to thank all doctors that prescribe this medication because it is a life saver.",

I also have had to raise the dose to 150mg 3 x daily. It really helped with the insomnia that I had suffered with for 10 years. If Lyrica did not have the side effect of weight gain, I would stay on it. Would I recommend this drug, yes I would.",

I researched ways to counteract the negative effects, and started taking a B6 supplement (for weight gain) and an herbal diuretic (for the bloat). I no longer feel bloated, and the headaches are gone. I'm on my 4th (or 5th?) week of lyrica, and am feeling much better. I don't think I'm still gaining weight, but it's too soon to tell. I wasn't eating any more or less than usual, so if the B6 helps, that would be nice.",

                    "I started Lyrica for chronic pain, but realized it was SO great for anxiety - worries disappeared, ruminating thoughts just didn't matter anymore, it was like my troubles were over because none of them mattered anymore (things I should have cared about tho, too). I had been taking 2mg valium everyday for 4 years and was able to taper VERY quickly because of lyrica. Pregabalin helps as a precursor to anxiety; it stops it before it can start, hence the 'PRE'-gabalin. It works on the gaba receptors which are responsible for anxiety. I take 150mg every 8 hours like another reviewer talked about, as I discovered that this was the golden ticket for keeping anxiety away. In Europe, the suggested dose for anxiety is between 400mg-MAX 600mg.",
                    "I was diagnosed with GAD three years ago. It began each morning with a small 'knot' in my stomach and then spread during the day causing tightness if chest, throat and often tension down my arms. It was stupid because there seemed to be no trigger, I just felt tension and worry all day. I was placed on a number of drugs, nothing worked. Busiprone helped but I remained anxious for no valid reason. About 18 months ago my doctor gave me Lyrica to try. Within a couple of days everything returned to normal I was even a bit euphoric but that subsided in a week or so. I started out taking Lyrica 50mg twice a day along with 20mg Busiprone twice a day. I have had to increase dosage over time and now take 200mg a day along with 40mg Busiprone.",

I am Rizwan 32 I had a esvere anxiety disorder 9 years ago I was treated with inderal 40mg b.I. d with paroxetin 25mg I recoverd and temper it off after 6 months gradually But Later on it relapsed wich couldn't coverd resulted in 50 mg of paroxetin initially it helped but relapsed again then I tried several antidepressant like Escitalopram 20 than venlafexine and sertraline and bubropion but none of them worked well than I changed my psychiatrist who put me on Mirtazapine 30mg which has increased to 60mg paroxetine75mg pregabalin450mg Rivotril1mg it helped me well but I am sick to as this also having side effects like this made me lazy, slow and my weight gain from 76kg to 110. Every time I tried to decrease fails badly.",
                    "My doctor calls my Lyrica use a sprint. Week 1 was 50 mg, week 2 - 100mg, the next 4 weeks were 150 mg in the evening. Now we are working our way up to doing the same thing for the second dose in the morning. I must admit I am glad she is doing it this way. The first weekend after I started taking it was the first weekend I actually wanted to do something, like move when I did not have to. I've adjusted slowly to the drowsiness and confusion to where it is not nearly as bad as when I first started taking it. There has been weight gain but I am slowly getting to the point of wanting to get back into that gym. Thank you Lyrica.",

I have also tried muscle relaxants like Soma. All of these helped but I still had painful days. Lyrica gets rid of the pain. I have been on it for 2 months and it is a miracle drug. I have my life back and can be productive. Also controls painful flares. Haven't had a flare yet. Lyrica is great.",

Lyrica although it does help with the pain, the side effects are just too much for me. I have been on it for over 2 years now and the water retention and weight gain is great. I weened down and stopped taking it a week ago and have already lost 10 lbs and the edema in my legs is gone. If I could take the Lyrica without the weight gain and water retention I would in a heart beat. Hopefully something else will work well for me.",
                    "I have been using Pregabalin for about 6 weeks and I have found it highly effective with my anxiety. I have had very little side effects. I have found that as my anxiety is worry,overthinking and my mind constantly racing. It has slowed down my rate of thinking and worrying, whilst I am aware they are there I find I am able to process them easier and thoughts become less irrational. Coupled with some CBT therapy I find this medication highly effective. The only thing to be wary of is on higher doses (I'm on 75mg) they can have a drunk feeling effect and so I asked my Dr to prescribe me with a lower dosage for daytime (incase of driving or working etc) so I take 25mg in the day and the 75mg at night and find this works for me.",
                    "I was on Lyrica for 5 months. It seemed to help with the pain somewhat for a while, but didn't stop it. Also, I GAINED 40 POUNDS. The doctor told me if I was careful about my eating habits that I wouldn't gain too much weight, but this was not true. After I went off it, I lost 22 pounds in 2 weeks - just from water weight. I have yet to be able to lose the rest of the weight.",

Search with google of you dont believe me. I took it for about a year, yes it worked for my problems the first couple but you arent aware yet what it is doing to you. It does permanent brain aging , you will be confused and have terrible memory the rest of your life and this problem becomes very clear to you when you quit. I did for 5 years now and still can't function  That is when you can quit because this drug is highly addictive and the withdrawal when you decide to quit is stuff out of nightmares.

                    "Lyrica is effective against anxiety but I have recently chosen to go off it due to side effects. The side effects are okay (not as bad as the SSRI's) but the main side effects I was concerned about were: Brain Fog (I became much dumber), forgetfulness, loss of physical sensations including less feeling during sex.

I've been taking it at night and experienced involuntary tremors, muscle spasms, twitching of my fingers, arms and legs.The twitching is scary! It's involuntary, I have no control of my body when this happens. My leg started twitching and it stuck straight up, waking me from a deep sleep! The twitching and tremors linger all day. Lyrica caused severe swelling in my feet,ankles and legs. It's very uncomfortable. I also experienced loss of balance, dizziness, blurred vision and ulcer sores on my tongue and in my mouth.

He got overruled by a doctor with a brain, but doctor Weisman seems to think Lyrica does't work for the treatment of peripheral neuropathy his reasoning was because the doctor didn't put diabetic in front of peripheral neuropathy. Lyrica won't work the thing this doctors doesn't understand is that the Lyrica is treating only the peripheral neuropathy the diabetic part mean nothing except that the peripheral neuropathy is being cause by the diabetes.

It also must be taken with a calcium supplement. I had been taking the D2 for several years, and then they wanted me to take Prolia as my bone loss was getting worse. Stopping the D2, and starting the D3 at 5,000 iu a day with 600 mg of calcium has helped quite a bit. I would suggest anyone try this before taking something like Prolia, or Forteo for bone loss. If you have osteoporosis, you need the supplements either way. Wife took Forteo everyday for 26 months, and less than 4 years later they now want her to try Prolia too.Check wikipedia for info on this."

I stopped taking it because I still had migraines and because of the rapid weight gain. I have never gained more than 5lbs. I was 120-125 most of my life. I gained 5 lbs after having 4 kids. I gained 20lbs each time I was pregnant and lost it quickly. I still have these 30 lbs that I can't lose from this damn nortriptyline.

After a year without medication I lost contact with my friends and most of my family, no longer went out for enjoyment, stopped writing and generally just comforted myself with TV. I finally went back to my doctor a week ago and he put me on Nortriptyline 10mg. The first two days were a painful introduction of lethargy and dizzyspells. On the third day my world had changed.

I lost my vision straight away and ended up having emergency surgery up my nose on a burst pituarty gland so close to my Brain it was bleeding and only so much removed, it benign thank goodness but I'm blind in my right eye possibly permanent and only about 20% vision in my left eye with no left vision and it could take at least a year to function properly.",
                    "I titrated up over two months, 10 mg at a time until I reached 50 mg. The side effects for me were: bad dreams, increased appetite, tiredness, heartburn, decreased sex drive, and sadness. I began taking the medicine at 7 PM and that eliminated the bad dreams. However, the medicine made me feel depressed. I would feel sad and start crying for no reason. This was all in the first 2 months and then the side effects went away. I have been at 50 mg for almost 3 months now and I feel normal! While it was hard for me in the first few months, I stuck with it and sure enough the side effects went away.  Unfortunately, I've been getting more migraines recently, and so I'm instructed to titrate up to 90 mg... So I'm not sure if it works yet",
                    "I'm 61 yrs old and have been taking Nortriptyline for about 30 years for depression. I believe I was depressed most of my life before being diagnosed. Initially, it took about 4 weeks before I started feeling the effects of the drug, but once it kicked in it made all the difference in the world. After many years, my doctor had me try some of the newer SSRI drugs (while still on Nortriptyline) and with each one I didn't feel at all like myself (like I was watching my life from outside myself), so with each attempt at trying a new drug, I kept going back to what worked best. Nortriptyline. I guess I'd consider myself a poster child for the drug, because it's always given me a level mood and I've never experienced deep depression while on it.",

I was put on only 30 mg a night to prevent headaches and to help me sleep. It certainly made me sleep a lot the first few nights. At first I was afraid it was a dud, but then 2 weeks later my migraines were less frequent; after 2 months on it, I have about 20 percent of the migraines I used to have. I get great sleep, and the best (and most surprising) part was that although it is a tiny dose, it was just what I needed to finally not be depressed and anxious. I only gave it 9 starts instead of ten because sometimes the dry mouth is unbearable at times.",

The first two weeks are hard to gauge the effect of it because for the first week I was in a much higher altitude than normal, and the second week was my schools finals. So far very unhappy with the drug as I am still getting 4-5 headaches a week, even during \"normal life\" with nothing going on. Will be talking to my doctor to see what can be done about it, maybe a different dosage or time taking it will change my opinion. Willing to try anything to reduce headache frequency and severity.",
                    "It took four months before I could titrate up from 50mg to 75mg. I'm on it for Dysautonomia, nuerolgia, fibromyalgia, depression. At that point I felt significant improvement from the depression and panic attacks. I weaned myself off at one point for fear that I was having a bad side effect. I had forgotten how much pain relief it provided until I was off of it. This is one of the most helpful medications I've ever taken! It helps with pain, dysautonomia and depression! I don't think it gives me bad side effects. I've had serious bad side effects from SSRI's so I was very nervous but had to try something. I'm also on Gabapentin which helps with sleep and pain but coupled with this drug I've done so much better.",

My ENT doctor recommended seeing a neurologist to determine if migraines were affecting me. I'd have 8/9 pain 3 to 4 times a month, 4/5 pain often and 2/3 pain almost constantly. I've had it so long that I'd routinely work through it, but it's taken a toll periodically on my personal and professional lives. I'm currently taking 30mg nightly and am virtually headache free. It's great having relief after so long. Research in the last five years indicates that migraines are often misdiagnosed as sinusitis also if you know someone suffering with what seems be sinus pain, have them get an opinion from a neurologist.",

After taking multiple drugs, Imitrex, Prodrin, Midrin, not much relief. After about 2 weeks on Nortriptyline my continuous headache had diminished, \"almost\" entirely. I did notice though many afternoons my headache return and I had to take other meds to help reduce the discomfort. I talked to my doctor and he agreed maybe 2x a day would be best. 25mg in the morning and again at night. That was about 3 weeks ago and now, very rarely do I have any headaches, at any time of day. I hope this continues. What a relief. To me, this has been a true wonder drug for my 24 hour headache! No side effects.",

The only side effect I have is sleepiness in the mornings. Other than that it's a charm.",

Seldom have I had headaches my entire life. I'm now 60. After 4 visits to a doctor, (the first one prescribed antibiotics saying I had a sinus infection-no help what so ever, the second guy Midrin, same thing). I was prescribed nortriptyline at 25mg once a day by my last visit with a new doctor. It has been 3 days, so not much change, yet. I can put up with any/all the side effects mentioned, if I get relief. I will repost in a week or 2, when hopefully it has kicked in. Scheduled for a CAT scan in 2 days.....we'll see. Reading these posts has given me some hope.",

Like a hangover headache with nausea and dizziness. It is worse than the headaches I had before I started taking the medication. I've also noticed my energy levels are way lower and I am super constipated everyday. Dr did advise me about the constipation but not the lack of interest in doing things. I am super slow and have literally no energy to do anything. So I am not sure if it is related. I want to try to get off medicine but dr advises against this. I am not sure what to do.",

A few weeks back I went to another doctor who gave me Nortriyptyline! He told me my Migraines could be due to stress. For example, I know I have to go to work, I get ready, but then I decide to take the day off. I get a migraine.

Being hyper was super in the day as it completely removed my severe fatigue. Dropped to half dose 25mg to see if it helped. The hyperness continued unfortunately though less, but the nerve pain also returned, though not as severe. Other side effects which are a little worrying: Woke one morning with massive pain in one eye/side of head unlike anything I've had before. Scary. Also a constant eye tic has developed plus a constant weird dizzy ringing feeling in the head and vertigo when standing.

I often get very thirsty as a side affect and I'm almost always constipated. I'm actually typing this up as I'm in the bathroom right now, constipated.

Cons: dry mouth, flatulence, lower sex drive, some weight gain, groggy in the morning, increased appetite, harder to urinate (dribbling). Pros: No anxiety around quitting smoking, seemed easier this time, medication is covered on drug plan, I feel committed and have been (no bargaining with myself to have 'just one'), It works!

The two times I stopped were because it was no longer effective in preventing migraines. During those times my doctor increased beta blockers for 6 months then went back to the regular dosage with nortriptyline. I take up to 100 mg a day but average 50mg. Sometimes I take for granted how well this medication has worked for me. The downsides are weight gain, restlessness and vivid dreams.

I also began having bad thoughts about hurting myself. I have had bad thoughts in the past, but always had control of them. These felt very different, I had no control of them.

The first couple weeks... no other side affects, also was mildly helpful but not entirely. By the time I got to 60mgs, I was disassociating from my body, felt like I was going to crash my car when I drove it, dropped things, couldn't focus, couldn't speak without slurring my words, and I was extremely depressed...so I dropped down to 50mgs and everything is great now.

I only take 10mg and my prescription says to increase as necessary, but I've been on it successfully for over a year now.

I did not heed the warning to avoid alcohol the first week and was very ill as a consequence. I was vomiting for 2 days afterwards and very dehydrated. My own fault. I am going to speak to my doctor to see if we should add to the dosage to try and get rid of the pain completely. I am currently on 10mg per night.

I had pretty severe burning pain. Within 3 days the burning stopped. Most of the pain went away except at night. I went up on the gabapentin several times. I didn't want to go up on Nortryptyline due to side effects ( extreme dry mouth, and it was hard to wake up in the morning). Occasionally I miss a dose on accident, I go to sleep without it. I will hurt so much that I can't do anything but sit and use ice packs all day. Also my pain will be much worse for 3 whole days following a missed pill. This has happened 5-6 times. Nortryptyline is the most effective medicine I ta",

I was told to increase the Nortriptyline as required to 20 mg at night if necessary but so far I have not had to do that. Side effects have been virtually non existent against the benefit of it.",
                    "I used to take quetiapine to fall asleep at night, but when I started to take nortriptyline I had to stop using it because these two meds interact. the doctors told me that nortriptyline would help me sleep at night, too. it doesn't. i have to wake up at 7 every morning for work, and I honestly can't remember the last time I fell asleep before 0200 in the morning. the side effects of this medication are way more intense than any other meds I've tried. it does help a litte bit with anxiety, but my depression hasn't improved.",
                    "For 25 years I suffered with migraines with aura, numbness in my hands, face, + nausea etc. I tried everything the doctors suggested, & avoided triggers. I haven't eaten chocolate in 32 years, never eat bananas, & I've never had red wine. In 1997, a neurologist prescribed 100mg of Pamalor, and 500mg of Naproxen 2x a day. It completely changed my life. I now stay away from the obvious triggers, & take 50mg a night(75 during my periods) & 250mg naproxen. I get migraines about 5x a year now, & use Imitrex then). I've taken it for 18 years & would like to ween off of it. I don't like the heart concerns associated with it, constipation, nor the weight gain. I exercise daily, maintain a 1200 cal diet, & still gain weight.. 50 lbs in 18 years.",

After extensive testing to rule out brain tumours, Wilson's disease, MS, etc, I was essentially told that I would have to manage my migraines for the rest of my life. The only pain meds that worked were T3s which weren't an option when I was getting more than one migraine a week. After trying several medications Nortriptyline actually worked. My only complaint is the worsening of my other symptoms such as vision issues, an essential tremor, and speech difficulties. The benefits far outweigh the costs though. I am a functional person today because of this medication",

Hence, the increase in anxiety & depression. I will admit that I was having a really bad day & out of desperation I took this (had it but never took it)--& it squashed the anxiety.

At age 32, a foot doctor tells me that I am a victim of visual migraines and suggested nortriptyline. Went to neurologist for medicine. I am on 50mg taken each night before bed. Visual effects still occur intermittently but migraine is aborted. Still have headache for three days but the medicine keeps me from being incapacitated for days. I am now 50 years old and could not live without it. I have dry mouth, redness of skin, sensitive to sun and problems urinating at times but these issues are nothing compared to what I lived with for 20 years. I highly recommend the product!",

I was at 125/130 beats per min. I'd only been getting a few hours of sleep each night in those 2 weeks, and experienced the heart racing, brain short circuits, insomnia, anxiety, severe constipation, extreme thirst, and an overall feeling of disconnect from aliveness.  As a teenager, I took Doxepin and Elavil too, and they were slightly better, but not much. These TCAs should be a last resort like Thorazine and Lithium. Seroquel is much better.

It didn't work; the hives, itching, tingling, and burning all returned. Back on the nortriptyline; my doctor allows me to vary my dosage from 50-80 mg depending on how my neuropathy is doing. Very noticable difference when I lower it; thinking I could get by with less because feeling better. 80mg seems to work very well for me.",

Finally nortriptyline (25mg) once a day before bed has FINALLY given me relief. It's only been one week since I started this drug but it's been a week where I can actually leave the house and not worry about my IBS (diarrhea) issues. I'm a 37 year old male. Lomotil and Imodium have only worked partially for me. Nortriptyline worked right away (the next day I was issue free - and I'm not exaggerating) I wish my doctor had me try this medicine earlier, although I do understand him wanting me to try other medicines first.

I was on many medications and in high doses. Didn't help. It was very frustrating cause no one believed what I experienced was real. Till a friend on college said maybe it's just in your head and encouraged me to see the counsellor who in turn sent me to.the shrink.

I will tell you now that out of all the steroid injections (16 in my neck, and base of my skull), physical therapy, different pain medications, nortriptyline has helped me the most. I still have headaches here and there, but it's not every day and I'm not calling out of work every other week. Since I have been on it, I haven't called out of work. I have about 2-3 headaches a week, but instead of rating the pain a 8,9,or 10 I'm now in a pain range of 3 or 4, sometimes 5. I may be taking this drug for the rest of my life, but it beats waking up in pain everyday.",

It stopped the loose bowel movements and the stomach pain every time I would eat. Had hard lumpy poops still no pain and a lot better than worrying if I was going to make it to a bathroom. After a year and a half not sure if it was cause of PMS (which never had an problem, a little crabby nothing more) I had a severe panic, anxiety, could not think almost psychotic. So cut my dose in half for a week and then stopped taking it and four days later IBS is back. DR is going to try something else but if it don't work I'm going to go back and risk the mental issues.",

I had tried amitriptyline before but it made me very drowsy. The headache relief with 75mg daily of Nortriptyline has been nothing short of miraculous for me. I do get rare mild to intermediate headaches from time to time but they never last long at all. The dry mouth is a real occurrence, but easily ignored. I've been reading about other possible side effects lately and was surprised to find that tingling and numbness in the extremities is a possible rare phenomenon. I must admit my fingers do get numb frequently. I was beginning to wonder if I was experiencing a symptom of carpal tunnel syndrome. Small price though!",

I went up to 40 mg. but experienced frequent night terrors and was scared down to back to 30 mg. (for 18mo which is still effective and reduced night terrors. No heart palpitations, but do experience dry mouth. Recently, I thought I would titrate down to 20 mg. BAD mistake, I experienced the famous ice pick headache for two days.

All affected my cognitive functioning (can't think, difficulty processing information, very bad memory, couldn't express myself verbally). Have had just about every scan done possible, showing nothing of concern. My neurologist started me on 25 mg. ofNortriptyline, and the head-hurting has stopped!Still some dizziness and difficulty processing information. Only side effect is dry mouth and a bad taste in my mouth, so always carry water. Happy with just this change as a place to start! I used to just cry, hold my head and stay home.",

I have been off medication all winter and since heat and activity is a big trigger I had to get back on medication. I had been very groggy in the mornings and caffeine wouldn't help I had insomnia and when I did sleep I had nightmares. Those side affects slowly went away with time except the nightmares they still come every once in awhile. I have heart palpitations and my heart rate is usually 130-120.

Once diagnosed with migraines about four years ago, I was able to reduce the frequency and severity by avoiding known triggers (see Buchholz's \"Heal Your Headache\") but recently the headaches recently returned in force.  I convinced my doctor to let me try nortriptyline and it works very well with very mild side effects. I had dry mouth which is not very noticeable now, higher incidence of heartburn than normal, firmer stools, and frequent \"weird\", vivid dreams. Relief started at 25 mg but I now take 75 mg daily. Migraine frequency is down from 20+ days a month to 1-2. I still avoid most triggers to be safe but this has helped tremendously",

After 6 weeks the only down side is I cannot drink alcohol but a small price to pay and if I try to reduce them I go back to the same conditions I had before taking them.

I do still occasionally get headaches every few months but they never last more than a few hours and generic Imitrex helps. I asked the doctor about going off the nortriptyline but she said if not's broken why fix it. So I am going to stay on this wonder drug. Best of luck to anyone suffering with headaches. It's a tough time.",

I went to a Dr. at the age of 22 and he put me on Pamelor. I was afraid to take it but I did. The first few days it made me feel weird. I felt like a zombie at first for maybe 3 days but then it went away. In 6 weeks my depression was gone and I felt like a normal person. I was normal. I think my does at one point was 100 which is moderate. People need to know that this type of med takes 6-8 weeks to work and when it does its like a fog has lifted, for me at least. You have to be careful with weight gain because it does increase your appetite. It helped me sleep at night. 6-8 weeks to work.",

Previously I was on a cocktail of Tegretol, amitriptyline and gabapentin which completely left me like a zombie. After being 'pain free' for 7 years, I began to wean myself off them but only recently the pain has begun to return so I'm going go back to the doctor for my script. Sometimes it's better to carry on taking the tablets even if you think the pain has gone as they cannot cure you, they merely mask the pain, which is good enough for me.",

I started with 10mg taken at bedtime with little relief. Eventually, increased dose to 75mg and am happy to report migraines have decreased from 2-3 week to 2/mo.

Slept great on that and had no ED problems. Had the fogginess the next day though I had gotten used to that. Planning to switch back but Doc wants me to wait two weeks in hope that side effects will lessen. Have DDD in lower back 4+ years and chronic foot pain from super high arches for 17 years.

I wanted to go the anti-depressant route since I am also chronically depressed, and since counseling and other medications I have tried did not help. After the first week on Pamelor the migraines were drastically reduced in both frequency and severity, and I went the next three weeks without any pain in my head. My mood is stabilized, I have a clarity that I have never had, and getting out of bed in the morning is no longer excruciating.

I've been on it over 10 years, but unfortunately about five years ago the side effects started to get a lot worse. Urinary retention is quite a plaque to have in your life. A year ago I also developed tinnitus. I have recently started weaning off and the tinnitus and retention is improving. If it wasn't for the side effects increasing, this would be a perfect drug. It fixed my insomonia and gave me 8 perfect hours of sleep for the past 12 years. It also helps a lot with my nerve pain. It's not a 100% but compared to other drugs its top of class for me. I'm not giving Tradazone and Ativan a try.",

I was given Amitriptylene first (5mg.) and I was like a zombie the entire next day. I tried it a few times to give it a chance but without any change. A specialist that I saw a couple of months suggested that I try Nortriptylene because even though it is in the same family as Amitriptylene sometimes it has a different effect. I have taken it for 4 nights now and have noticed a huge difference in the way my bladder feels. Spasms are gone and the heaviness and burning have gone as well. I haven't slept well since taking it but was having trouble sleeping through the night anyway. No day grogginess though.",

I now get a migraine perhaps five or six times a year compared with one a week previously. It did cause dry mouth at first, though that has abated. And my mood is much improved, possibly because I have fewer headaches and possibly because of the drug's antidepressive effects. The main problem is weight gain. I feel hungry almost all the time. That said, I'm not ready to return to pre-nortriptyline days and, instead, will work on diet and exercise.",

Lucky for me nortriptyline was the first one I was prescribed. I was getting migraines 4/5 times a week and it was REALLY getting in the way of my life. Within the first 2 weeks the migraines stopped!! I didn't get one again until 3 months of being on nortriptyline and it was a mild headache that I managed perfectly with Excedrine! Now I manage about one headache a month with Excedrine and take 30mg of nortriptyline daily before bed. Only side effect I have is hair loss.",

Neurologist put me on Nortriptyline. Started out with 10mg, each week added another 10mg till I was up to 40 mg. By the second week, my headache went way down. In a month it was completely gone. Tried to wean myself down, but headache returned. I'm staying on the 40 mg! I feel great now! This stuff works!!",

I had nearly given up hope. The only thing that seemed to help at all was activated charcoal.  One day a nurse practitioner prescribed me nortriptyline to trial. She told me that it wasn't for IBS but it may help with some of its symptoms. Within a week my pains went away and have been gone now for 2 years. I take one pill every night before bed.

I was taking narcotics constantly because of the head pain, I do not have migraines.

The second was so bad I was directly admitted from my first neurology appointment to the hospital for 14 DHE treatments (yuck).

I spent lots of time researching online and trying various treatments including elimination diets, supplements, various exercises etc.. My GP recommended I try Nortriptyline at nights starting at 10mg dosage and said that it'd take around a month to kick in. After about 3 weeks I switched to taking it in the morning and it's been working wonders every since. Pretty much IBS free and have my life back.",

It was very hard to deal with the daytime fatigue and this was only on a 25 mg dose, but two cups of coffee took care of that. I stopped taking it suddenly after 1.5 months due to a change in mood/angry/depressed feelings which I've never experienced, and sure enough I was in bed for 3 days with a migraine. So, I'm back on the medicine, have been almost migraine free for 3 months, the fatigue has gone away, and as long as I remember to read my \"positive thoughts/positive things in my life\" when I feel a little depressed (this medicine or at least 25mg a day hasn't helped depression) I'm fine.

But by the fourth or fifth day, all of that was gone, and my headaches went too. I'm glad I stuck it out, because I had had headaches that interfered with my daily life. It made me very drowsy at first, and still does act as a bit of a sedative, so I only take it if I plan to sleep very soon. Also, it really lowered my alcohol tolerance, so watch out for that.",

Have taken anti-depressants on/off for 12 years. Stopped those and started nortriptyline 10mg at night. The spiders stopped crawling completely during the day, so the pain associated with it stopped.

Started having severe migraines about once a week for which I finally sought a more permanent treatment. Had some undesirable side effects to a few of the initial prescriptions. Hair loss, nausea, insomnia, etc. I had a rough start with Nortriptyline. As I increased the dosage I experienced prolonged drowsiness and some constipation. After a few weeks the symptoms decreased and my head aches stopped being a daily occurrence. I have had a few migraines since starting but these have also become less frequent.

Additional benefits include helping me fall asleep easier and reducing the symptoms of a serious sleep disorder. The only negative side effect directly related to this med has been severe thirst requiring me to drink water and urinate very frequently. However this annoying and inconvenient side effect is well worth it. I'm also at high risk for angle closure, but am unsure if it's related.

I found that when it was combined with 100 MG of sertaline (zoloft). This combination gave me the greatest relief from the chronic depression I have suffered from since the age of 15. But I was not aware of its anticholinergic effects on older people which manifested at age 67 when I began to experience problems walking, repeated falls, lethargy, mental confusion and memory problems. In addition to the noritripteline, I was also taking benadryl (over the counter) to aid with sleep at night, another anticholinergic drug.

I was put on a small dose of nortiptyline (20MG) and within a week I was feeling somewhat better and within 2 weeks I felt almost normal again. This medicine has changed my life.

Stopped taking nortriptyline, and felt so much better almost instantly.",
                    "My doctor just put me on this, 10mg at night, and I have woken up with a bad migraine each morning after I've taken the pill. I don't know if I should continue.",
                    "I've had migraines since my teens and they become more frequent as an adult. A doctor prescribed nortriptyline as a preventative in my mid 20s. It worked well for me. We did 10mg at night for a few months and stopped it worked well. When the migraines became more frequent a few years later we switched to continued use and 20mg a night. Migraines are now rare unless I am dealing with serious stress. Headaches in general have been reduced in number.",
                    "I'm currently on 150mg daily of this medication and it does a great job in preventing headaches. A few smaller ones get through that ibuprofen will take care of but the amount of serious headaches and migraines have decreased significantly. The only difficulty is because the pills are so lightweight they do not go down easily. I have to chase it with food (such as taking it during dinner) or else the pills get stuck and cause pretty bad heartburn-type difficulties.",
                    "I suffered lower back pain for 15 years and finally my \"Pain Specialist\" gave me a prescription for a starter of Nortriptyline. 1 week 10mg, 1 week 20mg, 1 week 30mg, 1 week of 40mg and 1 week of 50 mg and the pain was gone. It made me very hyper, but I was out of pain and happy. I was on it for 6 months and a change in insurance forced me to taper back off. Basically the starter in reverse. As each week ended I kept wondering when the pain would come back. It was amazing because it never did come back. I had lost some weight and built up my core muscles, so that helped. After 15 years of daily pain, the kind that makes you think oh no when someone invites you anywhere, I have been pain free for over a year.",
                    "My neurologist prescribed nortriptyline 2 years ago to help with my chronic migraines, which I'd had since I was 13 years old. I'd suffer migraines at least 4 times a week and the pain would be excruciating. I'd suffer from rebound migraines as well and it turned out that I can't take medicines like Excedrin because they actually worsen my migraines. Imitrex stopped working. Once I started Nortriptyline, I started seeing relief within the first two months. I'm on a steady 30mg and as long as I eat right, keep active and reduce stress [a big factor to how they'd start at first], I only get level 8/9 migraines 2/3 a month, usually at the start and end of my menstrual cycle, and take Treximet for them.",
                    "My neurologist prescribed Nortriptyline for Neuropathy. It did not help much for that condition.However, at the time I was suffering from severe depression due to having to place my husband in a nursing home. The medication did wonders for me and I have been a daily user since that time.",
                    "I am currently 16 y/o & have been taking nortriptyline for about 6 years to treat migraines. I have been getting migraines since I was 8 or 9 and it eventually got to the point where migraines were a daily thing for me. After seeing a neurologist & trying out 2 or 3 other perscriptions, my neurologist prescribed nortriptyline. It worked for a while then my dosage needed to be increased, however I still take it to this day, once before bed every single night. The only time I get a migraine now is if I'm sick, skip two or more doses, or encounter a trigger, such as prolonged sun exposure, dehydration, large caffeine amounts, etc.",
                    "I've been taking this pill among others for pain and migraines , I started with 25 mg, and it was upped to 50 because I was still in pain and having head aches, while this hasnt helped my pain, it has helped my migraines I havent had one since taking it, and I usually had one once a week, I still get head aches. Im not sure if this helps or if its my other medications. I feel like this stuff makes me dizzy when outside in the heat, I have a constant dry mouth, my sex drive in no longer alive, I cant remember things and get confused easy. But I sleep good and my head doesnt hurt... I'm still in constant pain. And it seems like I have the hunger of 3 teenagers. Im 27 and have DDD, I hope I can find something that works.",
                    "Well I'm currently taking four 25mg nortriptyline a night for the past few months this is the only tablet that seems to keep my migraines at bay as I was diagnosed with classical migraines after my MRI scan if I miss one night I will get a migraine the day after every time I cannot miss a night taking them otherwise I pay for it the next day I can have up to 3 major migraines a day but this dosage and these tablets seem to be working for me .",

Now taking 50mg at bed time for a little over a month with almost no headache. Forgot to fill my prescription and went without for 2 days ... back to an extreme headache. Headache definitely fixed by nortriptyline!",

I've also had two serious incidents in combat and two vehicle accidents in the states. I have been on everything I think, no help so far and recently 3 months ago put on stepped into nortriptolyne 50 mg along with gabapentin. I must say I'm a bit better as I'm not on bed rest as I used to not be able to get up. I have also been forced to carry a Tens unit which helps with spasms along with Robaxin and at times have to take Norco when it gets bad.  I'm hoping for the best and hoping to just be on one pill or none soon. Oh, and therapy weekly. So far I can only say : I think nortriptyline helps.",
                    "I had been experiencing daily migraines for a couple of years. I had tried many things and then my rheumatologist put me on Nortriptyline. Within about 4 weeks the headaches were completely gone and I had my life back. I have been taking it for over 6 months now and haven't had one headache. Nortriptyline saved my sanity and made me think clearer than I had for years. I will not be stopping this any time soon.",
                    "I've been taking 30mg a night for 7 or 8 years now. It doesn't stop the migraines but it lessens the pain and makes them less frequent. One of the better medications I have tried. Others have either not worked or have had horrible side effects. I tried to go off of Nortriptyline twice now because I do feel it increases my appetite, but both times the headaches got worse. So for me Nortriptyline and Botox shots have been the most helpful.",
                    "Have suffered with back pain for 22 yrs. I'm 60 yrs old now. Started taking nortriptyline 4 days ago. While I know that's not very long I can say back pain is much better. Depression is much better. Overall feeling is much better. Sleeping better and longer. I have noticed some drowsiness but not a lot. I hope things continue in the direction I'm currently headed. Good luck!",
                    "To those of you who are having nightmares, they will go away. I had them so bad but it worked so well for the low back neuropathy I was finally able to walk again. My back kills me. I take 30 MG throughout the day now. Taking it with tramadol decreases the effectiveness of the drug.  Nortryptilline is a tricyclic antidepressant. It blocks the receptors in the cerebellum so pain signals cannot be received. This is not FDA approved because being an antidepressant when one is it depressed can be very risky and cause serious side effects. For those of you who are waking up on this medication, you could be low on serotonin and those that are falling asleep you could have too much. It will also make you very constipated. Be careful.",
                    "For several years I have lived with spine and disc-damage. I have been on a controlled narcotics program for quite a while. It saved my life. Chronic pain scrambles the brain. I was already on fluoxetine, but felt I was losing ground. Then my docor put me on nortriptyline. GREAT results. I feel better mentally, and the medicine somehow \"soothes\" inflamed spinal-cord areas. NOT my imagination-over the years, doctors tried several medicines for this, none worked. This one helped both the depression AND nerve-impulses at the discs/spinal-cord.",
                    "I've been on this for 3 weeks now and it helps so much. I used to have migraines that would last up to 3-4 days at a time non stop. Lately I have only had 1 mild headache a week. Wish I was put on this years ago.",
                    "Took this for nerve pain and it helped! Except I would rather ache & have nerve pain than deal with the side effects I experienced. I kept getting nightmares that were so horrific, I eventually started sleeping with the lights on & thus not sleeping as good. Within 6 months I gained 20 lbs without changing my eating habits nor physical activity. Looking back, there was a short period of time when my vision was affected as I had trouble focusing. At the time, I just thought my contacts prescription was getting too strong for me. I decided to revisit the list of side effects and sure enough there they all were. I quit taking Nortriptyline that day and eventually the nightmares, blurred vision, & weight gain went away.",

After Topamax, steroids, beta blockers, you name it I've tried it. Finally I've been put on nortriptyline, after 2 weeks I haven't had a single migraine. I hate to be skeptical but it's almost too good to believe for me since I've been sick so long, so I will be reporting back soon. But I even feel differently just how my brain feels. Right now I'm quite thrilled and the results seem to be what's reported by everyone else here (taking 25mg at night).",

In March 2015 I was referred to a neurologist who suggested I try Nortriptyline starting at 25mg before bed. I have progressed to 50mg as although the migranes went away I was still suffering with headaches at least 4 times a week. I am happy and only suffering irregular heart palpitations and night terrors. But overall I am extremely happy and am so thankful that life is back to normal. I can now function and go about my daily activities without constant pain.",
                    "I have been suffering with my migraines and daily headaches since I was a child, I am now 34. I have tried Tramadol (sometimes REALLY good but other times gave me a worse headache), Amitriptyline (no impact) and now Nortriptyline. I started on 10mg in the morning and 20mg at night. I had to go up to 20mg twice a day to see any effect. My headaches are now down to about one a week, which I can take pain killers for, so this medication has been amazing for me. The only downside for me is the extremely dry mouth, but that pales in comparison to the positives. I have also seen that Nortriptyline has lead to weight gain for some. I am fortunate in that it actually keeps hunger at bay. I have only been on the medication for 8 weeks.",

I have found that since l started taking the Nortripine my moods have been more up and down and my downs are considerable. I am now going to ask doctor for antidepressants. 15-20 minutes after I take my pill each night I get really itchy all over my body for about 10 minutes and then it suddenly stops. I have also found that I have really vivid and scary dreams now of being chased. I also take Tramadols to manage pain levels but have found that since starting Nortripine l can no longer drive after taking Tramadol, previously l managed fine. I have found no improvement in my pain levels",

I take it every night (because it does make me sleepy) and If I forget my headaches start right back up around 3pm the next day. One downfall is that I seem to craves snacks much more since I've been on this drug. I'll take that side-effect over chronic headache.",

After lots of testing my neurologist put me on Nortriptyline and it took about 6 months to get the dosage and migraines/vertigo under control but I am still on 75mg today for the past 7 years. I still have problems with dry mouth and I personally think it makes me a little forgetful (short term memory). I was a little lazy about taking it a few months ago and was wondering if it was still affective after 7 YEARS, and yes it is. One week after not taking it I got vertigo again which I haven't had in 3 years. So I'll be on this for life. I only get breakthrough migraines during my period for which I take a ketaprofen.",
                    "I started at 10 mg at bedtime for pain in my lower back, the pain would go down both legs and was ruining my life- after a few weeks I was up to 60 mg and I am virtually pain free. I am sleeping great, too. The dry mouth usually comes for me after I up the dose, one thing though, I had a numb spot right above my right knee which is caused by a pinched nerve in my pelvic region- the numbness has turned to a fullness in my knee now...weird but I can live with it.",
                    "I have had a headache upon waking every day for 40 years. I always took Excedrin and when it was taken off the market my headaches became much more frequent and migraines were a weekly occurrence. Nothing helped so my neurologist put me on Nortriptyline 10mg but I can take up to 3 if needed. First time taking it I didn't have a headache in the morning. It has been a Godsend. My only side effects are that I oversleep. I take it at bedtime, which is the morning since I work nights, but it made my mind \"wake up\" so I take my Lunesta with it. I have to force myself to get up after 8 hours so that I don't sleep 10 hours or more which is easily done. It's been 3 months with a rare minor headache that OTC aspirin takes care of.",
                    "I thought I'd share my experience as I was madly reading all the reviews on this website before starting this drug. I get it on the NHS in the UK and I take 20mg a day. Taking this drug and combining it with the plan in Dr David Buccholz' book Heal Your Headache has been the closest I've got to a total cure for my chronic severe migraines. There are almost no side effects. It's amazing.  A word of caution. At one point when I tried increasing to higher doses above 20mg I had very bad mood swings for a few days. Even when I started from 0 to 10mg I had very bad mood swings for a few days but then it evens out and becomes unnoticeable.",
                    "I was given nortriptyline by a pain doctor 7 years ago. It did help somewhat with the pain. However the side effects have been giving me problems ever since. I have problems concentrating but worse than that I daydream constantly. I can't shut it off. It lasts for hours. It is like it turned on a daydreaming switch in my brain and I can't shut it off. I went off of it expecting it to stop. It never has. It gets more unmanageable. I do not know what to do.",

I started the nortriptyline about a year ago after countless trips to the hospital to get a grip on my pain. Since last summer, I've noticed a HUGE difference since being on the nortriptyline. There is still some pain, but the medicine really calmed everything down. The only thing that I frown upon is the fact that it makes me very tired. Even though I take it at bedtime. I take 75mg every night and I wake up feeling groggy every day. I'm not sure if anyone else has had this experience and side effect. But I'd rather be tired than in pain, good luck to everyone!",

Far as my IBS goes I was put on Dicyclomine which wasn't helping me at all. After being on Nortriptyline for my migraines I stared taking noticed that it was helping me with my IBS. I wasn't having the sharp pains anymore and didn't have to worry about staying near a bathroom. Seeing that Nortriptyline wasn't helping me with my migraines the doctor took me off of the meds. I've been off of it for a month and since then my IBS has been in full effect. So my family doctor put me back on them which I will start tonight. Can't wait for it to get back into my system so it will get it back straight",

I was just learning how to live with them but somedays I just needed to stay in bed. Had a neurologist try one med that knocked me out and switched to a new neurologist that put me on this med. After one week I was a new person. Have been on it for several months with maybe one headache and I think that trigger was lack of food. I am sold on this medication it has been life changing. I did notice there were lots of side effects and was nervous at first but the benefits totally out weigh the dry mouth I get. Trying Biotine mouth was for that. Sleeping well too",

Nortriptyline was a miracle and I am migraine free. I tried going off of it about 4 times, and every time I had headaches and shoulder pain the next day. I am so thankful for Nortriptyline because I can go to work and think clearly without a headache clouding my thoughts.",

It worked well for each attack, but had a lot of side effects. I would get migraine episodes from once a week to 3 or 4 times a week. While employed, I would have to go to the ladies lounge and rest for the period it too to alleviate the pain. Then my blood pressure got out of control, thereby creating another problem. I was having a lot of nausea and vomiting also. After retiring at 50, a new doctor prescribed Amytriptilyne. Recently a new doc took me off it and migraine returned with a vengeance. I'm now taking Nortriptyline and it has worked wonders! No more migraine at all.",

Finally, after hours of this I would pass out, almost coma like. The recovery was long and slow after each attack. I was sent to a neurologist who prescribed Nortriptyline. It was amazing! They did start out with a low dose but it only had marginal effect. They increased it to 75 mg daily and now I only have an atypical migraine every few months. And they are not as severe and recovery is quicker. So thankful for this drug.",

Almost immediately, I had relief from migraines, had clarity of mind even better than ever before, had a great attitude. I felt \"normal\" for the first time in my life. This medication caused noticeable urinary retention, constipation and increased appetite which caused weight gain. Due to weight gain, I was changed to Pristiq. Migraines have returned.

After finally telling my doctor about them, he put me on Nortiptyline, (2) 10mg pills every night, so 20mg total daily. It was like a miracle for me!

During this time I have tried every sort of pain relief available to me, mainly narcotic drugs which I found as bad as the pain itself. Earlier this year I was prescribed Lyrica as far as pain relief goes...fantastic. After a few months (1x 75mg cap per day) I experienced total confusion and was unable to perform my daily tasks at work or at home. I was becoming agitated and experienced suicidal thoughts. Things returned to normal after a week or so of not taking Lyrica. Because it worked so well I am tempted to give it another go. It was just so good to not feel the pain anymore.",

After being on different narcotics that didn't work, I gave up and just lived with the aching in my arm that never stopped. My Doctor put me on Lyrica, and I swear, I started crying because I had NO pain in my arm for the first time since my accident: 5 years. Lyrica has been a God send for me. It helps both my back and my arm. When my Doctor increases the dose, the side effects go away after 2 weeks. I recommend this medicine to anybody with nerve damage.",

Since taking Lyrica for only 3 days at a low dose my pain has subsided enough so I could actually leave my home to go out to dinner.

I tried gabapentin first and did nothing for me and I was a zombie so we switched to Lyrica. I take 300mg a day. It's not perfect ALL the time. Some days I am back in pain. And three days before my period I'm in a lot of pain. It has also helped my anxiety and insomnia. For me, the dizziness went away after a month. And the other side effects are minimal.",

My fibromyalgia got so bad at the end of the year, that I decided to try it again.  I take low doses, 25 mg 2x a day, sometimes a 50 mg. The effect sets in within hours. My fibromyalgia pain is almost completely gone. A late evening dose allows me to sleep longer. I do feel strange when I take it and my intellectual capacity is quite affected, but the lack of distraction by the pain and a better social interaction with increased confidence levels makes up for that. I have to make sure that authorities and decision-making bodies are aware of my reduced competence, and close friends should know of these side effects, so that they can make allowances for any out-of-character behaviour on my part i.e. my inability to repair their car stereo.",

I was started on Pre Gabling two months ago and for me, it was a miracle, I have my life back! I know the Doctors say meds arent the answer for GAD but they are for me, I have had CBT, counselling, hypnotherapy, and nothing worked. But with pre gablin I have been on holiday with no probs, was actually able to relax for the first time in 8 years. I can go into any social scene and be really calm and enjoy it. All I hope is that it lasts and I dont get used to it. All my friends and family have said how well i am and relaxed and happy I appear. And I really am.",

Everything about this drug was far worse than the problems it was supposed to address.  Do not take this toxic garbage. My Dr insisted I had to give it time to work... Any more time and I'd likely be dead or blind! Avoid like the plague and/or carefully read of myriad side effects and hope you can stop in time to avoid permanent problems from side effects. IMO this med s/b taken off the market!",

I've been on it for approximately 8 years before the side effects really started kicking in. Began as morning anxiety attacks, severe GI upset, mood swings and low to mid level depression. Tried changing the schedule from twice a day to three times a day. It helped at first but about two months later my body began anticipating new schedule and the side effects would start kicking in about an hour before next dose. Its taken me 8 months to get dosage down from 225 mg a day to 75mg a day and every step down has been sheer hell. Every step down leads to a period of depression, and it gets worse the closer you get to zero.",

I developed a problem with my kidneys, not from Lyrica, and had to decrease the dose to 300 mg twice a day. I have to say that I get little pain relief from this med but do get a feeling of well-being, or contentment. So, I call it my little happy pill. When I miss a dose, I notice I'm a bit depressed. It's not an antidepressant but it works that way for me. Thank you",

I suffer quite badly from anxiety and agitation and I can't tell you just how much this medication has helped. Even if I could just about get through the daytime without it, when I am asleep and my mind can follow any path it wishes to, it chooses to go down really bad avenues and I wake up feeling absolutely dreadful and this reached a terrible climax 8 years ago and resulted in me not eating at all and therefore losing a frightening amount of weight. However on my last pharmacy visit, I was a generic version of the drug which has not worked at all and so I am hoping my GP will put me back on Lyrica. If not, I am very fearful for the future.",

It did nothing for that or my sciatica. Finally I was bumped up to high dose, but do to other things in life I had to stop because of financial difficulties. I couldn't even afford copays. So I'm on gabapentin and it barely works. If I could, I would get back on Lyrica!                Thank you all for sharing your experiences!",

It relieved the aches and body spasms almost instantly. I could sleep at night, and woke up pain free and was able to live a somewhat normal life. I did however gain 40 lbs. I am now experiencing severe depression, and I feel it is the Lyrica. I ran out once and experienced the worst withdrawal symptoms. I felt like I was dying and the pain was severe. This medicine is wonderful, but getting off of it is very hard. ",

I'm constantly hungry, sleepy, dizzy and I feel like I'm drunk. I worked VERY hard to lose the weight that I gained when I was pregnant and since I've been on this medication, I've put it all back on and then some (40 lbs). It's hard to say if the pain is better or if I'm so caught up with the side effects that I don't care. I'm being weened off of it right now and being put on a different medicine.

I take hydrocodone to deal with the body ache/back pain. I have good days and bad days still, but when the day is good, very little muscle pain. Downside: I have gained a great deal of weight.

I still have good and bad days, but I can bear the bad days because of Lyrica. It gave me my life back. When I first took it, I did have the \"high\" feeling the side effects mention, but it was only my first two doses. Also, I HAVE to take it with food, otherwise I get extremely nauseous and dizzy. I have gained a lot of weight (about 40 lbs), but I also have CFS which has caused me to have a very sedentary lifestyle. overall, Lyrica saved my life.",

I had to start taking a water pills because of the water retention, my memory& cognitive thinking were really effected. On three separate occasions, I was sent home from work because I was so drowsy I kept falling asleep. I was staggering, slurring my speech. My supervisor thought I had been drinking.

Can talk to people can go for hair cut can sit in the same room as people look at there face when talking to me. With out almost passing out.

I did experience a huge emotional roller coaster at first and even had suicidal thoughts for the first time ever. I figured it was just the adjustment period and gave it more time.

My feet went wild, burning pain, could not even have the bed covers on them at night. I got my Rx for Lyrica renewed and when it came I first took 2 caps in order to see if it would get started again. It did! I'm going to be doing a bit of research on the internet for a lower cost alternative. Gabapentin looks good at the moment, maybe on my next doc appt. I'll try it.

After a year of being on the Lyrica it might have gone to a 7 or 8 but it caused me to put on about 40 lbs, my skin changed, and caused a lot of other side effects.

I couldn't walk up/down stairs on that leg, or sleep on either of side without pain and I am a side sleeper so I was miserable.

Currently I'm feeling spaced all the time, gaining weight each day, and kind of depressed, but my psychiatrist said that could be anxiety coming through.

The first 3 days I was only taking one a day and incredibly tired having to take naps on my lunch hour. The extra sleepiness has subsided substantially even while increasing the dose.

I had taken Lyrica in the past for a very short time and it caused weight gain. I kept the medication on hand because it was expensive. After 2 trips back into the ER, the surgeon wanted me to take the Lyrica. His RN said that I will know if it will work in 1 1/2 - 2 days. She was right, thank God! The pain decreased dramatically.

It's frustrating to say the least. Considering the fact that I am also on Xanax, Clonazepam, Hydrocodone, Tramadol, Trazadone and Savella. Some I only take 1 x per day, others 3 x per day and a couple 2x per day. Lyrica was added after Tramadol. I had no side effects from it and it did not interfere with the other medicines that I am on. I was losing weight easily before, but now it is a bit harder. I'm staying on it.",

Unlike SSRI's it gives me no sexual side effects and no feelings of apathy.  It's highly effective for anxiety. I take 300mg daily. At this dose I still have some anxiety but it is greatly reduced.  I have no serious side effects other than an increase in appetite which may lead to weight gain. Dizziness and feelings of being 'high' pass in a week. I highly recommend giving Lyrica a go.

When I stopped taking it I had the worst withdrawal symptoms imaginable (way worse than benzos). I literally felt worse than dying & all I could think of was when the hellish experience would stop . Took about a month to start feeling better & several months to really feel better. Doctors say that Lyrica doesn't have withdrawal (or it should be minor) but that's rubbish. Withdrawal eventually passes",

                    "I've been on 75 mg twice a day for three months which took the edge off my sciatica but did little for lower back pain. A week ago my dosage increased to 150mg twice a day and my back pain is good and sciatica is gone. Additionally my general anxiety is eased. There's no worsening of my depression symptoms (I manage depression/anxiety with efexor). Aside from mild sedation I've had a great result from lyrica so far. Hope it continues working this well! :)",
                    "Although for some reason Lyrica seemed to make my pain medications oxycontin last longer or work better, Lyrica made my legs swell up. The pain was unbearable from the swelling and in the end I had a lot of broken veins. If you're swelling up and your doctor says \"oh, you just ate too much salt this week\" get another opinion to get off Lyrica and see if the swelling doesn't stop. I wish I could take it, it really did help. Good luck to all with Fibromyalgia, it's an awful and painful disease.",
                    "I was prescribed 400mg/day of lyrica for severe peripheral neuropathy of my feet. Prior to Lyrica I was taking 60mg/day of methadone with significant relief but with plenty of room for improvement. With the addition of Lyrica to my Methadone regimen, my relief now stands at approx. 80% analgesia which is a God send considering the severity of my pain. As a welcome side benefit, significant anxiety, hot flushes and insomnia were relieved as well. For me, Lyrica has been something of a miracle drug.",
                    "Seems to help. I take 100 mg, twice a day in a combination with Lortab 10. Have not had any of the listed side effects other than, I tend to anger quicker, nothing that can't be controlled.",

Those medicines worked great, however, they do not hold up as they claim. My doctor put me on Lyrica at 300mg a day and what a difference it has made! My mobility is much better as well as my mental outlook on life. This medicine seems to do the job. I like it and recommend it.",
                    "I was diagnosed with FM 3 years ago. Tried gabapentin, Cymbalta, muscle relaxers and opiates. Doc finally had me gave me lyrica (after I had to try everything else first) ams at first, it worked. I did feel \"high\" but that slowly went away. After approx. 2 weeks of 75mg a day, I had horrible side effects..feeling depressed, like people were talking about me or didnt like me, had no memory or wasn't able to concentrate but what finally got me to stop was I had thoughts of driving my car off of a hill that i drive down daily. I may suffer from pain so intensely that I cry all the time, can't leave my home at times or feel blue because of it, but I had never thought of taking my own life. I stopped immediately despite my docs orders.",

The doctor had said that it was the worse shingles he had seen. After the scabs had gone I was Prescribed lyrica.  I take 300mg at night and 25mg in the morning. It has been 5 weeks since I developed shingles and my face and scalp are still numb. I have intermittent pain shocks. I believe the lyrica is effective as I can't imagine what it would be like if I didn't take it. I'm not sure how long I am suppose to take this but I imagine by other feedbacks that it could be months.",
                    "I had shingles for two and a half weeks, then experienced severe nerve pain after the sores began to heal. My doctor originally prescribed Vicodin, then switched me to Lyrica in anticipation of my return to work. Lyrica was very effective at reducing the severity of the pain, but it caused me to be very drowsy. I slept for 14 hours a night, and had difficulty concentrating during the day. I would also have trouble remembering things I had done while taking Lyrica. I had to discontinue using it.",

I take 150mg twice a day and now the pain is so manageable that I get my life back. If you have really bad nerve pain that makes you feel depressed and debilitated give the medication a go! I have had a few side effects like memory fog but the pain relief is worth it!",

I have suffered on and off for years and a few months ago I was bed/couch ridden and found it impossible to even leave my house. My family has told me I am a completely different person since starting it. I feel alive again. I also used to take Xanax for years for social and general anxiety and I have found that it is helping with that also. Only side effect was feeling high the first two doses but now I just feel like a normal person, which is what I have always wished for. I hope it continues to work and gets better as I up my dose. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who suffers from fibromyalgia. Good luck to all.",

One day I pushed myself too hard at work, and I got to what I call \"final stage\". Half hour after getting a shot of Dilodid in the ER I was still crying and writhing. Doctor came in and sat down looking worried. \"There's probably nothing more you can do for me.\" I said \"No, there's not.\" She sent me home with maximum doses of every painkiller on the planet-nothing got rid of the deep burning aching pain. It hurt to stand, sit, walk, lie down. I laid in bed for days not knowing what to do. I tried Lyrica. That pain has been gone ever since. I got my life back.",

After years of being a long term sufferer I know there are triggers but I've never been able to control the symptoms that over took me even though I've tried to fight it and fight hard.

I also take Neurontin with Lyrica and this combination does a pretty decent job of helping with my pain. I have tried Cymbalta and had a horrible 3 days of dizziness that almost caused me to hit a parked car. I was trying to suck it up and go to work but ended up on the couch the entire time because every time I sat up the world spun and I felt so disoriented and off balance like I had been drinking.

In the hospital they started giving me Lyrical 75mg 3 times per day that just took the edge off. Then I went to the pain Dr it was increased to 150mg 3 times a day and I had such relief to the point I could touch my skin, it has worked so great that when it is time for my next dose I begin to feel the pins and needles severe and the fire on my shoulders and hands. Amazingly it takes away that feeling as long as I take it every 6 hers. The problem I have had is weight gain",

I have just started taking Pregabalin again, one 25mg capsule every three days as an experiment and, touch wood, I think it's helping. It's too early to tell if it will be of any permanent good as I've been borderline with the vision thing a couple of times but fingers crossed.

I notice that at the site of my initial injury (foot), I still have constant pain, but the pain has decreased. I also notice that if I'm stressed the medication seems to not work as well so I don't know if I need the dosage increased, but there is a major difference in how much pain I feel. I do not like the side effects, but which would I rather have - sharp pains or side effects? For me they're headaches, drowsiness, dizziness, fatigue, odd stomach upsets initially after taking the medication, unfocused attention, euphoria, and that \"high\" feeling. I don't get all of these side effects each time I take it but it can be any of them.",

A week after the surgery, the nerve in my left leg and foot \"woke\" up and the pain was severe. My left foot was constantly burning, with feelings of electric shock 24 hours a day. I couldn't wear my shoe and I was very depressed by the pain - I couldn't walk barely without pain. My surgeon put me on Lyrica and within a week, almost all of the burning disappeared. I get a random \"shock\" in my toes, a spasm in my arch and part of my foot is still numb, but I can function again. The pain is manageable and minor. I'm told it will heal but will take months.

Until lyrica I was in bed and couldn't do anything!!I was vomiting every day and had to be hospitalized several times and had lost several pounds. Now I'm back to work full time which i'd never thought i'd be able to do again. Doing more than simple tasks is a joy, and being able to play with my grand kids is more enjoyable than I can say. I do have to say I have to take pain medicines and muscle relaxers and had a pain pump placed inside my stomach, but with everything I'm almost back to normal. The only negative is the weight gain, but i'll take that. My husband said I needed it anyway. But I can't tell you how happy I am with the lyrica.",

I thought something was wrong bc I've never felt this way! It's been 4 months and I take 100mg 3x day. I may have had side effects in the beginning but they've gone away. I have however gained 30 pounds in 4 months. That is NOT normal. So it's come to the point that I'm gaining weight too rapidly to control and I must stop the meds. I'm very sad about this, except I'm not bc the lyrica will not allow me to be sad. So yeah. EXTREME WEIGHT GAIN. But amazing drug.",
                    "Lyrica is about as effective as opiates without the baggage that comes with the latter. Lyrica has it's own side effects for me while working up to 450 mg/day including a floaty spaced out sensation, INSANE appetite, and constipation - these side effects largely disappeared at the 2-week point. Pain relief was fairly quick, at about the third or fourth day.",

I have been on all the opiates and muscle relaxers and anti-anxiety drugs and Neurontin, etc that doctors thought might help. I am very sensitive to medications and the side effects from anti-depressants cause more depression than relief. So, to try another drug was scary for me. I saw a Rheumatologist, and he dx my Arthritis called DISH in my spine. He recommended Lyrica. I finally saw my PCP MD and said let's try this drug. From the 1st pill I had almost total nerve pain relief. I am so amazed! After all these years I feel wonderful. The side effect of being \"Happy\" has been a new feeling",

I then tried 150mg twice a day with limited success and then 300mg twice a day (this had no different). But then I hit on, the idea of taking it, three times, a day, exactly every eight hours (8am, 4pm, 12am) and this completely eliminated my GAD, making me functional, but I have to be very careful to stick to the correct times to take the dose, out by an hour and my GAD returns with vengeance.",

I was prescribed pregablin for Fibromyalgia pain and I can't say I've noticed a difference with pain but its done EVERYTHING for my anxiety! I am way less irritable and moody and feel like I can actually enjoy living a happy and complete life for once without worry, fear or nervousness. I went from being a procrastinating home body to a normal feeling, confident person! My side effects have been blurred vision, sometimes a little sleepy and dizziness. Its 100% worth trying!!",

Greatly reduced the pain, but I felt like I was constantly forgetful & would have brain fogs constantly. Have gained just a little weight, but can't do much with my hip anyway. The one thing that has made my Dr decrease the dose back to one a night very quickly, was I became depressive. Unfortunately, would prefer to deal with the pain & find something else, than feel that way. It is effective for pain relief (I found), but unfortunately I suffered some of the bad side effects.",

I had to leave work early one day and was off for the rest of the week. I also slept for about one whole day.

Doctor gave me some samples of Lyrica for Restless Leg Syndrome and I found that it made me quite sociable, talkative and able to let go some of my inhibitions, but without the sloppiness and horrible side effects as something like alcohol. I've tried Benzos and found they just made me feel dulled out and depressed. Lyrica, used periodically (a few times a month) never fails to brighten my mood and make me feel a bit closer to people. On the downside it also makes me feel closer to food. It's very helpful for me.",

                    "This used in conjunction with Cymbalta is about as good as it gets for nerve pain. In the past I was given Neurontin, Gabapentin, and many others but none were as effective. On the down side I found that the Lyrica in higher doses (150MG - 600MG) left me tired and unable to enjoy my days. I found that I received no greater pain relief taking the larger doses, just more / worse side effects. Even with Lyrica and the Cymbalta some people with extreme pain may still need to use some other type of pain relief in addition to this drug. I take 300MG of Lyrica spread over 4 doses per day and the Cymbalta, and 120MG of OxyContin and up to 40MG Oxycodone for breakthrough pain. In severe cases, a second anti-depressant may be needed in addition to The Cymbalta to help fight the depression that comes with chronic pain. The big down side to both of these name brand medicines is the cost. A months supply of Lyrica with no insurance is over $330 and the Cymbalta will set you back just over $300 each month. Even with insurance these both will end up on the top tier (My co-pay is $50.00 each) and neither of them has a generic equivalent.",

My MD switched me to Lyrica (75 mg), but when I got to 3 per day, I rapidly gained weight - 10 lbs. in 2 wks!  As a med student, I knew the two meds worked in a similar way and were metabolized similarly. I decreased the Lyrica to 1/ day, which stopped the weight gain, but didn't control the nerve pain, so I added back in one 300 mg. Neurontin per day (both at bedtime, to minimize drowsiness) - still not enough pain control. I added another Neurontin, and that was optimal for me. I take it all at bedtime.",

                    "While noticing at the time I was taking lyrica I was itching a lot so I found out that one of the side effects was itching and hives. I spoke to my Dr., and he said he was decreasing my dose. After about 3 days, the itching got worse, so I took my self off, against my doctors wishes. I started noticing red spots and my head, arms and back wouldn't stop itching. I got Benadryl and after 20 days, the itching is still here, but not as much as when I was taking lyrica. If I were you, I'll stay as far away from that drug, as you can.... I'm going back to gabpapentin",
                    "I had an attack of shingles last December. I experienced the typical symptoms: rash, burning pain, itching etc. After the scabs had dried I was put on Lyrica to ease the nerve pain. Have to say that it worked for me. I am a healthy 46 year old male. The side effects were some fuzziness and weight gain. This may have been due to lack of movement and also the Christmas eating but I put on 3 kilos in two weeks which is a lot for me. I am feeling that I would like to come off it so will reduce dosage and see what happens. At first I was nervous about taking this but it has notably reduced the pain to practically nothing.",
                    "Just started about 10 days ago up from 25mg evenings to 50mg after a week which is intended final dose. Much lower doses prescribed in Europe to limit side effects listed in some cases here. Seems to help getting to sleep and sleeping through night, wake early though with less of that anxious feeling in stomach. Take 10mg escitalopram (should be on 20 but want to limit the cocktail). Focus here is to be less dependent on benzos which seem less defective. Feeling quite spaced out and not quite myself being used to high energy and nervous (positively and negatively so) though there is a more general sense of calm which may just be such a distant feeling from the norm I had gotten used to. threads on withdrawal not that encouraging..",

Three hours after the first dose, I was dizzy, nauseous, shaky, and started having trouble with my balance. I decided to try and stick it out since I had heard such great things about the medication. By the 4th day and 4th dose, I couldn't function. I couldn't walk without holding on to something (like the couch or a wall), I was so nauseous I couldn't hold down food, my head wouldn't stop spinning, and I was suicidal! When I finally realized I QUIT THE MEDICINE!",

It has been a miracle drug for me. I have not experienced any of the normal symptoms either. I take 50mg at noon and 50mg at night. It helps me sleep during the night and function during the day. Two thumbs up.",

Tried Neurotin but it knocked me flat, finally switched to Lyrica, but I am so medicine sensitive that can only take 25mg in a.m. and 50 mg. at night. It is helping, however I become groggy and have gained 20 lbs. The weight gain doesn't help the Fibromyalgia, but the pain is unbearable so will take it.",
                    "Discovered I had the Shingles and the Dr. put me on Lyrica. 150 mg twice a day. Felt like I was drunk all day. That feeling decreased after a few days. This was in May, 2013. I had a hard time getting off of the first dose. I would experience shakiness and feeling unwell. I. Am finally getting off the second dose and it is Nov, 2013. Have to take a sleeping pill to sleep as I have severe insomnia without the Lyrica. It did help the nerve pain but hope I never have to take it again.",

                    "I find it amazing for social anxiety and sleep. You need to withdraw slowly though as going cold turkey has extreme withdrawal symptoms, but these last only a week. I'm on 600mg per day which greatly helps with sleep and gives me pleasant dreams instead of nightmares. The only negative side effect is the increased appetite. You need to manage this carefully with low calorie snacks.",
                    "I entered a clinical study for pregablin in the 90s, at that time it was for anxiety and depression. but once i was at the maximin dosage, I noticed I no longer had pain either. I was in denial about fibromyagia at that time. I was lucky to remain on the study even after 90 % of the patients had to get off of it because someone got a catarac. There were people begging to get back on it. I was on it for four years and by the time the clinical trial ended, and i went through a divorce, I had weaned myself off and didnt need it again until several years later when the fibromyagia became increadably painful. it took YEARS to go through the crappy drugs the insurance co. made me go thru with adverse reactions to get back to Lyrica !",
                    "Great medicine that gives a benzodiazepine effect for anxiety, but without the bad side effects such as memory loss or addiction. You cam't stop taking pregabalin cold turkey however because there are some withdrawal effects such as increased anxiety, insomnia, and depression in my experience.",
                    "I have a spine injury L5-S1 area for first 6 months I was on every anti-inflammatory and made me sick. In addition, I was on heavy dose of Tramadol with no effect on pain what so ever and just made me high, then Percocet and it only made me high and very addictive. Then I read about Lyrica, talked to my Doctor got some and stopped my flair-ups. It saved me. Lyrica cut my pain by about 40% and stopped my flair-ups by about 80%. It kind of acts like an anti-depressant for me and makes me a bit hyper-(Good thing) But kills my sex drive and I stopped it for a week, it was hard on me and pain and flair-ups came back. I built a fast resistance to Lyrica fast, I went from 100mg to now 600 mg. Gave me back my hunger and I'm gaining weight-(good thing) You have to realize nothing but hard work and Meds will cut your pain down, nothing will cut your pain 100% I know its depressing, we all just want our Doctor to put their hand on our injury and be healed. You have to try some home to exercise, eat well and seek mental help along with Pain meds and help from you doctor. Chronic pain, you need mental and physical help and most of all its you that has to push yourself to recover.",

                    "For severe chronic insomnia, Pregabalin does increase sleep for sure and I have regained many hours, even if it wasn't on the exact clock I planned. Combined with a good sleep-initiating medicine (i.e. trazodone), pregabalin is an even better lifesaver than alone. Next, pregabalin works quite well for benzodiazepine withdrawals. Lastly, it does work well for depression and anxiety. The downside is that it will dull cognition greatly and can also greatly increase depression at certain doses. For me, the best dose for sleep isn't great for those reasons however lowering the dosage (after a break) has provided better results. Takes experimenting with dosages.",

I have ordered it twice, 300mg of generic tablets each time. I can't put into words how much they have helped me, they have changed my life. I have PTSD, insomnia and a history of drug abuse as I was always using drugs to try and help me feel better not to get high. My problem with pregabalin started about 4 days after starting them, I done tons of research and took two 300mg the first time, too much, yeah I felt great but like I said don't want to be high just well. After the next 3 days on 300mg tolerance builds up fast, what a pity.",
                    "Pregabalin is very effective for generalised anxiety disorder, the way it works for anxiety I found is it kind of stops you from thinking about it much and bothering you so much. However being on it for 9 months now I am now on 600 mg daily 2x a day but I have noticed it's given me emotional bluntness... Could be other drugs mingling with pregabalin aswel but I don't mind, I prefer being emotionally blunt. A good mate of mine died the other day and my emotions would'nt even trigger much, my grandad died 3 days ago I feel a bit upset but I should be is disarray because he was close to me. I'm sure its maybe a side effect. I get free prescriptions for life I think though as epileptic What lyrica does is basically dumb you down.. still reccom",

I am so grateful for this drug I didn't believe I would regain use of my arms. I have not felt any unacceptable side effects just increased appetite. I actually wake up with hunger one or two hours after taking it and it does wrestle with the quetiapine 25mg which I take to help me sleep making it less effective but all acceptable given the great effect",

Search the internet for all the support groups and forums (and active lawsuits) for Lyrica users and read about the absolutely life-crushing hell that so so many users have gone through. This is a truly horrible drug for so many. It has been for me. My advice is this: If your doctor suggests this drug for you, RUN!!

So now after being on maintanence methadone for a year I have started taking lyrica for the past month with really good results.

                    "I will start off by saying it did cause weight gain. My clothes fit the same but the number on the scale went up about 7-10 pounds depending on the day. I cannot say this is solely because the drug- I think I can safely say that this is because my pain has improved so drastically that I have appetite again. I can keep the weight off if I really want to, but I am not overweight and I am content with my appetite finally being back after years of struggles that I don't think it's a problem. Regardless, I have been on lyrica for almost a year now. It has drastically improved my nerve pain, joint stiffness and swelling (along with a gallon of water a day), appetite, energy, and sleep. I am not pain free but no fibromyalgia patient truly ever is pain free but my pain has gone from an average of 8-9 down to a 4-5 on my good days. My flare ups are far less frequent and I only experience them once every two or so months which is a huge improvement over every other week. The length of the flare ups is also shortened from 3-5 days down to 2 days maximum. At the beginning of taking the medicine I was slightly drowsy but nothing dangerous. I only take it once a day and I am trying to keep it that way to avoid moving up to 2 doses a day. Lyrica is my miracle drug and has definitely given me my life back.

                    "After suffering from painful burning feet for ten years ,and due to the pain getting only a few hours sleep per night (if lucky) I started taking Lyrica 75mg twice per day . The very first day my feet started to feel better, but I thought it might be wishful thinking however after taking the second capsule before bed I slept for nine hours straight and woke up to manageable foot pain. My life is back to normal",
                    "I am taking 2 x 300mg per day (plus 20 mg Lexapro, plus 30 mg Mirap). Anxiety is decreased, confidence is increased. I have dizziness, but I am able to drive ok. I have tremors and heart racing. No weight gain or other side effects yet. I feel the medicien helps my brain to be more constructive and ordered. I stopped taking the Lexapro a year ago, but my doctor doesn't know. Tried missing the Lyrica for two days and felt very low, not easy to get off this.",

I served 8 years in the united states military 4 overseas and 4 in the U.S. I left the military 100% disabled diagnosed with Panic disorder with agoraphobia, GAD, Major Depression and of course some PTSD. I have tried everything. I was put on lyrica for nerve damage originally but found it soooo helpful for crippling anxiety. But this does not last long tolerance builds so fast its unreal and it almost feels as if the anxiety gets worst over time. I have tried to stop this cold turkey but found my self in a state of BENZO and OPIATE withdrawal feeling and it was a nightmare. Now I'm weaning! Bye lyrica..OH ya klonopin works wonders ;).",

                    "I have been in pain for years, since my second son was born. After my daughter, I lived with it for 5 years, thinking it was carpal tunnel. Finally the doctor sent me to a specialist after wearing braces from 1 1/2 years. Fibromyalgia is what the diagnosis was, I was not shocked, until she said NO CARPAL TUNNEL AT ALL. She gave me some 50 mg, Lyrica, worked wonderfully. I did not have to lay in bed for an hour or more before getting the children up for school. I got right out of bed and felt pretty good all day. It did make me a bit tired, but the doctor said you have to build your way up on it, but now, the insurance does not pay for it.",

I am still tired but that will come with conditioning my body again. I have intensive physio therapy twice a year and have founf improvements after each session. I have gained about 30lbs but part of that is due to inactivity. Only downside is that if I miss a dose I feel dreadful.",
                    "I was taking 450mg of Lyrica a day and it was a great medicine to help with my fibromyalgia. I took it along with Tramadol. After a few months of taking it I would wake up in the morning feeling as if a train had hit me. I also gained 40lbs on Lyrica. I recently switched to Neurontin and it works great. Also, coming off Lyrica gave me horrible withdrawals for almost 2 weeks. I have been off of it for about 17 days and have lost 8lbs. Lyrica is a great medicine if you don't mind gaining weight.",
                    "I was prescribed Lyrica for nerve pain in my leg and foot and found the \"side effect\" to be a lightening of my depression without the fogginess of other, more conventional medications prescribed for depression. I'm glad to see that it can be used for anxiety. It certainly makes a positive impact on my mood.",

I took the capsules 1 day (2days ago) and after I woke up the next morning, I was completely disorientated, neuasious and vomiting, sleepy, drowsy, forgetful, having uncontrallable shakes in hands and fingers. I thought it will get better soon if I do not take it again. My husband took me to work where I slept the whole time. I had dry nose and mouth, couldnt eat or drink, muscle stiffness drunk feeling, and walking abnormal. I stopped taking it and feeling today better. Could have a shake for breakfast.",

Help came when I was given high dosage of Lyrica in combination with Carbatrol. With time I was able to reduce it to half of the quantity of both medications. For the last 8-9 years I have been taking 900 mg of Lyrica and 600 mg of Tegretol. Before the Lyrica I was disabled, I couldn't talk, eat. open and close my eyes, touch my face, shave, have a haircut, or have my teeth cleaned, the list is too long. Basically noting could touch or move on the right side of my face. When I tried to eat, tears will stream down my face. I am taking Lyrica since February 2002, it saved my life.",
                    "It is difficult to rate this medication. I have all forms of Neuropathy, very painful and Lyrica has been the best so far at eliminating pain, allowing me to overcome the insomnia from the Neuropathy and opiate medication. Even at very small doses. I take 50mg once daily before bed and it works. The problem is the side effects, the worst being that after three days my eyesight is so degraded that I can not drive, I cannot read anything on the television 6 feet away, there is some eye pain and my eyes seem dry and burning. Eye problems can be serious. Wandering eye, crossed eyes and most commonly blurred vision. It also causes peripheral edema in my legs and feet.",

This drug is not side-effect free - but compared to the others out there (Including anti-depressants) it's Definitely the best option. After the initial euphoria wains it stabilizes however, so don't give up after the first effects go.",
                    "I have found Lyrica very helpful. I have fibromyalgia and I also suffer from depression. (I am also a diabetic). I used Lyrica with no expectations of any kind. I was so surprised when for the first time in I don't know how long I could move my head easily and what a reduction in pain. I am so happy I was not afraid to try it.",
                    "I was just diagnosed with fibromyalgia. After taking the first dose my hands and feet swelled up and I couldn't bend my figures. If I tried the pain was intense. Then I stated to stagger. I wobbled when I tried to stand still. My mind fogged up. I felt drunk and hungry. I got a sandwich and it slipped off of my plate to the floor and I picked up and continued to eat, at least a couple of times. Every thing I ate that night tasted so good. I was so sleepy. When I got up in the morning there were things in places that should never of been. (ie: TV remote in the bathroom, food on the floor near my bed and other things misplaced. I felt like I had a hangover. NEVER AGAIN. I had the same experience with Gabapentin. Just say no!",
                    "I take Lyrica primarily for non-diabetic polyneuropathy. The bottoms of my feet felt like they were on fire before. I could not walk. Now, though painful, I take long daily walks. I can only tolerate the lowest dose three times daily, maybe four times if the doctor allowed it. An increased dose made me too drowsy. I find it helpful for fibromyalgia too, but I could only choose one category. I still have too much pain.",
                    "I agree with almost everyone here. I have been on all the narcotics for pain, for arthritis, since 2001. Finally, a wonderful doctor recognised the fibromyalgia aspect of my pain and prescribed Lyrica. What a difference! I sleep all night and can move in the morning. My narcotic usage is lowered along with lower muscle relaxants. At this point, I wouldn't do without my Lyrica.",
                    "I love this medication. I feel calm and rid of anxiety, I currently take 600mg daily and it lasts throughout the day. I would highly recommend this medication, its both calming and stimulating. I have the confidence to go out and hang out with people, I finally feel like I can socialize and relax like a 'normal' person. It's approved for generalized anxiety disorder in Europe. ",

Your body feels active and you can't relax, I find my teeth are clenched or my hand, or my foot. So had enough three weeks ago took to my bed for three days crying, depressed, I take tramadol everyday, venlafaxine for anxiety, none of which take it away. So went to doctors she said give this ...all I can say is at present I have been on it for three weeks I now remember what a good nights sleep is , I can switch the engine off and actually properly relax its wonderful.",

Doc then changed prescription to 50mg twice daily. As a painkiller it is fantastic. I've never known a painkiller like it, however one bad side effect is my swollen feet. I fear that I will have to change to something else if it continues to make my feet swell, because it is extremely uncomfortable. Another side effect is the feeling of being drunk. It does however help me to sleep. I haven't slept this well in years, though I wake up feeling groggy. I could live with all these side effects, if I could overcome the swollen feet.",

With this new trend, by an insensitive Congress, to take away opioids I couldn't imagine being without Lyrica. The only side effect is memory loss, only short term memory. I don't mind. If you suffered my pain you wouldn't either. I've never felt high and taken it for 5 yrs. 75mg x 3 daily. I'm grateful for it. I would suffer so bad w/o it.",

Could not stand the pain in my feet, outer thighs and now along my belt line. I noticed that the weight gain seemed to be from an increased appetite. I have been able to keep the weight off by being very mindful of my hunger, or mindless eating. I am 5'10\" 185lbs. Without Lyrica I don't really get hungry. Mind is bigger than the belly when I order food. With Lyrica I find I could eat a horse, and a cow and maybe a squirl as an after dinner snack ..LOL. It makes me lose what ever normal appetite suppresent that I may have. It does wonders for my nerve pain that started 6 months ago and seems to get worse without Lyrica.",

I have been taking for almost a year now and I have not had any side effects!",
                    "I was prescribed Lyrica (pregabalin) about 6 months ago. I was so shocked by the feelings of unreality it initially caused that I quickly stopped taking it. My fibromyalgia got so bad at the end of the year, that I decided to try it again.  I take low doses, 25 mg 2x a day, sometimes a 50 mg. The effect sets in within hours. My fibromyalgia pain is almost completely gone. A late evening dose allows me to sleep longer. I do feel strange when I take it and my intellectual capacity is quite affected, but the lack of distraction by the pain and a better social interaction with increased confidence levels makes up for that. I have to make sure that authorities and decision-making bodies are aware of my reduced competence.",

I was originally given Nuerotin, which I took, and it bottomed out my blood pressure, I was rushed to the ER unconscious, and kept there until I was okay. Needless to say, I discontinued it, and was given Lyrica....but that made me nervous as well. With my pain over a 10, and the inability to sleep, I decided to try it. I slept well, my pain is decreased some, but isn't gone. I'm only at day 3, and I'm pretty dizzy, sick to my stomach, and sleepy, but that's all so far. I do hope it helps my pain a little more, it's about an 8 now, so we shall see! I'm glad to hear some good stories.",

After 2 months of increasing pain to the point I cried all day my Dr prescribed Lyrica after my suggestion. I think after about the 3rd day my pain had decreased dramatically. On the day I went to the Dr, my pain level was 10 and after 4 days of 75mg in morning and evening I would probably rate my pain level of 2. I hope this continues.",

In fact, she hardly recognized that shingles pain was significant. My PHN kicked in when the rash disappeared. I've still got it. I monitored the internet for PHN meds and when Lyrica came out I notified my new doc immediately. He started me out at 100 mg three times a day and when that was only modestly effective he kicked it up to 150 mg X 3. It works very nicely. However there are side effects. My weight gain has been significant. Brain fog happens. I get double vision on an irregular basis. I feel tired. Now my liver values are increasing.",
                    "My husband suffers from neuropathy and his Dr put him on Lyrica 75mg twice a day. The side effects were horrible, he had to stop taking it immediately. He was dizzy, had headaches, off balance, couldn't judge distance, and it looked to him like the walls and floors were moving.",
                    "My doctor prescribed Lyrica for fibromyalgia. As I am very sensitive to medication, I was prescribed 75 mg at bedtime each night.  The first month, I did feel better taking Lyrica. However, after about 4 months I began experiencing strange symptoms.  I could not remember things. My brain was foggy. I wasn't myself and my pain returned. It was a no brainer, so I informed my doctor that I wanted off of this medication.  I've been off Lyrica now for two months and my brain is back to normal. It was very scary to even think how little I was taking and what an impact it made on me.   I am taking apple cider vinegar with honey every morning, exercising a little day, even if I don't want to, and resting when my body needs it.",
                    "Lyrica was the first medication that helped with the nerve pains. It calmed down some of the burning in my toes, especially. It also gave me some hope in addition to pain relief.",
                    "I was prescribed Lyrica nine months ago and ever since I've been on this drug my quality of life has greatly increased because not only does it greatly relieve me of muscle tension and pain it greatly improves my mood and makes me feel like doing things that I normally wouldn't have the energy for.",

The pain continues to get increase. The lyrica within three days made him completely crazy. Couldn't sleep, very emotional. Started weaning right away. He had side effects all the way to cold and flu like symtoms. This Lyica is horrible, worst medicine he has ever taken and now we're stuck for $100.00",

Not to mention, I had horrific fluid retention! I couldn't wear normal shoes, my hands so swollen I couldn't get my wedding ring on. The swelling lasted for a while even after I discontinued the medication.",

I was told I couldn't use other anxiety meds because I have low blood pressure, but I can use pregablin. It has helped tremendously. I still have panic attacks but instead of many times daily, it's the odd one here and there when something has particularly stressed me out. It doesn't take away the anxiety completely, it's still there and I have really bad days still and it doesn't help depression, but it's much more manageable than before, likewise my OCD isn't as bad either. The only side effect I experience is weird dreams, insomnia and poor memory/memory loss. I recommend!!!",

My doctor figured out that I had Trigeminal Euralgea Facial Nerve Pain. So he started my on Lyrica. We started at 75mg x 2 times a day, and then had to move up to 150mg x 2 times a day. Lyrica really helps to keep the pain away. My chiropractor has said that since taking Lyrica that my back and neck can be manipulated easier than before. I love being able to feel better!",

                    "I started taking pregabalin yesterday - start at a low dose 75mg in morning, then 75mg in the evening. The effect was pretty much instant I swear.  I went from being hypersensitive, worrying, stressing and having all these horrible physical symptoms ( from the anxiety disorder I have been diagnosed with ) to being calm, having a subtle feeling of well being... my acid reflux stopped, my muscles have started to lose their tension, the tension headaches are lifting too. Side effects ? a little sleepy, but nothing too severe. I haven't listened to music for months and been able to enjoy it, but today I AM ! ... amazing ! I feel like a normal person, its like the volume has been turned down on life to a level I can manage :)",

It not only did not help with the pain but only made my condition worse, not to mention the 30 pounds of weight I put on. Also the horrible withdrawal's was worse than I ever could of imagined.

On the flip side, it definitely had a negative effect on my memory. I VERY slowly weaned myself off of it and most of my memory has returned. My insurance only paid a small part of the cost and it is very expensive. I would not use it again. No upside and plenty of downside.",

It made me feel very high the first week and I had to be careful how and when I would take it / 150MGs 3xs a day. The high feeling eventually, gradually dissipated  After a week, I noticed my wife smiling a lot with great caution I asked her why and she said she likes how calm and relaxed I am. I'm naturally a very high strung, intense person. I thought about what she said and noticed I actually was very relaxed and things that typically set me off they just didn't anymore. I then read about how the drug helps with anxiety. My insurance doesn't really cover it...I pay 50 for a months",

Finally had back surgery, which helped the lower back, but not the pain in my hips and legs, which was intense. As usual, had physical therapy, massage, and finally acupuncture. Nothing worked. My doctor finally started me on Lyrica at 50 mg before bed, then 100, and finally at 200 mg before bedtime. It has reduced the pain about 70 percent. It also helps me sleep like a log, and the only side effects are some dizziness in the morning, but by around 10 AM that goes away. Great stuff!",

I have had left hand/arm jerks where my arm just flies up, once throwing iPad mini across the room, another time scatting nuts everywhere while chopping them.

I was a zombie. So now I'm worsening day by day even though I try to stay active have cut all caffeine, etc. because my doctors just don't believe pain medicines help and say there isn't much else they can do for me. Glad for the people it has helped.",
                    "I have Fibromyalgia and developed horrific back/sciatic pain last year. I started taking lyrica about 3 months ago and within a week,I could walk properly. I could sleep, I could exercise and I thought it had fixed everything.  Then my elbow started hurting. I just thought I'd strained it at the gym. The pain became excruciating. Then it hit the other arm until 3 days ago when it got so bad, I couldn't move my arms properly. It felt like my arms were inflamed from my shoulders to my finger tips. I stopped taking it 2 days ago and the arm pain is starting to go. But the back pain is starting to come back. I also have had no idea what day it is for the last 3 weeks which I thought was stress but suspect is the lyrica.",
                    "When I first started Lyrica, my pain almost totally disappeared. After about 3 weeks, my pain started returning. My tongue started to tingle and was sore.",
                    "I was prescribed Pregabalin by my GP for anxiety disorder. I am 27 and have had anxiety since a teenager. I have never tried meds before. I have just gone up to 600mg. I have definitely experienced side effects (blurred vision/dizziness/drowsiness). The side effects do wear off but it does take some perseverance in the beginning to get to grips with it. I felt 'out of it' for a few days. I definitely feel less anxious. It's hard to tell how well it is working but I definitely have the ability to look at 'stressful' and 'anxious' situations with far more clarity. I am a designer and I always worried if taking meds would suppress my creativity but in fact - I think it helps me to have more confidence in my ideas.",
                    "I was diagnosed with adult onset Diabetes last Dec. I started on Metformin 750 and almost immediately my fasting glucose dropped to 94. That is what it has been since but I have been bothered with neuropathy for months. I tried Lyrica for 3 months and it did absolutely nothing for the pain. I am presently taking gabapentin 300 mg at bedtime and it helps slightly. The cost for the Lyrica was money out the window.",
                    "I am glad that Lyrica has helped many, just did nothing for my nerve pain and tons of side effects.",
                    "Just started Lyrica 75mg twice a day yesterday. My first dose, I felt extremely drunk, and could not function. I took my second dose at bedtime, and slept through the night, and woke up refreshed! I had no aches or pain. My 3rd dose, this morning, again feeling a little drunk, and off balance... but again, I feel good. I can actually sit still at work, without having to move around and try to be comfortable. I am going to stick with this medication, and hope that the side effects go away in a couple of days.",
                    "I had been experiencing major depressive disorder and I have an anxiety disorder. I have tried every antidepressant on earth and had suicidal ideation with each one, even after one pill! I have some nerve pain so I tried gabapentin but didn't really get any relief from it so I asked my doctor for some lyrica. The NEXT DAY I felt the depression lift and the anxiety came to a manageable level where I felt I could function well and go out in public. I recently started vaping nicotine and the anxiety is back. I am going to quit and continue to take the lyrica. When I feel really anxious I take 10 mg of valium with it and I am in heavenly bliss. No pain, no worries, just normal albeit a bit sedated but still very functional.",
                    "I had an accident in April 2016. Riding lawnmower fell on top of me in a deep ditch. It knocked me out and caused severe lumbar spinal stenosis , pinched nerves . Up until this year I was in a lot of pain due to the nerves being pinched by my spine. All this time I have seen 3 doctors, really 4, one neurologist, 2 neurosurgeons, internist. No one even suggested Lyrica for my pain...except the neurologist who did the nerve conduction study. He said it worked for restless leg syndrome which I also have. I go some Lyrica and tried it. It has brought me from 10 pain level to a 2 or 3. I get up early now like I used to, I have the will to do things on my property etc. I had lost the desire to even get out of bed, I wish I had tried Lyrica a lot sooner, it gave me my life back.",
                    "I have had FM for about 10 years. For the past 2 years I have been on Duragesic patch for pain. It intensified the fatigue. I started on Lyrica a couple of months ago and am now off of the Duragesic patch. I am getting as good or better pain control with the Lyrica alone as I was with the Duragesic patch and without the added fatigue.",
                    "I couldn't make it without my Lyrica! This medicine has absolutely changed my life. I was hurting all the time and used all my energy just to work. There was no joy in my life until I was prescribed this medicine. Now I work and feel like doing the things I enjoy, like working in my flower garden. I thank God everyday for this medication!",

After many years of being tried on just about every drug out there FINALLY a drug that actually helped me!..I now drive again and sometimes leave the house alone and even on occasion brave the supermarket ALONE..After 3 years on the same dose and with its effect starting to wane I am now on 150mg twice a day..And yes I am very tired, vague and spaced out, but this will wear of with time as my body adjusts..And regarding the weight gain, I have lost 5 stone, and have regained some control.",
                    "I was prescribe Lyrica for a pinched nerve in my elbow after a dislocation. The pain made physical therapy intolerable. With just one dose of 75mg of Lyrica, I could bend my elbow without wincing. Absolutely marvelous. Unfortunately there were 2 side effects that make me stop taking it. First one was that I fell asleep almost immediately after taking it for about 2 hours and my brain felt very foggy after I woke up. Second issue was a slight tightness in the chest and feeling a little out of breath. Not severe, but enough to let me know that I couldn't take it again. Made me sad because it really worked.",
                    "Going to have to decrease dosage (50mg 2x daily) or quit Lyrica due to loss of memory & confusion & jerking. Once could top out any IQ tests but my husband says I can't even find my \"behind\" anymore. Taking it for neuropathy & came home from complete knee surgery with foot drop in leg operated on. Now the other foot has dropped half way so I am all but an invalid. No more going outside for me to enjoy our horses on our farm. The dry mouth I got with Lyrica also frightens me as afraid I will lose my teeth as others have. Lyrica also causes severe sleepiness. I guess it MIGHT have stopped the shooting pains in my feet at night?",
                    "I gained weight.",
                    "My doctor prescribed it for me and gave me samples. I have been taking the samples while fighting with the insurance company because they want me to try Neurontin first. I think the Lyrica is really working. I am still tired, but I feel it is a normal tired from having two kids and running around with them. The way I felt before, I couldn't move. I really don't want to use the Neurontin, I don't want to lose the benefits that I have gained.",
                    "Lyrica works well on my chronic neck pain which I have had for 4 years. But I have gained about 30 pounds so am considering trying Neurontin to see if effects are the same but without the weight gain!",
                    "Lyrica the wonder medicine. After having a nerve crushed in Afghanistan, I had RSD/CRPS in my left leg. Doctors put me on Neurontin which just made me neurotic...and did not help the pain. A month after switching to Lyrica, I was able to lose the crutches, and a few weeks later the prosthetic supporting my leg. After four months, yes I still have a crushed nerve, but pain and hypersensitivity dropped to bearable levels and after six months off all medication but Motrin. Four years later... I have a resurgence of RSD due to a back injury. Lyrica had me back walking in two weeks and has continued to reduce the pain levels.",
                    "I take Lyrica for seizures and Fibromyalgia. The side effects are tremendous and I have had a hard time adjusting. True enough I have had no more seizures however, frequently, I am unable to consentrate or think with any lever of clarity.",
                    "I was on Lyrica for 2 years. At first it was fabulous! But over time I needed to keep increasing the dosage to get the same result. The side effects were bad for me. In the two years I was on it I gained 60 lbs and my hair started falling out. I have since switched to Neurontin with no side effects and my hair is slowly coming back. Lyrica was a miracle for me for about 18 months but as they say all good things must come to an end.",
                    "I would give it a 10, then a 1. At first the medicine worked GREAT but then 30 days later it just quit. After a few months I gave up on it, I occasionally retry the medicine but no luck.",
                    "Taking Lyrica hasn't helped my Fibrmyalgia symptoms at all, and even though I'm on a starter dose of 75 mg once per day the side effects are terrible! I tremble so badly it appears as if I have Parkinson's disease. I can't hand write at all and let alone many other daily functions. It has affected my thinking terribly and makes my mind race and my thoughts are very jumbled which makes me feel extremely anxious, plus when talking my speech is very shaky sounding and very fast and slurry. I also have a lot of trouble urinating. I find it extremely difficult to empty my bladder and at times very painful. I was already taking sleeping tablets ( Temazipan), but Lyrica has made getting to sleep even worse. My chest and nose both feel congested.",
                    "I have been on Lryica for 2 1/2 weeks now. I take 1 x 75mg capsule morning & night. I suffer from back, buttock, leg & feet pain from a 360 degree double spinal fusion of L4-L5 & L5 & S1 done 20 years ago. Nerve pain is now ruining my life. However since being on this medicine my pain is now around a 2-3 out of 10 from being anywhere between 5-9. The only real side effect I am having is feeling \"High\" 24 hrs a day. Supposedly this will go away in time. I also feel uplifted and it has helped with my depression. I do feel a bit aggressive at times too. I have been keeping a close check on my weight too but nothing has changed. My normal weight is 75 kgs and I'm fit & strong as I workout in the gym regularly which helps control back pain.",
                    "I usually have bad migraines that knock me out for a day or two every week. Today I had the aura, the nausea and all my senses started feeling fuzzy like they do when it's coming on. This time, the troubles went away in an hour and I was left with a minimal headache. This is on Lyrica 2x75mg daily, that I actually take for Social Anxiety Disorder/Generalized Anxiety Disorder.",
                    "I have been on pregabalin 75mg three a day for 3 months now. I have fibromyalgia and I haven't noticed any difference. I was on it twice a day so I thought going to a higher dosage would help and that didn't so I am going to try taking vitamin D to see if that helps with the bone pain.",
                    "I take a 75 mg dose, and it really makes a difference, I still have an underlying tenderness in the toes and the pads of my feet, but at least I can walk. I am looking for an alternative for it as the cost to me is excessive.",
                    "I have recently been put on this. I am taking 450mg, 300mg in the morning and 150mg at night. It has also helped with a tight band pressure feeling in my head. I'm fighting the tiredness but so far its helping along with rationalizing my thoughts. Good luck to you all.",
                    "I started using Lyrica six months after it was put on the market and I think it is a miracle drug for those of us who could not sleep or relax in any way due to severe neuropathy. The only side effect I experienced was sleepiness which disappeared after about a week. This is a wonderful, wonderful thing for diabetics with nerve pain. Thank you to the makers!",
                    "Lyrica did not work particularly well for me. I had previously taken Cymbalta 60mg for 7/8 years and was feeling that it was no longer as effective so my doctor prescribed Lyrica. I noticed a large amount of weight gain (which I would not have minded if helped the pain!) about 50 pounds over 6 months before it stabilized. After some time of taking the medication (9 months or a year I forget) I was always complaining to my doctor about pain and fatigue being bad so he switched me to Savella. I noticed a huge difference and I lost the weight!",
                    "Lyrica was great as a pain reliever. It is not a pain killer. The side effects were brutal - weight gain, swelling, water retention yikes. I only stayed on Lyrica a few months. I am now trying Robaxasil.",
                    "My psychiatrist put me on 200 mg capsules 3 x a day (600 mg daily) and it's effective for treating anxiety. I've been on lorazepam, alprazolam, and clonazepam and all 3 became ineffective after 6 months to 1 year and were extremely difficult to get off of. I don't notice any tolerance issues with pregabalin either. I've been on the same dose for about 2 years. Better than any of the benzodiazepines and other medications I've tried for anxiety. Only side effects I've noticed are calmness, sedation, and increased appetite but exercise and healthy eating take care of any weight gain.",
                    "I was prescribed Lyrica for nerve pain as well as tingling/numbness/electricity feeling in my legs. Since I have been taking it (about 6 months now) these symptoms are all but gone. The only side effects I have are short term memory loss and concentration issues but I am able to work around these in most cases. Lyrica has been amazing for me.",

                    "I've been on lryica for a month now. 150 mg 2x a day. It works wonders for the awful muscle spasms and fibromyalgia pain but I do have side effects. I have to do every thing from chores to running errands before I take it. Once I take I become unbalanced, forget words and become extremely tired. I sleep a lot and very heavy and usually can't remember the previous day. I definitely cannot function after I take it. I don't care for the side effects but so far has been the only thing that has worked for me. I tried cymbalta, neurton, zanaflex, flexeral lots of things. To me its worth taking the lryica as those terrible rib and back spasms keep at bay..and after two years of dealing with those I don't ever want to again. btw does kill my appetite.",
                    "Having been diagnosed with depression and GAD I'm now taking 300 mg of Lyrica a day along with an antidepressant. My life has changed. I'ts nothing short of a miracle. I finally see the world again the way it was supposed to be seen and can enjoy the grass under my feet in the park. Honestly these little things make a world of difference and move me like nothing else. I feel connected with the world yet again.",

I lost those yrs of my life sleeping 17 hours a day and the pain was horrible even taking 90mg a day and 30mg of Valium. I went to Wilmington Treatment Center to stop the medicines & so they started me on the Lyrica 450mg per day. It saved my life. Without the Lyrica I was awake for 3 days crying in pain, could not lay in a bed due to the sheets touching me, my core temperature would not come up, I was freezing but everything burned my skin if it touched me. The Lyrica within 2 hours gave me hope and I started turning around for the better. My life is so much better now. My family is glad to have me back!",
                    "I JUST started using this drug 3 days ago. I have been suffering with horrible pain from a herniated disc over the past 2 months. Tried hydrocortisone shots in my back and the pain went away for 3-4 days. I've been on vicodin and skelaxin as well as Aleve twice a day. I've had to take my vicodin every 4 hours instead of every 6 hours because the pain has been so bad. Just in the last 48 hours, I've noticed such a difference with Lyrica. I keep waiting for the pain to be there, but it is NOT. I'm still titrating my way up on the dosage, but in another day or two, my maximum dose will be 50 mg 3 times a day. Currently, I'm taking 50 mg 2 times a day. It really works.",

The things that bothered me before no longer bother me. I am a smoker and since starting Lyrica I no longer crave cigarettes. I have had severe back pain due to arthritis and I no longer have back pain! It does however make me hyper. I can live with that, and it makes me hungry, but this stuff works really well for me.",
                    "Worked wonders at the start. Was up to 600mg a day. I don't eat the best but I do think this did make me gain weight. I live in the great white north but I struggled with balance, fell often, and also had trouble putting my thoughts into words. These side effects are now gone now that I'm off this. Balance and communication much better now that I'm off.",
                    "I recently started taking Lyrica for two herniated discs. The doctor said I have massive nerve damage that will result in surgery but suggested taking this medication temporarily until surgery because my pain was unbearable! At first I was a little off balance but within a week I wasn't constantly in pain....within a month my pain was almost gone and I refuse to do surgery now! Thanks Lyrica for making this happen!",
                    "75mg x2 daily - no noticeable effect. 150mg x2 daily - slight effect of calm, not really therapeutic. 300mg x2 daily - feeling calm, a little sleepy, but I quite like that... it is still early days, but I don't feel the need to take any valium anymore. I stopped it weeks ago. I like being in this calm fluffy state, rather than sweating and thinking 100 miles an hour and stressing out. I am taking this medication for an anxiety disorder, panic attacks and lower limbs pain and walking problems...supposedly they are all linked.",
                    "I have been on Lyrica for the past 8 months, I have fibromyalgia and pain was unbearable. It was amazing at first as I could finally sleep. Over the few months however I have had increased swelling in my joints and gained 15 lbs with no change in eating habits. I started feeling confused with memory loss, then two weeks ago I started feeling suicidal. I did not ever suffer from depression but could not get the thought of just taking a bottle of pills. Due to my experience of working with mental health I knew something was not right so I am now working at reducing Lyrica and going off of it . I think it was amazing for the pain but not worth the risk with the change in my mental state.",

I tried nuerotin years ago but after the second day I could not function, so any one with nerve pain should give this a try. .it sure has helped me",

I started taking Lyrica for some unresolved jaw pain thought to have arisen from my wisdom tooth extraction. It was like a switch had been flipped, the next morning I woke up completely refreshed; a feeling I hadn't experienced in years. I experimented on-and-off to determine whether Lyrica was indeed the reason for this change in energy and mood. Indeed, nights that I took Lyrica (75mg) I was completely refreshed and motivated the next day. This contrasted my normal routine greatly, where I would typically take high doses of vyvanse (75mg-max dose) at 5 am just to wake up. Game changer for depression.",

Over the next 5 months it pretty much stopped working for the pain and the side effects became very worrying. I could not think straight and was dangerously clumbsy. I was is a malaise and did not wish to do anything so I decided to quit. I followed the instructions to taper over at least a week, then the real problems began. This is a horrendous drug to come off, I had to reinstate as I went out of my mind. I am now tapering at 10% as and when I can. I feel so unwell, anxiety has spiralled, depression, suicidal thoughts, insomnia, lack of appetite, sweats, the list could go on it has been a hellish period.",

I was diagnosed with bipolar II, GAD and mixed anxiety and depressive disorder, all I can say week 2 on this medication has saved my life! I'm on 75mg twice a day and can increase if I wish too, but with the way I am feeling at the moment I feel I don't need too. I can leave the house, I'm going back to work next week, and my girls have their mummy back, also suffer from damaged nerves in my lower back, it's helped so much with the pain. It's a miracle",

                    "I started taking lyrica about 4 years ago for fibromyalgia and found it lowered my daily pain by about 60%. While I do not suffer from GAD, I have always had feelings of anxiousness and physical feeling of restless uneasiness, and also restless leg syndrome. It was an unexpected side benefit that the lyrica helped control these feelings. After about a year and a half of taking 150 mg twice a day, I began to worry about addiction, and decided to cut back in an effort to possibly quit altogether. I soon found that my anxiousness and restlessness seemed worse than before, so I went back to my full 300mg per day dose, and have remained at that dosage. While on lyrica, I intentionally lost 35 lbs, and have not gained any weight back for 3 years",

After surgery I was also experiencing new pain of stabbing, electrical sensations in addition to the pain I previously had. I was prescribed Neurontin and the doctor kept raising the dose with no difference in my pain. I heard of similar experiences and being switched to Lyrica and it made a huge difference. I was in so much pain day after day. I switched to Lyrica and I have had nearly full relief of the pain I was having. I can't even describe how much this medication has helped me. If you find yourself in the same experience there is hope. Keep communicating with your surgeon and try Lyrica.",

I don't have the side effects from it that most have, and it works to control the pain, although I do have neuropathy flare ups from time to time. I'm taking it as a result of neuropathy from spinal chord injury. and my insurance pays for it so no out of pocket costs. I recommend this to people who have nerve pain.",
                    "Like many others, my pain doctor had me on gabapentin first, then after several months without relief, switched me to Lyrica. Without a generic version available, it can cost a small fortune depending on your insurance. Without any insurance, 100mg capsules 3X daily, 90 pills will cost upward of $600! With my Part D, and not qualifying for \"Extra Help\" through the state, I'm now paying $140 for a 2 week supply, $280 monthly. That's a car payment! I have no idea what to do once the free samples run out, it's a very good medication but unaffordable. If your doctor tells you gabapentin (Neurontin) works the same, chemically there's no difference, that just isn't true. It may be similar, but Lyrica works much better with significantly less mg's",

This pill made it worse. I took 50 mg at bedtime for about a week. The doctor said it takes a while to get into the system. I'm not waiting that long.

The dose increased again with good effect. I do notice if I am late on a dose or miss a dose, sure pay for it, takes some time for pain to come back under control. I say as I write this at 5 am having not slept a wink. I'm currently on 150 mg twice daily.

After trialling other prevention medication which had bad side effects. Trialed Lyrica 25mg twice a day and after the first week was migraine free for months. after running out, migraines returned. This is very effective, as all other migraine prevention medication has been unsuccessful.",
                    "I was on Lyrica for 8 years at 75mg twice a day. I thought it was doing little for my pain and I didn't want to start increasing it. I had no side effects when taking it. So last year I stopped taking it as I still had a lot of nerve pain. But since I have been off it I realized just how much it actually did for me. I started suffering from crippling anxiety, my pain has gotten progressively worse and my hand tremors have returned. So after 9 months off it I am back on it again as I need a quality of life and Lyrica gives me that. It may not work for everyone but it does for me. I have fibromyalgia and General Anxiety.",
                    "I started taking it for my anxiety when nothing else worked and its change my life in so many ways! my anxiety is gone for the first time in my life, and I'm not sedated or high. I just feel normal. My anxiety got so bad it was causing severe stomach problems, I almost had my gallbladder removed. Not only did it cure my anxiety, my stomach issues are gone, as well as my IBS that was a seperate issue, my restless legs are gone!!! GONE, RLS was torture, it stopped me from going to movies or on planes.. but that's not even the best part! My chronic leg pain which I saw many specialists about when I was young and had since given up on IS GONE! I thought I had to live in pain forever. My life is drastically improved. No words can explain",

The only side effect that MAY have been due to Lyrica is vision loss, but I have worn glasses for 30 years, so no big deal for my eyesight to slightly worsen over 2 yrs on the drug. Some of the side effects that people mention could be due to menopause rather than Lyrica. I gladly spend $60 for a monthly supply. Other meds I took previously left me like a zombie. With lyrica I actually feel good.",

For 6 years, everyday I would have to lay in the tub and the shower hit my back or lay on a heating pad and even at night just to fall asleep I use sleep aids and constant showers or heating pads to get the muscles to stop hurting and spasms and then I couldn't take it anymore. The muscle relaxers wouldn't work and my back and neck were burning and stiff and spasms all day and night and I couldn't sleep and went desperately to a my new doctor that I was seeing and got his associate. He saw me and recognized the fibromyalgia and placed me on Lyrica. I'm a true 26 year old again.",

The nerve damage got so bad, I spoke to my doctor about it and he prescribed Lyrica which took care of all the nerve damage. At first probably the first 2 months only side effect I had was a little swelling of my hands. Lyrica was a wonder miracle for me. The doctor had me on it for over 3 years with no problems, then my insurance refuses to pay for it now, because a 30 day supply is $900.00. They wanted to give me Neurontin, which I am allergic too. Now all the nerve pain is back and worse. I want the Lyrica back and would recommend it to any one.",
                    "I've had problems with my feet burning for several years. Every year it was worse than the year before. It got to the point that I couldn't stand anything on my feet. Lyrica helped a lot, with much less frequency and severity of burning. Finally some relief. Unfortunately, I had to discontinue because of side effects. I had almost all side effects listed in the info sheet. Most I could have tolerated, but the ones I couldn't was weight gain, confusion, and fast progressing blurred vision. Also, I had severe clinical depression over 18 years ago until I received the correct antidepressant. I've had no depression since. However, the Lyrica caused it to return, although not as severe. It also caused anger flareups, very unlike me.",

Discontinued after 60 days and nearly 20lbs. Depression lightened, however the weight has been hard to lose having so much pain from the Fibro. Baclofen has been one medicine that has \"helped\" with minimal side effects. Please come up with something without the side effects!",

Day 2, Pain was gone but I was very sleepy not able to concentrate. Day 3, slept all day could not keep my balance and my dreams was almost real. Day 4, very sleepy and unresponsive, it was so bad that I could not feel my low blood sugar until all my body was shaking and I needed help to take sugar. Day 5, STOP taking the dame thing. Day 6, Pick up the phone, called my doctor and used every word I have learned in English on him and those scientist, who came up with this IDEA. Instead of spending their time and knowledge to fin cure for diabetes, they just look for accommodating, Just to make MONEY.",
                    "About four hours after taking the first dose, I felt years of anxiety just fade away like mist in the morning. The next day I was free of pathological anxiety, and have been the same ever since. So, full marks from me. Yes, there are side effects, but they're nothing compared with anxiety that attaches itself to all aspects of your life.",

I am 25 and took Lyrica for at least 6 years. I experienced severe brain fog, difficulty breathing, cognitive difficulties n others while on this medication. I thought they were all due to my conditions, but after truly reflecting on my journey Lyrica surely hurt me more than it helped me. I have been off of the medication for about 3 weeks now. I did some research and learned that my detox period would be both difficult and long because 1, I took the medication for several years, I took a high dosage andi stopped the medicatiod cold turkey. It's getting easier for sure. The creator on my side!",

I'm really surprised that the Drs didn't tell my about \"Excedrin abuse\" since I told all that I was taking that much. However, when prescribed Lyrica for fibro pain, my headaches were gone to maybe 3 a week. So I highly recommend this for serious headache problems. Does help with Fibro pain. But, weight gain and dry mouth are my biggest side effect and is to the extent that I almost want to go back to 8 Excedrin a day. Hope this helps someone!",

I was put on Lyrica at age 31 to help with the severe pain that I have (and I also have nerve damage in my toes due to an unknown cause- I'm not diabetic). The medicine is astoundingly good for me at combating depression, anxiety, overall body pain & morning stiffness. It takes higher doses of Lyrica to feel pain relief for most people with Fibromyalgia- those who say it doesn't work have often only tried it at <300mg a day. I take 300mg twice a day. The only bad side effect is weight gain- 100lbs. (And I'm naturally overweight to begin with, so this was terrible). It did eventually stop making me gain, but I have to eat less and work out more than everyone else I know, just to maintain my weight, let alone lose.",

I also take 37mg Tramadol IR whenever I have breakthrough pain. This is the minimum I need to function, but it does allow me to work and improves my overall mood.

As the pain decreased I had a better appetite, however my exercise would never be enough to consume those calories. You have to exercise carefully. So now after 4 years I have decided to take control and reduce calories to equal my physical activity. I have a dietician and I AM loosing the weight.

I also managed to severely rupture a few discs in my neck while stretching of all things. Was misdiagnosed by the surgeon who only fixed one of the ruptures with a fusion of C7. Off course this still left me with pain and numbness from my neck down both arms. About a month or so ago I switched to a spine and pain management doctor and he put me on the Lyrica (75mg 3x daily) and a Duragesic patch. These two drugs have worked wonders for my pain and Quality of life. The only side effect is that my short term memory is a little sketchy and my mind doesn't want to shut down.",

I have been using a walker for 8 years. Yesterday I went across the street, came back to my house to get the garden hose, back across the street to water my neighbors plants, and lugged the hose back home. Suddenly I realized, I forgot my walker. I completely forgot it. I wake in the morning, pain free. I am walking now without the walker, it has also improved my mood. I used to cry a lot, because I could not do the \"normal\" things, people my age can do. I am 50 years old, and have been on disability for 8 years. I feel like a new person.",

Eventually I was put on Pregabalin by a Psychiatrist and it was very helpful almost from day one. We increased my dose until I take the maximum of 300mg twice a day. At this dose my anxiety has been pretty much eliminated, I am happy and now an active person. However a word of warning to anybody taking this medicine for a long time: DO NOT allow yourself to suddenly withdraw from it. I recently had to go a week without it and it was a living hell for me. Withdrawal symptoms for me were as follows: severe anxiety and depression, suicidal ideation, inability to sleep, nausea and vomiting",

However, I did not gain weight. Maybe that is because I had read that you could gain weight and I changed my diet so that I would not. In fact, I lost 25 lbs. while on it. I read that I am in the minority with this. I can say for the most part Lyrica helped, but I had to take Advil with it. Overall, it helped.",

I was put on Pregabalin for generalized anxiety disorder and seasonal affective disorder by my Doctor. At first I was put on a very low dose of 75mg, which did next to nothing. I immediately requested to have the dose increased until finally I reached a dose that was effective enough for me (600mg). For a while the medicine did its job and I actually felt like my anxiety had been reversed. I suffer bad social anxiety, and 300mg of this made me quite extroverted and confident. I would say it was 'pro social' for sure. Alas tolerance set in and now even 800mg doesn't do much of anything apart from prevent withdrawals.",

It has not stopped the pain at all, makes me so dizzy I am afraid to drive my car, legs swell like balloons, and have gained over 30 pounds in 3 months. A clinical research was recently done in Australia on lyrica (for Acute and Chronic Sciatica) and the findings stated it had the same effect as the research subjects getting placebos or sugar pills. The makers have racked in 3 billion dollars on it. I told my doc it isn't working but he still prescribes it to me, finding another doc this week. I just got a months supply, 90 pills 3 times a day, 150 mg at a cost of $1,111.19. Biggest drug ripoff in history.",

Nothing helped and I was in tears, I just could not stand the pain and discomfort any longer. My sister was on Lyrica because she had Fibromyalgia and got relief. So the next time I was at the doctors I asked him about taking Lyrica and he thought that it was a good idea. It took awhile but each day that went by more of my pain left me, and now I am pain free from Fibromyalgia. My side effects was gaining weight and that was about it. Any day I would gain 20-30 lbs. to get rid of that terrible pain. Thank you Lyrica.",

I think both are helping right now. I was on a higher dose over 300mg a few years ago and my hands and feet swelled up and I gained 30 pounds I can't get rid of now even with water pills, so I had to stop med. I've had shingles right when I turned 50 before I could get the Shingles vaccine which I recommend to everyone as shingles is painful!

I got my very first dose of Lyrica (just a tiny 25mg) and after it kicked in (4 hours) I've been feeling myself, like I didn't since I was a boy!

I then took a bad fall and pain came back. Fully expecting surgery I returned to Thailand and doctor suggested Neurontin. Although I got some relief, the side effects were intolerable. He then put me on Lyrica. It stopped the pain within 24 hours. He said it would take a few days. I was on it about 45 days and then weaned myself off. I think anyone with spinal stenosis should ask your doctor about this. I think they have just approved it for back pain here in the States. My surgery was in 2005, and went back in 2008. It was a miracle for me.",

I have caught myself dozing off in front of the computer at work, so I force myself to get up and walk around a bit. All in all a small price to pay for the relief of the pain in my feet.",

A small dose of 50 mg each night keeps my symptoms under control. I tried adding a morning dose, but it made me giggle at inappropriate times, so I went back to only taking it at night. For over two years my pain has been controlled well. One night I forgot to take my medicine and the next day I had a painful attack. I'll never forget it again! I'm so thankful for this medicine.

Couldn't tolerate Endep, worked my way back down to 600mg Lyrica and after 6 months the nerve pain is tolerable. What I didn't' realize was all the side effects that I now believe stems from Lyrica, severe bloating, sore eyes, memory loss, word problems, hand and feet pains, plus more. I have now found that it makes little difference between 75 or 300mg for pain relief. I have difficulty sleeping without any, 75 will eventually help but 300 gets me to sleep faster.

It helped a little, but still had substantial back pain requiring Ultracet 3x per day and Lortabs when pain peaked. Have been on Lyrica 75mg 3x per day for past 11 days. Really reduced the pain the first few days, but pain came back a bit. Still, the Lyrica is helping and I've not had to take the Lortabs since starting Lyrica.

GP reduced dose to 75mg three times a day and 1 x 75mg when needed. That is my current dose and the side effects are worth it based on the fact that I've had painful neuropathy in both my feet and lower legs. The breakthrough pain was the main issue I was having trouble with and DID NOT want any more narcotics than I currently take...60mg. MS Contin x 24hours and 2 Statex when required per 24 hours.

On a scale of 1-10 I rate the pain relief a 5 or 6.",
                    "This medication has made a tremendous difference in my life. My pain was due to arthritis and none of the drugs prescribed for this condition worked. After two weeks on Lyrica I feel like a different person and my back is back to normal.",
                    "For pained Multiple Sclerosis sufferers who get no pain relief from the common Carbamazamine treatments, I have found it works perfectly but at high doses. I take 300mg. morning & night to get complete relief. Completely free under Spanish National Health System as it is classified for \"critical\" use in patients.",
                    "I have had fibromyalgia now for more than 20 years and my back pain was getting out of control. I had been taking a low dose of Lyrica (25mg) for some years, along with a cocktail of about 15 other drugs. I did some research, and came up with the fact that Lyrica was licensed for fibromyalgia, and took this to my doctor, who thought it would be an idea to try increasing the dose. After 3 months I am now up to 100mg night and morning, and am getting reasonable pain relief. However, I have severe side effects,the worst one being disturbed sleep every night through foot and leg cramps. I only have to stretch my legs slightly and it starts. Am getting disrupted sleep every night because of it. ",
                    "I really didn't notice much difference after 6 months on Lyrica - still had minor headaches, but apparently swelling went down (MRI). I DID notice the sleepiness at first, followed by insomnia and 30 lbs weight gain in that 6 months and swollen fingers and belly area.",
                    "I didn't even know Lyrica was prescribed as an off lable treatment for anxiety. I was mainly taking it for my fibromyalgia and phantom pain from an amputation. And I didn't realize until now I had full blown GAD and have probably had it since my teens.  I thought it was mostly depression. I journal and I can see that when I have been on Lyrica I didn't reach the extreme kind of depression I've been in. I recently tried to quit again because it causes me to be lethargic and to not be able to lose weight. It may have been some withdrawal symptoms, but within a week I was in grueling depression-anxiety. The DAY I started back on my 75mg/day Lyrica I started feeling better!",
                    "This didn't really change the pain levels but what it did do was make me gain weight substantially. This lead to me getting depressed which made the fibro flare up again. I stopped taking it.",
                    "I was prescribed Lyrica for fibromyalgia. The first hour after I took Lyrica I felt better and at night, I slept like a dream. I was on for a total of two weeks in which time I started feeling bloated and put on weight. I am a heart patient and I started getting angina. My blood pressure started to raise. I started getting headaches. My only wish was that I could have continued taking Lyrica as the fibromyalgia pain was gone. But I'll just have to keep looking. ",
                    "I started taking Lyrica 4 months ago. I am always anxious when taking a new medicine as I am also on Paxil, which is horrible if I do not have a dose within 24 hours. Within an hour I felt 'weird' like I do if i miss a dose of Paxil. That feeling subsided throughout the day. Over the next days I did feel quite vague and forgetful (like I couldn't remember my bank account number, which I use daily). Again I persisted, taking 75mg twice a day, on waking and then at 2pm. I noticed an increase in energy and a decrease in pain. ",
                    "I am diagnosed with a type of \"Meralgia Peresthetica\", a Neuropathic pain in my right leg. I also get pain \"breakthrough\" where pain attacks can reach up to 10 on a pain scale. I started Lyrica last year, and now am on 225Mg twice a day and have the same amount of pain control as the Gabapentin, but at a much lower dose. My wife says that I am much more \"aware\" and \"responsive\" on Lyrica and my short term memory issues are not quite as severe, however still there. My weight gain has ceased, however I am having a tough time trying to lose all the weight I have gained.",
                    "I began reporting my symptoms of peripheral neuropathy to my doctor in the 90's. My stroke in 2002 finally got my doctor's attention that my nerve pain was real. She dropped me as her patient and subsequent doctors ignored my pain complaints. In 2004 I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia but my Neurologist said not to take Lyrica. Fortunately, I recently got a new Primary Care Physician and new Neurologist. Two weeks ago, my new PCP gave my samples of Lyrica. I am amazed at my improved ability to function already. I think of the years of being bedridden at age 36-41. I can't believe that I wasn't prescribed Lyrica, a decade ago. No side effects so far. I still have pain 24/7, but the relief due to Lyrica, is a miracle.",
                    "I was given Lyrica for my fibromyalgia in 2007. No relief, but gained 30 pounds in 3 months and continued gaining until it reached 55 pounds! I've lost less than 10 pounds, hard weight to lose so be aware.",
                    "Tried every ssri and srni out there over the last 10 years together with 3 separate lots of CBT minimum 20 sessions per course. And had very little success. The anti depressants had effects but not desirable ones.At times they replaced some anxieties with others and bad side effects. Sleep, sex drive, confusion. From someone who has experimented with recreational drugs including ecstasy the feeling I had from anti depressants was sometimes similar to a moderate come down from recreational drugs. I pretty much gave up on drugs Then along came pregablin which I hadn't spotted before. It is by far the best thing I've taken I started on 150mg a day now on 225mg won't go higher I don't feel as scared anymore I can do things. Try it.",
                    "I've been taking 600mg for about 2 years due to a spinal cord injury. It is one of the few medicines that seem to help tolerate the daily pain.",
                    "I have full body RSD. Lyrica brings down the burning and helps with the pain especially in my face and upper body. I also have to take Cymblata and tramadol with morphine but like I said I have full body RSD. Only side effect is my vision and I feel like I'm high but the benefits outweigh the side affects",
                    "I am 36, have a bad case of herniated disc that hits me in the back. Lyrica has helped a lot with pain and overcoming my hernia's crisis twice, at 150-300 mg daily. This is not an example of chronic use, although I might be such one case in the future if the problem persists.  In lower doses it seems to take more time (days) to take effect, in higher doses the side-effects are more pronounced.  My side-effects were: slight sedation, euphoria, strange body coordination, all in all: the psychoactivity. One can have an accident on these, so caution should be exercised and doctors instructions followed strictly. Using cars or other potential dangerous machines should probably be avoided too.  ",
                    "This (Lyrica) has been the best option I have tried. It did not make me drowsy and made long days of standing and walking on my bad foot almost unnoticeable.",
                    "I had L3-L4 diskectomy in l988. Since '98 have had steady pain down left side, including hip. Have L5-S1 joined from birth. Finally went to a specialist in physical medicine and am on Lyrica 75mg 2 x day. I can WALK again! Feels like a miracle!",
                    "Had spinal fusion in Jan 2015. I had severe nerve damage due to spinal stenosis. I had terrible burning pain in my entire right leg. Opiates did nothing for it. I have only been on lyrica for a week and I definitely feel somewhat of an improvement . I am hoping it gets even better in the coming weeks.",
                    "I started having intermittent pain about two months ago all over my body. My hands, shoulders, legs, knees, feet... it all hurt. My doctorr tested for inflammatory diseases and autoimmune diseases and nothing showed up. He decided to treat me as if I have fibromyalgia and gave me Lyrica (not sure what dose but supposed to take 2x a day) this little capsule is great. I can move and actually sleep comfortably at night. Only issue is it does make me sleepy so I can only take at night but that's good for me right now.",
                    "I took lyrica for long standing neuropathic pain. I took it before bed and woke up the next day completely in a haze, dizzy , uncoordinated and could not function. It made my symptoms worse. The dose was 150 mg. I am just sharing my experience. Unfortunately it is not helpful for me.",
                    "I was prescribed this capsule when my pain in left thigh muscle became unbearable and I was not able to stand or walk. Either this, or combined first 3 days muscle relaxant made my pain vanish. I was prescribed for 15 days and after 8 days, I forgot to take one night. I felt much better next day (after not taking). As I am getting pain in knee joints, which I did not have earlier, I think, I will gradually stop it.",
                    "I have BiPolar disorder with the main symptom being never ending depression and anger. GAD, PTSD, OCD, severe memory loss and Fibromyalgia. I have been taking 25mg 4x a day for a week and am a new person. What a miracle after taking medicines for 20 years that didn't work. I have my life back. I can remember, think and function again. I still can't believe it. I was sure I had Alzheimers. I now know I don't. I'm 65 and can't believe I may be able to be a normal person after being so mentally ill for more than 20 years. Fibromyalgia is much better. Anxiety almost gone. OCD obsessive thoughts gone.  Haven't been able to drive in 5 years. Hubby takes me everywhere. Hoping to drive again soon. ",
                    "Tried several antimdepressants, lofepramine, duloxetine, prozac,amitriptylene, effexor. All,gave bad side effects, felt like a zombie. Had tom top. Psychiatrist now trying pregabalin but from first dose feel spacey, out of it, drunk. Not sure its for me.",
                    "Lyrica works. Unfortunately, I am on the verge of discontinuing use because of significant side effects. The most troubling for me are the eye disorders (conjunctivitis and blurred vision), and the dementia. I am 53 years old and I have trouble remembering elementary words! It's very embarrassing. I also have a significant taste disorder... many things taste like \"burnt garlic\" to me... that's the best way I can describe it. Finally, I have facial bloating, weight gain, and dizziness. I have been on the maximum dose of Lyrica for chronic pain due to degenerative disc disease in my neck. I was willing to endure the weight and dizziness, but the eye, memory and taste problems are intolerable. Too bad, because Lyrica really helps pain.",
                    "I've been on 75mg, 2x/day for 2 months. Difference is night and day! I have RA, nerve damage form a pretty bad accident, herniated discs and vein's are dying. I'm a mess. Tried everything, but Lyrica has been the one that worked. Not completely, but they may bump up the dosage, I'm told. Trying for 2 more months til I see my GP again. Lucky my insurance pays- otherwise I'd never be able to afford it.",
                    "The best way to describe how well Lyrica works for me is to say, \"I'm young again! I'm a 50 yr old who has suffered with fibromyalgia for many years. Every morning on waking I would just lay in bed dreading the pain and discomfort of something as simple as getting up and out of bed. I was prescribed Cymbalta, Celebrex and Tramadol which help; but nothing works as well as Lyrica. I am able to get more done now without slowing down. Like I said before, I feel years younger. I have read that Lyrica poses an abuse warning, but what I experience isn't really euphoria (High) as one might experience with opiates. I experience relief of pain and maybe \"light on my feet\" and actually stronger muscles %u2014 but not the euphoria of opiates.",
                    "It helped with the pain but every few months the doctor would have to increase the dose for me to have relief. Bad side it caused weight gain.",
                    "This is a miracle medicine. My pain prior to taking this medicine was so bad. I was having a hard time waking up in the mornings cause the pain was just wearing me down. It was harder to function at work too. My imagination started running wild as I started wondering if I was going to end up on social security disability. I've had 2 back surgeries C4-C7, and started to have new pain in the T spine below the 3 level fusion. I started taking Neuronton a few months ago for my pain and it did help some, but after a few months it wasn't helping anymore. My pain was strong and deep. I just didn't have much hope in this medicine but it is AMAZING! I have my life back. It helped with my anxiety also.",
                    "Like most others, I've tried everything possible for fibromyalgia over the past several years. I also have 3 herniated discs and chronic back pain. I tried Lyrica in the past and it did not help. Two years later I tried it again and in fact am still on 300 mg/day in combination with Flexeril 10 mg at night. It helped to take the edge off for about a month then suddenly stopped working. As I am going on a vacation soon, I am not beginning to wean off yet as I will wait until we return. Perhaps increasing the dosage would help? We will see. So far all I had was a month with a little less pain and am having a hard time maintaining my weight. My memory loss and grasping for words has also noticeably increased (and I am young). ",
                    "I was taking only 75mg per day of Lyrica for Fibromyalgia pain. I found it to be very helpful to me and helped me to get much needed rest at night. I took my dosage at night 2 - 3 hours before bed. My only issue with it was there were occasions where I felt a little \"spacy\" but overall, the pain left and I was able to carry out most of my day without significant pain. It was a very low dosage, so a lot of the side effects that some people experience could be from taking a much larger dosage. I am no longer taking it because I lost my insurance and can't afford the cost. However, I was told about Neurontin, will be starting it tomorrow and hoping to get some similar relief.",
                    "I was formally diagnosed with fibromyalgia August 2009. After 8 months of trying other medicines and physical therapy I finally gave in to my Doctor and tried Lyrica. I was nervous because I had used Neurontin in the past with bad side effects and thought Lyrica would be the same. I was wrong. Lyrica does make me sleepy but I take 75 mg at night about 2 hours before bed. My Doctor started me out on the lowest dosage and it has worked miracles for me. I have less pain and my muscles don't seem to spasm or twitch as much, I am able to increase my activity levels which helps with the stiff muscles. It also has helped to calm the nerves in my foot that were irritated in an unrelated injury. This medicine has been a miracle for me.",
                    "When I took Lyrica, I gained 40 lbs myself and my eyes were blurry. Once I got off of the medicine it has been still hard to lose the weight. It did work for my leg pain but the side effects were to much!",
                    "I have found I have an increased urge to eat sweet foods. I have tried to control this by eating fruit. However, this does not stop the craving for sweets. Also I have noticed an increased thirst and less urination. Further I have been able to stop using morphine patches and taking Mersyndol Forte since starting Lyrica. The lessening of pain has enabled me to sleep better",
                    "The nerve pain became so unbearable that it forced me to take lyrica despite the bad reviews and long list of negative side effects. I was told by many that it worked a lot better that neurontin with less drastic negative effects. Well, it has eased my pain some, but the side effects have taken my life from me. I'm dizzy at times, my head is always foggy and not clear thinking, I have depression, anger outbursts I've never had before, daily nausea, and am so tired that I can sleep all day and night long and can barely function. Unfortunately the alternative medications have even worse negative side effects, so what are we supposed to do in order to have some normalcy?",
                    "I call it a miracle drug like most others who have shared their comments. I have been taking it now for 7 months, currently 450mg a day (for treatment of fibromyalgia). I gained about 20 pounds within 2 months which I desperately needed to do. Overall, I have a better life now thanks to Lyrica. Nothing that I have been prescribed in the last 14 years has even came close to treating my condition.",
                    "I've suffered from Fibromyalgia since I was 16 years old (I'm now 24). My doctor put me on pain killers/ muscle relaxers, anti-inflammatories, Cymbalta and the list goes on. I've been told to change my diet. Nothing truly worked. Then I saw the Lyrica commercial. Asked my Doctor about it and he told me he had heard great things about it. I was given a free week trial. The FIRST pill- I could tell a slight difference. It's day 7 for me and I LOVE this pill thus far. ",
                    "It works for the muscle aches and it actually makes me a lot calmer. I don't know if that's just because I feel better so I can relax or if it's the medicine. I was so happy and blessed to find a doctor who listened to what was wrong with me and actually followed through with treatment. Hope that it can help more people and that there are no long term side effects but I am happy with the results and how quickly I felt a difference.",
                    "If you are debating on whether to take this, please don't hesitate. I was in car accident Dec 2012 and have whiplash/cervical strain. Injured my neck and shoulder. I was in pain for the past 9 months and no doctor would prescribe me narcotics due to Ohio law. I was miserable, crying, irritable and nothing I took (IB, Tylenol) wouldn't touch the pain. I got a prescription for Gabapentin, which I am allergic to BAD side effects. Finally the doc gave me Lyrica, within 15 min of taking pain GONE. I feel like I'm back to normal again (like the day before accident). Lyrica is a miracle although pricey. There is a program you can get through Lyrica website to qualify for free prescription. Try it.",
                    "Initially, this medicine was a godsend. Burning pain finally fizzled away. Muscle pains, didn't help as much. Still got numb and weak as well. The real problem came months later when I realized I was having memory problems. Had to wean off it. Memory loss was permanent. Chunks of time just gone. I still think because of the state of pain I was in I would do it over. Maybe the pain made me block out the time. I wish I would have just risked stopping it sooner to see if the nerve had healed. I still take them when I am desparate for relief. But just one maybe two until the zingers stop. Oh ya, nerves were damaged from electricity. Hand to my neck and face.",
                    "Hi. I have been on methotrexate 10 pills once a week and embrel injection 50mg once a week and now added Lyrica 50 mg 2 x a day. Told I have RA, and fibromyalgia. But even with these great meds I feel bad. From my waist to botton of my feet I hurt so. I do see my legs are swelling so very large and skin gets tight it hurts to walk. I dont know what else to do. I work and am on my feet all day. I go up and down the stairs at home I try to get extra walks in going around the blocks. But it hurts too bad. Im very tolerant to pain but this is to the point of no return. I feel bad for my family that maybe I'm a burden. And if I feel this way now how will I feel if I'd ever need some one to help me with everyday chores and hygiene. They may not see",
                    "After a head/neck/spine injury I found the drug to be very helpful with the neuropathic pain in my arm, face and various body parts. Weight gain is a minor issue. I don't suffer night terrors but feel as though I've been dragged through a hedge backwards upon awakening. I do NOT feel rested upon awakening. Cognitive issues due to the injury have been exaggerated after taking Lyrica.",
                    "This medicine was my neuropathic calming wonder medicine until my body over the course of several years had progressed to full body pain. I recommend anyone who has new or has out grown their pain medication to talk to your doctor about this.",
                    "The first time I used Lyrica I experienced an amazingly profound reaction; layers of depression and anxiety that had built up over several years melted away within minutes. That was years ago and I have since both weaned myself off the drug and restarted taking it again. One thing I rarely see mentioned is the terrifyingly bad withdrawal effect- missing more than one dose for me throws me into the absolute darkest pits of despair. Has anyone else experienced this? When I went off the drug the first time I felt like I had performed a miracle; so strong was the feeling that it took a long time for me to convince myself that things were bad enough to warrant going back on. It still helps, but nothing as miraculous as the first time.",
                    "Lyrica is the best medication for generalized anxiety disorder. I am on 75mg twice a day and been able to slowly get off my clonazepam without the benzodiazepine withdrawal. Brain fog will go away after being on it for about a month. Only other side effect is the cost.",
                    "Lyrica 25mg has been my beginning dose and I have been sleeping well, waking up feeling no pain, have no pain during the day, have a good mood and best of all no side effects! My doctor says that if I am comfortable on this dose I can stay at this amount and I don't have to go up if I don't need to!",

                    "I have suffered from panic disorder and GAD for well over 10 years, starting in my early 20s. I finally sought treatment 3 years ago, but nothing helped. CBT, 40mg Citalopram, nothing. I then discovered pregabalin on this website. It was a struggle to get it prescribed on the NHS in the UK, but I'm so glad I persevered. This medicine is nothing short of a miracle. Within 24 hours I was a new person. I've only been taking it a week, but now I feel light and happy, and the anxiety has just faded away. I don't need alcohol any more. In fact, the thought of drinking now makes me feel ill.  If you have GAD - please try this. I'm only on 75mg twice a day as well.",
                    "This gave me incredibly bad nightmares not read other reviews with this problem but main reason I'm coming off it... does help slightly with anxiety but feel a bit too relaxed not good for daytime and work... does 150mg taken at night also causes dizziness and my eyes can't focus extremely groggy in the morning not great for me",
                    "I have been suffering from severe pudendal nerve damage pain and fibromyalgia for over 12 years. Vicodin, Percocet, Duragesic, Oxycontin, injections, you name it. Lyrica 75mg 2-3 x day has made the biggest difference in my life and pain in over 12 years. I can walk without a cane and I feel like doing things. There was some initial weight gain, but that seems to have leveled off. I've been amazed and very pleased.",
                    "I used Hydrocodone and Tramadol for persistent joint and neck/back pain. Didn't appreciate the foggy out of body living experience but it did help the pain. Although with narcotics, I became easily resistant and constant increasing of dosage doesn't seem like the most practical idea for long term pain. Lyrica took about one month to actually show it's benefits, luckily I had gotten free samples for that trial period. After the 1st month I noticed significant relief from my persistent joint pain. I am able to function normally for most of the day without any issues. So happy to have found Lyrica, just wish it wasn't so expensive!",
                    "I have been on lyrica for 1 month, starting at one 75mg twice daily for two weeks, then stayed on 150mg twice daily for two weeks. I had horrible side effect so my doctor told me to split the morning dose that was 150mg in to taking 75mg in the morning and 75mg afternoon, then 150 at nite. So the side effects got better. I suffered from extreme dizziness, increased anxiety, had a feeling my legs couldn't carry me, burning sensation throughout the whole body. After one month of medication, when side effect had gone away a little bit, I talked to my doctor and he told me than since I still suffer from anxiety we should increase the dose to 150/75/150. Side effects are back, I take oxazepam 30 mg to get through the worst side effect and waiting for a better effect on anxiety. However I am better than before.",
                    "My doctor just put me on Lyrica 25 mg tablet twice a day. The first day I took one dose around lunch the other before bedtime and got sleepy in the day. Anyway I emailed doctor he said only take the one at nite but I decided to take both at nite and feel great! I have suffered for years with fibromyalgia and cymbalta was not working for the fibromyalgia but I also take cymbalta for depression so still on that added the Lyrica and feel that the great pain is so much less, my knees and ankle pain, burning sensation all down, and finally get a good sleep without all the leg pain. I am thankful for this drug and finally can get my life back on track and finally see light at the end of my long tunnel of dealing with this horrible condition.",
                    "I have been taking Lyrica for 6 weeks.The first 5 weeks I took 50mg twice daily.Literally at the 5 week mark I had significant improvement.My pain was at a consistent pain level of an 8/9 before starting and now a 5/6.I would like to note I had no side effects at this dose.My doctor increased my dose to 100mg twice daily a week ago and now I have side effects,headaches that last all day,everyday where as before I did have chronic headches that came and went during the day from fibro. Also my fingers and face are very puffy to the point of being uncomfortable.And the worst part is the chronic dry mouth.I have to keep a water bottle on hand to sip on constantly!(Having a chronic dry mouth puts you at a higher risk of cavities.)And weight gain",

I honestly didn't think pregabalin would be effective but I noticed immediately it helping with the pain in my foot where I'm sure there is nerve damage as well as in my arm where I broke it. Later on in the day I set about doing a chore and realized my anxiety was gone. I mean I still had worry but it was managable? Hard to explain. Started off at 300 mg a day and went up to 450 a day then after a few weeks it was like my anxiety worsened.(I have GAD and take Clonazepam) I was going to go off the Pregbalin but I'm down to 100mg in the morning 50mg at dinner and 50 mg at night. Ok so far",

My life was pretty limited as to what I could do, which was pretty much sitting in a chair at the computer or watching tv. My love for the outdoors was pretty much squashed since it requires bending over, which I can't do, due to the rods and screws in my back. I have only taken this medicine for two days, and I have already have noticed a huge difference. I am actually able to move around more. I also have osteoarthritis, and my joints were hurting. Not anymore. This stuff is amazing. The only drawback is the cost. I have to take it three times a day, and it's really expensive.",

Yet nobody knows the source of these symptoms. Due for a muscle biopsy soon. While taking tramadol and hydrocodone had great results for energy and pain, I became dependent. I was prescribed Lyrica 50mg about 2 months ago and felt a little relief. Doctor raised the dosage and now I take 150mg 3 times a day and the results are amazing. I'm alert, energetic, and pain free. Have a little dizziness now and then, but this medicine is great.",
                    "I would just like to say that I know everyone worries about weight gain on this drug so I thought it important to share a positive experience with this drug. I am on 300mg per day and have experienced no side effects and absolutely no weight gain. I am so much calmer and happier, my mood doesn't plummet suddenly, I am not anxious at all anymore and I am sleeping like a log! 10/10 don't let fear of sudden weight gain effect your decision to take this drug, remember that when they test drugs they don't take into consideration the lifestyles of the test subjects, that 1 in 10 person could just eat to much day to day which would result in weight gain and have nothing to do with the drug. Don't worry too much about it!",

Couldn't sleep due to pain took hydrocodone daily which upset my stomach and I became dependant on it every night and morning due to severe pain. My life has changed for the better since I started taking Lyrica. Now able to move with very little pain and my son is so happy to have his mommy back.",

                    "I am naturally an anxious person/born worrier but I saw a dr because panic attacks were waking me in the night and my chest pain was hard to cope with. I explained to the dr that I didn't feel depressed but I worried constantly through the night about things, and would also wake suddenly with chest pain. The dr sent me for ECG but I knew the pain was linked to anxiety. Anyway, after the ECG came back clear, he prescribed Pregabalin (a much lower dose than most people on here) and I only take one at night. I now sleep better, I have not woken with a panic attack since taking them, and my anxiety is no longer controlling me. I've been on them 6 months.",
                    "I have been using Lyrica for about ten weeks. I increased my dose gradually until the majority of my pain is gone. I am now at 150mg at bed and 75 mg in the morning. I have found the side effects to be minimal, the most noticeable is mid afternoon drowsiness and a bit of vertigo. This medicine has also helped calm the need for frequent urination. Who knew?",
                    "I started taking this at 150mg twice a day with some relief of pain, no side effects. I've recently increased to 225mg twice a day, which is the maximum dosage. I'm experiencing vertigo, sleepiness, and weight gain, but virtually no pain. My doctor feels the results out-weigh the side-effects and I agree.",

My feet still sting and burn on and off everyday. One time, I decided to slowly stop taking Pregabalin and take the generic drug, Gabapentin and my feet flared up by a 1000 percent. I asked my doctor if he could prescribe Pregabalin again. I have had zero/none side effects taking Pregabalin but recently I came across reading peoples \"hellish/nightmare\" experiences trying to wean and stop taking this drug. That scares me and I do not want to be dependent on this drug or any drug. I am going to slowly wean myself off and find other ways to deal with my nerve pain. Prayers needed!",

I almost immediately noticed a complete change in my mood, which was anxious, severly depressed and at times suicidal. In time I figured out it was the Lyrica. Even though I still had pain in problematic joints I felt alive and relaxed and hopeful for the first time in what felt like years! My relationship with my husband and my baby (with whom I have had terrible difficulties bonding/guilt/PND. I've started having fun with her, I have finally somehow managed to stop fretting about what I think went wrong/I could've done better and started to enjoy now. The only problem I have with this, and the reason my Rheumatologist won't give more is WEIGHT GAIN.",

Lyrica has been the miracle drug for me and I have been taking it for about 3 years. It takes time for any drug to work properly and I couldn't function with out it. 150mg a day is my dosage. Even though there is weight gain with these kinds of drugs, the effectiveness is worth it. I have a life now.",
                    "I have been on Lyrica for around a year now, I take 300mg twice a day, initially this was a wonder drug that helped immensely with my pain, I couldn't stay awake for first few weeks but since getting used to it I've been fine. The massive downside for me is that it's affects have weaned dramatically and I once again find myself in pain, being a single parent to 4 children and working full time is becoming increasingly difficult and I'm not sure I can continue working.",

Although I still worry and feel anxious, I feel a little calmer. The thing is, on the first night, I felt extremely weird. My head was spacey and I couldn't register what people were saying, and once I realised I couldn't come up with a reply. Today, I woke up and I felt drunk and stoned at the same time but not as severe. I found it hard walk straight, my balance was off. I feel happier but not less anxious? I kind of felt calmer and giddy.",

I have found that this low dose of Lyrica works well with 10mg of Vicodin. My feet are tolerable and I can function without kicking my feet every millisecond and always thinking of the pain in my feet. This combination works very well and I recommend it to all diabetic/dialysis neuropathic pain patients.",

I am trying it for GAD (general anxiety disorder) after trying antidepressants; I tried SSRI's like Paxil and Lexapro and these were horrible failures. The SSRI's made me suicidal BUT Lyrica seems to really be doing the trick! The weight of anxiety is totally gone, and I feel somehow stronger and more self confident, although the feeling is a little manic at times and irregular, like feeling quite drowsy, then quite manic, in a short period of time. But I am assuming that this might stabilize after a few more days. So far I feel like a new person!",
                    "I started Lyrica 30 days ago and take 150mg per day. I have not received any relief in my neuropathy. I have a constant headache and my vision is fuzzy. I am hoping the Lyrica will solve these problems in 60 days or I will have to stop the medicines.",

Decided this year I want to come off them for good. I've tried many times in the past unsuccessfully. I take 150 - 200mg a day - different times depending on how I feel that day. Sleeping better, emotions have come back and I am not an anxious wreck! very helpful and no side effects.  Today I am having a little bit of a rough day with anxiety but I am safe in the knowledge that Pregablin will prevent it from escalating and that I can safely ride the wave until it passes, thanks to this amazing drug",
                    "I took Lyrica for a couple of months. It helped with some of the fibro pain and I felt tired and a little dizzy along with having dry mouth which I expected as common side effects. What surprised me was I got new pains in new places--my big toe felt like it was on fire and my lower back hurt badly. I started weaning off of Lyrica and the new pains went away. I also had insomnia from weaning process. I think it does work to dull the fibro pain but not sure if it's worth it if there are new pains.",
                    "I was prescribed Lyrics for RLS...I also have severe lumbar spinal stenosis. My legs hurt bad due to compressed nerves. Lyrica helped me a lot. It definitely relieved my leg pain. I was also taking Tramadol which I decreased because Lyrica does the job as well and I don't like the tramadol as it makes me sleepy. Lyric does not make me sleepy. I have had no problems with Lyrica and been on it several months . Have gone off it also for several weeks with no problems at all. Maybe it helps some people and others not. For me, it really relieved my nerve pain in my legs.",
                    "This medicine worked pretty well for me. I didn't realize how well it worked until I went off of it before getting pregnant. The thing I didn't like about it though was that it always made me feel like I was in a cloud. My thinking wasn't clear. I would get dizzy. I didn't notice too much of a weight gain, but there was some. In the end, I chose to try a different med (Savella) after my daughter was born and have been happier with that. Still works and fewer side effects.",

I have only been taking it for 3 days and I can already tell a significant difference. My hands and feet have no burning pain and I seem to have less numbness. I have also noticed that it helps tremendously with my anxiety. I was taking Xanax 1mg 3x a day and now I only take it once a day if that. I seem to feel more relaxed and less anxious so maybe this will actually help me stop taking the Xanax which I've tried so many times in the past. So far I am super impressed with this medication.",
                    "I was taking Xanax to calm the muscle spasms and Tylenol 3 for severe pain. This combination worked but I was terrified of addiction. Now taking 75mg Lyrica 3x a day.

AND I've needed a cane to walk for the last 2-3 yrs. FMS & depression compete for the title of \"most debilitating.\" I've tried almst everything, (Cymbalta was useless.) The last 2 months I've been taking slowly increased doses of Lyrica. Currently on 150mg a day, (2x 75mg,) with a view to 300-400mg. I've had zero relief from pain, BUT nasty side fx. Almost no sleep. Worsened depression & anxiety. Terrible FMS type 'fog.' Flatulance! Cannot see this contiuing or improving. (Available on PBS in Australia.)",
                    "I find it sad reading some of these reviews as many of the side-effects people are listing can be helped or eliminated by using Lyrica in combination with other medications. Have your Doctor consult with a psychiatrist - because they know effective drugs to layer with this anticonvulsant - and you can continue to reap the benefits of Lyrica. I know it sure worked for me & life is so worth living now.",
                    "I have been having pain in my wrists, hands and elbows for years due to waiting tables and hefting 100 pound trays on one hand. Lately, I was having more pain in those areas, and my hips have started really hurting me. My doctor and I ran tests, and by process of elimination we feel that I have chronic fatigue, which can contribute to a lot of the allergy/asthma symptoms, the pains and exhaustion. I started taking Lyrica and am up to 100mg 3 x daily. I feel great. Everything but my hip is better.",

Anti depressants, exercise, narcotics, you name it. So I was excited about the dramatic pain reduction from Lyrica. But now I have developed severe muscle weakness, headache, abdominal cramping, blurry vision, bad judgement which causes accidents to my fingers and toes I have recently had difficulty thinking clearly. I can barely hold myself up and I can't lift anything over a few pounds. I have asked my doctor if I can safely stop taking it. She said stop daytime and only take at bedtime. every other night till I ween off. My quality of life has worsened. I have started Chondroiden, MSM powder and ALpha Lipoid",

Tried stopping lycria for 1 day as I gained confidence. Went back on it within 1 day leg and lower back pain unbearable. Sleep much better on it . Would advise anyone to try for chronic pain- side effects much less than Gabapentin by far. Had to stop work lost cognitive ability and brain fog worsened",
                    "I have suffered from progressive neuropathy over the last 5 years to where it finally became intolerable, particularly in my feet and legs, and starting to spread to my arms and even my face. I now have a doctor who has prescribed Lyrica for me for the last 4 months. At a starting dose of 75mgs twice daily there was noticeable relief. Still hurting, however, my dosage was increased to 300 mgs twice daily which has successfully reduced the pain so that I am able to function at a higher level than I have experienced in years with minor side effects, the most annoying of which is sleepiness. I am grateful and relieved to have been introduced to Lyrica and to have insurance that will cover it as it is obscenely expensive.",

I have very bad social anxiety but on that day I was not afraid of anything, I felt any goal that I had always wanted to pursue I suddenly could, and even if I failed, I would deal with it. My only fear that day was that this would be temporary, and sadly, it was. The next day I took it, and I got only the slightest hint of what I had the day before, the tiny effect maybe lasted for the next couple days, then nothing, I kept taking it, thinking it might somehow kick in after time, but then I started to notice I was gaining lots of weight I stopped.",

Was given various prescriptions and decided I did not want to live dependent on pills - the side effects were just too much. Yesterday my doctor encouraged me to try Lyrica. With hesitation I took the first pill last night and woke up feeling like I did 10 years ago! I'm still shocked. I haven't noticed any side effects, but this is definitely worth every penny!",

My main issue has been a lack of deep restorative healing sleep as it exacerbates the fibromyalgia pain and inability to exercise. My Rhematologist has given me Lyrica to try and I have to say so far so good. I have only taken 3 doses and already I am getting a better quality sleep. So much so that my husband has noticed my improved overall state of mind. I am a little cloudy the next day but I am hoping this will ease over time. Worth the cost of a cup of coffee a day if it helps!",

I can not explain this but within an hour of taking lyrica I get the most severe tooth pain, like every tooth suddenly has a hole in it ? I went to my dentist the first time NO HOLES?? My doctor thought it was amusing ? Bizarre. My real problem is the next morning after taking lyrica I have horrendous stomach pain for days, hurts to urinate, poop or fart. Feels like I really have to push to urinate, my doctor said sounds like stomach/intestine inflammation which is on the common side, so I've been taken off it. I will say I sleep like a baby after taking it!",

Gabapentin 800 3x a day. Has done Nothing for me. I am miserable. If you need help paying for it go to there website and they will actually pay for the medication for you.

I was furious with her and plan on changing doctors soon. I called Pfizer and qualified for no charge Lyrica . I received it 4 days ago, 150 mg . I sleep great with it and I also take xanex, trazadone, amitriptyline for sleep, I take it in the morning with my antidepressents and feel ok then I take it around noon and sometimes I feel really flaky.

I started to feel a slight benefit from the drug a few weeks after beginning to take it but it wasn't until I started swimming that my long standing pain completely disappeared. I never missed a dose until a few days ago: just ran out, had to wait til the next day, effectively missing two doses. I went through an incredibly harrowing experience in that time without the drug...it wasn't psychological: I could almost physically feel the chemistry in my brain and body going totally haywire. It was extremely alarming, nothing can describe how nasty it was.",

Wake up in the morning without hurting my back and ribs to breath. My chronic diarrhea is gone too. The only thing I have noticed on the negative side is I am super hungry, which doesn't surprise me.

Until last week, I was under a lot of stress at work, mind you I teach infants and toddlers up to age 3, and I woke up one morning in pain. Pain over my entire body. Pain I have never felt before. I felt like I had a supped up version of the Flu. I went to work in tears and left in tears and headed straight to my doctor. I began Lyrica that day and I was pretty out of it the first night and especially the next day when I took the next dose. I slept most of the first day and the second day I was a little dizzy headed and off balance. So far Lyrica is working well",

I tried many medications so I could have some quality of life with my husband and 2 children. I spent most of my time in bed or on the couch because the pain was so debilitating. I was taking Ultram and Zanex but these just didn't take away the pain and then my doctor started me on Lyrica. I started feeling like a new person because slowly the pain started to decrease. The only side effect which could also be part of Fibromyalgia is with speech. I have trouble sometimes finding the words I want to say. I now take 75 mg 3 times per day and have been taking it for over 10 years. I'm so grateful to have my life back.",

Shingles is the worst pain I have ever experienced and it isn't going away. I tried everything out there from Gabapentin to acupuncture, to percocet, to injections in my back and nothing helped, or it would help for a few weeks, but the pain always managed to come back strong. I was wary of Lyrica because of the side effects, but I finally decided to try it. It has definitely helped me and I can do things like ride my bike again with little pain. However, I have put on 8 lbs in 6 months and I am an extremely active person, so this is tough for me. I also have pain in my joints and sometimes my hands go numb, but less pain.",

My doctor increased me to 150mg twice a day and for the first time in months, I was able to sleep through the night. I feel like a new person. It's a wonder drug. For once I am not walking around like a zombie due to pain and lack of sleep. I have gained a couple of pounds but I can live with that.",

It does nothing for the pain or fatigue from Fibromyalgia or Chronic Fatigue/M.E. Until people realize that legitimate users of meds such as Hydrocodone, morphine ER, etc are rarely abused by people in genuine chronic pain, doctors will continue to jeopardize patients lives by giving them meds like this as a placebo with nasty side effects. One doctor also put me on Paxil which gave me Serotonin Syndrome and I was in Intensive care for a week! This was when SSRI's first came out and I went into med journals.

I am 5'6\" 125 and went up to 150lbs. 125 pounds is a high weight for me so 150 is too much for my frame. ",
                    "I was prescribed Neurontin for anxiety and panic, but it made me a zombie. I am now taking Lyrica and it is amazing! No more anxiety or panic and my mood is greatly improved. Neurontin was like whiskey hit hard and had \"hangover\", Lyrica is like a fine wine, subtle and mellow and doesn't have the zombie effect. DON'T DRINK ALCOHOL WITH IT this was only a reference. I am taking 75mg at night and 50 in the morning. I also don't need the antidepressants anymore.",
                    "I have been on Lyrica for Fybro for 7 weeks now and I sleep great - I can play with my grandchildren and I don't hurt enough to even complain about - I am off the narcotics - was 2-3x's a day with oxy and overall I am more productive at work and I move more and am much happier. Still tired because I move so much",
                    "I have had neuropathic spine pain since 1984. I have triple S curve; had 6 spine surgeries, and have implanted pain relief system for low back pain. Nothing worked, opioids almost led to death. 2 months ago begam Lyrica (100mg, 3x/day). At beginning: brain felt \"foggy\"; walking unstable; total urinary incontinence (some bowel incontinence). To say I was shocked at how the Lyrica relieved my spine pain is an undersatement! I read all the horror stories, but decided to give it time. This is the first time since the early eighties I have had NO pain! The side effects are gone.",
                    "I take 75 mg at bedtime. I started Lyrica in 2015 when I had shingles. I noticed that I wasn't having crippling anxiety. I was able to stop Klonopin. I went back on Klonopin when we moved out of state. I also started Ambien 5mg. For sleep issues. I thought I could stop Lyrica. That was a big mistake. Last night I didn't take the Lyrica and I am so anxiety ridden and feel physically sick. I will definitely take the Lyrica tonight.",
                    "I was taking 50mg Lyrica every 2 hrs or sooner each day; while it did seem like I had more energy and could work a little longer before resting, the pain never stopped or lightened up. Lyrica  amitriptyline did help me sleep better. I quit taking Lyrica and started taking gabapentin 300mg 3Xper day and the pain lessened a lot, and sleep is better and some of the brain fog is gone. ",
                    "I have been on a wide variety of medicines for anxiety over the last 8 years, recently my Dr put me on Gabapentin because I suffer from extreme sensitivity especially when sitting (burning sensations), I tolerated this quite well at 1800 mg but still had anxiety, My Dr changed me over to Pregabalin four days ago, I have had a pressure headache on and off in the left side of my head and quite severe bloating, however the Anxiety seems more under control, has anyone else had these types of side effects and if so do the pass with time.",
                    "I found this to be very effective in treating the after effects of double fusion of cervical vertebrae. Then I found I was having less difficulty with fibromyalgia. I was on 3 a day and only side effect was weight gain.",
                    "So far so good. I have been on Lyrica for about two weeks. I sleep better and pain is a bit less during the day. ",
                    "Due to a toxic neuropathy which causes an excess of electrical conduction through my peripherical nervous system and results in neuralgic pain specially in my legs, arms, hands, feet, torso & face I have been taken 450mg a Day. It worked for a couple of years but now my body tolerance has reduced its pain killing efect. Don't want to increase dosage and my neurologist seems at a loss as what to prescribe.",
                    "Diagnosed with fibromyalgia 6 years ago, I've tried many antidepressants and pain killers. I have been in withdrawal of Tramal and replacing it with Lyrica. I see it as my salvation when compared to some of the medications I have taken over the years. YES, withdrawal from any form of medication is horrific and with uncertainty and discomfort. I personally am prepared to go through this horrible time to give Lyrica it's chance to work and improve my life, as I have seen an improvement already. Thanks to those who worked so hard to make this medicine for those of us who need it, know that your work is appreciated.",
                    "Have had fms for 8yrs. Have tried all sorts of meds & have been on fentanyl 75mcg every 48 hrs for the last few years. Fentanyl for fms is like a heavy bat for the wrong ball but was the only bat available.  I have been taking Lyrica for 1 1/2 yrs now. Had 1st pain free days in years when 1st started. Unfortantely, still on fentanyl in addition because I cannot take more then 50mg a day of lyrica w/o it knocking me out. Tried to build tolerance over 3 wks w/o success. Have had wild vision changes also.",
                    "My Anxiety had crippled me to a state which my life could no longer function. The first few days on Lyrica I noted a sense of euphoria and confusion but by the 4th day I found myself able to think about trigger points for my anxiety and was almost in awe of how it didn't raise its head. It seemed like anxiety had left my body, to the point where I had to look in a mirror and say \"why did you care about all that so much?\" Almost in disbelief of my previous behaviour, not being able to connect with those feelings or attitudes became freeing. lyrica gave me my life back it seems. Importantly, I'm still me. Friends and family all commented how much better I am without losing personality which i believe is one of the best qualities of the drug.",
                    "On my first day taking Lyrica, it was incredible - I was patient, calm, and chilled out. I could deal with stress better than I have been able to in my entire life. However, I quickly grew a tolerance, and I spent weeks chasing that feeling by upping my dose. When I finally reached 250mg, I was an absolute zombie. I was taking much longer to finish my sentences and I felt like I was constantly in a fog. My depression has reached an all-time high and my anxiety is still present - I'm just not having panic attacks any more. The past few months have been particularly bad and I just don't think it's worth being on any more. I think I'm especially disappointed now because it started out so well and I'm significantly worse off now.",
                    "It makes the pain go away and I can finally sleep at night. I'm so glad they have this medicine. The only side effect that I have had is the weight gain, which is 25 pounds so far and I have only been on it a month. At first I had some dizziness and minor hand and face swelling but that has gone away. If they could only improve so it wouldn't make you gain weight it would be a perfect medicine.",
                    "in april/may of 2011 i my right foot kept falling asleep over a 3 day period & i had a tingling sensation creep across my groin after 3 days of my right foot falling asleep & the tingling sensation creeping across my waist i was numb from the waist down for 2 weeks since then my feet fell asleep & NEVER woke up i finally got on lyrica & and it has help some with the tingling sensations but it has me feeling oh so stoned thankfully i get my lyrica through the county health department and it doesnt cost me",
                    "I have taken just one 75mg yesterday afternoon. It did not take long at all and I noticed a difference in my pain. I felt good. When I went to bed, I drifted off to sleep and woke up this morning feeling refreshed. It was a wonderful experience.",
                    "Awful drug , mess you mind up. Pain or sanity you choose",
                    "I've been taking this medicine for four days and feel a little off balance still, but the jittery insides are gone and so is almost every pain I had! I feel so good, better mood and everything.",
                    "Only took one prescribed dose with real bad reaction. Ended up in hospital with dangerously slow heart rate. Unable to talk, walk or stand, it felt like I had a stroke. Severe joint pain and urinary retention developed within 24 hours and I found it incredibly difficult to remain conscious. Hospital staff did not recognise the symptoms as an adverse effect of the medication, even though I handed them the advisory notes from the medication, and treated me as though I was just having an anxiety attack or attention seeking. It wasn't until I was discharged and read up on the medication that I was able to confirm that all the symptoms I had were listed as side effects. needless to say I did not take any more.",
                    "Works for anxiety but omg I am eating like food is going to run out",
                    "This seems to work for me, at least the nerve pain in my legs, it controls the racing, shooting pains but does not help the muscle pain or spasms at all. at least when I take it i can sit down without shaking or moving my legs. Every little bit helps.",
                    "Not doing much for shingles pain.",
                    "Lyrica is a miracle drug. I was taking 12 to 16 ibuprofen a day and was still in constant pain. Now I only take a few occasionally for breakthrough pain. I take 150 mg of Lyrica in the morning and 300mg at bedtime. My sleep is better. I still have difficulty moving around in the morning, but within an hour of taking my morning dosage the majority of my pain, etc is gone.",
                    "I have been on Lyrica almost 2 1/2 years. When I first started it I was really skinny so weight gain didn't bother me but now I have gained over 25 lbs which is not good at all. I am going to go back to Gabapentin which helped me get off morphine. My eyes are dry and blurry. I fart all the time and I am fat! I was off of it the beginning of the year and I was hurting but side affects are too much.",
                    "I was experiencing nerve pain from hernia and knee operations, being a single parent and running a business a while back had me run off my feet and feeling nerve pain running up the bottom of my feet and through my knee joints into the groin, Lyrica has so far taken most of that pain away. What I didn't realise was it also helps with anxiety and depression, after 3 weeks I noticed a calmness I thought I could never achieve, did some googling on the benefits of Lyrica last night and was amazed at everyone's experience on Lyrica. This is great stuff, would recommend it highly, thank you Lyrica, back to fun time with the kids again.",
                    "Side effects like extreme fatigue and shortness of breath limited my dosage which limited the drug's effectiveness at pain relief.",
                    "With the recent changes to pain medication guidelines I was reduced from opiates and given Lyrica to try. RUN, don't walk away from this medicine. My memory got fuzzy, I stumbled and fell in injurying my back, it keeps new synapsis from forming in your brain (I.e. brain damage long term), I have rashes, etc. Most importantly, I started having thoughts of death. All of this on 50mg at bed time.  In a few years I'm sure TV lawyers will be soliciting patients for lawsuits. This is a strong chemical to introduce into a already weak person's system.",
                    "I have suffered a very long time to the point where my bones ached so bad that it brought me to a complete halt in life. My mother also suffers as well as my daughter who is showing many of the symptoms that I had at her age. I have been on Lyrica for ten days now and can not believe the difference it has made. I hope that this med can improve other's lives as well as it has mine, because FM is a horrible thing to have to live with. No side effects so far. Here is hoping it is for you..",
                    "My doctor prescribed this for me when I was dealing with pain from a fractured sternum. After dealing with the pain for over a year we tried this. Fantastic results. Required only 3 weeks of treatment and the pain resolved.",
                    "I was prescibed pregabalin for leg pain associated with Spinal Stenosis. The first prescribed was 225 mg daily. Side effects extreme tiredness and swollen ankles. When I tried to stop this drug I experienced severe anxiety and feelings of gloom. Went back on see and say the pain clinic who advised tapering 25mgs every 2 weeks. I am down to 50mgs am and pm. The withdrawal is one of the hardest things I have been through and cannot wait until this drug is totally out of my system. Lesson learnt to research prescribed drugs, their side effects and withdrawal before blindly accepting them.",
                    "I rated Lyrica as \"one\" because IF your prescription plan does not pay for it, it is worth nothing to you UNLESS you are prepared to pay about $350.00 a month out of your own pocket. It's effectiveness for a few of my problems was very good, but since I cannot afford it, it's effectiveness is actually ZERO to me now.  Don't take the free sample that will be offered to you (unless you can afford it later). Stopping Lyrica will be the one of the most miserable things you have ever tried in your life! It is a horrible withdrawal. the company is just like a street dealer of drugs. BOTH give you \"free samples\" to get you dependent on the drug and they charge big money for you to continue taking it.",
                    "Initial euphoric effects wore off so dosage was increased. Was told would treat nerve pain and later told good for anxiety. My anxiety got worse on med as when it was due or late I was ill, it has addictive qualities I do not like. My health took a nose dive on this and I had to come off due to blurred vision, weight gain, blocked bowel. My Doctor advised decreasing of 75mg a week. My first drop was hell completely threw me into panic as I felt so ill, no one explained withdrawal when I saw medics in a state no one comforted me saying it could be the reduction too high/quick for me, after all in hindsight if I felt unwell late taking one dose then dropping 75mg wouldn't be helpful quickly, lower doses not easy to get as more costly to NHS etc",
                    "I'm really waiting for the other shoe to drop with this medicine, because for me it has thus far been thoroughly life saving. I had been in pain every minute of every day, with some days being completely overwhelmed by the pain. Now I feel like I can live again. I just noticed that increased suicide risk was a potential side effect of Lyrica, which might concern me as I've suffered from major depressive disorder for >25 years. But being on this medicine has raised my mood a great deal because I don't have chronic pain to deal with on top of my baseline mood disorder. It is so wonderful. I'm waiting to hear that it causes something dreadful - because isn't that usually the case when something works so well.",
                    "I went from 800 mg of Neurontin a day, with its zombie-like side effects, to 100 mg of Lyrica with no side effects and more effective that Neurontin.",
                    "Didn't do much for my anxiety. I'm taking 150mg two times a day. Can't really feel much difference. I do feel a little bit more \"spacey\" though.",
                    "Diagnosed with fibromyalgia 19 yrs ago, no pain medicines until 5 yrs ago. Electro-acupuncture is great, but hard to find/afford. Heating pads aren't therapeutic, I sleep on 4 ice packs (I know, eeww, but whatever works). They help with inflammation, try them. Lyrica gave me agonizing, shooting pains from deep within shoulder and hip joints down humerus and femur. And unwelcome 35 lb weight gain. And blurry vision that meant I couldn't drive. Lyrica was useless for me, so glad you all have something to fight this fibromyalgia.",
                    "I did not feel it was helping all that well with the pain.[ lower, middle back and rib]  I went from 25 mg to 75, 150 then 225mg.  I found I was tired and lethargic. I had a dry mouth and throat constantly, and my vision was hard to focus, jumpy. I had stopped and restarted after 4 months, still the same. Breathing is harder, so I've noticed this time.   I have stopped for good!",
                    "I have been taking Lyrica for 3 months. I started at 50mg x 3. Increased to 150 x 3 times a day a month later. I have had almost no pain since starting. The side effects have been extreme dizziness, edema in the feet, weight gain (about 15lbs). At my last appointment the Doctor adjusted the dose to 50mg x 4 times a day. The dizziness comes and goes. This is a great medicine for me. I can handle dizziness at this level.",
                    "My doctor prescribed Lyrica for my anxiety, and it has been a God-send. Dump Trazodone. I feel like normal people are supposed to feel - with basically no side effects. In addition, I have Herpes, and since taking Lyrica have had no Herpes break-outs. This drug is incredible.",
                    "Finally, a medicine prescribed by my psychiatrist that is non narcotic and actually works. Due to a severe auto accident fifteen years ago, I am now 40 yrs old, and having suffered a closed head injury, fractured pelvis, 4 fractured ribs and tailbone fracture. I have suffered with chronic pain mostly my adult like. I have undergone nearly every pain management regime one can think of: Epid nerve blocks, rhizotomy, physical therapies and of course every narcotic medicine that was available. Yet within just a few months, and after all these years, Doctor and I have finally found a medication regimen that truly works! Lyrica 75 2x a day and MS 60mg 2x daily. And since starting Lyrica, my acute pain episodes are less frequent.",
                    "I was given this medication for pain after suffering from two herniated disks. The medication worked great, but I did not know how good until my doctor took me off of it and my pain returned to its debilitated state.",
                    "I find it helpful for sleep 150 mg with seroquel and Xanax. Sometimes it makes me dreamy or spacey not unpleasant but maybe for its reputation as a street drug in larger doses I have never tried. I don't have much anxiety so have nothing to add.",
                    "I was already overweight and went on Lyrica because of the tingling in my hands and feet being intolerable. Three weeks later, its like I woke up one morning and none of my clothes fit. I got on the scale and from the time my doctor gave me this pill to current and have gained over 25 lbs. It's a shame I have to decide between being obese or able to sleep and be pain free.",
                    "Brilliant, like an anti depressant but I don't get nervous anymore",
                    "I suffered severe sciatica for two years before my doctor prescribed Lyrica. After a few days of building up in my system, the medication completely killed all of the pain, numbness, and tingling in my right leg. It was so effective, I thought I was suddenly cured! I stopped taking the Lyrica and the symptoms returned after a couple of days. I have now been taking Lyrica for two years and swear it is the best solution available for my bulging disk problem.",
                    "VERY MIXED RESULTS. Had a severe attack of shingles on the face and scalp (3 weeks in most of the hair on one side of my head was literally gone). I refused morphine (in hindsight, I should have taken it) but I did take Percocet which helped the internal pain but not the nerve pain in the skin. For that they gave me Neurontin, but I could not tolerate it due to extreme drowsiness, loss of appetite, loss of concentration and dry mouth (before I could chew food it was too dry to swallow it). Tried Lyrica 75mg 3 times daily. First dose seemed to really work but effect declined significantly so that the fifth dose had no effect. During the fourth week he increased to 100mg 3 times daily. Second dose helped then effects declined.",
                    "I have had chronic pain from Spinal Stenosis for over 25 years. Neck shoulders and lower back. I was on Lyrica 150 mg twice a day a couple years ago & truthfully can not remember why I stopped taking it. Since the \"war on pain meds\" My Dr. ask me to try it again. I took for 2 weeks then I started getting blurred vision, confusion, memory loss, & I would be standing in a store and twice the husband had to catch me because I was just falling over. I felt sick inside, instead of my quality of life improving it went down hill. I will never take this so called med again. I will live with the 10 to 15 pain level somehow if I have to spend the rest of my life just sitting still or in the bed. I also got to the point I was severely depressed. Do NOT take this drug.",
                    "Apart from putting on weight - Lyrica has been great. I sleep (a miracle in itself) and have felt no pain.",
                    "Started using LYRICA about 6 months ago. It seems to have minimized the toe/foot pain I have when I go to bed. This was keeping me awake with pain and restless legs. Now I can get to sleep easier. Did notice some weight gain... but am working on it. No other side effects noted at this time. Sure has helped me at night!",
                    "Lyrica has saved my life, just wish I'd have started taking it sooner and it would have saved my marriage. My pain is completely controlled and I am no longer taking anti-depressants. I didn't realize it helped with GAD, but it does. I actually feel human again and interact with others. It does have some side effects, can't concentrate and a drunk feeling but compared to the pain I was enduring, these side effects are worth it to me.",
                    "600 mg of lyrica works wonders for me. Its a very good drug and completely takes away the pain. Without this drug I would go insane I've gone days with so much pain that I thought of committing suicide. Really awful feeling because I have always enjoyed life and I'm only 38. Nerve pain is by far the most painful pain I have ever had. To all of you who suffer out there, there will always be a medicine that can help you. Don't give up there is a way this horrible condition. I hope everyone find relief",
                    "Started taking Lyrica yesterday for severe diabetic neuropathy in both feet and lower legs. I am currently on Suboxone for a 15 year addiction to opiates and was concerned that Lyrica wouldn't work because my body is so screwed up from all the years of opiate use and most medications do not work well for me. Thirty minutes after the first dose I noticed a significant improvement in the neuropathic pain. My bedtime dose was another 75 milligram capsule and I slept better than I have slept in months! This medicine has been a God send for me so far. Hoping that it continues to work well for me! Thanks Pfizer!",
                    "I'm a 41 year old male and I suffer from diabetic Neuropathy in my feet. It's steadily gotten worse over the last 2 years and wasn't even diagnosed properly until 3 months ago. I've been taking Lyrica started with 75mg twice a day which didn't much of anything. I'm now taking 150mg twice a day, it's somewhat effective but not quite there yet not sure if dosage will have to be increased or I'll have to try something else? I haven't had a lot of the side effects others have mentioned except for memory loss. I've noticed that my short term memory hasn't been the best of late but other than that not really many side effects for me.",
                    "I was just diagnosed with fibromyalgia earlier this year. My old doctor prescribed me Cymbalta and it didn't work. I was off from work for 2 months because of the pain. All I did was layed in bed suffering. Seemed like I would never have my normal life back. I went to another doctor and he prescribed me Lyrica it lessened the pain within a day or two. Now I have some of my life back. I still have a little pain but Lyrica has helped me and changed my life.",
                    "I am 37 with multiple illnesses, fibromyalgia, diabetes, arthritis, and schizophrenia being the tip 4. My Doctor put me on 300 mg of Lyrica 3 times a day. Initially, it stopped my severe symptoms of fibromyalgia, initially. I began to have sleeplessness, which became 3 hrs of sleep every other night. My legs from knee down began to tingle, then it felt like worms crawling in them. I had fuzzy vision, and then 60 voices came out in my head, very loud and clear. My Doctor refused to stop lyrica, I stopped taking it and within a month the side effects disappeared.",
                    "Side effects are worse than Fibromyalgia pain. I've been taking Lyrica for two months. It was a miracle drug for the first few weeks. I've been living with Fibromyalgia for over 35 years and have tried eveything. Anti depressants, excersise, bio-feedback, acupuncture, narcotics, you name it. So I was excited about the dramatic pain reduction from Lyrica.But now I have developed severe muscle weakness, headache, abdominal cramping, acne and difficulty thinking clearly. I can barely hold myself up and I can't lift anything over a few pounds. I have asked my doctor if I can safely stop taking it. I'm just waiting g for him to return my call. I would rather just live with my horrible pain than take any more of these toxic drugs.",
                    "I started with 75 mg of Pregabalin which was raised to 100 mg at bedtime. While it helped me in reducing neck pain and I had substantial reduction in anxiety, it started giving me huge side effects. I started having throat pain, sinusitis, vivid dream early morning and some feeling of dizziness. I also added 5 kg of weight in 2 months. I am now tapering it off gradually. While I would say it worked for my main symptoms, unfortunately it gave me too much side effects.",

After reading reviews I decided to try these tabs I have only taken them for 2 nights ( 1 x 75mg cap) supposed to take 2 daily but I feel I cant wake up in mornings and have to force myself to get out of bed, for a couple hours after i still feel groggy and light headed throughout the day. I dont know whether to perservere with them, I have to say slight improvement with being able to walk with a little less pain. I live in Scotland so my prescription is free for this drug.",

                    "Have been rock bottom down by the river, then re-started Pregabalin. IT IS AMAZING. It only took about 24 hours to notice the difference, and wow. A week later and I am nearly 100%. I knew I was anxious not depressed! It should be prescribed as a first-line choice. Previously on it for 3 yrs. I am a 59yr old housewife.",
                    "I first started taking this for trapped nerve causing cramps in my hand. I started off 25mg 3 times a day for first week. The first thing I felt was calm all my worries went away second week upped to 100mg 3 times a day feel like a lotto winner walking and talking like a new man. No prob with sex its all still working! Slight foggy brain but got my old job back cramps in hand gone all looking well, booking to go away with the wife soon xx",
                    "I couldn't remember the last time I had a \"good\" day since diagnosed having Fibromyalgia until 2010, when I was first told about Lyrica by an emergency doctor. The symptoms & pain had got so bad that I drove myself to a Baylor emergency room. Physically and mentally I just felt defeated. I was so stressed out that I developed an ulcer and my potassium/magnesium levels were so low they admitted me several times for as long as a week on time. Bags of blood had to be given and IV fluids. Ugh..I was a hot mess. I don't recall the doctor that introduced me to Lyrica, cause I was in and out a few times, but all I can say is a BIG thank-you. I've been on Lyrica 300mg a day since 2010. I can get what I need done and function like a normal woman.",
                    "I used this for my last herniated disk issue. I had a sequestered herniated L5 L4 issue and suffered from nerve pain down my left leg and drop foot. Pain Medications (e.g. 10mg Percocet 3-4 times daily) did nothing for my leg pain though helped my back. Lyrica at 150mg twice daily did the trick for my leg nerve pain. The sciatica makes your leg kill while you know nothings wrong with it, so with Lyrica I was amazed to have the leg pain just disappear. No side effects. Sciatica went away by itself after 3 months so no need for Lyrica anymore.",

                    "I had put off taking Lyrica because I was afraid of the side effects. Eventually my nerve pain got to the point where I had no choice. It was completely debilitating. Searing burning pain with no relief. Pain meds didn't touch it. I couldn't sleep because the pain was that bad. My clothes hurt. Soft feather light brushes against my skin stung and BURNED for minutes after contact (more intensely than the consistent present burning). After about three weeks on Lyrica I finally found relief from the worst of it. What I am left with as far as the burning goes is completely tolerable (of course it does nothing for my other symptoms). I'm grateful I caved but am concerned about weight gain & significant cravings for sweets.",

I had to quit my job and have barely been able to keep up with school. I took Lyrica for the first time last night. It caused some upset stomach and a weird buzz, but this morning I woke up feeling like a different person. I am still sore from my muscles being weak and tight all the time, but today is the first day I could feel that I was still sick from a headcold. The pain and discomfort had drowned out any other discomfort. I am hopeful for the first time in months.",

Doctor added Lyrica 75mg 2x day three months ago and the day after I felt euphoric. I felt no pain! After one week some pain came back but no peaks as before. Some weight gain. Want to get off of Oxy and try Lyrica or other non-narcotic drugs.",

Many days could just not make myself move or interact. I had great tired feeling and feeling of pain running thru all parts of my body. Oct 2014 I was lucky. Went to another neuro, prescribed 25mg bid lyrica. In 2 weeks I was myself and have not looked back. Befote this I was an avid runner, pilates, overall exerciser. This came fromnowhere.

Started Lyrica 7 months ago, now at 75mg x 2, twice daily.  Reduced oxycodone from 80mg daily to 40mg daily, tramadol for breakthrough. Hope to increase Lyrica and further reduce oxy. Still do PT for flares. PT is needling with electricity, like acupuncture with electricity running thru needles. It is amazing. No side effects, no weight gain but possibly weight moved to stomach area, no problem. 5ft 3in, 125 lbs Lyrica is no miracle but finally found combo of therapy, meds (Lyrica inc) for some quality of life.",

After taking 50 mg a day, I had no difference, then up to 75mg a day, I still had pain in my wrists (most likely because I work on a computer). But MIRACULOUSLY!, I noticed that along with 'Some' pain, my social anxiety is all but GONE! It's not even the reason I started taking it! As for my wrist pain, we've bumped up the mg to 175 per day and it's only been two days, I'm very groggy in the morning. I didn't get that on the 75mg, but I am confident it will subside. I feel like a new person because the easing of the social anxiety was a total surprise! I would recommend this medicine to ANYONE with pain/social anxiety.",
                    "The first time I used Lyrica I experienced an amazingly profound reaction; layers of depression and anxiety that had built up over several years melted away within minutes. That was years ago and I have since both weaned myself off the drug and restarted taking it again. One thing I rarely see mentioned is the terrifyingly bad withdrawal effect- missing more than one dose for me throws me into the absolute darkest pits of despair. Has anyone else experienced this? When I went off the drug the first time I felt like I had performed a miracle; so strong was the feeling that it took a long time for me to convince myself that things were bad enough to warrant going back on. It still helps, but nothing as miraculous as the first time.",

I have high hopes that this doesn't wear off and I can continue to feel so good. I feel like a miracle, really has helped my all over body pain that I live with for years.",

Because of drug issues in my state, I tapered off of Fentanyl in Feb. I don't think that Lyrica was around before I started the patch. Since the burning pain came back, I was put on Lyrica. It certainly helped and I can live somewhat pain free. Now the doctor has refused to give me a script for Lyrica because he is afraid of repercussions from authorities. I will have to find another doctor. I am dependent on anything that will take this pain away and I hope I can find a doctor who will give me Lyrica again. It is not giving me a good reputation to be constantly changing doctors.",

But has a lot of side effects. Cons-Feeling like a zombie, shakes, sick at my stomach, itching and blurry eyes, drowsiness. Pros-My pain is almost all gone, happy mood, and can move free with barely any pain. And I feel like I'm on cloud nine and can't wait to go to sleep. Overall, the Lyrica has really helped me a lot. I have tried the generic gabapentin and Savella. They do not work! I'm so happy that I found this website, for all the people whom have aches and pains as well as I. Thank you.",

I put on over 10 lbs in weight when I first started taking it, but with correct food choices , I lost what I had put on and more. I did at first have an increased balance problem. I now take 200mgs of Lyrica 3 times a day because I have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, I take metformin 500mg twice a day and I've got neuropathy pain. I have no side effects with Lyrica now.The other pain meds I am on is a 500mg Fentanyl patch and Arcoxia and Quinine for leg cramps. I live in the UK and get my pain medication free .",

I am very active in trying to keep the fibromyalgia pain as controlled as possible and just not been able to get to a plateau of any type. After a rough adjustment period of about 5 wks I noticed a drastic change in fibro pain. I have gained a significant amount of weight but over the last three months have been able to maintain. Now I am able to start losing the weight but have to be very careful to not take in complex carbohydrates or sugars in afternoon or evening. I have gone to an almost vegetarian style diet and have noticed that the weight just starts to come off with ease but slowly. My balance and vision are the only consistent side effects that I have.",

I also have had to raise the dose to 150mg 3 x daily. It really helped with the insomnia that I had suffered with for 10 years.

I researched ways to counteract the negative effects, and started taking a B6 supplement (for weight gain) and an herbal diuretic (for the bloat). I no longer feel bloated, and the headaches are gone. I'm on my 4th (or 5th?) week of lyrica, and am feeling much better. I don't think I'm still gaining weight, but it's too soon to tell. I wasn't eating any more or less than usual, so if the B6 helps, that would be nice.",

I had been taking 2mg valium everyday for 4 years and was able to taper VERY quickly because of lyrica. Pregabalin helps as a precursor to anxiety; it stops it before it can start, hence the 'PRE'-gabalin. It works on the gaba receptors which are responsible for anxiety. I take 150mg every 8 hours like another reviewer talked about, as I discovered that this was the golden ticket for keeping anxiety away. In Europe, the suggested dose for anxiety is between 400mg-MAX 600mg.",

It began each morning with a small 'knot' in my stomach and then spread during the day causing tightness if chest, throat and often tension down my arms. It was stupid because there seemed to be no trigger, I just felt tension and worry all day. I was placed on a number of drugs, nothing worked. Busiprone helped but I remained anxious for no valid reason. About 18 months ago my doctor gave me Lyrica to try. Within a couple of days everything returned to normal I was even a bit euphoric but that subsided in a week or so. I started out taking Lyrica 50mg twice a day along with 20mg Busiprone twice a day.

Now we are working our way up to doing the same thing for the second dose in the morning. I must admit I am glad she is doing it this way. The first weekend after I started taking it was the first weekend I actually wanted to do something, like move when I did not have to. I've adjusted slowly to the drowsiness and confusion to where it is not nearly as bad as when I first started taking it. There has been weight gain but I am slowly getting to the point of wanting to get back into that gym. Thank you Lyrica.",

I weened down and stopped taking it a week ago and have already lost 10 lbs and the edema in my legs is gone.

I have found that as my anxiety is worry,overthinking and my mind constantly racing. It has slowed down my rate of thinking and worrying, whilst I am aware they are there I find I am able to process them easier and thoughts become less irrational. Coupled with some CBT therapy I find this medication highly effective. The only thing to be wary of is on higher doses (I'm on 75mg) they can have a drunk feeling effect and so I asked my Dr to prescribe me with a lower dosage for daytime (incase of driving or working etc) so I take 25mg in the day and the 75mg at night and find this works for me.",

It does permanent brain aging , you will be confused and have terrible memory the rest of your life and this problem becomes very clear to you when you quit.

It also must be taken with a calcium supplement. I had been taking the D2 for several years, and then they wanted me to take Prolia as my bone loss was getting worse. Stopping the D2, and starting the D3 at 5,000 iu a day with 600 mg of calcium has helped quite a bit. I would suggest anyone try this before taking something like Prolia, or Forteo for bone loss. If you have osteoporosis, you need the supplements either way. Wife took Forteo everyday for 26 months, and less than 4 years later they now want her to try Prolia too.Check wikipedia for info on this."

This NSAID works great. My migraine was gone within an hour, and instead of being bedridden with ice packs on my head, I was actually able to eat and return to my normal activity. It is a God send!",

Nothing else works as good .I have had severe sinusitis since I was 8 yrs old .I am now 62 and it is still working for me. I take the 50 mg. capsule and it works for at least a day or more.",

It also helped my brother and 2 sisters with migraines. In my view it is much like ibuprofen except slightly stronger and much more effective.",

Had an asthma attack when they gave me the generic oruvail as generics only have half the main ingredient and some awful fillers. Available on our pbs in Australia",
                    "I have used this for 30 yrs off and on. I first started using for my migraines back when I was 30 years old. Then I realized it worked good for menstrual cramps. Then as I got older I used it for my osteoarthritis. Now that I am 60 years old. It helps me for everything! My arthritis, my knee, my fibromyalgia. I have used other non steroid anti- inflammatory medications but they just do not seem to work as good as Ketoprophen! I can count to the minute how long it takes for it to work! This is a life saver medication for me!",

I bumped into a friend whom I told of my pain being due to gout. He immediately told me his issues with gout far worst than I have. but he put his praise on this (Ketoprofen(Ketonal) medicine prescribe for him in Kosovo, that made him fell better by just the first tab 100mg (he is over 50 year though). I went and got a prescription and took the first tab of 100mg from him at 19:00 (I am 48yrs), it is a miracle, next morning I wanted to challenge Usain Bolt for 100meter race :) I am following the prescribe dosage now from.

Sadly for the last two years I have terrible pain and I have extreme difficulty walking, climbing stairs or even sitting down on the loo or as it is called in America- trying to sit on the toilet seat. Two days ago I went to see a Doctor here in Italy and she prescribed this drug- 200 mg once a day. I took it yesterday for the first time and woke up the next day feeling like my old self- ready to rule the world! I went to the Park with my 12 month old puppy and I enjoyed playing with him and I had no problem at all walking up the 3 flights of stairs to our home. This drug is a great.",
                    "I have taken this product for headaches, backaches and toothaches and having tried Motrin, Extra Strength Tylenol, and Aleve for these issues in the past I would give Orudis KT the highest rating of the OTC pain medications.",
                    "During a very serious bout of gout, I was unable to put pressure on my foot. My doctor recommended ketroprofen and assured me I would be able to walk without crutches the next day. He prescribed 75mg 3X a day. True enough, I was able to go to work the next day and within a week the gout had cleared up. I now take a pill as soon as I feel a flare up of gout and within a day or two it is gone and I have not had a serious bout.  I just found out that the 75mg capsules are no longer available, only the 200mg and I am unable to refill my final 30 on a prescription I got last August. I only take them when needed and was hoping get this last refill to cover me until 2016."

I have found it the most effective pain relief for the sinus migraines and I have tried everything - hot compresses, inhaling steam, saline sprays, nasal sprays, antihistamines, decongestants, panadeine, ibuprofen, codeine. It is not clearing up the source of the problem but does provide some relief.",
                    "I\"ve had the tubes in my ear previously and didn't want to go through that experience again. I wish my doctor would have just prescribed this medicine instead of a nasal spray. I've had a clogged ear for almost a year now, on and off. I bought some Sudafed over the counter. Outside of having to give my ID, I had no issues. I took it and a few hours later, my ear has cleared up! Thank you very much for the helpful advice.",
                    "The only noticeable effect was that it made me extremely sleepy. Did not work in the slightest.",

(although she SHOULD have known - she is a doctor, after all.) After taking sudafed, I had a major anxiety attack and my blood pressure shot through the roof. It took HOURS for it to wear off. Apparently, there is a warning on the box that people with thyroid disease shouldn't take sudafed. Sudafed causes the effects of synthroid to increase dramatically and synthroid does the same thing to the Sudafed. If you take synthroid AVOID sudafed!! I threw the box away and will never take it again. I blame my Doc for not knowing this stuff is dangerous to thyroid patients.",

                    "Yes. Pseudoephedrine will make it easier to breathe, but if you don't read the fine print, you'll also find out that it makes it harder to pee, makes you jittery, and can make you restless. So, if you need to take it for a day or two - you should. But not for any longer.",

I took two doses every four hours of two tablets each and the congestion has finally cleared but I didn't realize that it would make for a sleepless jittery night and now a jittery morning with no appetite and mild nausea. Next time I would start with one tablet and see if that helps and make sure I had plenty of time before going to sleep.",

I have tried endless OTC drugs, like Mucinex, Advil Sinus, vapor rub and even nasal sprays. None of those have helped on top of home remedies. I tried Sudafed for the first time about two years ago and with just one dose I feel like myself again! I have experienced some drowsiness with the medication, but I could still function and do my daily task.",
                    "I had a terrible experience with this medicine and I do not recommend at all. Instead of helping you to decongest, it just makes you more congested. It stops the phlegm from being coughed up which it would make you feel worst. The minute I stopped taking the medicine I started be able get rid of the phlegm. Same as the majority of medicines over the counter, they are just a temporary help - but on them long they make more damage to you.",
                    "This is the only decongestant that works for congestion in the ears. Also, I have found it better than all others for nasal and sinus. The ones they have attempted to replace it with do not work nearly as well.",
                    "My doctor says this medicine is not for ear pressure, but it sure helps me. I battle allergies all year long, but eliminating gluten has helped tremendously. I now take 1/4 tablet in the morning and again in the afternoon if needed. I NEVER take the full tablet. If my symptoms are really bad, I take 1/2 tablet more frequently, rather than a full tablet as directed. It can cause a racing heart and insomnia, so decrease dosage and only take what you need to take the edge off of your symptoms. Trust your body (often times more than your doctor).",
                    "When I had a really bad ear and sinus infection I went to go see the best ear and head doctor. He told me to take Sudafed so I did and it was like magic. It helped so much, 15 mins, I was clear so its worth the try if you have any sinus problems try Sudafed. It works!",
                    "I had sinus surgery about 5 years ago, but with my allergies I still have to take this occasionally. I can take it before I go to bed and sleep all night. I can take it in the morning and stay awake all day. Plus I can finally breathe!!",
                    "I work in unhealthy, dusty, bacteria, allergen laden environments. When I feel my sinuses congesting, Sudafed or generic pseudoephedrine will clear it.

Sore throat, cough, runny and stopped up nose, horrible dry mouth, extra crusting around the eyes, just overall feeling crappy but not bedridden. The levels of crappyness that I felt got better and worse randomly. Every time I thought I was going to get well, the sickness came back the next day with full force. I finally went to the campus nurse. She told me I probably had two seperate viral infections and told me to get pseudefed and ibuprofen. I did this and I am feeling completely fine! It's been one day and I've taken two doses so far. I will say I could not sleep for more than three hours last night and I'm tweaking out a little bit. But otherwise 10/10 would recommend.",

I use Elocon after I realize I'm scratching uncontrollably and within a couple of days, the scratching ends and the swelling subsides. My eczema flares and bleeds on the same day so when I apply Elocon for the first day it burns for a few seconds as I'm rubbing it into my wounds. The following day, my rashes have healed and never look as painful as the first day. *Only use 14 days on and 14 days off if you need it like I do!",

                    "I've had hayfever for over a decade now and every summer I have suffered very badly with it, I had tried everything from pharmacy to natural remedies which weren't helping and every year my summers would be ruined due to being ill with it constantly but I recently got given nasonex by my doctor and within 2 days I had no hayfever symptoms and haven't now for over 3 weeks since I've had it although the pollen count has been high throughout, very grateful for this product.",
                    "I went to the doctor because of a serious flu that affected my breathing because of post nasal drips, extreme coughing and fearsome blockage of my throat while coughing. Among two other medicines including general cough medicine, he prescribed Nasonex. This has helped tremendously. It has cleared my nasal passages and it has allowed me to breath properly. It has stopped my heavy snoring which was caused by having to breath through my mouth. I do not know whether I am imagining it, but for years I have had erectile disfunction, so much so that I have given up trying anything to cure it and just accept my condition. However, lately I am getting reasonable erections at night and I wounder if it is some beneficial side effect of Nasonex.",
                    "I have used Elocon for several years for frequent contact dermatitis on my hands, between my fingers and under rings, behind my knees, and for poison ivy or sumac. It relieves itching and redness very quickly and you only need a very small amount - apply sparingly. Episodes are over in about three days in my experience. I keep in in the house at all times when flare-ups occur.",
                    "Has never once worked in opening my sinuses during a cold or flu... Pretty much useless as far as I can tell.",
                    "I was allergic to it. Developed upper respiratory infection, cough, conjuctivitis, and the final straw was waking up one night with my throat almost swollen shut. The allergist said I had a reaction to it and to stop taking it.",
                    "Helps me breath I love it.",
                    "I have been using the Elocon lotion everytime when eczema was there, it cured. Just speechless and I'm thankful I got the Elocon lotion for the first time when I suffered eczema since I have tried everything out there and done a lot of researches, but it seems Elocon did the job impressively well. Got my life back. Ps. #1 cure Elocon",
                    "I've had psoriasis for 4 years now, Since I was about 14. Nothing ever worked for me. The doctors could never figure out what it was. It got so bad at one point my face was infected. Finally I discovered Topicort. A steroid based ointment that showed dramatic results. I mean I could use it right out the shower and I would be spot free for months. A few tips on how to control psoriasis, use fragrance free lotion, powder foundation, almost natural body mists/ perfumes, laundry soap and softer sheets/liquid without harsh smells-those can lead to serious breakouts. Try changing your bath soap to body wash that is gentle and SOAP FREE. Aveeno and Neutrogena are the best products for me. Good luck.",
                    "I have Allergic Rhinitis since I was a kid unfortunately I was told that there is no cure for this allergy it will be with me for the rest of my life - doctors have always treated my so called sinus issue with Flu medication and sinus medication to be honest it worked for a hour max and I am back where I started. A doctor prescribed Kestine and Nasonex almost 15 years ago I used it for the first two days and every time when we the seasons change. To-date I still use the same products and I don't regret using it since - honestly the best medication available for people who have Allergic Rhinitis. ",
                    "Nasonex worked great for what it was intended. My nasal passages opened up during the worst allergy season on record, and I didn't want to scratch my face off. I had to stop using it though because it was causing tension headaches and eye weirdness. I even stopped and started again to make sure it was the Nasonex, and it was. Oh well. It's worth trying if your insurance covers it, otherwise it's $200+...",
                    "This is the best product I've ever used for allergies. For a long time, I've suffered terribly with hay fever, which antihistimines controlled but it was the constant itchy face, nose and neck that made life miserable for me and I couldn't find anything to control it. I had tried other nasal sprays but to no avail. A friend recommended Nasonex and I tried it reluctantly. After 1 week of taking it (one spray in each nostril every morning) I am delighted. No more itchiness, sneezing, water eyes and no more misery!! I'm very happy and grateful and I've suffered no side effects so far.",
                    "I use Nasonex because my allergies trigger migraines. I spray the Nasonex when I feel a migraine coming on because of the sinus pressure and it works within 10 minutes. A real life saver!",
                    "I have tried many treatments for my eczema and this, and its generic form, have been the best. I get dry skin, redness, and cracking between my fingers, at the wrist and sometimes on the lower arm. One treatment at night and by morning the redness is gone, irritation gone, and after the 2nd day of treatment, no signs or symptoms of the eczema.",
                    "Wow I've had scalp psoriasis for 15 years and have tried many things. My new doctor prescribed Elocon and my scalp cleared in less than a week. I don't have to wear a hat any more and I feel comfortable wearing black.",
                    "This medication is the bomb! its like crack for eczema. I have tried other remedies as well and nothing else comes close. I am african-american with a caramel colored complexion. I started having flare ups on my hands really bad to the point where my hands are almost black and rough like dinosaur skin. I was scratching until they bleed. My hand even swelled up. It started to really affect my self esteem. Words cant even describe how happy I am that I got my hands on this stuff again. I am in love with it!",
                    "I started taking asthma to control my adult-onset asthma. It works very well, and when I am on it, my asthma is very well-controlled. I have gone off of it twice, due to my doctor thinking I did not need to be on it long-term, but after my last series of asthma attacks we agreed I should stay on it for the foreseeable future. My only comment is that I do think it makes me gain weight, especially in my mid-section. Not a lot (yet) but we will see what happens if I go off of it again. The weight gain is on average about 5 lbs., so not much, but on my frame, it is noticeable. Every time I go off it, the weight goes as well. I'd rather breathe and have 5 extra lbs., but I haven't seen this listed as a significant side effect anywhere.",
                    "I used to have rashes that swelled and bled. In 5 minutes the irritation and swelling was gone.",
                    "I had a cold with a stuffy nose so I don't know why my Doctor prescribed this for me. I wish I could give this product a zero. It did absolutely nothing for me except give me severe nosebleeds. I would love to contact the company to complain but I can't find their contact information anywhere. Worst 50 bucks I ever spent.",
                    "I call this a miracle. Been on for 16 months and haven't had a single attack. Went from taking five nebulizers treatments a day, to taking ZERO. On top of that it has significantly cut down allergies that was obviously triggered by asthma. I hope you have the success that I have had. Out of pocket price is the only downfall to Asthmanex.",
                    "Couldn't live life without it.",
                    "It works well without side effects.",
                    "Took my son to the allergist for testing, but he couldn't due to raised bumps on back so he prescribed elocon, I got the generic solution that comes in a squeeze dropper. I apply about 6 drops to affected area followed by cruel lotion which is good for replacing ceramides and hydration. I started late evening by the following morning I saw big improvement, by day 3 my son was a new person. Very satisfied so far hope he doesn't relapse",
                    "Works great for allergies. I mean AMAZING. My only issue is if I miss a dose, within 12-24 hours I get symptoms of a sinus infection.",
                    "My 5yr old daughter had a nasty flare-up that travelled from under her arm to half way down her inner forearm. Wasted money at Chemist buying OTC creams for a month that did nothing. Seeing her in pain & itching was awful, so went back to Drs & were prescribed Elocon-UNBELIEVABLE!!!! Cleared completely in 36hrs & has never come back-this was 7yrs ago!",
                    "First of all, it didn't really help me, I still suffered as much after I used it a few times for a sinusitis that was about to start. Second, it caused a huge cold sore to burst on my lip. I only had a cold sore once before (the first time I was infected) so I don't have have much doubt that Nasonex is what caused it.",
                    "I've had psoriasis for 15 years. I have purposely avoided biologics, steroids and UV treatments. I used Elocon for my first spot ever when I was first diagnosed with psoriasis and it made my tiny non-healing patch of psoriasis go away in a day. It never came back in that location. So, here it is 15 years later and although I've been covering up all year round and using coal tar to take the itch away. I've finally figured out a treatment plan that works. Use the Elocon to get rid of all the patches (it works great!) Then, use the 25% coal tar (5% active coal tar). Wallah! No more dermatologists or steroids for years!",
                    "I was given this drug for bronchitis. I was told that it takes a couple of days before you notice an improvement. I noticed a slight improvement after about 8 days. However if you weigh the cost and time it took to improve, ($100) it was not worth it. My $25 ProAir inhaler gave me the most relief. Maybe it is not designed for bronchitis???",
                    "Musician... Play twice if not more every weekend.... Got to the point where I was bleeding over my guitar and couldn't use certain fingers. After the first application of the cream within hours everything calmed down.. No inflammation.. Amazing cream!",
                    "I love this once a day use and have been sick less since on this medicine. I love it, have not had to use my rescue inhaler as much and in 2 years only 2 ER visits and only a couple of attacks instead of weekly.",
                    "Using mometasone steroid cream once a day after showering before I went to bed was the best solution to my eczema every time it got bad. I used to always struggle with eczema and hydrocortisone never worked! If you are in a similar scenario, this one is a stronger steriod",
                    "I started out having chapped lips about six months ago. Went to a doctor and then a dermatologist three times. My condition kept getting worse and finally I saw a new dermatologist. By the time I saw the new doctor my lips, above my lip was raw. He recommended mometasone and within one day my condition was 95% gone. It is a miracle cream.",
                    "I began using Nasonex to help with nasal congestion and snoring. Worked really well. I was also on Cymbalta and Lamictal for depression. About the same time I started the Nasonex, I began to suffer from acute, chronic migraines, as many as 20 per month. I went through 5 different neurologists/specialists during a SIX year period in which I was more or less bedridden. When the drug company stopped supplying it in September, I had to stop taking it, and haven't had a migraine since. Doctors need to be made more aware of the link between Nasonex and migraines. This condition is incredibly hard to diagnose and treat, as everyone has different triggers. Doctors don't know- for six years they got nowhere-- I was the one who figured it out.",
                    "Magic. I actually used it for congestion/flu.",
                    "I have suffered from eczema on and off for many years, recently I had a massive reaction on my face which resulted in severe eczema all over my face and neck. I had very sore red patches and very red burning patches. I felt rock bottom and after seeing a dermatologist she gave me Elocon. She gave me confidence that in 4 days my eczema would be completely cleared. I put it on at night and it stung just a little for the first night, 3 days later it had all cleared and my skin super smooth. This is a fab ointment and would certainly give a 10 out of 10 review.",
                    "My 3 year old son suffers from eczema! It is one of the worst cases his doctor has seen. He scratches till it bleeds. It's behind his legs, between his fingers, bends of his arms. He has been using this cream for about 3 days only. As of now it is helping but not cleared up completely!",
                    "I want to say that this cream does suspend the effects of Psoriasis and you do feel good when you see clear skin for that period of time. However, I have been using this cream for ten years now and I can only wonder if there is something out there that is safer and would have more permanent results. I know this is hard to deal with but hang in there - clear days ahead.",
                    "I suffered from this medical condition for many months. It cleared up within one day of using Elocon cream.",
                    "Recently began using the generic form of Nasonex and it is not managing my symptoms as well.",
                    "I had a very itchy rash on the outside of both lower legs, also what at first was an itchy red spot became quite large on the back of my calf. My doctor prescribed a cortisone cream that didn't help. Tried some other creams but no improvement. My legs were a mess for 12 months. Then I saw another doctor who prescribed Elocon which I used for 3 weeks and the rash cleared up. That was 3 months ago. I am 75 years old. I will use it again if I need too.",
                    "After having quite a lot of tests on allergies done, and still unable to find out what the problem of my running nose was, using Nasonex helped to relieve the most unpleasant affects of my condition. I have not experienced any side-effects. What I enjoy the most is that this spray doesn't destroy or acidize my nose.",
                    "This ointment is very effective. It has cleared up all of my breakouts from eczema. However, it concerns me that someone in an earlier post mentioned that they apply this medication to their face. Please DO NOT do this as Elocon is a steroid that can thin the skin. Its so strong, you only need to apply it to the affected area. Its not meant to be used like a face cream. The skin on your face is already so much thinner and more sensitive when than the skin on your arms and legs.",
                    "I had bad Psoriasis behind my ear. Elocon cleared it in just two days. I would definitely recommend it.",
                    "I had to discontinue using this drug after 3 months because it gave me joint pain.",
                    "This cream caused red skin syndrome. It ruined my life as I had to go through the most horrendous drug withdrawal just to get off it. 31 months off it and still not normal. Look up topical steroid addiction and withdrawal before deciding whether you want to risk 3 years plus of your life. Awful",
                    "I've been using Elocon for over 15 years. I use the liquid lotion on my scalp. If I apply twice a day for a week, my entire scalp is cleared and itch free. Elocon however is not very effective for the psoriasis in my belly button and in my ears. It only works to clear it for 3 days and comes right back. But for the scalp it's a 10! I also apply it to new spots over my skin if I see them, it nicks any new spots from forming. Elocon states it may thin the skin, but after 10 years, I'm still doing good, no thinning.",
                    "I have used it in several patients and the result was awesome.",
                    "My daughter is 21 now, but when she was about 1 or 2 years old, she was prescribed elocon and it permanently stopped her eczema in a few days. I was trying to remember the name of this prescription to recommend, and it just came to me out of the blue. I am so glad I remembered the name; I'm hoping it helps.",
                    "I haven't had an asthma attack since I started using Asmanex Twisthaler--nor have I had to use my Proventil for a flare-up. I am taking this medication instead of Advair or Singular because I have osteopenia. Asmanex does not deplete bone density as do some of the other medications for asthma.",
                    "I've had eczema ALL my life and I was starting to think nothing's working from Hydrocortisone creams all the way to natural aloe Vera but my new doctor prescribed this and I've never looked better! The flare ups are under control and my skin is almost clear",
                    "I tried every lotion, shampoos etc that said it would work and didn't. Came to the point where I was scratching so much my hair was falling out. My doctor suggested Elocon lotion for my scalp. Skeptical of course, used it in my hair and scalp before I went to sleep (stung a bit) but worth waking up and washing my hair to clear flake free scalp. I've never looked back, Best lotion ever.",
                    "Nasonex was prescribed because I can't breathe easily through my nose. It is hard to sleep at night and breathing through my mouth is very troublesome. I would wake several times at night with dry mouth, throat and in the morning, have a raspy voice. Dr thought I might have allergies and thought the Nasonex might open up nasal passages.",
                    "For me, it clears up outbreaks within 7 days and is used as a control when the fungus tries to make a comeback. The only drawback I have experienced is to my wallet. Very expensive even after insurance."

There are so many people allergic also someone like me with cancer and very sore and nauseated to spend money on this and it made me so sick I washed up 4 times and my hands and skin still smells strong. It gave me a headache and made my nausea worse. There is no need for perfume not to mention it's just an toxic unnecessary ingredient. I will never use this again and I will be sure to let everyone at clinic know.",

I sometimes get killer tension headaches that first build up in the back of the neck. When I felt one coming on, I used the gel on the back of the neck and shoulders. The headache never developed. Before this experiment I would take 3 or 4 ibuprofen for one of these headaches and hope for the best. The gel is now my standard treatment for these headaches.",

Zipsor is the only medication I've taken that has reduced the inflammation long enough for the joint to begin to heal thus giving my pain relief.",

It has made a big difference in helping me manage the pain of rheumatoid arthritis.",

It is like a miracle. I have never found any medication for anything that was more effective. I guess it just works better for some injuries than others. It is , however, very short acting. But the pain relief it provides is priceless. I have arthritis in my hands, I don't find it helps with that pain. For the certain types of injury it works better than narcotic medication.

It used to just act up at bedtime, so bad at times that I had to wrap my feet in ice packs to get relief. Now it's all hours & hands/feet and I have a stiffness and severe putting edema that pops up & then disappears with no regularity. There's no explanation from Doctor's YET.

                    "Only took twice a day for my ankylosing spondylitis . Had little relief if any at all. Vimovo worked much better but after a couple months had horrible GI side effects.",
                    "I've had migraines for 25 plus years and it's almost impossible to get pain medication these days even at an urgent care facility. My new doctor offered me Cataflam. I received the generic Diclofenac 50 mg. and was very excited about receiving any kind of help making it through a migraine which sometimes lasts 8 days, sometimes 2 days. Anyway, I took it three times a day the first two days and sporadically for another two or three days. It worked very well much to my surprise; however, after that I experienced the stomach burn I read someone else experienced. I didn't realize what had caused the burning until I read the reviews on this med. I'm a little afraid to take it again unless I just take it one or two days next time. Try it.",
                    "Liver problems, severe stomach pain, severe constipation, memory issues, trouble sleeping, loss of appetite, nausea to name just a few. Otherwise it took my knee pain away.",
                    "I started taking Disclofenac today for severe back pain caused by shingles. Immediately I felt some relief and I'm able to take a deep breathe without it hurting. This is the only pain med that really helped.",
                    "I have taken this medicine on and off for the past few years and it has done wonders! My doctor tried a number of medications for years of back pain and nothing worked. Diclofenac worked immediately. At times I go off of it for a few months, but when pain comes back, it works immediately. Fortunately no side effects.",
                    "I had back surgery 6 months ago, three discectomies, and a rod and five screws implanted. While it is stated it is not approved for spinal use, I have found Voltaren extremely beneficial. While I still have pain in the neighborhood of an 8 out of 10, I feel that it would always be a 10 without Voltaren. Many thanks to my PA for recommending it.",
                    "Long story kinda short! My knee swelled up where I couldn't even bend it. My mom gave me a tube of her gel. It worked right away when I applied it. Great stuff. Here's the best part though. I have a bulge in my lower back. I have meloxacam but I don't take it regularly because I feel that it don't help any. So one day my back is as hurting really bad so I decided to apply the gel. Glad I did because wow! It works amazing! They should most definitely test it on the back. I know surgery will be the only thing for permanent relief but I'm only 31 and one can't afford it and two it's not guarantee it would work and could make my problem worse. Next time I go to my doctor I will be asking for my own prescription.",
                    "The first time my doctor suggested Voltaren cream. I have osteo in both knees, right ankle and my spine. After several tubes and no reduction of pain or swelling my doctor suggested Pennsaid . The difference was like day and night. Not only did it reduce the pain but the swelling in my ankle was also reduced. When I investigated both products I was shocked to find that only Pennsaid contains a delivery agent DMSO that Voltaren does not . So it seems the DMSO delivers directly into the joint while the Voltaren only stays on the skin. Bottom line I will never spend my money on anything else going forward ....Pennsaid works for me.",
                    "I love this gel. Just 10 seconds after I put it on an area with severe pain, the pain is gone completely for 2 hours. I couldn't believe it the first time I used it. I take some other strong prescription medication for knee and back pain and the medications don't do as good a job on the pain as this gel. I wish I could use it more than 4 times a day, but during my waking hours, it is a God send. Thank you, thank you, thank you! I would do a commercial for Voltaren Gel anytime, for free!",

I am now 60 and the arthritis in my fingers is getting worse, but as I can take up to 3 tablets a day I can just increase my dosage. I recently recommended Diclofenac to a friends 90 year old mother, she had immediate relief and was so thankful.",

                    "I was suffering from an impingement of a nerve root exiting the left side of the T10 - T11 junction. I was prescribed Zipsor in combination with Skelaxin (muscle relaxant). The combination provided no discernible pain relief. However, I did suffer from significant stomach and intestinal pain. The stomach & intestinal pain stopped within 12 hours of discontinuing the Zipsor. Overall, not a pleasant experience.",
                    "I had tried Lidoderm and had fair to good results. I was reluctant to try the Flector because of the cost. My insurance did not cover them.  In an impulsive act due to frustration with pain, I got the script filled. Within 2 hours I noticed that the severe pain in my knee was almost gone, and I slept very well through the night. These are a miracle and work as well as or better than any systemic medicine including narcotics. They really do work. ",
                    "I had this for Broken Back, Shoulder Surgery (rotator cuff). I literally taste the medication when I apply it to my skin on my shoulder / arm area. Had a bit of gastric upset for about a half hour after using. Seemed to help relieve some of my pain though. Just wondering if you've had people report the taste on application.",
                    "My doctor prescribed Voltaren after an extremely painful IUD insertion and subsequent cramping. I've never had cramps like these before. I'd literally be curled up in the fetal position, unable to even talk. Depending on the level of pain, this either completely eradicated it or made it totally bearable, and lasted for 12 hours at a stretch. Voltaren is wonderful and I'm glad my doctor recommended it over a narcotic painkiller.",

I also have bursitis & piriformis syndrome in my right hip as well as achilles tendonitis in the right foot. I take 75mg 2 times a day. My knees are so bad that I had to have Synvisc-One injections as well. Combined I have been able to work my 12 hr shifts as an RN. I still have pain that's about a 6-7 after working three 12's in a row, but would not be able to work at all without the Voltaren. I am looking to have my knees replaced in the near future. The only side effect I have had is stomach upset if I do not take it with food and some mild constipation. I would recommend this medicine to anyone. ",
                    "This medication has been a God send for me. After PT and a year of Aleve my shoulder was somewhat better but not great. For a different issue my physician told me to stop the Aleve and try Diclofanac Sodium. My body is very happy. No back, neck, ankle, toe, shoulder pain. My shoulder range of motion is almost 100%.

I've since called my podiatrist asking for a full prescription based on the relief I already feel.",
                    "This medicine is pretty miraculous as far as my joints are concerned. I'm using much less than the 2gram dose - maybe 1/4 to 1/2 a gram on a joint, tops - and having at least 8 hours pain free. It seems no studies were conducted on it's use on shoulders, but it worked decently enough for mine when I pinched a nerve.  Make sure you read the possible side effects and all the potential negatives, and test on a single area with someone with you for a couple hours just to make sure you're not allergic. It's been problem-free for me, but everyone's body chemistry is different.",

Diclofenac does not relieve all of my pain, but it relieves 60-70 percent of it, or enough to allow me to have a life. For me it appears to be safe and effective. The only side -effect I've experienced is occasional mild constipation. I recommend it highly.",

I'm 26 years now .",

It's absolutely horrible! But when I take Cambia right away it relives the killer pain! I still get my warning signs but the migraine passes much more quickly with this medication! It does tend to make me feel a little weird-my nerves feel over sensitive. But I got a migraine around 8am today took cambia! And on my way to work at 12:30pm! Miracle!",

I was in a car accident and it appears I may have partially torn a ligament in my wrist. Maybe I was misdiagnosed and this is just the wrong medication for that? My doctor told me it would help the inflammation but all the reviews I've read are claiming \"pain relief\"?

My ligaments and tendons are weak and has been affecting my joints, needing to have 2 neck surgeries, bunions, and wrist surgery. I switched over to the generic Diclofenac 3% gel. Let me tell you it works! Unfortunately this higher dose costs anywhere from $600.00 - $1,100.00 for a 100 Gram tube. Downside is that it's marketed for skin Actinic Keratosis.",

By the end of second day the arm was black swollen and painful. Emergency room visit did not provide any relief other than telling Me to discontinue use of gel. I have a artificial heart valve that requires that I take blood thinner which was discussed with the prescribing physician and had been used as prescribed. The arm continued to swell and the blackness continued down the arm with pain that became unbearable. A ambulance was summoned to take me back to the hosital emergency room personnel could not diganose the situation completely and I was admitted to the ward. Surgery was required",

My pain had increased to the point where I had to have two radiofrequency (RF) neurotomy procedures performed to varying degrees of success. Pain returned, so tried Percocet 5/325 2x day for a month but only provided a temporary relief until the dose would wear off. I became concerned about opiate dependency so I made the decision to stop. Started Diclofenac 75mg ('551' on one side and a fancy 'R' on the other) 1xday and had a SIGNIFICANT reduction in pain after just two days. Bloodwork shows that it does mildly elevate my liver enzymes (ALT of 60) and has slightly lowered RBC, WBC & platelets which is a common side effect. Benefits outweigh the risk at this point, so will continue.",

This gel works well and very quickly in my case, and with bracing and icing I have experienced a lot of relief. The nature of this pain reliever is anti inflammatory - not numbing - so I don't think you would find use for it if your pain is not of the inflammatory nature. I get spastic and tense neck muscles all the time and find heat and massages work better. So for the right purpose it is excellent stuff. I am sensitive, delicate skinned and had no allergies but I would be careful and spot test nonetheless.",

Apparently it works for everyone else, so I may just be an oddball. It was like taking a placebo and I am not even taking other pain meds... So it's not like I have a tolerance level for pain meds...

I am a chiropractic student, so I went the conservative route first: adjustment, ultrasound, cold laser, Alpha-stim, microcurrent probes. Finally I had a series of x-rays on campus and unfortunately, there is a large osteophyte on the volar (palm) side of the base of the 1st metacarpal, along with serious lipping of the scaphoid bone which supports it (you know this combination as the saddle joint). Voltaren helps the crippling pain of trying to unscrew a jar, open a doorknob, or hold a pen. I will however have surgery to remove the osteophyte.",

I only rubbed in a small amount. I can't swear by it but I think it also caused me to have several anxiety attacks which I think are related to the woozy out of it feeling. It says it makes you dizzy on the box.",

I didn't have high hopes, but it is WONDERFUL!  Because I have had Gastric Bypass surgery, I can not take NSAIDS which pretty much leaves me, Tylenol! I did sneak an Aleve after being in so much pain and I was so sick to my stomach. The only negative, if Im in pain and my husband isn't home, it's kind of hard to apply to my own back!!! So I think this is a WONDERFUL medication for a person who can't orally take an anti-inflammatory medication! A true life saver!",

I can't say for sure what has relieved my pain, but ever since taking diclofenac my pain almost immediately has gone from being almost completely debilitated, to being able to function physically at the level I was at when pain started. Still have pain and not 100%, but my quality of life is back and I feel much more fluid and agile. For almost six months I could hardly get out of bed, let alone tie my shoes.",

Now on day three my foot pain is much better, allowing me to walk. I have had no skin reaction. The smell of the ammonia carrier can be a bit overwhelming but it dissipates quickly.",

I'd feel a small reduction in pain level for about 30 minutes then it would spike back up. It caused my blood glucose to shoot up and I am non-diabetic. It also caused me a great deal of stomach cramps, burning pain below sternum, belching, heartburn and diarrhea. I had better response on Ibuprofen and that did very little.",

My doctor told me that was very bad for my stomach and to use the Voltaren Gel instead and I found it to be wonderful, comfortable and it smells nice. Two days after I started using the Voltaren Gel I was so much more comfortable and now I alternate the ibuprofen 200 with the Gel and only use the Ibuprofen 200 two times a day. I can sleep a whole night. My back condition is in the muscles and and they are in spasm much of the time. Voltaren calms the spasms down and makes the pain tolerable. I am so glad to have found it.",

Tests for many conditions are negative, including rheumatoid arthritis, but we are still looking. Diclofenac was prescribed, and over the course of two weeks, the pain faded. I felt like a human being. I did not experience negative side effects. On the contrary, I did not suffer any of my standard migraines. Unfortunately, after 8 months, the VA hospital changed vendors and the new brand of Diclofenac was not effective. In the week following the change, I suffered all previous symptoms along with a migraine and upsurge in depression symptoms. Very frustrating. Still trying to sort it out.",

Sometime the back of my neck swells around two nerves on both sides that go into my arms and head, I've tried every narcotic there is but nothing but a Flector patch helps. Recently I had a very extensive knee surgery with an 8-12 month recovery time and once the incision healed I was given the okay to use these, they helped tremendously.

I have very inflamed painful bursitis under my scapula that throws all my muscles in my back/neck out of whack and creates a lot of transferred pain and problems for me. I was hoping this Voltaren gel my rheumatologist prescribed would help since the Celebrex and muscle relaxers alone are not doing the trick. But I do not detect any difference when I use it.

Then as I was standing in the kitchen making dinner I developed extreme nausea for about 5 minutes. This led to a rush shooting straight to my head and on came a dizzy spell that lasted for about 20 seconds. Followed by a partial black out for a split second, vision came back and I went to sit down moments later I was perfectly ok. Well besides feeling freaked out of course. I would never recommend this medicine to anyone.",

My pain specialist has done various treatments including Facet Joint Injections, with no long terms results. At my recent visit with him I was complaining of the same pain with no relief, he handed me two sample tubes of Voltaren Gel. I have been using it for about a week now and have had a full week without pain. This stuff really works. I have been impressed so far. Thanks Voltaren.",

These pain patches basically feel like happiness surrounding my wrist. I still have pain but it is at a much more tolerable level. I have my life back. For me, the patches work better than pain pills. They are covered by my insurance at a higher co-pay. And, with each prescription, I have to go through this whole prior authorization wait period. Get samples from your doctor to test them out and make sure they work for you. If they do, then fight the insurance. For my wrist, I am able to cut the patches into 2 halves and makes the prescription last longer. These saved my life.",

I was prescribed the patches with the caveat that \"they may not work.\" They work very well and my pain has decreased between 75-90%. If I use them as directed (1 every 12hrs) they are most effective. There are some issues with the adhesive on the edges but I've found if I warm them with my hand they stick better. True, there is very little movement of fabric over the area as with back issues. I work with a personal trainer 5 days a week so the leg gets a lot of use. Mine is an unusual use for these patches, but they are definitely worth a try.",

A friend turned me on to Voltaren Gel . I used it on my knees, neck, and lower back. This is as close to a miracle as I have experienced in my 50 years of arthritis producing activities. The best part is that dosing is applied directly and only to the problem areas so consequently much less ends up in your system overall than if taken orally. Win. Win.",

I have taken other anti inflamitories before but they didn't seem to help but this drug has been fantastic. I have been able to work out again and it has really reduced the amount of knee and ankle pain I get. I take two 75 mgs tablets a day and have not had any side effects and I have been taking it for about 3 months. I would recommend this drug to anyone who has arthritis pain",

I work on a computer all day, typing and mousing. I apply 2 grams, 4 times a day to the elbow area. It makes working very tolerable. I would say Voltaren is a good treatment and really helps bring my arm function back to normal with no pain for tendonitis / Tennis Elbow. Aspercreme was also ok, but the Voltaren does better. Mild stretching, exercise and movement also help and are made much easier with the Voltaren.",

My GP prescribed me Diclofenac, and it provided instant relief and reduced the inflammation straight away as after just one dose I could move again like almost normal. Two more doses the next day but then had to discontinue due to the unacceptable side-effects: heart palpitations, hot flushes, restlessness, minor anxiety. But I must state here though for you that I can hardly tolerate Ibuprofen or any NSAID pain-killer for that matter, of late that is. Earlier, I'd tolerate medicines like sweets, but after taking Ciprofloxacin 14 months ago, and that has messed up my whole system: I've even developed a number of food intolerances as well. So, it might still work better for you.",

Keeping a pad on the elbow has prevented it from flaring up more, but I don't think the drug has helped me at all.",
                    "I've tried a lot of things to help with my back pain. The latest going to chiropractor for 2 months. Things just did not get better. I called my doctor to go with some pain medicines and looked into seeing an orthopedic doctor for steroid shot. They prescribed this and I have been taking it now for 5 days and my back pain is gone. It felt much better on day 1 and each day was better and better. I take one tablet every 12 hours.",

I'm seeing a rheumatologist for a diagnosis (possibly fibromyalgia my GP said) in a couple months but my general practitioner has been treating me til then. I've tried 3 different prescription medications and they did nothing. The second day on this medication I started getting some relief in my back. It's not 100% gone but it really eases my pain. The unfortunate side effect with any nsaid is thin blood resulting in bruising. I have a bleeding autoimmune disorder so it's not the best combo. But I feel like as a first there's promising relief. I hope it continues.",

However, I JUST had an \"ah ha\" moment as to the mysterious, very itchy rash I have developed. The application areas reacted in the intense heat. Last summer while gardening I developed a severe lower back rash which I assumed was somehow sweat related. This year I developed the same painful, itchy rash on my right upper back (deltoid area and shoulder) down to my lower arm. Again, I thought it was from the heat and sweat. As I was applying it yesterday, I realized it was being applied directly on top of my rash. The ONLY places I have my rash. It took me long enough!! However, I did NOT get this rash in the cooler temps.",

After using Voltaren gel 2-3 times a day, after just 2 days pain was greatly reduced. And if there is any pain, it's only about a level 3 or 4. Have recently started using it on knees. Seems to help but not as dramatically as toe. I really like that fact that very little of the diclofenac goes systemic.",

It burns her and she refuses to use it so she gave me a tube for my arthritis in both my knees, my hip, back and ankles. WOW! This is a dream come true. It seems to work immediately for me and putting it on right before bed allows me to sleep all night because I have slight to no pain. I wake up, use it and then my day goes by MUCH better. I'm going to try to remember to actually take it to work with me so I can apply it there. I keep forgetting. Praise God for allowing me to try this gel. I was leery at first but tried it anyway. I am TRULY amazed and will buy more and more and more. Thank you for this amazing discovery.",

Pain was bad with little improvement the past 2 months, even with rehab/exercises and Vicodin and later Mobic (Meloxicam) and finally Motrin. Nothing worked. Couldn't sleep, constant ache from shoulder into my bicep. Rather than get a Cortisone shot yesterday, the doctor suggested I try a sample of the Flector Patch. I wore it last night and finally experienced some relief. I'd say the pain is about 75% better, and I managed to get some sleep. ",

Went to the doctor after a week of pain and not much healing taking place to make sure I didn't suffer any major ligament damage. He diagnosed the IT band issue and gave some samples of Flector Patch and as more of a comic relief, stated that \"these really shouldn't work, but actually do\". Was a little skeptical at first, but these patches do provide wonderful relief. Four patches later I am feeling much improvement in the mobility of my knee strain. Definitely worth a try.",

My doctor put me on this 2 years ago, 50mg once a day, and I honestly don't think I would survive the summer without it. One of my major problems I was getting out of bed in the morning, I couldn't even roll over the pain was so bad. So basically what I do is set my alarm 1/2 hour earlier so I can take it and let it work a little bit before I have to be up and out. I went from having to take so many days off of work to feeling so much relief. Since Physical Therapy didn't work for me, I will probably continue to take this as long as I have pain.",

POOR DESIGN on the pump.",

I get super stiff behind my knee, and it makes it hard to even walk, or straighten my leg all the way. I take ibuprofen, I ice it...and that helps some. I woke up this morning with it being extremely stiff behind my knee. I applied Pennsaid all over the back and front of my knee. No kidding - within 5 minutes, most of that stiffness is GONE. I am in shock. And if you have knee pain, you know how debilitating it can feel. This stuff is INSANE - in a good way!! I'm so glad I have it. I literally can't believe how much it helped me. And no, I don't work for a pharmaceutical company.",

I have not been overly impressed with either thus far. But I have noticed a little less stiffness and some range of motion. But in fairness the inflammation is no doubt very deep in both joints and would take time for the medicine to hit its target area. The Dr told me to give it time which I felt was reasonable. I find the gel to have a pleasant smell and rubs in nice and dries pretty quick. I am using the Voltaren Gel that says, diclofenac sodium topical gel 1%. Don't quote me but I believe they also make it with 2% diclofenac sodium?? With ins my cost was 42.00 for 5 tubes. Greasing both knees uses a lot",

It does not cause stomach upset like other NSAIDS and the only side effect is sleepiness but, a quick nap and pain is much better and no grogginess.",

I was waking up due to pain and found moving extremely difficult and painful. I was at the point of taking pain relief before bed and again at around 4 a.m. With no expectations but exasperation I tried voltaren. It really has worked very much to my surprise!!! I did not expect such a good result or any result, I was just so fed up I grabbed a tube to mix up with the oral meds! It's helped my sleep in a matter of days and I'm much more comfortable. I don't take oral pain killers now and whilst I can still feel it, it's nowhere near the way it was. I can move properly again",

I have exercised on a regular basis for many years and in 2009 I injured my rotator cuff on a piece of gym equipment. After the physical therapy was finished I was experiencing sharp pain radiating from my shoulder to my neck. I asked my doctor at the time, a rheumatoligist, if this was arthritis now coming from the shoulder. He gave me a tube of Voltaren Gel to try and it has been wonderful.

We have had no side effects and we use it for major flare-ups as it is not intended for long term daily use. We each get a big tube, even though some might find it pricey, you don't have to use a lot it lasts a long time. The relief it provides is priceless.

I'm still broken\"  I am on a 75mg dose, and within hours I could breathe and move much better- magical stuff. Pain is still there, but more like a sore muscle at this point... not like the sharp barbed wire in my chest feeling it had been. I have been eating with every dose, the doctor told me that this can be pretty harsh on your stomach if you are not careful. Hopefully I can decease my dose in a week.

I also have severe pain down the IT band area in both legs and my hips and low back give me problems (DDD in low back). Since using Voltaren Gel I can make it through the day without the aching and usually debilitating pain that I get when I don't use it. Fortunately I only need to use it once a day in the morning and that gets me through until the next day. This medicine works. It smells bad at first when you put it on but I can deal with that.",

I have been on them for one month, I use them for about 10 hrs a day. The only bad side effect I have experienced is massive weight gain. About 15 lbs in only one month. It does warn you on the label about possible fast weight gain. I have always maintained my weight by give or take 5 lbs...but 15lbs in 1 month is absurd.",

I had two Zipsor left from a sample pack I got from the doctor. I try to hang on to them in case my pain got worse. Since my doctors office had not received any samples I ask if they could call in a prescription. I didn't care about the cost. Zipsor has helped the pain and swelling tremendously in my knees.

If I had stronger pain, I did diclofenac shots to myself and that helped a lot. What I noticed, the quality of the European diclofenac is much higher.

Unfortunately, I found out that it is supposed to work to relieve the pain each time it is used. It certainly doesn't do this for me--I may as well be applying lotion for all the good it does me. It really does nothing at all. I'm really disappointed, as my pain management doctor just weaned me off of narcotics, so I don't have anything that helps with the pain at the moment.

My doctor prescribed this after the pain clinic refused to give me a steroid injection for pain relief. It's more effective than anything else I've tried. I take a prescription drug for the pain and then put this cream on 4 or 5 times a day. Within minutes of applying it the pain dissipates & I'm pain free for several hours.

So if you decide to use Caraflam, take it before it's painful.",
                    "I have recommended this to fellow-workers,it has made work bearable again. Been on everything, this medicine works. I take 75 mg daily.",
                    "Recently diagnosed with osteoarthitis in both hands. The pain was so bad that I would wake up in the middle of the night in pain and I was not able to use my right hand at all. Doctor put me on voltaren one week ago. So far I have been pain free. Still have swelling in joints but the morning stiffness and pain is gone. Gave it an 8 rating since I have only been on the drug for 1 week. Have experienced some acid reflux and sleepiness during the day. I don't know if it is because of the medicine or other problem.",
                    "After taking other meds for 4 months, took Voltaren for 2 days and no pain in my wrist - I was able to sleep and work.",
                    "I went to a fancy sports Dr. to no avail. The cortisone shot also didn't help shoulder pain but for a couple of months. I love this product..It has given life back to my arm. I can only use my arm without pain if I use this gel. I use it in the morning when I wake up. If I don't use the gel my shoulder and joints down to my elbow is impossible to deal with.",
                    "I am 51 and have lived with pain for a while. I have tried Celebrex in the past and I'm not knocking it. It's just that this medicine, even though it's only been a couple of days is great. ",

                    "I suffer with fibromyalgia mostly in my upper back and both sides of my neck. Flector patches ARE INCREDIBLE! I had been receiving pain shots for years to relieve the muscle pain that in turn caused me to have migraine/tension headaches more than 15 days per month. The major problem is that Insurance does NOT cover these patches and I have drained my Dr. of all of their samples. I highly recommend them if you can afford them!",
                    "I had pain behind my eyes, a headache, sore throat, and general joint pain. Took 1 tablet before a nap and woke up mostly pain free. No side effects as yet.",
                    "I have a heel spur and was given Voltaren for inflammation to possibly control plantar fascitis. This along with a 10 day use of AFO brace on my foot just may help prevent surgery. I believe Voltaren definitely is doing the job in reducing inflammation and controlling the pain.",
                    "I was diagnosed with pleurisy yesterday - intense pain on inhalation/yawning/coughing etc - in fact anything that involved inflating the lungs felt like I was being stabbed in the side. Was prescribed Dicloflex (Diclofenac sodium in UK) in 3 x 50mg tablets a day. Didn't seem to make a lot of difference the first day, so I continued using Paracetamol codeine for pain relief. Today I've been a lot more comfortable - it seems like it took three doses to get started. I was even able to yawn earlier and I spent a little time sleeping lying down this morning - both of which would've been impossible yesterday.",
                    "This is a magic pills for a tooth extraction pain. I had a lower second molar surgical extraction. After 4 days my pills was finished and 5th day I had terrible pain. Doctor gave me Diclofenac tablets again for 5 days. 30 minutes After taken the pill my pain totally gone. That's why I called magic pills.",
                    "I have been treated for plantar fasciitis (heel spurs) in my foot for 8 weeks - having several painful shots with little relief. I have only taken 3 doses of the Voltaren and I am feeling 90% pain free! I hope this will only improve with a little more treatment. I have had no noticeable side effects as of yet.",
                    "I have ulcers so I can't take ANY oral NSAIDS or aspirin or any blood thinning medication. I have severe osteoarthritis in my knees, back, shoulders, elbows, feet, neck, and back. I am only 24 and I also have fibromyalgia. I have been using Voltaren cream from 3 years and it is wonderful. My opiate pain medication helps so much but in between doses I use the cream to get by. Without it I can't function at a normal level and it hurts to bad to cook, shower, or do any basic activity. I have had no side effects. Although after I shave it burns to put it on my knees but that's just because I had just shaved.",
                    "I have been on the patch for about 4 months now. It has by far worked better than anything else I have tried. I am about to change out of it because my body has been building a resistance to it. It is working only about 40% compared to before but I don't blame the patch. I think it's fantastic. Hope it works for you..",
                    "It works very well for my joint pain, my feet hurt so bad when I walk on them for 10 mins or longer and my lower back when I sit or stand 10 mins or longer. Voltaren gel eases the pain but does not take it completely away. I'm much worse without it. I notice someone was taking Motrin while using this gel, I read to not use certain medications when using this gel, double check please, just want people to be safe or ask doctors.",
                    "Took diclofenac 75 mg DR (delayed release) twice / day for 1 month, then once / day for 2 weeks, then stopped.  Worked well with 90-95% improvement in reduced pain and stiffness due to inflammation from one degenerative disk in lower back and some osteoarthritis --- within 3-4 days !  No side effects. Take with food on the stomach. Drink more water than normal to flush system and hydrate kidneys.",
                    "I was diagnosed with sciatic pain that affected my back and right thigh. I used the gel liberally as the pain increased. Eight days ago I stopped as my right thigh was experiencing a burning sensation in the area where I had applied the gel. I still have the burning sensation.I am on various drugs for hypettension.",
                    "Diclofenac really helped with my arthritic hip pain & heel spur pain the first two weeks, but I had to stop taking it because it caused dizziness, nausea, nightmares, insomnia, irritability, headaches, pressure in ears, muscle weakness, fatigue, decreased urine output, worse joint pains when worn-off, liver pain.",
                    "While taking this medication I had increased mobility in my frozen shoulder because of the significant decrease in pain. However 1 week after finishing medication, pain fully returned.",
                    "Works really well , but the size of the tube compared to the box it comes in is very very deceiving , when I bought my 50g one thought it was going to be bigger when it came out the box I thought someone had switched it for a smaller version just look before you buy",
                    "I have been using Voltaren for sometime now and it brings me immediate relief. My muscles seem to be effected by the arthritis I have, and the Voltaren helps those muscles to relax and not knot up on me. I love the stuff!",
                    "Just diagnosed with arthritis. I have osteoporosis now. Have only been using this for 3 days and it works wonderful. It eases my neck pain to wear I hardly feel any hurt. I'm weary of the side effects so don't know how long I will use this cream but I tell you what, if I hurt, this cream is the 1st thing I would go for!",
                    "This gel was prescribed to me to help wean me off of strong dose of anti-inflammatory. I have a bone bruise on my knee and the orthopedic doctor said it will take a year to heal. I am unable to do my usual 4 miles on the treadmill or even walk around the block. When I ease off the anti-inflammatory medicine, my knee swells up and I can barely walk. This has not helped my knee that much. However, I have started to use it for some swelling/pain in my thumb and I also have some lower back and neck pain and it helps.",
                    "Before being diagnosed with Ankylosing Spondylitis I was treated for general chronic back pain. I was started on Ibuprofen, but had to up the dosage. My GP changed me to Diclofenac (50mg 2x daily) but I didn't find it effective. I went back to 100mg 4x daily Ibuprofen which was much more effective for me.  I had no side effects while taking it.",
                    "Have only used it twice, and ONLY as a \"rescue\" med from my Dr. It worked within 20 minutes and lasted the whole day. I'm only instructed to use it no more than twice a week. I suffer all the other days and have had this headache for 4 years now. Also starting some new meds to figure out what will PREVENT them.",
                    "I was prescribed Diclofenac 75 mg, for chest pain. It did nothing for me. I think my chest pain was due to anxiety and indigestion, so I stopped taking it after 1 day. A year later I woke up one morning with a stiff neck. I thought nothing of it and went to a trampoline park where I came down with a thud on my bum. No biggie, I'm pretty resilient at 32. The next day I had excruciating pain in my upper left back, neck and shoulder. My muscle at the collar bone was cramped tight! I waited 2 weeks and there was little relief, no sleep. I found my Diclofenac and it helped in an hour! NO PAIN! I slept for a full night! I see doc tomorrow for an MRI and diagnosis.",
                    "My doctor prescribed this for inflammation in my lower back area, I have been on it for one week. My shoulder and neck pain is gone almost completely and my back feels a lot better. As of today its been 5 days I have been on this product. The info says it takes two weeks..am hoping it just gets better. Very impressed.",

I am a 44 year old male employed full time and spend long periods of time on my feet quite frequently.I can not say enough how much this drug improved my life. My knee pain was getting so bad I thought I was going to need replacement surgery. I can take long walks and run up the stairs again. One caution is to make sure you eat with food and drink plenty of water throughout the day. A glass of milk and a banana does the trick. t will give you an upset stomach if you don't.",
                    "In 1981 I had severe heel pain and was living in Germany. I was prescribed a topical gel called Rheumone gel. It worked great. I had occasion to use it several times while we lived there. When I got back to the States, no luck in finding it. Then, about 6 months ago my daughter was prescribed Voltaren Gel. Hurrah! It is made in Germany by the same company as the Rheumone gel. It smells the same and works the same. My doctor has prescribed it to me for the arthritis and pain. It does a wonderful job.",
                    "I was hit by a police car in 2002. I was in recovery for a year. From the head down. Broken jaw, 4 disks crushed my neck. Both collar bones, 7 broken ribs and a shatered pelvis. So many pills, patches and injections. Under the knife many times. A real humpty dumpty story. I have more pins, screws in me than your local hard wear store. Note: I don't want to over state the how effective it is but it works. Talking to my doctor about the pain. He gave me this to try. Well my 1st thought was \"just another snake oil\" But it'sfreak'in amazing, it works like magic. Why did I not recive this years ago. The Drugest gave me a stupid look. And said it just became generic. All those years I would have paid anything. When your in pain, money is no object",
                    "This morning (my first day) I was shaking and in tears. That's how bad my cramps have become during the past year. I was given a diclofenac (voltaren) injection 30 min ago and now am almost completely at ease. Considering that I'd tried nearly everything (ibuprofen, panadol ex, buscopan, spasm relaxers etc etc), I'm umderstandably excited and can't wait to share this. I tried the tablets last month and this morning but they aren't as effective as the injection. My advice is if it's debilitating - definetely go for the injection ASAP. Don't wait.",
                    "My dr gave me Voltaren Gel to help relieve my Ilio-Inguinal Neuralgia as a sample. I don't have a specific dosage, just when it hurts, apply the cream. It works amazing! I mainly use it for break-through pain between doses, and days like this with storms and hectic days at work, I'm able to concentrate on work instead of trying to take my mind off of the pain. Does this come in gallon size with a push handle? Maybe a bath bomb I could put in my jacuzzi tub? Just askin...",
                    "I have severe osteoarthritis in both knees, and arthritis in my back, and shoulders. My doctor prescribed Voltaren because I built up a resistance to ibuprofen and Aleve. I've been in pain for so long I forgot what it was like to be pain free. A little nervous over the long term side effects, so hoping I can get the weight off so I can be medication free. Just thankful to be able to move and do things I love without pain.",
                    "I have been taking Firocet for years and it has been moderately effective for my migraines , which I usually have one per week. My Dr. last week recommended Cambia, was skeptical about it but was in agony and gave it a try. Within 45 minutes I was up and functional. Will only use in severe cases. Also very costly if you have no insurance.",

I have degenerative disc disease in my neck and lower back, as well as osteoarthritis in my hips and right shoulder (right shoulder is due to a broken humeral head and torn muscle from a 4-wheeler accident). 2 years ago I wrecked my 4-wheeler, so bad that I could not walk or even bathe myself for 2 weeks. I have been in severe pain and have tried everything, including nerve block injections, and incredibly high pain medicines (including Valium and Oxycodone). The doctor gave me this gel a week ago and said to use it for my neck. My neck is doing great, and after reading all of these reviews I am going to try it on my hips and shoulder!",
                    "My doctor prescribed this medication for arthritis in my feet. It worked great and within a few days there was no pain in my feet, or anywhere else for that matter. After about 2 weeks, however, I developed heartburn and intestinal cramps so severe that I passed out on 2 occasions. If you can handle the side effects, this medicine works wonders for pain and inflammation.",
                    "I've been on this now for 5 months and it is by far the best pain medicine out there. No high feeling or anything like that. If your doctor has you on Celebrex and you don't feel any relief, ask him for Voltaren. You will most certainly feel the difference. If you are on it for any length of time (like me) then every so often you'll have to have blood work done to check your kidneys and liver to make sure they are functioning right as this medicine can cause problems with that. For me everything is good to go so far. I swear by Voltaren.",
                    "I found this medication online with some web searches during major migraine. I asked my neurologist for a prescription and fortunately she agreed. She'd never heard of it before, so was hesitant. My insurance covers this a better price than other migraine abortants. It's my go to now. I highly recommend. Use as little water as possible, then rinse the cup with water and drink whatever residue. It works wonders and truly dosen't taste bad.",
                    "I used the gel for 2 1/2 months after TKR 3-4 times/day. Part of the time I used the extra-strength version. I thought that it was moderately effective for pain and swelling. However, three weeks after stopping I still cannot get the odor out of my body. The extra-strength version has a different carrier, thicker and with a strong odor, and I would not use it again.",
                    "Due to a recent accident my orthopedic doctor prescribed this for my knee swelling/bursitis condition. I'm a 51yr-old female and after 2-3 weeks of taking this medicine I was experiencing hot flashes frequently about 5X a day especially at night that wakes me up, which never occurred before. I thought I was pretty young to be experiencing this, but this website was the second place where I researched this medicine where it states \"works by reducing hormones\" that explains my hot flashes recently. I still need to take a few more pills and swelling has subsided in my knee but do not intend to take this long-term.",

Had to have an upper endoscopy to find the cause of my symptoms. I had burns to my lower esphagus and mild stomach bleeding. My doctor told me that a side effect of this medication (ointment applied to the skin on my face) can destroy the mucus lining in the stomach. Use with extreme caution!",
                    "I was prescribed Flector patches after surgery to repair my collarbone, which came with frozen shoulder that I've been getting physical therapy on for weeks. I have not used the patches regularly, just when I have a little pain. Early on I had pain in the shoulder area but could not place the patch directly on the shoulder because of the surgical scar. The patches helped somewhat. Now I have some pain for stepping up workouts on the shoulder, and I can place the patch directly on the pain area, and it's working wonderfully. The patch has a kind of numbing feeling, and overall the feeling can be compared to what ibuprofen does in reducing inflammation. The patches can make me a little sleepy. They also can be a little large for certain spots",

Each time I got very stiff with painful joints. I've tried most of the other arthritis NSAIDS and none work nearly as well. My Dr. runs a liver function test every 6 months.",
                    "Use for lower back pain and spine arthritis. The patches make it possible to function, significant pain relief. It helps to tape the edges down with athletic tape otherwise the edges catch on clothing and pull the patch loose. Far fewer side effects than oral NSAIDS and better relief.",

                    "Personally it's the best gel I have used to warm up my back muscles, making the muscles feel like I've stretched for 15 - 20 min. Don't expect miracles. You should not be expecting this gel to completely alleviate back pain. It's not supposed to do that. It's supposed to get your muscles to a place where you can do other things more easily to attain painlessness via a combined effort. For a lot of back pain, if you use the gel in conjunction with consistent stretching (twice daily) whilst consuming the correct diet and being active enough to lower your body weight, you will be in a much better place in no time - so be encouraged! The gel really helps you do the things you need to do physically to get to that place.",

For the last 3 years I have reduced to 1x50D mg per day and really feel very comfortable. I found it very effective and I didn't noticed any side effects yet.

Worst episodes included my inability to pick up a coffee cup with my left hand, pain level of 7, inability to sleep on my left side etc.  After 6 months of this, I visited my G.P who x-rayed my shoulder and found arthritic changes.

If you're having trouble with it adhering to the skin, make sure the area is free from oils, either naturally or lotions or soap residue. I have no problems at all with them. My RA flared up in addition to my cocyx broken off, literally. The pain was so severe that oral meds weren't effective.

The pain subsided to about a level 3 from a level 6 after wearing it for just a few short hours.  Do not stop wearing the patch as the pain will come back quickly. I did have to supplement the pain with additional meds after I did some light home repairs (despite the the warnings) and this kept the pain level down.",

In that year I have had total knee replacement (left knee), then two more \"revisions\" on the same knee to get rid of an infection. Just weeks ago, I came to the conclusion that Celebrex just wasn't getting the job done for my pain, and of course I did not want to take narcotics. I did a lot of research (the reviews on this site were immensely helpful) and decided to give Diclofenac a try. It has been fantastic, and I feel better than I have in years.",

I use along with oxycodone and muscle relaxers and honestly think I get more relief from the patches.

I've tried most approved treatments, including \"off label\" medications, with ranging levels of relief.  I've yet to find a preventative aka \"miracle drug\", although, botox has effectively reduced the number of my \"headache\" days.

But I noticed weeks later, severe back pain that affected my ability to stand for a long period of time without feeling light headed from the pain. No over the counter pain killers helped. When my doctor prescribed me this, it immediately went away. The only side effect I've experienced is feeling fatigued. Like most medications, though, my tolerance for it has built up quickly. And when I don't take it, the pain catches up on me quickly. It's difficult for me to get out of bed if I go more than a day without it.

After having a large mass removed from my leg, the knee got worse and was swollen until I couldn't walk without a cane or walker. I went to the doctor to see if I could get a shot to help me walk and he gave me a tube of Voltaran Gel to use. I came home, put it on the knee and propped my leg up for an hour. When I was ready to get up, I dreaded it because I just knew I was going to be in horrible pain again. But, the pain was almost all gone.

I used this gel for about 2 months twice daily on the lip. I must mention that there absolutely no effect of this medication on my lip. A total waste of money if you don't have insurance as it can be quite expensive without it.  Then I was prescribed all sort of other creams which was nothing but a waste of money on moisturizers. Don't feel bad to question the dermatologist as to what the cream does and whether it will cure you. The most essential treatment for single or isolated AKs is cryotherapy - liquid nitrogen spray.",

No one can really tell or know when you have went too far because you are suppose to hurt and be in pain. If you are in pain, it means that your body muscles are stretching and you are making room for more muscles to fit. Many people don't understand that when you go home then that's when the adrenaline wears off and you start to think \"I went a little too far that time\".  Since most of what I do is shoulder press, I have to say that this back patch for pain has saved me from several night where I wouldn't have been able to sleep.

                    "This is an AMAZING product. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND TRYING IT. Truly a must try.",
                    "I think the use of putting perfume in the gel is really stupid. There are so many people allergic also someone like me with cancer and very sore and nauseated to spend money on this and it made me so sick I washed up 4 times and my hands and skin still smells strong. It gave me a headache and made my nausea worse. There is no need for perfume not to mention it's just an toxic unnecessary ingredient. I will never use this again and I will be sure to let everyone at clinic know.",
                    "I used Voltaren gel on some sore joints (and a tennis elbow). It worked as well as anything I have ever tried. I sometimes get killer tension headaches that first build up in the back of the neck. When I felt one coming on, I used the gel on the back of the neck and shoulders. The headache never developed. Before this experiment I would take 3 or 4 ibuprofen for one of these headaches and hope for the best. The gel is now my standard treatment for these headaches.",
                    "Amazing topical relief. I 100% recommend it.",
                    "Because of an auto accident a year ago I had a partial separation of my right sacroiliac joint. I've taken Advil, Celebrex, and Mobic along with steroid injections and received little or no pain relief. Zipsor is the only medication I've taken that has reduced the inflammation long enough for the joint to begin to heal thus giving my pain relief.",
                    "I have been on diclofenac 75mg twice a day for 5 years. The first year I took it 2 X each day. After the methotrexate began to kick in, I now only take it when needed when I get a flare up. At the most, only about once per week, sometimes less. It has made a big difference in helping me manage the pain of rheumatoid arthritis.",
                    "I use the gel and it may take a little time to work (about 30-45 minutes), but the effect is pretty good. It will take my pain from a 9 down to a 5 (that's pretty good for me).",
                    "My grandmother had Voltaren gel for her, but when my knee wouldn't bend and I began to have pain, she let me use her gel. So far, I've placed it on my right knee and the pain was almost gone. I've placed the gel on again and the pain is disappearing. I'm 19 and there is no way I should be having joint pain...the gel works great.",
                    "Have been using Pennsaid for over eight years but strictly on an as needed basis (2-3) times a week. Very effective for knees and hips (almost instant relief). Only side effect is an occasional oral off taste.",
                    "Really did the trick for my migraine with no side effects. Tastes terrible but I'll take that over a migraine any day!",
                    "Voltaren 1% gel was prescribed for my elderly (92 year old) friend for foot pain. She had a negative reaction to the first application and would not try it again. In desperation and since I have a type of neuropathy in my feet and cannot fall asleep, I applied 1/2 the dosage she was prescribed. To my surprise it allows me to fall asleep at night without the pain and discomfort in my feet. I will be seeing my doctor to get this prescribed for me! I have been looking for relief for over 5 years!",
                    "Have used off and on for three years for severe back pain/spasms as well as tendinitis of the elbow. Diclofenac (75mg) is moderately effective at best, at least for me. It's about the same as a single Ibuprofen (Advil) which is to say not useful for serious pain. Everyone's different I guess. Unfortunately my doctor refuses to prescribe anything else.",
                    "Have Full Meals with this medicine to keep your stomach safe.",
                    "I had a bad reaction to this medicine; trouble breathing, tight throat, cold hands and feet, increased pulse, strong headache, then fatigue. It was very frightening, but did go away after several hours.",
                    "I have a sprained rotator cuff. I was prescribed Voltaren for Plantar Facilities several months ago. I found no relief from the Voltaren for my feet. When I injured My shoulder, I remembered that had the Voltaren so I figured it couldn't hurt to try it. WOW!! AMAZING!! Nothing I have tried orally can even come close to the Voltaren. It is like a miracle. I have never found any medication for anything that was more effective. I guess it just works better for some injuries than others. It is , however, very short acting. But the pain relief it provides is priceless. I have arthritis in my hands, I don't find it helps with that pain. For the certain types of injury it works better than narcotic medication. Smells great Absorbs quickly.",
                    "This drug works so fast, I had my migraine gone in 15 minutes. It's fabulous!",
                    "Not sure exactly what condition I have, Doctor's have just generically named it \"Peripheral Neuropathy\" but there's more to it than that. I'm 38 now & I've battled this since I was a child. I have this intense burning ache that began as a child in my feet & has gotten worse over time. It also affects my hands. It used to just act up at bedtime, so bad at times that I had to wrap my feet in ice packs to get relief. Now it's all hours & hands/feet and I have a stiffness and severe putting edema that pops up & then disappears with no regularity. There's no explanation from Doctor's YET. I was given this cream and I rub it into my hands, wrists, feet, & lower legs. It does seem to calm things some, reduces the burn.",
                    "I'm a 58 year old woman with osteoarthritis and pain in my knees. Tried a lot of things that didn't work including other NSAIDs, shots, tramadol, but have been on this for about 2 months and it is a life saver. I am able to walk 2-3 miles a day with minimal pain, walk up and down steps, and sleep better. I haven't noticed any significant side effects -- perhaps very mild constipation. I will be deferring the knee replacements for a while thanks to this drug. I take it twice a day, 75 mg.",
                    "This works great.",
                    "Not a bad anti-inflamatory. Better if taking it with a Vicodin or Percocet.",
                    "Worked great on a muscle strain! Even helped to heal it faster. Nice mild smell. I gave it a 8/10 and not a 10/10 because it gave me side effects. Ringing in ears quite frequently as well as a very strong dizzy feeling. This began after a week of use.",
                    "I was having hand pains a friend put some on my hand,I had no pain for days,I went to my Dr.got a prescription, it works no ordor,it also helps my roto tear,I had a botched surgery, it helps that pain. Thanks to my friend and this company.",
                    "I have been taking Voltaren for the past 6 years in conjunction with omapromazin. I would not have been able to walk, sleep or enjoy life. It is only now after having two knee replacements that I no longer need to take any medication. I think Voltaren is a way to enjoy life again, without pain. But for me I am happy to have the new knee replacements.",
                    "Only took twice a day for my ankylosing spondylitis . Had little relief if any at all. Vimovo worked much better but after a couple months had horrible GI side effects.",
                    "I've had migraines for 25 plus years and it's almost impossible to get pain medication these days even at an urgent care facility. My new doctor offered me Cataflam. I received the generic Diclofenac 50 mg. and was very excited about receiving any kind of help making it through a migraine which sometimes lasts 8 days, sometimes 2 days. Anyway, I took it three times a day the first two days and sporadically for another two or three days. It worked very well much to my surprise; however, after that I experienced the stomach burn I read someone else experienced. I didn't realize what had caused the burning until I read the reviews on this med. I'm a little afraid to take it again unless I just take it one or two days next time. Try it.",
                    "Liver problems, severe stomach pain, severe constipation, memory issues, trouble sleeping, loss of appetite, nausea to name just a few. Otherwise it took my knee pain away.",
                    "I started taking Disclofenac today for severe back pain caused by shingles. Immediately I felt some relief and I'm able to take a deep breathe without it hurting. This is the only pain med that really helped.",
                    "I have taken this medicine on and off for the past few years and it has done wonders! My doctor tried a number of medications for years of back pain and nothing worked. Diclofenac worked immediately. At times I go off of it for a few months, but when pain comes back, it works immediately. Fortunately no side effects.",
                    "I had back surgery 6 months ago, three discectomies, and a rod and five screws implanted. While it is stated it is not approved for spinal use, I have found Voltaren extremely beneficial. While I still have pain in the neighborhood of an 8 out of 10, I feel that it would always be a 10 without Voltaren. Many thanks to my PA for recommending it.",
                    "Long story kinda short! My knee swelled up where I couldn't even bend it. My mom gave me a tube of her gel. It worked right away when I applied it. Great stuff. Here's the best part though. I have a bulge in my lower back. I have meloxacam but I don't take it regularly because I feel that it don't help any. So one day my back is as hurting really bad so I decided to apply the gel. Glad I did because wow! It works amazing! They should most definitely test it on the back. I know surgery will be the only thing for permanent relief but I'm only 31 and one can't afford it and two it's not guarantee it would work and could make my problem worse. Next time I go to my doctor I will be asking for my own prescription.",
                    "The first time my doctor suggested Voltaren cream. I have osteo in both knees, right ankle and my spine. After several tubes and no reduction of pain or swelling my doctor suggested Pennsaid . The difference was like day and night. Not only did it reduce the pain but the swelling in my ankle was also reduced. When I investigated both products I was shocked to find that only Pennsaid contains a delivery agent DMSO that Voltaren does not . So it seems the DMSO delivers directly into the joint while the Voltaren only stays on the skin. Bottom line I will never spend my money on anything else going forward ....Pennsaid works for me.",
                    "I love this gel. Just 10 seconds after I put it on an area with severe pain, the pain is gone completely for 2 hours. I couldn't believe it the first time I used it. I take some other strong prescription medication for knee and back pain and the medications don't do as good a job on the pain as this gel. I wish I could use it more than 4 times a day, but during my waking hours, it is a God send. Thank you, thank you, thank you! I would do a commercial for Voltaren Gel anytime, for free!",
                    "Zipsor is the ONLY med that gives me relief from intense pain in both shoulders due to widespread inflammation. This drug is absolutely amazing.",
                    "I've been taking Diclofenac 50mg once a day for many years. If I forget for any reason the pain immediately returns. I am now 60 and the arthritis in my fingers is getting worse, but as I can take up to 3 tablets a day I can just increase my dosage. I recently recommended Diclofenac to a friends 90 year old mother, she had immediate relief and was so thankful.",
                    "I use it for Osteoarthritis of the knee and shoulder arthritis from torn rotator cuffs. It has helped me alleviate the need for surgery for many years. It is very effective.",
                    "better than pain pills works the best and goes right to the pain",
                    "I had pain from shingles. Gabapentin was giving me minimal relief, I tried diclofence suggested by a friend, it gave me relief in minutes. I use the 10%, and thankful I found it worked for me.",
                    "This gel is so effective that I don't need to take ibuprofen anymore. Very soothing, quick acting, long lasting, pleasant smell that soon dissipates.",
                    "I did physical therapy, icing, resting, every technique to try to stop the pain in my knee. I have osteoarthritis as well. This medication was the only thing that worked and stopped the pain in my knee. I am so happy my doctor prescribed this drug for me.",
                    "Cataflam is a life saver but it takes about an hour after swallowing to start working. I take 2 at a 6 hr interval and can take up to six at the end of the day, but that's only for the first day of the period. ",
                    "Works for Osteoarthritis and sciatica.",
                    "I was suffering from an impingement of a nerve root exiting the left side of the T10 - T11 junction. I was prescribed Zipsor in combination with Skelaxin (muscle relaxant). The combination provided no discernible pain relief. However, I did suffer from significant stomach and intestinal pain. The stomach & intestinal pain stopped within 12 hours of discontinuing the Zipsor. Overall, not a pleasant experience.",
                    "I had tried Lidoderm and had fair to good results. I was reluctant to try the Flector because of the cost. My insurance did not cover them.  In an impulsive act due to frustration with pain, I got the script filled. Within 2 hours I noticed that the severe pain in my knee was almost gone, and I slept very well through the night. These are a miracle and work as well as or better than any systemic medicine including narcotics. They really do work. ",
                    "I had this for Broken Back, Shoulder Surgery (rotator cuff). I literally taste the medication when I apply it to my skin on my shoulder / arm area. Had a bit of gastric upset for about a half hour after using. Seemed to help relieve some of my pain though. Just wondering if you've had people report the taste on application.",
                    "My doctor prescribed Voltaren after an extremely painful IUD insertion and subsequent cramping. I've never had cramps like these before. I'd literally be curled up in the fetal position, unable to even talk. Depending on the level of pain, this either completely eradicated it or made it totally bearable, and lasted for 12 hours at a stretch. Voltaren is wonderful and I'm glad my doctor recommended it over a narcotic painkiller.",
                    "My doctor gave me samples for a pulled muscle under my right breast; glad I did not have to pay for them because they've done nothing for me!",
                    "I started taking Voltaren back in October for osteoarthritis of my knees, right hip & left hand. I also have bursitis & piriformis syndrome in my right hip as well as achilles tendonitis in the right foot. I take 75mg 2 times a day. My knees are so bad that I had to have Synvisc-One injections as well. Combined I have been able to work my 12 hr shifts as an RN. I still have pain that's about a 6-7 after working three 12's in a row, but would not be able to work at all without the Voltaren. I am looking to have my knees replaced in the near future. The only side effect I have had is stomach upset if I do not take it with food and some mild constipation. I would recommend this medicine to anyone. ",
                    "This medication has been a God send for me. After PT and a year of Aleve my shoulder was somewhat better but not great. For a different issue my physician told me to stop the Aleve and try Diclofanac Sodium. My body is very happy. No back, neck, ankle, toe, shoulder pain. My shoulder range of motion is almost 100%. For me, Diclofenac Sodium DR 50mg has been wonderful.",
                    "I need to take Cytotec (misoprostol) with it.",
                    "I have \"jumpers knee\" tendonitis. I play softball and I am a outfielder...I also workout 5 times a week. Back in my days I ran track as well...I guess it all caught up to me in my early 30's ..I couldn't lift my leg below my knee it was so painful, my sports dr prescribed Voltaren and when I used it as prescribed 4x's a day I saw a good bit of improvement...",
                    "My podiatrist gave me a sample containing 2 patches for heel spur/achiles tendon pain. I've been using the patch for 3 days and have noticed a marked improvement in the amount of pain. Based on other reviews with issues of sticking, I use veterinary wrap to hold it in place. I've since called my podiatrist asking for a full prescription based on the relief I already feel.",
                    "This medicine is pretty miraculous as far as my joints are concerned. I'm using much less than the 2gram dose - maybe 1/4 to 1/2 a gram on a joint, tops - and having at least 8 hours pain free. It seems no studies were conducted on it's use on shoulders, but it worked decently enough for mine when I pinched a nerve.  Make sure you read the possible side effects and all the potential negatives, and test on a single area with someone with you for a couple hours just to make sure you're not allergic. It's been problem-free for me, but everyone's body chemistry is different.",
                    "I'm a great fan of diclofenac. I have severe lumbar stenosis and osteoarthritis of the hips and knees, and could not function without some relief of the pain. Diclofenac does not relieve all of my pain, but it relieves 60-70 percent of it, or enough to allow me to have a life. For me it appears to be safe and effective. The only side -effect I've experienced is occasional mild constipation. I recommend it highly.",
                    "Since i got my period when I was 12 years I experience an unbearable pain that stops my life completely accompanied by vomiting and diarrhea and so many times went to hospital emergency. I may faint of pain all the ppl arround me  know what i suffer in school, university or at work Voltaren ampoule worked well so far to extent that i can give myself the injection in the butt like a boss It makes me sleepy and from the huge pain I feel dizzy head and very tired but its better than the pain for sure I wish there would be no side effects in the long run .. I'm 26 years now .",
                    "I've been on Vicodin, Percocet, etc. My body doesn't react to those. I was diagnosed with a cervical strain and was put on this. Absolutely love it for muscle pain. I have arthritis and fibromyalgia and this medicine is great. Also no side effects.",
                    "Although no medication completely rids my migraines (I get stroke like symptoms with my migraines) aura with numbness on right or left side- depending on side of pain, dizziness and off balance. It's absolutely horrible! But when I take Cambia right away it relives the killer pain! I still get my warning signs but the migraine passes much more quickly with this medication! It does tend to make me feel a little weird-my nerves feel over sensitive. But I got a migraine around 8am today took cambia! And on my way to work at 12:30pm! Miracle!",
                    "My doctor gave me 3 samples of Pennsaid while waiting on the prescription. I don't understand any of these reviews. It does absolutely nothing for me. I was in a car accident and it appears I may have partially torn a ligament in my wrist. Maybe I was misdiagnosed and this is just the wrong medication for that? My doctor told me it would help the inflammation but all the reviews I've read are claiming \"pain relief\"? Thankfully I had the samples before I was forced to spend upwards of $75.00 for this useless medication.",
                    "I started using Voltaren Gel 1% in 2015 and it really did help decrease my pain in my neck, lower back, hips, knees, ankles, elbows, and wrists. But do need to apply 4 times per day.  I have Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type III hypermobility . My ligaments and tendons are weak and has been affecting my joints, needing to have 2 neck surgeries, bunions, and wrist surgery. I switched over to the generic Diclofenac 3% gel. Let me tell you it works! Unfortunately this higher dose costs anywhere from $600.00 - $1,100.00 for a 100 Gram tube. Downside is that it's marketed for skin Actinic Keratosis.",
                    "I have rheumatoid arthritis and use Voltaren topically on my joints. This helps.",
                    "Amazing! Perfect!",
                    "After purchasing the medicine for shoulder pain I followed directions and applied 4 times a day. The second day the applied area ( upper arm and shoulder ) was turning dark. By the end of second day the arm was black swollen and painful. Emergency room visit did not provide any relief other than telling Me to discontinue use of gel. I have a artificial heart valve that requires that I take blood thinner which was discussed with the prescribing physician and had been used as prescribed. The arm continued to swell and the blackness continued down the arm with pain that became unbearable. A ambulance was summoned to take me back to the hosital emergency room personnel could not diganose the situation completely and I was admitted to the ward. Surgery was required",
                    "I did take it without food and my stomach did not like the pain like gas high in the stomach and right side pain. Given by the VA.",
                    "I started on this medication to relieve inflammation for tennis elbow. It has done a decent job on that, but it has done an amazing job in reducing pain from plantar fascitis! I've only been on it for about 3 weeks. I've noticed no side effects.",
                    "I have cervical osteoarthritis extending from C5-T1. My pain had increased to the point where I had to have two radiofrequency (RF) neurotomy procedures performed to varying degrees of success. Pain returned, so tried Percocet 5/325 2x day for a month but only provided a temporary relief until the dose would wear off. I became concerned about opiate dependency so I made the decision to stop. Started Diclofenac 75mg ('551' on one side and a fancy 'R' on the other) 1xday and had a SIGNIFICANT reduction in pain after just two days. Bloodwork shows that it does mildly elevate my liver enzymes (ALT of 60) and has slightly lowered RBC, WBC & platelets which is a common side effect. Benefits outweigh the risk at this point, so will continue.",
                    "I am an artist and a horseback rider and for the last few months have experienced a very painful case of tendinitis in my right arm. This gel works well and very quickly in my case, and with bracing and icing I have experienced a lot of relief. The nature of this pain reliever is anti inflammatory - not numbing - so I don't think you would find use for it if your pain is not of the inflammatory nature. I get spastic and tense neck muscles all the time and find heat and massages work better. So for the right purpose it is excellent stuff. I am sensitive, delicate skinned and had no allergies but I would be careful and spot test nonetheless.",
                    "I received a sample of this from my ortho hand surgeon. He said it should help while I wait for my EMG test. He wasn't lying. I have several trigger points and my right side is painful and numb due to compression from my neck and what he suspects, compression of carpal tunnel radial nerve, ulnar nerve, etc. basically everything is compressed. This patch worked wonders. Very disappointed to learn its not covered by insurance",
                    "I have arthritis is both knees from years of athletics, in my youth. I have moderate to severe pain after long standing, use or cold. The Flector Patch on my knees are perfect.

                    "Cataflam is a miracle for my period pain. I have suffered for years and wouldn't be even able to walk a few steps with the horrible pain. I've tried everything from Meftalspas to spasmoproxivonne, Brufen, Panadol, etc.. nothing works. With Cataflam in just half an hour my pain is completely gone. I take it every 8 hours in my first two days.",
                    "Occupational Health at my workplace prescribed this patch for me because I apparently strained a muscle below my patellar bone... It did nothing for me! Apparently it works for everyone else, so I may just be an oddball. It was like taking a placebo and I am not even taking other pain meds... So it's not like I have a tolerance level for pain meds... This just doesn't do anything for me. It was def. a miss. ",
                    "I was prescribed Voltaren gel for my MCP joint, which experienced remodeling of bone after my 14-year career as a deep tissue massage therapist. I am a chiropractic student, so I went the conservative route first: adjustment, ultrasound, cold laser, Alpha-stim, microcurrent probes. Finally I had a series of x-rays on campus and unfortunately, there is a large osteophyte on the volar (palm) side of the base of the 1st metacarpal, along with serious lipping of the scaphoid bone which supports it (you know this combination as the saddle joint). Voltaren helps the crippling pain of trying to unscrew a jar, open a doorknob, or hold a pen. I will however have surgery to remove the osteophyte.",
                    "The gel helps with the pain but my stomach was a little upset, I got a mild headache and I felt very drowsy and out of it. Yes I know it's the gel but I still had side effects. I only rubbed in a small amount. I can't swear by it but I think it also caused me to have several anxiety attacks which I think are related to the woozy out of it feeling. It says it makes you dizzy on the box.",
                    "I slipped a disc in my back a year ago and have been in pain ever since! After racking his brain, my doctor gave me a sample of Voltaren Gel. I didn't have high hopes, but it is WONDERFUL!  Because I have had Gastric Bypass surgery, I can not take NSAIDS which pretty much leaves me, Tylenol! I did sneak an Aleve after being in so much pain and I was so sick to my stomach. The only negative, if Im in pain and my husband isn't home, it's kind of hard to apply to my own back!!! So I think this is a WONDERFUL medication for a person who can't orally take an anti-inflammatory medication! A true life saver!",

                    "I've had chronic lower back pain for over two years (herniated disk). I can't say for sure what has relieved my pain, but ever since taking diclofenac my pain almost immediately has gone from being almost completely debilitated, to being able to function physically at the level I was at when pain started. Still have pain and not 100%, but my quality of life is back and I feel much more fluid and agile. For almost six months I could hardly get out of bed, let alone tie my shoes.",
                    "I have psoriatic arthritis with lots of foot pain. I wanted an alternative to the drugs and anti-inflammatories normally prescribed and my doctor suggested this. After reading reviews I expected this to take away the pain immediately. It didn't, but knowing that everyone is different I kept trying and I'm glad I did. Now on day three my foot pain is much better, allowing me to walk. I have had no skin reaction. The smell of the ammonia carrier can be a bit overwhelming but it dissipates quickly.",
                    "It has helped my back, but not completely eliminated pain or discomfort. The patch has greatly enhansed my quality of life, easy to use and does not cause any problems to my stomach.",
                    "Why on earth any company would add fragrance to a medicine is beyond me when so many medical facilities have gone fragrance free. Even the low level fragrance has caused nausea after a half day's use. It's either the fragrance or a reaction to the gel. Didn't make much difference in my pain level.",
                    "I fell and broke the Radial head of my elbow (have never broken anything before and I am 45 yrs old). The doctor put me on Vicodin and it did nothing for that pain, UNTIL he gave me Zipsor, I was much much better in about an hour! The only side effect was that I was a little sleepy.",
                    "I am 38 years old with 4 small kids. I've recently been diagnosed with osteoarthritis in my hips and most likely my knees. I was also having significant shoulder and heel pain. Within 2 days of starting this medication I would say I was 75% better. Now after 1 month I feel better than I have felt in years. I am amazed that 1 medication can work this well. I have not noticed any side effects.",
                    "I was prescribed Diclofenac Sodium tablets for emergency medicine regarding my Chronic Paroxsymal Hemicrania. It was ineffective at alleviating any pain. I'd feel a small reduction in pain level for about 30 minutes then it would spike back up. It caused my blood glucose to shoot up and I am non-diabetic. It also caused me a great deal of stomach cramps, burning pain below sternum, belching, heartburn and diarrhea. I had better response on Ibuprofen and that did very little.",
                    "I have been having severe back and neck pain for years and was taking ibuprofen 24 hours a day. My doctor told me that was very bad for my stomach and to use the Voltaren Gel instead and I found it to be wonderful, comfortable and it smells nice. Two days after I started using the Voltaren Gel I was so much more comfortable and now I alternate the ibuprofen 200 with the Gel and only use the Ibuprofen 200 two times a day. I can sleep a whole night. My back condition is in the muscles and and they are in spasm much of the time. Voltaren calms the spasms down and makes the pain tolerable. I am so glad to have found it.",
                    "I experienced very high levels of pain in my upper back over the course of six months, with hand tremors and trouble swallowing. Muscle and joint pain followed. Tests for many conditions are negative, including rheumatoid arthritis, but we are still looking. Diclofenac was prescribed, and over the course of two weeks, the pain faded. I felt like a human being. I did not experience negative side effects. On the contrary, I did not suffer any of my standard migraines. Unfortunately, after 8 months, the VA hospital changed vendors and the new brand of Diclofenac was not effective. In the week following the change, I suffered all previous symptoms along with a migraine and upsurge in depression symptoms. Very frustrating. Still trying to sort it out.",
                    "Unbelievable. I just used this for the first time and had relief in about 15 minutes. 13 years of pain shots 12 doctors, 2 surgeries and I put on this gel and feel so much better. For me, it is a miracle.",

                    "I began seeing my doctor for neck problems, I cannot take oral NSAID'S due to Crohns disease so my doctor suggested to try them as an alternative. I had every test run from an Ortho and Neurologist with no reasoning for my neck problems other than Fibro. Sometime the back of my neck swells around two nerves on both sides that go into my arms and head, I've tried every narcotic there is but nothing but a Flector patch helps. Recently I had a very extensive knee surgery with an 8-12 month recovery time and once the incision healed I was given the okay to use these, they helped tremendously. I now have an injury while recovering and they are my life saver once again. They are very expensive but worth every penny.",

I suffer from stiff shoulders and neck pain, caused by sitting at a computer all day, carrying a heavy laptop and purse. I used it on my neck and shoulders since it was an anti-inflammatory. It worked for me, I noticed a significant 'loosening' of my 'tight' shoulder muscles with just one application. I'm sold! I'm gonna get mom to give it another go!",

                    "My Rheumatologist prescribed the Voltaren Gel to use with my oral Meloxicam and the combination is tremendous. I am having very little pain for the first time in 3 years in my knees and feet. On a recent business trip to Germany I purchased 4 large tubes of a higher strength (over the counter in Germany and Switzerland) for 1/3 the price of my copay. A very effective drug for me.",

I was a little skeptical about a Cambia pack I got from doctor, but after 3 hours and no relief I took it and within 30 minutes it was gone. Been suffering from these for 18 years and will keep some this on hand just in case.",

                    "I think it's probably a good product but not the right medicine for my condition. I have very inflamed painful bursitis under my scapula that throws all my muscles in my back/neck out of whack and creates a lot of transferred pain and problems for me. I was hoping this Voltaren gel my rheumatologist prescribed would help since the Celebrex and muscle relaxers alone are not doing the trick. But I do not detect any difference when I use it. However, I do occasionally get soreness in my left knee and when I tried it on that, it did seem to help.",
                    "I have been dealing with extreme pain in my hip and groin area. I took one pill but never again. I first experienced drowsiness, which isn't anything to worry about until I started to not feel right in my head. Lasted for about 20 minutes. Then as I was standing in the kitchen making dinner I developed extreme nausea for about 5 minutes. This led to a rush shooting straight to my head and on came a dizzy spell that lasted for about 20 seconds. Followed by a partial black out for a split second, vision came back and I went to sit down moments later I was perfectly ok. Well besides feeling freaked out of course. I would never recommend this medicine to anyone.",

My pain specialist has done various treatments including Facet Joint Injections, with no long terms results. At my recent visit with him I was complaining of the same pain with no relief, he handed me two sample tubes of Voltaren Gel. I have been using it for about a week now and have had a full week without pain. This stuff really works. I have been impressed so far. Thanks Voltaren.",

I've used Lidocaine patches, pain management trigger point injections, and acupuncture. When my PA handed me 2 tubes of this gel, I didn't have much hope for it.

These pain patches basically feel like happiness surrounding my wrist. I still have pain but it is at a much more tolerable level. I have my life back. For me, the patches work better than pain pills. They are covered by my insurance at a higher co-pay. And, with each prescription, I have to go through this whole prior authorization wait period. Get samples from your doctor to test them out and make sure they work for you. If they do, then fight the insurance. For my wrist, I am able to cut the patches into 2 halves and makes the prescription last longer. These saved my life.",

Since I have stomach problems and am unable to take oral NSAIDs, narcotics or Ultram, I tried Lidoderm patches without success. Then I read about Voltaren gel in Arthritis Today magazine and asked my doctor for it. It has worked well and this is the only way I am able to sit without severe pain. ",
                    "Is expensive but takes the edge off. I use for L-spine DJD and combine with 300mg Neurontin for best effect.

                    "Works wonders on lower back pain but sometimes needs a narcotic pain killer or muscle relaxer for days when pain is more severe. Downside of this drug is that taking too much causes excruciating abdominal cramping and stabbing gas pains in the intestines. But it's an 8-hour pill, so pain relief usually lasts and it is not hard to space doses out since it lasts so long.",

I was prescribed Flector patches and I could not believe how much better I felt the next day. I was able to get out of bed and bend over with little to no pain. These patches are so GREAT!!!!!",
                    "This medicine really helped my back pain, but lead to a whole other problem. My stomach was damaged and I had to get a tube down my throat to check my esophagus.

I was prescribed the patches with the caveat that \"they may not work.\" They work very well and my pain has decreased between 75-90%. If I use them as directed (1 every 12hrs) they are most effective. There are some issues with the adhesive on the edges but I've found if I warm them with my hand they stick better. True, there is very little movement of fabric over the area as with back issues. I work with a personal trainer 5 days a week so the leg gets a lot of use. Mine is an unusual use for these patches, but they are definitely worth a try.",

I should have looked further (http://www.drugs.com/cdi/voltaren-gel-gel.html). The maker (Novartis) issued a warning letter in December, noting problems. Looks like I'll still be getting my Hyalgen shot on Friday. I will follow up with my Doc(I used a free-sample) and go from there. I have liver tests every 6 months due to blood pressure medicines and the beer I drink too much of. I hope I will be able take this medicine safely: it sure does work.",

My Rheumatologist gave me a script this past week for Diclofenac Sod EC 75 mg tab 2x day. It is my miracle! Absolutely NO pain, bones, joints, skin, muscles, anywhere!

A friend turned me on to Voltaren Gel . I used it on my knees, neck, and lower back. This is as close to a miracle as I have experienced in my 50 years of arthritis producing activities. The best part is that dosing is applied directly and only to the problem areas so consequently much less ends up in your system overall than if taken orally. Win. Win.",

I have taken other anti inflamitories before but they didn't seem to help but this drug has been fantastic. I have been able to work out again and it has really reduced the amount of knee and ankle pain I get. I take two 75 mgs tablets a day and have not had any side effects and I have been taking it for about 3 months. I would recommend this drug to anyone who has arthritis pain",

After using for 2 days, the pain is diminished and movement of the forearm, grasping with the fingers, and range of motion is very near back to normal with very little pain. I work on a computer all day, typing and mousing. I apply 2 grams, 4 times a day to the elbow area. It makes working very tolerable. I would say Voltaren is a good treatment and really helps bring my arm function back to normal with no pain for tendonitis / Tennis Elbow. Aspercreme was also ok, but the Voltaren does better. Mild stretching, exercise and movement also help and are made much easier with the Voltaren.",

Since then quality of life has not been good, and the only relief from pain was Diclofenac, which settled things down in 1-2 days. Now told it was being discouraged from use, so taken off it. All the alternatives have not worked, so persuaded a new Rhumatologist to re-instate it for short while and life was good again. I had no side effects from this drug.

I have tried numerous pain medicines and although I did not have any noticeable side effects with the Zipsor, it did no more for me than taking 2 Aleves. Maybe because my pain is bone related with the addition of torn cartilage and nerve problems? Glad that it works so well for some. Anything to get off of narcotic medicines and the crutches pre-op would be nice! So, for me and my dysplasia Zipsor has not been the miracle I was hoping for.",

It also helps my very sore feet, probably plantar fasciatis.  I don't know why they did not give this to me earlier, its much more effective than oral NSAID's or even Vicodin, as this works faster, much faster.  I use it less often than recommended (up to 4 times a day), because its not needed. Once or twice a day for me relieves the pain, pronto. It also helps my wife, with her osteoarthritis pain.",

If I get up walk around for a few minutes sometimes the pain vanishes. Otherwise I apply Voltaren gel- about the size of a small grape over the sore place and the pain goes away pretty quickly. I occasionally apply Voltaren ahead of time if I know I'm going to be on my feet a lot. ",

The Voltaren Gel also helps with the bone pain I get along my temples and at the base of my skull, so I am thankful that it is a non-greasy gel instead of a cream. (These areas of pain come from a compression head injury I got as a teenager.) I have a lot of problems trying to take anything for the arthritis in oral form, and I still take Aciphex along with using the Voltaren Gel as a precaution. (This product works well with even less than the amount suggested, so a tube goes further for me; I use up about 1 1/2 tubes each month.)",

They charge hundreds of dollars for only nine powders. The actual drug of Diclofenac Potassium is cheap and you get a 30 day supply. I just crushed the pill into a powder and took with water just like the Cambia...worked just as fast and tasted better, because it had NO taste. Don't be fooled by the makers of Cambia. It is just another Epi Pen scandal story.",

Used in conjunction with my other medicines it has helped me to put together a medication regime that helps me to live with this condition. If you have tried oral medicines with negative side effects, please give VOLTAREN a try. I hope you find the relief that I have.",

I was taking lortab every day, one or two, in the later part of the day to make it through. I used one inch of Votaren Gel where I have the residual arthritis and covered it and taped it. After two hours I went for a walk and was able to walk farther in the same amount of time and without as bad of a limp. This morning my foot was tender. I don't think I will use it when my foot is really sore. I have learned to back off or pay for it the next day. There is always a trade off when I try to medicate this kind of pain.",

I had 3 epidurals in the space of about 3-4 months with no relief. I swapped pain management doctors and am now on 15mg of oxycodone every 6 hours, 4mg Zanaflex every 8 hours, 500mg of Naproxen every 12 hours, 40mg Celexa once a day and 600mg of Neurontin every 8 hours just to sort of be able to function.

Two more doses the next day but then had to discontinue due to the unacceptable side-effects: heart palpitations, hot flushes, restlessness, minor anxiety. But I must state here though for you that I can hardly tolerate Ibuprofen or any NSAID pain-killer for that matter, of late that is. Earlier, I'd tolerate medicines like sweets, but after taking Ciprofloxacin 14 months ago, and that has messed up my whole system: I've even developed a number of food intolerances as well.

I've tried 3 different prescription medications and they did nothing. The second day on this medication I started getting some relief in my back. It's not 100% gone but it really eases my pain. The unfortunate side effect with any nsaid is thin blood resulting in bruising. I have a bleeding autoimmune disorder so it's not the best combo. But I feel like as a first there's promising relief. I hope it continues.",

However, I JUST had an \"ah ha\" moment as to the mysterious, very itchy rash I have developed. The application areas reacted in the intense heat. Last summer while gardening I developed a severe lower back rash which I assumed was somehow sweat related. This year I developed the same painful, itchy rash on my right upper back (deltoid area and shoulder) down to my lower arm. Again, I thought it was from the heat and sweat. As I was applying it yesterday, I realized it was being applied directly on top of my rash. The ONLY places I have my rash. It took me long enough!!

After using Voltaren gel 2-3 times a day, after just 2 days pain was greatly reduced. And if there is any pain, it's only about a level 3 or 4. Have recently started using it on knees.

It burns her and she refuses to use it so she gave me a tube for my arthritis in both my knees, my hip, back and ankles. WOW! This is a dream come true. It seems to work immediately for me and putting it on right before bed allows me to sleep all night because I have slight to no pain. I wake up, use it and then my day goes by MUCH better. I'm going to try to remember to actually take it to work with me so I can apply it there. I keep forgetting. Praise God for allowing me to try this gel. I was leery at first but tried it anyway.

Pain was bad with little improvement the past 2 months, even with rehab/exercises and Vicodin and later Mobic (Meloxicam) and finally Motrin. Nothing worked. Couldn't sleep, constant ache from shoulder into my bicep. Rather than get a Cortisone shot yesterday, the doctor suggested I try a sample of the Flector Patch. I wore it last night and finally experienced some relief. I'd say the pain is about 75% better, and I managed to get some sleep. ",

Went to the doctor after a week of pain and not much healing taking place to make sure I didn't suffer any major ligament damage. He diagnosed the IT band issue and gave some samples of Flector Patch and as more of a comic relief, stated that \"these really shouldn't work, but actually do\". Was a little skeptical at first, but these patches do provide wonderful relief. Four patches later I am feeling much improvement in the mobility of my knee strain. Definitely worth a try.",

My doctor put me on this 2 years ago, 50mg once a day, and I honestly don't think I would survive the summer without it. One of my major problems I was getting out of bed in the morning, I couldn't even roll over the pain was so bad. So basically what I do is set my alarm 1/2 hour earlier so I can take it and let it work a little bit before I have to be up and out. I went from having to take so many days off of work to feeling so much relief. Since Physical Therapy didn't work for me, I will probably continue to take this as long as I have pain.",

I get super stiff behind my knee, and it makes it hard to even walk, or straighten my leg all the way. I take ibuprofen, I ice it...and that helps some. I woke up this morning with it being extremely stiff behind my knee. I applied Pennsaid all over the back and front of my knee. No kidding - within 5 minutes, most of that stiffness is GONE. I am in shock. And if you have knee pain, you know how debilitating it can feel. This stuff is INSANE - in a good way!! I'm so glad I have it. I literally can't believe how much it helped me. And no, I don't work for a pharmaceutical company.",

I have not been overly impressed with either thus far. But I have noticed a little less stiffness and some range of motion. But in fairness the inflammation is no doubt very deep in both joints and would take time for the medicine to hit its target area. The Dr told me to give it time which I felt was reasonable. I find the gel to have a pleasant smell and rubs in nice and dries pretty quick. I am using the Voltaren Gel that says, diclofenac sodium topical gel 1%. Don't quote me but I believe they also make it with 2% diclofenac sodium?? With ins my cost was 42.00 for 5 tubes. Greasing both knees uses a lot",

I did not expect such a good result or any result, I was just so fed up I grabbed a tube to mix up with the oral meds! It's helped my sleep in a matter of days and I'm much more comfortable.

After the physical therapy was finished I was experiencing sharp pain radiating from my shoulder to my neck. I asked my doctor at the time, a rheumatoligist, if this was arthritis now coming from the shoulder. He gave me a tube of Voltaren Gel to try and it has been wonderful.

We have had no side effects and we use it for major flare-ups as it is not intended for long term daily use. We each get a big tube, even though some might find it pricey, you don't have to use a lot it lasts a long time. The relief it provides is priceless. You should not take it with oral anti-inflammatories and ask a doctor before use if you have any medical conditions and/or take medications (even natural remedies). Great product.",
                    "I was in a large amount of pain because of a bruised rib cage, it hurt to move, breathe, walk... well do almost anything. I don't like narcotic drugs because they just mute pain, and pain is your body's natural feedback loop, saying \"Hey, don't move that way... I'm still broken\"  I am on a 75mg dose, and within hours I could breathe and move much better- magical stuff. Pain is still there, but more like a sore muscle at this point... not like the sharp barbed wire in my chest feeling it had been. I have been eating with every dose, the doctor told me that this can be pretty harsh on your stomach if you are not careful. Hopefully I can decease my dose in a week. This is like a sledgehammer to inflamed tissue. No ill effects.",

Pain and swelling have been reduced, but not totally gone. I'd have to say I'm happy with the result as it has enabled me to keep working, but side effects are troublesome: I get headaches close to migraine level, my vision is so blurred sometimes, I'm VERY groggy in the morning and have a hard time getting out of bed, and the ringing in my ears has gotten worse.

He found what was wrong just by my x-ray, my hip was about an inch off hitting a nerve. Now I can work again, not 100% but 4 year's suffering to being able to walk somewhat normal is great. Still need meds for pain but way less. If nothing else helps try a chiropractor. Don't wait 4 year's to go. If it don't help in a month stop going its not going to.",

Unfortunately, I found out that it is supposed to work to relieve the pain each time it is used. It certainly doesn't do this for me--I may as well be applying lotion for all the good it does me. It really does nothing at all. I'm really disappointed, as my pain management doctor just weaned me off of narcotics, so I don't have anything that helps with the pain at the moment.

                    "I've been having all over muscle and joint pain. I tried everything OTC and nothing helped. Saw a rheumatologist who prescribed diclofenac. The next day my pain was greatly diminished and I was able to use my left arm again! The itching I was experiencing before this medicine has intensified over the past week. Don't know if that's a side effect. I didn't take it at all today and the pain is unbearable. Calling doctor in the morning.",
                    "This is a miracle! I've had migraines since I was 6, diagnosed with chronic daily migraines when I was 14 and have not been able to find a reprieve from the pain. On a scale of 1 to 10 my pain is usually around a 4 on a good day and a 8 or 9 on a bad one. On a bad day I take a dose of Cambia and an Imitrex subcutaneous injection and it completely knocks out my migraine! In all my years of having migraines I never thought that was possible. Even when I don't take the injection the Cambia alone brings a level 8 migraine down to a 3 which is manageable.",
                    "I was given Toradol for five days post operation (which is another wonderful medication) and Loratab to take along with it. I never had the need or desire to take the latter. But after Toradol was gone (I was able to stretch it over nine days) I still needed something else.  I began to take Naproxen over-the counter strength and the pain and stiffness gradually came back. I had Cataflam, which after 2-3 dosages, controlled the discomfort that was building up. ",

I have been on this med for 5 days now. It helped with the pain, but I don't know if I can deal with the side effects of muscle aches, irritability, weakness, fatigue,stomach issues. It is seeming like the side effects are winning. I can not continue to take this medication. I will be contacting my Dr. and giving him the details and will need to try something else, does anyone have any suggestions on a different medication?",
                    "I was in agony for weeks and barely able to walk. Absolutely nothing stopped my sciatica pain, and I tried everything. Within one hour of taking Zipsor the pain was gone. I don't know what's in it, but it literally saved my life. Thank you for your wonderful product.",

It is a fast acting medication, so you can apply it and get on with activities right away. The cost of the medicine is high, but if you have tried products such as aspercreme, biofreeze or joint flex. You will see that the cost and relief you get are directly related. I have and will continue to recommend this medicine to anyone who needs relief from osteoarthritis. Thanks for the help NOVARTIS.",

Take pills 75mg 2 X daily, for 2-3 days, then go off of them until I cannot tolerate the pain. Last time I took Voltaren was in mid March, now it's mid April. Very happy.",

I would sleep at night and could barely move certain ways without the pain and almost wanting to cry. I found out i have an enlarged blood vessel in my heart and that's what the pain was from. Being 23 I shouldn't be having this pain but after the 2nd day on this it helped me so much and I can actually get up and go on with my day with no pain. (Thank goodness).",

It doesn't take the pain 100% away but it reduces it to a low enough level that I can sleep. Without it I am up for hours twitching and wiggling trying to find comfort after s a long dayday. The scent is mild after a few minutes, and so is my pain level. After a particularly painful day I may apply twice. I don't need this every day so a tube will last me several months, at $30 each tube it does add up but since I don't need it nightly I manage the expense.",

I expected same relief with fewer side effects (s-e's)--possible s-e's turn out to be same. Have used for only 24 hours with some pain relief. But try cutting these in half and wrapping around thumb down to lower joint, surprised they stay on fairly well but they are ugly white, I can't wear out of the house. Besides, nowhere does it say they are for arthritis pain, just minor aches, sprains, strains etc. Afraid to use continually or long term due to s-e's. Terribly expensive for just an NSAID with terrible potential side-effects. (1 box with insurance $140, on retirement)",

My other sisters always need to take Caraflam. So when I couldn't bear the cramps anymore I took it, it started working about an hour later, I didn't feel painful anymore. Even though my sisters are pharmacists, they always told me that the less medicines I take, the better it would be. So I tried not to use it. It was the worst ever, I took one, it didn't work well when it reached the max of pain. I threw up and took another one. After an hour, it worked.  So if you decide to use Caraflam, take it before it's painful.",

Doctor put me on voltaren one week ago. So far I have been pain free. Still have swelling in joints but the morning stiffness and pain is gone. Gave it an 8 rating since I have only been on the drug for 1 week. Have experienced some acid reflux and sleepiness during the day. I don't know if it is because of the medicine or other problem.",

I had been receiving pain shots for years to relieve the muscle pain that in turn caused me to have migraine/tension headaches more than 15 days per month.

Was prescribed Dicloflex (Diclofenac sodium in UK) in 3 x 50mg tablets a day. Didn't seem to make a lot of difference the first day, so I continued using Paracetamol codeine for pain relief. Today I've been a lot more comfortable - it seems like it took three doses to get started. I was even able to yawn earlier and I spent a little time sleeping lying down this morning - both of which would've been impossible yesterday.",

My opiate pain medication helps so much but in between doses I use the cream to get by. Without it I can't function at a normal level and it hurts to bad to cook, shower, or do any basic activity. I have had no side effects. Although after I shave it burns to put it on my knees but that's just because I had just shaved.",

Hope it works for you..",

A year later I woke up one morning with a stiff neck. I thought nothing of it and went to a trampoline park where I came down with a thud on my bum. No biggie, I'm pretty resilient at 32. The next day I had excruciating pain in my upper left back, neck and shoulder. My muscle at the collar bone was cramped tight! I waited 2 weeks and there was little relief, no sleep. I found my Diclofenac and it helped in an hour! NO PAIN! I slept for a full night! I see doc tomorrow for an MRI and diagnosis.",

Note: I don't want to over state the how effective it is but it works. Talking to my doctor about the pain. He gave me this to try. Well my 1st thought was \"just another snake oil\" But it'sfreak'in amazing, it works like magic. Why did I not recive this years ago. The Drugest gave me a stupid look.

If your doctor has you on Celebrex and you don't feel any relief, ask him for Voltaren. You will most certainly feel the difference. If you are on it for any length of time (like me) then every so often you'll have to have blood work done to check your kidneys and liver to make sure they are functioning right as this medicine can cause problems with that.

The patches helped somewhat. Now I have some pain for stepping up workouts on the shoulder, and I can place the patch directly on the pain area, and it's working wonderfully. The patch has a kind of numbing feeling, and overall the feeling can be compared to what ibuprofen does in reducing inflammation. The patches can make me a little sleepy.

You should not be expecting this gel to completely alleviate back pain. It's not supposed to do that. It's supposed to get your muscles to a place where you can do other things more easily to attain painlessness via a combined effort. For a lot of back pain, if you use the gel in conjunction with consistent stretching (twice daily) whilst consuming the correct diet and being active enough to lower your body weight, you will be in a much better place in no time - so be encouraged! The gel really helps you do the things you need to do physically to get to that place.",

Worst episodes included my inability to pick up a coffee cup with my left hand, pain level of 7, inability to sleep on my left side etc.  After 6 months of this, I visited my G.P who x-rayed my shoulder and found arthritic changes.

If you're having trouble with it adhering to the skin, make sure the area is free from oils, either naturally or lotions or soap residue. I have no problems at all with them. My RA flared up in addition to my cocyx broken off, literally. The pain was so severe that oral meds weren't effective. It took several days to feel the beginning of relief, and I've improved steadily. If you've used these short term and are the impatient type, chill out and give them a chance. They do work.",

I'm now 80% better and changing the patch every 12 hours as prescribed to me. The first day (for whatever reason), I got a surge of energy when I first put on the patch. The pain subsided to about a level 3 from a level 6 after wearing it for just a few short hours.  Do not stop wearing the patch as the pain will come back quickly. I did have to supplement the pain with additional meds after I did some light home repairs (despite the the warnings) and this kept the pain level down.",

In that year I have had total knee replacement (left knee), then two more \"revisions\" on the same knee to get rid of an infection. Just weeks ago, I came to the conclusion that Celebrex just wasn't getting the job done for my pain, and of course I did not want to take narcotics. I did a lot of research (the reviews on this site were immensely helpful) and decided to give Diclofenac a try. It has been fantastic, and I feel better than I have in years.",

The surgeries did help- but still have pain, burning, & pins and needles sensation in neck, shoulders & arms. Burning pain in hips, and muscular soreness through out my back. I've been on pain meds for years and wasn't getting a lot of relief. I discussed with my MD and he ordered Voltaren Gel. I can't say enough how much relief I receive from this medicine.

First sign was extreme itching and severe sweating with dizziness. If this happens go to hospital quickly and stop taking the drug. When this started Doctors can't always determine it quickly enough as in my case. Second time wasn't as severe but by the third time when my reactions started I knew.

My pain is considerably better, but I am guessing/hoping from the procedure, not from the Zipsor. I am having terrible stomach problems, that are outweighing what I am guessing the pain relief to be.

I use along with oxycodone and muscle relaxers and honestly think I get more relief from the patches. They are just so expensive I can only fill my prescription once my deductible is met for the year and even then I have to download a coupon. My cost for a full month is about $70.

I also do botox migraine every three months. I not only suffer with common symptoms, debilitating headache, nausea, light/sound sensitivities, I also have numbness, unilateral paralysis, and even blindness. I've tried most approved treatments, including \"off label\" medications, with ranging levels of relief.  I've yet to find a preventative aka \"miracle drug\", although, botox has effectively reduced the number of my \"headache\" days. At any rate, my migraine specialist gave me samples of Cambia at last visit and today I remembered I had it. It quickly took a level 9 to a level 3.",
                    "I have tried a dozen different medications but none as effective as this. I tried Celebrex last year and was in so much pain after three days I went back to my Voltaren. I take 100mg twice a day that helps me work and function normally.",

But I noticed weeks later, severe back pain that affected my ability to stand for a long period of time without feeling light headed from the pain. No over the counter pain killers helped. When my doctor prescribed me this, it immediately went away. The only side effect I've experienced is feeling fatigued. Like most medications, though, my tolerance for it has built up quickly. And when I don't take it, the pain catches up on me quickly. It's difficult for me to get out of bed if I go more than a day without it. So I'd recommend doing exercises/stretches and don't just depend on it forever.",

I swear it's like not taking anything at all. At first I thought it had taken the edge off the cramps, but at 12 hours almost to the dot it wore off, so I took a second, which isn't doing anything. Will try this again next month when I can start taking it in advance of the pain, but as of right now this has been a completely useless medication.",

After having a large mass removed from my leg, the knee got worse and was swollen until I couldn't walk without a cane or walker. I went to the doctor to see if I could get a shot to help me walk and he gave me a tube of Voltaran Gel to use. I came home, put it on the knee and propped my leg up for an hour. When I was ready to get up, I dreaded it because I just knew I was going to be in horrible pain again. But, the pain was almost all gone. I couldn't believe that a simple gel could have that effect so fast but, it did! This product is worth its weight in gold! No cane for two days now!",

I used this gel for about 2 months twice daily on the lip. I must mention that there absolutely no effect of this medication on my lip. A total waste of money if you don't have insurance as it can be quite expensive without it.  Then I was prescribed all sort of other creams which was nothing but a waste of money on moisturizers. Don't feel bad to question the dermatologist as to what the cream does and whether it will cure you. The most essential treatment for single or isolated AKs is cryotherapy - liquid nitrogen spray.",

No one can really tell or know when you have went too far because you are suppose to hurt and be in pain. If you are in pain, it means that your body muscles are stretching and you are making room for more muscles to fit. Many people don't understand that when you go home then that's when the adrenaline wears off and you start to think \"I went a little too far that time\".  Since most of what I do is shoulder press, I have to say that this back patch for pain has saved me from several night where I wouldn't have been able to sleep. Absorbine Jr pain patches for back work quickly, absorb fast, and give me pain relief fast no matter what."

There are so many people allergic also someone like me with cancer and very sore and nauseated to spend money on this and it made me so sick I washed up 4 times and my hands and skin still smells strong. It gave me a headache and made my nausea worse. There is no need for perfume not to mention it's just an toxic unnecessary ingredient.

Before this experiment I would take 3 or 4 ibuprofen for one of these headaches and hope for the best. The gel is now my standard treatment for these headaches.",

In desperation and since I have a type of neuropathy in my feet and cannot fall asleep, I applied 1/2 the dosage she was prescribed. To my surprise it allows me to fall asleep at night without the pain and discomfort in my feet. I will be seeing my doctor to get this prescribed for me! I have been looking for relief for over 5 years!",

When I injured My shoulder, I remembered that had the Voltaren so I figured it couldn't hurt to try it. WOW!! AMAZING!! Nothing I have tried orally can even come close to the Voltaren. It is like a miracle. I have never found any medication for anything that was more effective. I guess it just works better for some injuries than others. It is , however, very short acting. But the pain relief it provides is priceless. I have arthritis in my hands, I don't find it helps with that pain. For the certain types of injury it works better than narcotic medication.

It used to just act up at bedtime, so bad at times that I had to wrap my feet in ice packs to get relief. Now it's all hours & hands/feet and I have a stiffness and severe putting edema that pops up & then disappears with no regularity. There's no explanation from Doctor's YET. I was given this cream and I rub it into my hands, wrists, feet, & lower legs. It does seem to calm things some, reduces the burn.",

I received the generic Diclofenac 50 mg. and was very excited about receiving any kind of help making it through a migraine which sometimes lasts 8 days, sometimes 2 days. Anyway, I took it three times a day the first two days and sporadically for another two or three days. It worked very well much to my surprise; however, after that I experienced the stomach burn I read someone else experienced. I didn't realize what had caused the burning until I read the reviews on this med. I'm a little afraid to take it again unless I just take it one or two days next time. Try it.",

While it is stated it is not approved for spinal use, I have found Voltaren extremely beneficial. While I still have pain in the neighborhood of an 8 out of 10, I feel that it would always be a 10 without Voltaren. Many thanks to my PA for recommending it.",

Here's the best part though. I have a bulge in my lower back. I have meloxacam but I don't take it regularly because I feel that it don't help any. So one day my back is as hurting really bad so I decided to apply the gel. Glad I did because wow! It works amazing! They should most definitely test it on the back. I know surgery will be the only thing for permanent relief but I'm only 31 and one can't afford it and two it's not guarantee it would work and could make my problem worse. Next time I go to my doctor I will be asking for my own prescription.",
                    "The first time my doctor suggested Voltaren cream. I have osteo in both knees, right ankle and my spine. After several tubes and no reduction of pain or swelling my doctor suggested Pennsaid . The difference was like day and night. Not only did it reduce the pain but the swelling in my ankle was also reduced. When I investigated both products I was shocked to find that only Pennsaid contains a delivery agent DMSO that Voltaren does not . So it seems the DMSO delivers directly into the joint while the Voltaren only stays on the skin. Bottom line I will never spend my money on anything else going forward ....Pennsaid works for me.",
                    "I love this gel. Just 10 seconds after I put it on an area with severe pain, the pain is gone completely for 2 hours. I couldn't believe it the first time I used it. I take some other strong prescription medication for knee and back pain and the medications don't do as good a job on the pain as this gel. I wish I could use it more than 4 times a day, but during my waking hours, it is a God send. Thank you, thank you, thank you! I would do a commercial for Voltaren Gel anytime, for free!",

The combination provided no discernible pain relief. However, I did suffer from significant stomach and intestinal pain. The stomach & intestinal pain stopped within 12 hours of discontinuing the Zipsor. Overall, not a pleasant experience.",
                    "I had tried Lidoderm and had fair to good results. I was reluctant to try the Flector because of the cost. My insurance did not cover them.  In an impulsive act due to frustration with pain, I got the script filled. Within 2 hours I noticed that the severe pain in my knee was almost gone, and I slept very well through the night. These are a miracle and work as well as or better than any systemic medicine including narcotics. They really do work. ",

                    "My doctor prescribed Voltaren after an extremely painful IUD insertion and subsequent cramping. I've never had cramps like these before. I'd literally be curled up in the fetal position, unable to even talk. Depending on the level of pain, this either completely eradicated it or made it totally bearable, and lasted for 12 hours at a stretch. Voltaren is wonderful and I'm glad my doctor recommended it over a narcotic painkiller.",

I also have bursitis & piriformis syndrome in my right hip as well as achilles tendonitis in the right foot. I take 75mg 2 times a day. My knees are so bad that I had to have Synvisc-One injections as well. Combined I have been able to work my 12 hr shifts as an RN. I still have pain that's about a 6-7 after working three 12's in a row, but would not be able to work at all without the Voltaren. I am looking to have my knees replaced in the near future. The only side effect I have had is stomach upset if I do not take it with food and some mild constipation. I would recommend this medicine to anyone. ",
                    "This medication has been a God send for me. After PT and a year of Aleve my shoulder was somewhat better but not great. For a different issue my physician told me to stop the Aleve and try Diclofanac Sodium. My body is very happy. No back, neck, ankle, toe, shoulder pain. My shoulder range of motion is almost 100%.

I've been using the patch for 3 days and have noticed a marked improvement in the amount of pain. Based on other reviews with issues of sticking, I use veterinary wrap to hold it in place. I've since called my podiatrist asking for a full prescription based on the relief I already feel.",
                    "This medicine is pretty miraculous as far as my joints are concerned. I'm using much less than the 2gram dose - maybe 1/4 to 1/2 a gram on a joint, tops - and having at least 8 hours pain free. It seems no studies were conducted on it's use on shoulders, but it worked decently enough for mine when I pinched a nerve.  Make sure you read the possible side effects and all the potential negatives, and test on a single area with someone with you for a couple hours just to make sure you're not allergic. It's been problem-free for me, but everyone's body chemistry is different.",

Diclofenac does not relieve all of my pain, but it relieves 60-70 percent of it, or enough to allow me to have a life. For me it appears to be safe and effective. The only side -effect I've experienced is occasional mild constipation. I recommend it highly.",

It does tend to make me feel a little weird-my nerves feel over sensitive. But I got a migraine around 8am today took cambia! And on my way to work at 12:30pm! Miracle!",
                    "My doctor gave me 3 samples of Pennsaid while waiting on the prescription. I don't understand any of these reviews. It does absolutely nothing for me. I was in a car accident and it appears I may have partially torn a ligament in my wrist. Maybe I was misdiagnosed and this is just the wrong medication for that? My doctor told me it would help the inflammation but all the reviews I've read are claiming \"pain relief\"? Thankfully I had the samples before I was forced to spend upwards of $75.00 for this useless medication.",

But do need to apply 4 times per day.  I have Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type III hypermobility . My ligaments and tendons are weak and has been affecting my joints, needing to have 2 neck surgeries, bunions, and wrist surgery. I switched over to the generic Diclofenac 3% gel. Let me tell you it works! Unfortunately this higher dose costs anywhere from $600.00 - $1,100.00 for a 100 Gram tube. Downside is that it's marketed for skin Actinic Keratosis.",

By the end of second day the arm was black swollen and painful. Emergency room visit did not provide any relief other than telling Me to discontinue use of gel. I have a artificial heart valve that requires that I take blood thinner which was discussed with the prescribing physician and had been used as prescribed. The arm continued to swell and the blackness continued down the arm with pain that became unbearable. A ambulance was summoned to take me back to the hosital emergency room personnel could not diganose the situation completely and I was admitted to the ward. Surgery was required",

My pain had increased to the point where I had to have two radiofrequency (RF) neurotomy procedures performed to varying degrees of success. Pain returned, so tried Percocet 5/325 2x day for a month but only provided a temporary relief until the dose would wear off. I became concerned about opiate dependency so I made the decision to stop. Started Diclofenac 75mg ('551' on one side and a fancy 'R' on the other) 1xday and had a SIGNIFICANT reduction in pain after just two days. Bloodwork shows that it does mildly elevate my liver enzymes (ALT of 60) and has slightly lowered RBC, WBC & platelets which is a common side effect. Benefits outweigh the risk at this point, so will continue.",

This gel works well and very quickly in my case, and with bracing and icing I have experienced a lot of relief. The nature of this pain reliever is anti inflammatory - not numbing - so I don't think you would find use for it if your pain is not of the inflammatory nature. I get spastic and tense neck muscles all the time and find heat and massages work better. So for the right purpose it is excellent stuff. I am sensitive, delicate skinned and had no allergies but I would be careful and spot test nonetheless.",

This patch worked wonders. Very disappointed to learn its not covered by insurance",

Apparently it works for everyone else, so I may just be an oddball. It was like taking a placebo and I am not even taking other pain meds... So it's not like I have a tolerance level for pain meds... This just doesn't do anything for me. It was def. a miss. ",

I am a chiropractic student, so I went the conservative route first: adjustment, ultrasound, cold laser, Alpha-stim, microcurrent probes. Finally I had a series of x-rays on campus and unfortunately, there is a large osteophyte on the volar (palm) side of the base of the 1st metacarpal, along with serious lipping of the scaphoid bone which supports it (you know this combination as the saddle joint). Voltaren helps the crippling pain of trying to unscrew a jar, open a doorknob, or hold a pen. I will however have surgery to remove the osteophyte.",
                    "The gel helps with the pain but my stomach was a little upset, I got a mild headache and I felt very drowsy and out of it. Yes I know it's the gel but I still had side effects. I only rubbed in a small amount. I can't swear by it but I think it also caused me to have several anxiety attacks which I think are related to the woozy out of it feeling. It says it makes you dizzy on the box.",

I didn't have high hopes, but it is WONDERFUL!  Because I have had Gastric Bypass surgery, I can not take NSAIDS which pretty much leaves me, Tylenol! I did sneak an Aleve after being in so much pain and I was so sick to my stomach. The only negative, if Im in pain and my husband isn't home, it's kind of hard to apply to my own back!!! So I think this is a WONDERFUL medication for a person who can't orally take an anti-inflammatory medication! A true life saver!",

I can't say for sure what has relieved my pain, but ever since taking diclofenac my pain almost immediately has gone from being almost completely debilitated, to being able to function physically at the level I was at when pain started. Still have pain and not 100%, but my quality of life is back and I feel much more fluid and agile. For almost six months I could hardly get out of bed, let alone tie my shoes.",

After reading reviews I expected this to take away the pain immediately. It didn't, but knowing that everyone is different I kept trying and I'm glad I did. Now on day three my foot pain is much better, allowing me to walk. I have had no skin reaction. The smell of the ammonia carrier can be a bit overwhelming but it dissipates quickly.",

Even the low level fragrance has caused nausea after a half day's use. It's either the fragrance or a reaction to the gel. Didn't make much difference in my pain level.",

I have not noticed any side effects.",

I'd feel a small reduction in pain level for about 30 minutes then it would spike back up. It caused my blood glucose to shoot up and I am non-diabetic. It also caused me a great deal of stomach cramps, burning pain below sternum, belching, heartburn and diarrhea. I had better response on Ibuprofen and that did very little.",
                    "I have been having severe back and neck pain for years and was taking ibuprofen 24 hours a day. My doctor told me that was very bad for my stomach and to use the Voltaren Gel instead and I found it to be wonderful, comfortable and it smells nice. Two days after I started using the Voltaren Gel I was so much more comfortable and now I alternate the ibuprofen 200 with the Gel and only use the Ibuprofen 200 two times a day. I can sleep a whole night. My back condition is in the muscles and and they are in spasm much of the time. Voltaren calms the spasms down and makes the pain tolerable. I am so glad to have found it.",

Tests for many conditions are negative, including rheumatoid arthritis, but we are still looking. Diclofenac was prescribed, and over the course of two weeks, the pain faded. I felt like a human being. I did not experience negative side effects. On the contrary, I did not suffer any of my standard migraines. Unfortunately, after 8 months, the VA hospital changed vendors and the new brand of Diclofenac was not effective. In the week following the change, I suffered all previous symptoms along with a migraine and upsurge in depression symptoms. Very frustrating. Still trying to sort it out.",
                    "Unbelievable. I just used this for the first time and had relief in about 15 minutes. 13 years of pain shots 12 doctors, 2 surgeries and I put on this gel and feel so much better. For me, it is a miracle.",

Sometime the back of my neck swells around two nerves on both sides that go into my arms and head, I've tried every narcotic there is but nothing but a Flector patch helps. Recently I had a very extensive knee surgery with an 8-12 month recovery time and once the incision healed I was given the okay to use these, they helped tremendously. I now have an injury while recovering and they are my life saver once again. They are very expensive but worth every penny.",

I have very inflamed painful bursitis under my scapula that throws all my muscles in my back/neck out of whack and creates a lot of transferred pain and problems for me. I was hoping this Voltaren gel my rheumatologist prescribed would help since the Celebrex and muscle relaxers alone are not doing the trick. But I do not detect any difference when I use it. However, I do occasionally get soreness in my left knee and when I tried it on that, it did seem to help.",

I first experienced drowsiness, which isn't anything to worry about until I started to not feel right in my head. Lasted for about 20 minutes. Then as I was standing in the kitchen making dinner I developed extreme nausea for about 5 minutes. This led to a rush shooting straight to my head and on came a dizzy spell that lasted for about 20 seconds. Followed by a partial black out for a split second, vision came back and I went to sit down moments later I was perfectly ok. Well besides feeling freaked out of course. I would never recommend this medicine to anyone.",

At my recent visit with him I was complaining of the same pain with no relief, he handed me two sample tubes of Voltaren Gel.

These pain patches basically feel like happiness surrounding my wrist. I still have pain but it is at a much more tolerable level. I have my life back. For me, the patches work better than pain pills. They are covered by my insurance at a higher co-pay. And, with each prescription, I have to go through this whole prior authorization wait period. Get samples from your doctor to test them out and make sure they work for you. If they do, then fight the insurance. For my wrist, I am able to cut the patches into 2 halves and makes the prescription last longer. These saved my life.",

I was prescribed the patches with the caveat that \"they may not work.\" They work very well and my pain has decreased between 75-90%. If I use them as directed (1 every 12hrs) they are most effective. There are some issues with the adhesive on the edges but I've found if I warm them with my hand they stick better. True, there is very little movement of fabric over the area as with back issues. I work with a personal trainer 5 days a week so the leg gets a lot of use. Mine is an unusual use for these patches, but they are definitely worth a try.",

A friend turned me on to Voltaren Gel . I used it on my knees, neck, and lower back. This is as close to a miracle as I have experienced in my 50 years of arthritis producing activities. The best part is that dosing is applied directly and only to the problem areas so consequently much less ends up in your system overall than if taken orally. Win. Win.",

I have taken other anti inflamitories before but they didn't seem to help but this drug has been fantastic. I have been able to work out again and it has really reduced the amount of knee and ankle pain I get. I take two 75 mgs tablets a day and have not had any side effects and I have been taking it for about 3 months. I would recommend this drug to anyone who has arthritis pain",

I work on a computer all day, typing and mousing. I apply 2 grams, 4 times a day to the elbow area. It makes working very tolerable. I would say Voltaren is a good treatment and really helps bring my arm function back to normal with no pain for tendonitis / Tennis Elbow. Aspercreme was also ok, but the Voltaren does better. Mild stretching, exercise and movement also help and are made much easier with the Voltaren.",

Since then quality of life has not been good, and the only relief from pain was Diclofenac, which settled things down in 1-2 days. Now told it was being discouraged from use, so taken off it. All the alternatives have not worked, so persuaded a new Rhumatologist to re-instate it for short while and life was good again. I had no side effects from this drug. When a flare up occurs I take 2 in the day 75mg and everything quietens down, then it may be weeks before another attack. To me it is a wonder drug. All drugs are a risk, and for me this is good",

I have tried numerous pain medicines and although I did not have any noticeable side effects with the Zipsor, it did no more for me than taking 2 Aleves. Maybe because my pain is bone related with the addition of torn cartilage and nerve problems? Glad that it works so well for some. Anything to get off of narcotic medicines and the crutches pre-op would be nice! So, for me and my dysplasia Zipsor has not been the miracle I was hoping for.",

It also helps my very sore feet, probably plantar fasciatis.  I don't know why they did not give this to me earlier, its much more effective than oral NSAID's or even Vicodin, as this works faster, much faster.  I use it less often than recommended (up to 4 times a day), because its not needed. Once or twice a day for me relieves the pain, pronto. It also helps my wife, with her osteoarthritis pain.",

(These areas of pain come from a compression head injury I got as a teenager.) I have a lot of problems trying to take anything for the arthritis in oral form, and I still take Aciphex along with using the Voltaren Gel as a precaution.

I just crushed the pill into a powder and took with water just like the Cambia...worked just as fast and tasted better, because it had NO taste. Don't be fooled by the makers of Cambia. It is just another Epi Pen scandal story.",

What an advantage to be able to apply the gel right to the affected area, relief comes rather fast. It doesn't last as long as I would like, but when you are in pain, any relief is welcome. Used in conjunction with my other medicines it has helped me to put together a medication regime that helps me to live with this condition.

After two hours I went for a walk and was able to walk farther in the same amount of time and without as bad of a limp. This morning my foot was tender.

I swapped pain management doctors and am now on 15mg of oxycodone every 6 hours, 4mg Zanaflex every 8 hours, 500mg of Naproxen every 12 hours, 40mg Celexa once a day and 600mg of Neurontin every 8 hours just to sort of be able to function.

Two more doses the next day but then had to discontinue due to the unacceptable side-effects: heart palpitations, hot flushes, restlessness, minor anxiety. But I must state here though for you that I can hardly tolerate Ibuprofen or any NSAID pain-killer for that matter, of late that is. Earlier, I'd tolerate medicines like sweets, but after taking Ciprofloxacin 14 months ago, and that has messed up my whole system: I've even developed a number of food intolerances as well.

I've tried 3 different prescription medications and they did nothing. The second day on this medication I started getting some relief in my back. It's not 100% gone but it really eases my pain. The unfortunate side effect with any nsaid is thin blood resulting in bruising. I have a bleeding autoimmune disorder so it's not the best combo. But I feel like as a first there's promising relief. I hope it continues.",

However, I JUST had an \"ah ha\" moment as to the mysterious, very itchy rash I have developed. The application areas reacted in the intense heat. Last summer while gardening I developed a severe lower back rash which I assumed was somehow sweat related. This year I developed the same painful, itchy rash on my right upper back (deltoid area and shoulder) down to my lower arm. Again, I thought it was from the heat and sweat. As I was applying it yesterday, I realized it was being applied directly on top of my rash. The ONLY places I have my rash. It took me long enough!!

After using Voltaren gel 2-3 times a day, after just 2 days pain was greatly reduced. And if there is any pain, it's only about a level 3 or 4. Have recently started using it on knees.

It burns her and she refuses to use it so she gave me a tube for my arthritis in both my knees, my hip, back and ankles. WOW! This is a dream come true. It seems to work immediately for me and putting it on right before bed allows me to sleep all night because I have slight to no pain. I wake up, use it and then my day goes by MUCH better. I'm going to try to remember to actually take it to work with me so I can apply it there. I keep forgetting. Praise God for allowing me to try this gel. I was leery at first but tried it anyway.

Couldn't sleep, constant ache from shoulder into my bicep. Rather than get a Cortisone shot yesterday, the doctor suggested I try a sample of the Flector Patch. I wore it last night and finally experienced some relief. I'd say the pain is about 75% better, and I managed to get some sleep. ",

Went to the doctor after a week of pain and not much healing taking place to make sure I didn't suffer any major ligament damage. He diagnosed the IT band issue and gave some samples of Flector Patch and as more of a comic relief, stated that \"these really shouldn't work, but actually do\". Was a little skeptical at first, but these patches do provide wonderful relief. Four patches later I am feeling much improvement in the mobility of my knee strain. Definitely worth a try.",

My doctor put me on this 2 years ago, 50mg once a day, and I honestly don't think I would survive the summer without it. One of my major problems I was getting out of bed in the morning, I couldn't even roll over the pain was so bad. So basically what I do is set my alarm 1/2 hour earlier so I can take it and let it work a little bit before I have to be up and out. I went from having to take so many days off of work to feeling so much relief. Since Physical Therapy didn't work for me, I will probably continue to take this as long as I have pain.",

I get super stiff behind my knee, and it makes it hard to even walk, or straighten my leg all the way. I take ibuprofen, I ice it...and that helps some. I woke up this morning with it being extremely stiff behind my knee. I applied Pennsaid all over the back and front of my knee. No kidding - within 5 minutes, most of that stiffness is GONE. I am in shock. And if you have knee pain, you know how debilitating it can feel. This stuff is INSANE - in a good way!! I'm so glad I have it. I literally can't believe how much it helped me.

I have not been overly impressed with either thus far. But I have noticed a little less stiffness and some range of motion. But in fairness the inflammation is no doubt very deep in both joints and would take time for the medicine to hit its target area. The Dr told me to give it time which I felt was reasonable. I find the gel to have a pleasant smell and rubs in nice and dries pretty quick. I am using the Voltaren Gel that says, diclofenac sodium topical gel 1%. Don't quote me but I believe they also make it with 2% diclofenac sodium?? With ins my cost was 42.00 for 5 tubes. Greasing both knees uses a lot",

It also decrease my need for vicodin which I'm scared of getting hooked on. I also have had a history of ulsers so I take protonix every day. I haven't had any problems yet!",
                    "I have been on many pain/anti-inflammatory medications to help with Rheumatoid Arthritis, Plantar Fasciitis and a torn tendon in my shoulder. It is the fastest acting and most effective pain relief I have tried (comparing to Duexis, Hydrocodone, Prednisone, Tramadol). It does not cause stomach upset like other NSAIDS and the only side effect is sleepiness but, a quick nap and pain is much better and no grogginess.",

I've tried everything for a whiplash injury - physical therapists, joint injections, steroid injections, chirpractors, NSAID pills - but did not find my solution until this gel. I put in on my neck at night and wake in the morning gloriously pain-free.",

Voltaren actually reduces to Rids muscle and all other pain in my miserable body. I can't take narcotics as i vomit and they don't work, but oddly Voltaren does work for me. Also works on those with arthritis (as originally intended) and several people have commented this cream/gel has been the only med, oral or topical, to truly help. I use Brand as generics of anything don't work.",

Another person who I know also noticed this and thought it was just him but I have been using it for over a year now and the regular strength and the extra strength are both less effective after the seal has been opened 4-5 days.",

It truly surprised me how well this medicine works. I can't take NSAIDs for more than a day or two without causing tummy troubles. I keep a tube with me now at all times. I highly recommend this to anyone with muscle or joint pain. I've used Lidoderm patches and TENS unit, probably been on every possible combination of medicines. This medicine really helps me.",

Pain is usually severe enough that Only the Colorado patch works. These are for when I'm not in Colorado. Have to use 3 to get any results though. They could use a better adhesive. 100mph tape works best to hold them on.",

I take it now once a day as I recover from the surgery and it works really well. I don't have to take hydrocodone any more. My doctor says I will have to stop taking it soon.

I was waking up due to pain and found moving extremely difficult and painful. I was at the point of taking pain relief before bed and again at around 4 a.m. With no expectations but exasperation I tried voltaren. It really has worked very much to my surprise!!! I did not expect such a good result or any result, I was just so fed up I grabbed a tube to mix up with the oral meds! It's helped my sleep in a matter of days and I'm much more comfortable. I don't take oral pain killers now and whilst I can still feel it, it's nowhere near the way it was. I can move properly again",

Since the 1950's I have suffered neck pain when doing a chore in one position for a long period of time. I have exercised on a regular basis for many years and in 2009 I injured my rotator cuff on a piece of gym equipment. After the physical therapy was finished I was experiencing sharp pain radiating from my shoulder to my neck. I asked my doctor at the time, a rheumatoligist, if this was arthritis now coming from the shoulder. He gave me a tube of Voltaren Gel to try and it has been wonderful. I only rub two pea sized drops between my shoulder and neck in the morning and have no pain the rest of the day.",

My son played hockey to a Jr A level and had to quit due to chronic knee pain from arthritis (he is only 23) and it has helped us both a great deal. We have had no side effects and we use it for major flare-ups as it is not intended for long term daily use. We each get a big tube, even though some might find it pricey, you don't have to use a lot it lasts a long time. The relief it provides is priceless. You should not take it with oral anti-inflammatories and ask a doctor before use if you have any medical conditions and/or take medications (even natural remedies). Great product.",

I don't like narcotic drugs because they just mute pain, and pain is your body's natural feedback loop, saying \"Hey, don't move that way... I'm still broken\"  I am on a 75mg dose, and within hours I could breathe and move much better- magical stuff. Pain is still there, but more like a sore muscle at this point... not like the sharp barbed wire in my chest feeling it had been. I have been eating with every dose, the doctor told me that this can be pretty harsh on your stomach if you are not careful. Hopefully I can decease my dose in a week. This is like a sledgehammer to inflamed tissue. No ill effects.",

Pain and swelling have been reduced, but not totally gone. I'd have to say I'm happy with the result as it has enabled me to keep working, but side effects are troublesome: I get headaches close to migraine level, my vision is so blurred sometimes, I'm VERY groggy in the morning and have a hard time getting out of bed, and the ringing in my ears has gotten worse.

He found what was wrong just by my x-ray, my hip was about an inch off hitting a nerve. Now I can work again, not 100% but 4 year's suffering to being able to walk somewhat normal is great. Still need meds for pain but way less. If nothing else helps try a chiropractor. Don't wait 4 year's to go. If it don't help in a month stop going its not going to.",

My doctor gave me Zipsor and it was 90% better in 1 day. My teammates take a lot of things for pain but I got to say Zipsor has been the best to date.",
                    "I tore my shoulder labrum and the pain can be off the chart. Hydrocodone and ibuprofen and ice helped some. After my doctor gave me the Flector Patch I noticed major relief in my shoulder within an hour. These work very well. These truly work.",

Using more at one time or more frequently does not bring the pain down any more. It did not work that much on my wrists and hands where carpel tunnel is \"suspected\" but they are not certain what it is. Some other pain on hand and arm were helped but not overly so.",
                    "My Doctor put me on this Voltaren gel and now I can get a goodnights sleep , because it works so good, and I have to rate this medicine in the high 10s. All you have to do is put between 4 up to 9 gram 4 times a day and you will see just what I'm talking about.",
                    "I have been using voltaren (diclofenac) for my RA for 27 years without any other strong medications. Yes, I lost my knee joints and had their replacement, however, for all these 27 years I have never stopped working full time job as a teacher. The most recent dosage is 150 mg a day. If I had stronger pain, I did diclofenac shots to myself and that helped a lot. What I noticed, the quality of the European diclofenac is much higher. After staying on the US production or maybe because of aging (or both), I've started feeling side effects: GERD and stomachache at night. So it's time to find something else, though I am grate full to this medication for keeping me alive and productive for 27 years!",

The pain can keep me up at night when I sleep.  Best thing for recovery is rest,  but I can't seem to stay away from doing cardio which causes it to come back.  Voltaren has helped me manage the inflammation and still do some light cardio exercise.",

Unfortunately, I found out that it is supposed to work to relieve the pain each time it is used. It certainly doesn't do this for me--I may as well be applying lotion for all the good it does me. It really does nothing at all. I'm really disappointed, as my pain management doctor just weaned me off of narcotics, so I don't have anything that helps with the pain at the moment. I'll have to go see him again to get something else. It is so frustrating to try to find something that works, since everyone is different.",

I've been in physical therapy for 14 months, tried dry needling, myofacasial release massage therapy, diet changes, prescription drugs, yoga, isolated/ active stretching & OTC icy hot & HO Capazain cream. My doctor prescribed this after the pain clinic refused to give me a steroid injection for pain relief. It's more effective than anything else I've tried. I take a prescription drug for the pain and then put this cream on 4 or 5 times a day. Within minutes of applying it the pain dissipates & I'm pain free for several hours. This stuff works better than numbing yourself with ice. It helps the pain in both hips and my lower spine. I was given 3% strength & it rocks!",

I've been using this topical gel for several months and it was only until approximately four months later I associated itching all over my body after I use the gel.  I thought it was my imagination but I have tested it out several times, I am not itchy In the area that I apply the gel, but it must get into your bloodstream and I have several areas of my body that start itching at the same time. So in addition to not feeling any pain relief, I am reacting with all over body itching. I will now we put this back to my doctor, And hope to find pain relief for my hip.",

To make matters worse, I tore ligaments in my ankle from a fall at work. Finally after worker's comp. only with my ankle, I was referred to a neurologist. They did many tests and indicated that it was a sensory nerve injury. He gave me a sample of this gel and told me to apply it 4x a day. It worked wonders. Pain was gone!

First dosage caused me itches (I have had a slight reaction to Naproxen Sodium also) so was not too worried. I don't really see much reduction of pain and it appears a larger dose would give me hives. Many years ago I had tremendous shoulder pain and was prescribed Baclofen. THAT drug helped me completely. I had no side effects (unsure of the dosage. Perhaps I'll ask if I can retry that drug in place of Diclofenac.",

On a scale of 1 to 10 my pain is usually around a 4 on a good day and a 8 or 9 on a bad one. On a bad day I take a dose of Cambia and an Imitrex subcutaneous injection and it completely knocks out my migraine! In all my years of having migraines I never thought that was possible. Even when I don't take the injection the Cambia alone brings a level 8 migraine down to a 3 which is manageable.",

But after Toradol was gone (I was able to stretch it over nine days) I still needed something else.  I began to take Naproxen over-the counter strength and the pain and stiffness gradually came back. I had Cataflam, which after 2-3 dosages, controlled the discomfort that was building up. ",

It is a fast acting medication, so you can apply it and get on with activities right away. The cost of the medicine is high, but if you have tried products such as aspercreme, biofreeze or joint flex. You will see that the cost and relief you get are directly related.

The scent is mild after a few minutes, and so is my pain level. After a particularly painful day I may apply twice.

But try cutting these in half and wrapping around thumb down to lower joint, surprised they stay on fairly well but they are ugly white, I can't wear out of the house. Besides, nowhere does it say they are for arthritis pain, just minor aches, sprains, strains etc. Afraid to use continually or long term due to s-e's. Terribly expensive for just an NSAID with terrible potential side-effects. (1 box with insurance $140, on retirement)",

My other sisters always need to take Caraflam. So when I couldn't bear the cramps anymore I took it, it started working about an hour later, I didn't feel painful anymore. Even though my sisters are pharmacists, they always told me that the less medicines I take, the better it would be. So I tried not to use it. It was the worst ever, I took one, it didn't work well when it reached the max of pain. I threw up and took another one. After an hour, it worked.

So many pills, patches and injections. Under the knife many times. A real humpty dumpty story. I have more pins, screws in me than your local hard wear store. Note: I don't want to over state the how effective it is but it works. Talking to my doctor about the pain. He gave me this to try. Well my 1st thought was \"just another snake oil\" But it'sfreak'in amazing, it works like magic. Why did I not recive this years ago. The Drugest gave me a stupid look. And said it just became generic. All those years I would have paid anything. When your in pain, money is no object",
                    "This morning (my first day) I was shaking and in tears. That's how bad my cramps have become during the past year. I was given a diclofenac (voltaren) injection 30 min ago and now am almost completely at ease. Considering that I'd tried nearly everything (ibuprofen, panadol ex, buscopan, spasm relaxers etc etc), I'm umderstandably excited and can't wait to share this. I tried the tablets last month and this morning but they aren't as effective as the injection. My advice is if it's debilitating - definetely go for the injection ASAP. Don't wait.",
                    "My dr gave me Voltaren Gel to help relieve my Ilio-Inguinal Neuralgia as a sample. I don't have a specific dosage, just when it hurts, apply the cream. It works amazing! I mainly use it for break-through pain between doses, and days like this with storms and hectic days at work, I'm able to concentrate on work instead of trying to take my mind off of the pain. Does this come in gallon size with a push handle? Maybe a bath bomb I could put in my jacuzzi tub? Just askin...",
                    "I have severe osteoarthritis in both knees, and arthritis in my back, and shoulders. My doctor prescribed Voltaren because I built up a resistance to ibuprofen and Aleve. I've been in pain for so long I forgot what it was like to be pain free. A little nervous over the long term side effects, so hoping I can get the weight off so I can be medication free. Just thankful to be able to move and do things I love without pain.",
                    "I have been taking Firocet for years and it has been moderately effective for my migraines , which I usually have one per week. My Dr. last week recommended Cambia, was skeptical about it but was in agony and gave it a try. Within 45 minutes I was up and functional. Will only use in severe cases. Also very costly if you have no insurance.",

I have degenerative disc disease in my neck and lower back, as well as osteoarthritis in my hips and right shoulder (right shoulder is due to a broken humeral head and torn muscle from a 4-wheeler accident). 2 years ago I wrecked my 4-wheeler, so bad that I could not walk or even bathe myself for 2 weeks. I have been in severe pain and have tried everything, including nerve block injections, and incredibly high pain medicines (including Valium and Oxycodone). The doctor gave me this gel a week ago and said to use it for my neck. My neck is doing great, and after reading all of these reviews I am going to try it on my hips and shoulder!",
                    "My doctor prescribed this medication for arthritis in my feet. It worked great and within a few days there was no pain in my feet, or anywhere else for that matter. After about 2 weeks, however, I developed heartburn and intestinal cramps so severe that I passed out on 2 occasions. If you can handle the side effects, this medicine works wonders for pain and inflammation.",
                    "I've been on this now for 5 months and it is by far the best pain medicine out there. No high feeling or anything like that. If your doctor has you on Celebrex and you don't feel any relief, ask him for Voltaren. You will most certainly feel the difference. If you are on it for any length of time (like me) then every so often you'll have to have blood work done to check your kidneys and liver to make sure they are functioning right as this medicine can cause problems with that. For me everything is good to go so far. I swear by Voltaren.",

She'd never heard of it before, so was hesitant. My insurance covers this a better price than other migraine abortants. It's my go to now. I highly recommend. Use as little water as possible, then rinse the cup with water and drink whatever residue. It works wonders and truly dosen't taste bad.",
                    "I used the gel for 2 1/2 months after TKR 3-4 times/day. Part of the time I used the extra-strength version. I thought that it was moderately effective for pain and swelling. However, three weeks after stopping I still cannot get the odor out of my body. The extra-strength version has a different carrier, thicker and with a strong odor, and I would not use it again.",

I'm a 51yr-old female and after 2-3 weeks of taking this medicine I was experiencing hot flashes frequently about 5X a day especially at night that wakes me up, which never occurred before. I thought I was pretty young to be experiencing this, but this website was the second place where I researched this medicine where it states \"works by reducing hormones\" that explains my hot flashes recently. I still need to take a few more pills and swelling has subsided in my knee but do not intend to take this long-term.",

Had to have an upper endoscopy to find the cause of my symptoms. I had burns to my lower esphagus and mild stomach bleeding. My doctor told me that a side effect of this medication (ointment applied to the skin on my face) can destroy the mucus lining in the stomach. Use with extreme caution!",
                    "I was prescribed Flector patches after surgery to repair my collarbone, which came with frozen shoulder that I've been getting physical therapy on for weeks. I have not used the patches regularly, just when I have a little pain. Early on I had pain in the shoulder area but could not place the patch directly on the shoulder because of the surgical scar. The patches helped somewhat. Now I have some pain for stepping up workouts on the shoulder, and I can place the patch directly on the pain area, and it's working wonderfully. The patch has a kind of numbing feeling, and overall the feeling can be compared to what ibuprofen does in reducing inflammation. The patches can make me a little sleepy. They also can be a little large for certain spots",
                    "I had a Torn tendon in left shoulder Ltd movement of arm. I used patch 200mg for seven days, did not help an iota, very disappointed , no idea what medicines were penetrated into my body, would not recommend.",

Each time I got very stiff with painful joints. I've tried most of the other arthritis NSAIDS and none work nearly as well. My Dr. runs a liver function test every 6 months.",
                    "Use for lower back pain and spine arthritis. The patches make it possible to function, significant pain relief. It helps to tape the edges down with athletic tape otherwise the edges catch on clothing and pull the patch loose. Far fewer side effects than oral NSAIDS and better relief.",

Worked great for me only thing negative is that it makes me sweat also I've been gaining weight. And I believe the weight gain is because of the medicine.",
                    "I've used voltaren rapid 25 and 50 by far the best joint pain medication I've ever had. I use it to ease my pain when gout attacks come on I take to 2 with milk or before I eat something. My partner also uses it only if her period pain is unbearable seems to help her cope..",
                    "The patch works well as part of a program. It and Percocet (7.5/350) work well together, 800mg ibuprofen less so. They are more effective to prevent pain for me, so don't wait for the pain to use a patch.",

                    "Personally it's the best gel I have used to warm up my back muscles, making the muscles feel like I've stretched for 15 - 20 min. Don't expect miracles. You should not be expecting this gel to completely alleviate back pain. It's not supposed to do that. It's supposed to get your muscles to a place where you can do other things more easily to attain painlessness via a combined effort. For a lot of back pain, if you use the gel in conjunction with consistent stretching (twice daily) whilst consuming the correct diet and being active enough to lower your body weight, you will be in a much better place in no time - so be encouraged! The gel really helps you do the things you need to do physically to get to that place.",

                    "This seems to help my pain, but I find the odor a deterrent to using it regularly. I am allergic to most fragrances, and this is no exception. Why do they add fragrance when it is a common issue for people with allergies?",

For the last 3 years I have reduced to 1x50D mg per day and really feel very comfortable. I found it very effective and I didn't noticed any side effects yet. I think that Voltaren helped me to keep my ankylosis under contol. Doctor told me to avoid using it for so long but the pain was coming back the next day. I don't know what problems I may face in future but my life quality is good and I am happy.",

                    "I used this for sciatic pain. The first few times it worked. Pain was reduced. Then about the 4th or 5th time I experienced a burning sensation. It was so strong that I had to wash off the medication to get relief.",

This stuff is a lifesaver. It helps me regain my joint flexibility and I can move and walk around again. Also, I am not crying out in pain. My life was horrible before Voltaren Gel. Now, I have a normal life again and can manage my symptoms.",

I have a pain in my shin that wakes me up at night, and have rubbed Voltaren on that area and it gives me 100% relief. I've also rubbed it on my jaw in an area where I have a back tooth that is inflamed. And it also relieves the pain. I am so happy with this medication...thank you Novartis.",

Worst episodes included my inability to pick up a coffee cup with my left hand, pain level of 7, inability to sleep on my left side etc.  After 6 months of this, I visited my G.P who x-rayed my shoulder and found arthritic changes. He gave me 2 sample tubes and told me to try it. I did with great results.",

I tried several other medicines, like paracetemol, but they weren't very effective, even after taking 3 within a few hours of each other. I tried 1 x 50mg diclofenac tablet, and after about an hour, all my pain was gone. It's been about 4 hours now, and I'm still 100% pain-free.",

It is not like oral pain relievers with near immediate results. Patience is needed. If you're having trouble with it adhering to the skin, make sure the area is free from oils, either naturally or lotions or soap residue. I have no problems at all with them. My RA flared up in addition to my cocyx broken off, literally. The pain was so severe that oral meds weren't effective. It took several days to feel the beginning of relief, and I've improved steadily. If you've used these short term and are the impatient type, chill out and give them a chance. They do work.",

I'm now 80% better and changing the patch every 12 hours as prescribed to me. The first day (for whatever reason), I got a surge of energy when I first put on the patch. The pain subsided to about a level 3 from a level 6 after wearing it for just a few short hours.  Do not stop wearing the patch as the pain will come back quickly. I did have to supplement the pain with additional meds after I did some light home repairs (despite the the warnings) and this kept the pain level down.",

I also have knees that ache and pop and shoulder and elbow issues as well as pain and spasms in my back.

In that year I have had total knee replacement (left knee), then two more \"revisions\" on the same knee to get rid of an infection. Just weeks ago, I came to the conclusion that Celebrex just wasn't getting the job done for my pain, and of course I did not want to take narcotics. I did a lot of research (the reviews on this site were immensely helpful) and decided to give Diclofenac a try. It has been fantastic, and I feel better than I have in years.",

The surgeries did help- but still have pain, burning, & pins and needles sensation in neck, shoulders & arms. Burning pain in hips, and muscular soreness through out my back.

First sign was extreme itching and severe sweating with dizziness. If this happens go to hospital quickly and stop taking the drug. When this started Doctors can't always determine it quickly enough as in my case. Second time wasn't as severe but by the third time when my reactions started I knew.

My pain is considerably better, but I am guessing/hoping from the procedure, not from the Zipsor. I am having terrible stomach problems, that are outweighing what I am guessing the pain relief to be.

Also, I work at a computer and drive for work a lot, it really works miracles on tight/sore shoulder and neck areas, as another poster has mentioned.. you do feel more \"loose\" after you use it. Finally, it smells pretty decent. I was concerned that I'd walk around smelling like Great Auntie Momo... It just has a light, semi fresh smelling scent--not medicinal.",
                    "I have had right hip pain for two years everyday all day hurts worse when I sit down at work then get up from my desk and try to walk I had started to limp . I tried Naproxen, Celebrex , lodine , Cymbalta and Tramadol nothing took the pain away . I had a MRI and went to see a spine Dr no one could tell me why I had the pain Upon walking into a physical therapy office the receptionist told me about Voltaren gel. I had my Dr. prescribe it after the third day I realized the pain was not as bad and by the fifth day it was barely noticeable. This is a miracle I use a small amount of gel in the morning and maybe another small amount before I go to bed.",

I just take one tablet with food in the morning (75mg/day) and it makes all the difference in the world. I have not experienced any side effects yet and have been taking this medicine for about 9 months.",

It has been prescribed as an adjunct medicine for me in either case, not my primary medicine. I love this stuff! It absorbs very quickly and usually works well for me for a few hours post application. So far I have had no negative side effects from using it, just relief!",
                    "This medication has truly changed my life. It gets rid of every migraine every single time. The only issue is that the two insurances I've tried to fill it on won't approve. It's hundreds of dollars for 5 (?) packets I think. Must of us can't afford that.",

                    "I have been using these off and on for years. Best relief after using as directed for about 48 hours, using a new patch every 12 hours. This medication is for inflammation so it takes a little while for swelling to subside enough for pain relief. I use along with oxycodone and muscle relaxers and honestly think I get more relief from the patches. They are just so expensive I can only fill my prescription once my deductible is met for the year and even then I have to download a coupon. My cost for a full month is about $70. Much better than almost $600!",

Alot of younger people are bashing this stuff, because their doctor didn't put them on vicadin/percocet. I have been suffering a from a sharp, stabbing pain in my chest that shoots down my back (costochondritis) & finally decided to go in after 3 sleepless nights. I took one as soon as I got them, & let me tell you..it seriously helps! The pain hasn't fully subsided, but now it's more of a tightness than a unbearable pain. I'm so looking foward to get some sleep tonight! & just a little fyi, I was also told that the only safe anti-inflammatory I can take along with this, was Tylenol!",

Saw specialist who did biopsy. Non malignant. Treated with Solaraze. Lesion changed to open sore. Stopped treatment until sore healed. Used Paw paw ointment to soften it. That worked. Resumed Solaraze. Other smaller lesions have appeared close by. Will see specialist soon for assessment.",

I had mild dizziness and upset stomach early in treatment but now have no side effects at all. When my back gets bad, I still take muscle relaxers, narcotic pain relievers, and chiropractic treatment (when I can afford it), but diclofenac helps me manage things so as to reduce the need for stronger medicines.",

Relief comes within 10 to 15 minutes. Maybe even less on an empty stomach. Pain, throbbing, sensitivity, all of it. Best part- I can take it at work (elementary special needs teacher) with no impairment, drowsiness, or pesky side effects whatsoever. That's a BIG deal when working with kids. I keep two packets in my wallet at all times. PS: The taste, mint and black jellybeans, was hard for me to swallow at first. But it's no worse than NyQuil or Robitussin or any of the other horrid things we take to feel better. So what?",

I was told to drop it to 1 pill per day for 3 more weeks. I had been in menopause for over a year. I got a period and one of the side effects is changes in your menstrual cycle. Not happy. After I stopped taking the pills, about a week now, I've had horrible pain in both knees that I didn't have before, and the pain in my foot is back. I have a popping in the back of one knee that someone says sounds like it may be a baker's cyst. I can't even walk normal. I have an appointment this coming week and will try to follow up. Not sure if this caused it, but too much of a coincidence.",

I also do botox migraine every three months. I not only suffer with common symptoms, debilitating headache, nausea, light/sound sensitivities, I also have numbness, unilateral paralysis, and even blindness. I've tried most approved treatments, including \"off label\" medications, with ranging levels of relief.  I've yet to find a preventative aka \"miracle drug\", although, botox has effectively reduced the number of my \"headache\" days. At any rate, my migraine specialist gave me samples of Cambia at last visit and today I remembered I had it. It quickly took a level 9 to a level 3.",
                    "I have tried a dozen different medications but none as effective as this. I tried Celebrex last year and was in so much pain after three days I went back to my Voltaren. I take 100mg twice a day that helps me work and function normally.",

But I noticed weeks later, severe back pain that affected my ability to stand for a long period of time without feeling light headed from the pain. No over the counter pain killers helped. When my doctor prescribed me this, it immediately went away. The only side effect I've experienced is feeling fatigued. Like most medications, though, my tolerance for it has built up quickly. And when I don't take it, the pain catches up on me quickly. It's difficult for me to get out of bed if I go more than a day without it. So I'd recommend doing exercises/stretches and don't just depend on it forever.",

I swear it's like not taking anything at all. At first I thought it had taken the edge off the cramps, but at 12 hours almost to the dot it wore off, so I took a second, which isn't doing anything. Will try this again next month when I can start taking it in advance of the pain, but as of right now this has been a completely useless medication.",

After having a large mass removed from my leg, the knee got worse and was swollen until I couldn't walk without a cane or walker. I went to the doctor to see if I could get a shot to help me walk and he gave me a tube of Voltaran Gel to use. I came home, put it on the knee and propped my leg up for an hour. When I was ready to get up, I dreaded it because I just knew I was going to be in horrible pain again. But, the pain was almost all gone. I couldn't believe that a simple gel could have that effect so fast but, it did! This product is worth its weight in gold! No cane for two days now!",

I used this gel for about 2 months twice daily on the lip. I must mention that there absolutely no effect of this medication on my lip. A total waste of money if you don't have insurance as it can be quite expensive without it.  Then I was prescribed all sort of other creams which was nothing but a waste of money on moisturizers. Don't feel bad to question the dermatologist as to what the cream does and whether it will cure you. The most essential treatment for single or isolated AKs is cryotherapy - liquid nitrogen spray.",

                    "If you are anyone that loves to hit the gym hard like I do, you gotta know what muscle pain feels like. No one can really tell or know when you have went too far because you are suppose to hurt and be in pain. If you are in pain, it means that your body muscles are stretching and you are making room for more muscles to fit. Many people don't understand that when you go home then that's when the adrenaline wears off and you start to think \"I went a little too far that time\".  Since most of what I do is shoulder press, I have to say that this back patch for pain has saved me from several night where I wouldn't have been able to sleep. Absorbine Jr pain patches for back work quickly, absorb fast, and give me pain relief fast no matter what."

There are so many people allergic also someone like me with cancer and very sore and nauseated to spend money on this and it made me so sick I washed up 4 times and my hands and skin still smells strong.

I sometimes get killer tension headaches that first build up in the back of the neck. When I felt one coming on, I used the gel on the back of the neck and shoulders. The headache never developed. Before this experiment I would take 3 or 4 ibuprofen for one of these headaches and hope for the best. The gel is now my standard treatment for these headaches.",

It is like a miracle. I have never found any medication for anything that was more effective. I guess it just works better for some injuries than others. It is , however, very short acting. But the pain relief it provides is priceless. I have arthritis in my hands, I don't find it helps with that pain. For the certain types of injury it works better than narcotic medication.

It used to just act up at bedtime, so bad at times that I had to wrap my feet in ice packs to get relief. Now it's all hours & hands/feet and I have a stiffness and severe putting edema that pops up & then disappears with no regularity. There's no explanation from Doctor's YET.

I received the generic Diclofenac 50 mg. and was very excited about receiving any kind of help making it through a migraine which sometimes lasts 8 days, sometimes 2 days. Anyway, I took it three times a day the first two days and sporadically for another two or three days. It worked very well much to my surprise; however, after that I experienced the stomach burn I read someone else experienced. I didn't realize what had caused the burning until I read the reviews on this med. I'm a little afraid to take it again unless I just take it one or two days next time. Try it.",

While it is stated it is not approved for spinal use, I have found Voltaren extremely beneficial. While I still have pain in the neighborhood of an 8 out of 10, I feel that it would always be a 10 without Voltaren. Many thanks to my PA for recommending it.",

Here's the best part though. I have a bulge in my lower back. I have meloxacam but I don't take it regularly because I feel that it don't help any. So one day my back is as hurting really bad so I decided to apply the gel. Glad I did because wow! It works amazing! They should most definitely test it on the back. I know surgery will be the only thing for permanent relief but I'm only 31 and one can't afford it and two it's not guarantee it would work and could make my problem worse. Next time I go to my doctor I will be asking for my own prescription.",
                    "The first time my doctor suggested Voltaren cream. I have osteo in both knees, right ankle and my spine. After several tubes and no reduction of pain or swelling my doctor suggested Pennsaid . The difference was like day and night. Not only did it reduce the pain but the swelling in my ankle was also reduced. When I investigated both products I was shocked to find that only Pennsaid contains a delivery agent DMSO that Voltaren does not . So it seems the DMSO delivers directly into the joint while the Voltaren only stays on the skin. Bottom line I will never spend my money on anything else going forward ....Pennsaid works for me.",
                    "I love this gel. Just 10 seconds after I put it on an area with severe pain, the pain is gone completely for 2 hours. I couldn't believe it the first time I used it. I take some other strong prescription medication for knee and back pain and the medications don't do as good a job on the pain as this gel. I wish I could use it more than 4 times a day, but during my waking hours, it is a God send. Thank you, thank you, thank you! I would do a commercial for Voltaren Gel anytime, for free!",

The combination provided no discernible pain relief. However, I did suffer from significant stomach and intestinal pain. The stomach & intestinal pain stopped within 12 hours of discontinuing the Zipsor. Overall, not a pleasant experience.",
                    "I had tried Lidoderm and had fair to good results. I was reluctant to try the Flector because of the cost. My insurance did not cover them.  In an impulsive act due to frustration with pain, I got the script filled. Within 2 hours I noticed that the severe pain in my knee was almost gone, and I slept very well through the night. These are a miracle and work as well as or better than any systemic medicine including narcotics. They really do work. ",

I'd literally be curled up in the fetal position, unable to even talk. Depending on the level of pain, this either completely eradicated it or made it totally bearable, and lasted for 12 hours at a stretch. Voltaren is wonderful and I'm glad my doctor recommended it over a narcotic painkiller.",

I also have bursitis & piriformis syndrome in my right hip as well as achilles tendonitis in the right foot. I take 75mg 2 times a day. My knees are so bad that I had to have Synvisc-One injections as well. Combined I have been able to work my 12 hr shifts as an RN. I still have pain that's about a 6-7 after working three 12's in a row, but would not be able to work at all without the Voltaren. I am looking to have my knees replaced in the near future. The only side effect I have had is stomach upset if I do not take it with food and some mild constipation. I would recommend this medicine to anyone. ",

For a different issue my physician told me to stop the Aleve and try Diclofanac Sodium. My body is very happy. No back, neck, ankle, toe, shoulder pain. My shoulder range of motion is almost 100%.

I've since called my podiatrist asking for a full prescription based on the relief I already feel.",

I'm using much less than the 2gram dose - maybe 1/4 to 1/2 a gram on a joint, tops - and having at least 8 hours pain free. It seems no studies were conducted on it's use on shoulders, but it worked decently enough for mine when I pinched a nerve.  Make sure you read the possible side effects and all the potential negatives, and test on a single area with someone with you for a couple hours just to make sure you're not allergic. It's been problem-free for me, but everyone's body chemistry is different.",

Diclofenac does not relieve all of my pain, but it relieves 60-70 percent of it, or enough to allow me to have a life. For me it appears to be safe and effective. The only side -effect I've experienced is occasional mild constipation. I recommend it highly.",

My ligaments and tendons are weak and has been affecting my joints, needing to have 2 neck surgeries, bunions, and wrist surgery. I switched over to the generic Diclofenac 3% gel. Let me tell you it works! Unfortunately this higher dose costs anywhere from $600.00 - $1,100.00 for a 100 Gram tube. Downside is that it's marketed for skin Actinic Keratosis.",

By the end of second day the arm was black swollen and painful. Emergency room visit did not provide any relief other than telling Me to discontinue use of gel. I have a artificial heart valve that requires that I take blood thinner which was discussed with the prescribing physician and had been used as prescribed. The arm continued to swell and the blackness continued down the arm with pain that became unbearable. A ambulance was summoned to take me back to the hosital emergency room personnel could not diganose the situation completely and I was admitted to the ward. Surgery was required",

My pain had increased to the point where I had to have two radiofrequency (RF) neurotomy procedures performed to varying degrees of success. Pain returned, so tried Percocet 5/325 2x day for a month but only provided a temporary relief until the dose would wear off. I became concerned about opiate dependency so I made the decision to stop. Started Diclofenac 75mg ('551' on one side and a fancy 'R' on the other) 1xday and had a SIGNIFICANT reduction in pain after just two days. Bloodwork shows that it does mildly elevate my liver enzymes (ALT of 60) and has slightly lowered RBC, WBC & platelets which is a common side effect. Benefits outweigh the risk at this point, so will continue.",

This gel works well and very quickly in my case, and with bracing and icing I have experienced a lot of relief. The nature of this pain reliever is anti inflammatory - not numbing - so I don't think you would find use for it if your pain is not of the inflammatory nature. I get spastic and tense neck muscles all the time and find heat and massages work better. So for the right purpose it is excellent stuff. I am sensitive, delicate skinned and had no allergies but I would be careful and spot test nonetheless.",

Apparently it works for everyone else, so I may just be an oddball. It was like taking a placebo and I am not even taking other pain meds... So it's not like I have a tolerance level for pain meds...

I am a chiropractic student, so I went the conservative route first: adjustment, ultrasound, cold laser, Alpha-stim, microcurrent probes. Finally I had a series of x-rays on campus and unfortunately, there is a large osteophyte on the volar (palm) side of the base of the 1st metacarpal, along with serious lipping of the scaphoid bone which supports it (you know this combination as the saddle joint). Voltaren helps the crippling pain of trying to unscrew a jar, open a doorknob, or hold a pen. I will however have surgery to remove the osteophyte.",
                    "The gel helps with the pain but my stomach was a little upset, I got a mild headache and I felt very drowsy and out of it. Yes I know it's the gel but I still had side effects. I only rubbed in a small amount. I can't swear by it but I think it also caused me to have several anxiety attacks which I think are related to the woozy out of it feeling. It says it makes you dizzy on the box.",

I didn't have high hopes, but it is WONDERFUL!  Because I have had Gastric Bypass surgery, I can not take NSAIDS which pretty much leaves me, Tylenol! I did sneak an Aleve after being in so much pain and I was so sick to my stomach. The only negative, if Im in pain and my husband isn't home, it's kind of hard to apply to my own back!!! So I think this is a WONDERFUL medication for a person who can't orally take an anti-inflammatory medication! A true life saver!",

I can't say for sure what has relieved my pain, but ever since taking diclofenac my pain almost immediately has gone from being almost completely debilitated, to being able to function physically at the level I was at when pain started. Still have pain and not 100%, but my quality of life is back and I feel much more fluid and agile. For almost six months I could hardly get out of bed, let alone tie my shoes.",

After reading reviews I expected this to take away the pain immediately. It didn't, but knowing that everyone is different I kept trying and I'm glad I did. Now on day three my foot pain is much better, allowing me to walk. I have had no skin reaction. The smell of the ammonia carrier can be a bit overwhelming but it dissipates quickly.",

Even the low level fragrance has caused nausea after a half day's use. It's either the fragrance or a reaction to the gel. Didn't make much difference in my pain level.",

I'd feel a small reduction in pain level for about 30 minutes then it would spike back up. It caused my blood glucose to shoot up and I am non-diabetic. It also caused me a great deal of stomach cramps, burning pain below sternum, belching, heartburn and diarrhea. I had better response on Ibuprofen and that did very little.",
                    "I have been having severe back and neck pain for years and was taking ibuprofen 24 hours a day. My doctor told me that was very bad for my stomach and to use the Voltaren Gel instead and I found it to be wonderful, comfortable and it smells nice. Two days after I started using the Voltaren Gel I was so much more comfortable and now I alternate the ibuprofen 200 with the Gel and only use the Ibuprofen 200 two times a day. I can sleep a whole night. My back condition is in the muscles and and they are in spasm much of the time. Voltaren calms the spasms down and makes the pain tolerable. I am so glad to have found it.",

Tests for many conditions are negative, including rheumatoid arthritis, but we are still looking. Diclofenac was prescribed, and over the course of two weeks, the pain faded. I felt like a human being. I did not experience negative side effects. On the contrary, I did not suffer any of my standard migraines. Unfortunately, after 8 months, the VA hospital changed vendors and the new brand of Diclofenac was not effective. In the week following the change, I suffered all previous symptoms along with a migraine and upsurge in depression symptoms. Very frustrating. Still trying to sort it out.",
                    "Unbelievable. I just used this for the first time and had relief in about 15 minutes. 13 years of pain shots 12 doctors, 2 surgeries and I put on this gel and feel so much better. For me, it is a miracle.",

I had every test run from an Ortho and Neurologist with no reasoning for my neck problems other than Fibro. Sometime the back of my neck swells around two nerves on both sides that go into my arms and head, I've tried every narcotic there is but nothing but a Flector patch helps. Recently I had a very extensive knee surgery with an 8-12 month recovery time and once the incision healed I was given the okay to use these, they helped tremendously.

I have very inflamed painful bursitis under my scapula that throws all my muscles in my back/neck out of whack and creates a lot of transferred pain and problems for me. I was hoping this Voltaren gel my rheumatologist prescribed would help since the Celebrex and muscle relaxers alone are not doing the trick. But I do not detect any difference when I use it. However, I do occasionally get soreness in my left knee and when I tried it on that, it did seem to help.",

I first experienced drowsiness, which isn't anything to worry about until I started to not feel right in my head. Lasted for about 20 minutes. Then as I was standing in the kitchen making dinner I developed extreme nausea for about 5 minutes. This led to a rush shooting straight to my head and on came a dizzy spell that lasted for about 20 seconds. Followed by a partial black out for a split second, vision came back and I went to sit down moments later I was perfectly ok. Well besides feeling freaked out of course.

At my recent visit with him I was complaining of the same pain with no relief, he handed me two sample tubes of Voltaren Gel.

For me, the patches work better than pain pills. They are covered by my insurance at a higher co-pay. And, with each prescription, I have to go through this whole prior authorization wait period. Get samples from your doctor to test them out and make sure they work for you. If they do, then fight the insurance.

If I use them as directed (1 every 12hrs) they are most effective. There are some issues with the adhesive on the edges but I've found if I warm them with my hand they stick better. True, there is very little movement of fabric over the area as with back issues. I work with a personal trainer 5 days a week so the leg gets a lot of use. Mine is an unusual use for these patches, but they are definitely worth a try.",

I have taken other anti inflamitories before but they didn't seem to help but this drug has been fantastic. I have been able to work out again and it has really reduced the amount of knee and ankle pain I get. I take two 75 mgs tablets a day and have not had any side effects and I have been taking it for about 3 months. I would recommend this drug to anyone who has arthritis pain",

I work on a computer all day, typing and mousing. I apply 2 grams, 4 times a day to the elbow area. It makes working very tolerable. I would say Voltaren is a good treatment and really helps bring my arm function back to normal with no pain for tendonitis / Tennis Elbow. Aspercreme was also ok, but the Voltaren does better.

I take it with Zantac 150 to protect my stomach. I only need 1 pill a day. If in severe pain, I will also take a muscle relaxer called Norflex and I am able to rest and function and get much needed relief.",
                    "I live in Florida. This gel worked very nicely for my tennis elbow, shoulder pain and lower back pain. However, I JUST had an \"ah ha\" moment as to the mysterious, very itchy rash I have developed. The application areas reacted in the intense heat. Last summer while gardening I developed a severe lower back rash which I assumed was somehow sweat related. This year I developed the same painful, itchy rash on my right upper back (deltoid area and shoulder) down to my lower arm. Again, I thought it was from the heat and sweat. As I was applying it yesterday, I realized it was being applied directly on top of my rash. The ONLY places I have my rash. It took me long enough!! However, I did NOT get this rash in the cooler temps.",

After using Voltaren gel 2-3 times a day, after just 2 days pain was greatly reduced. And if there is any pain, it's only about a level 3 or 4. Have recently started using it on knees. Seems to help but not as dramatically as toe. I really like that fact that very little of the diclofenac goes systemic.",
                    "My daughter was given this gel for her leg pain but it had an adverse reaction for her. It burns her and she refuses to use it so she gave me a tube for my arthritis in both my knees, my hip, back and ankles. WOW! This is a dream come true. It seems to work immediately for me and putting it on right before bed allows me to sleep all night because I have slight to no pain. I wake up, use it and then my day goes by MUCH better. I'm going to try to remember to actually take it to work with me so I can apply it there. I keep forgetting. Praise God for allowing me to try this gel. I was leery at first but tried it anyway. I am TRULY amazed and will buy more and more and more. Thank you for this amazing discovery.",

Always seem to be hurting somewhere all the time, as well as really bad headaches. Couldn't take the pain any more tried it. It was wonderful so fast 30 to 45 mins. I was so grateful I cried out of relief. Finally took care of all of it...you got to try it. Thanks so much for this medicine.",

Pain was bad with little improvement the past 2 months, even with rehab/exercises and Vicodin and later Mobic (Meloxicam) and finally Motrin. Nothing worked. Couldn't sleep, constant ache from shoulder into my bicep. Rather than get a Cortisone shot yesterday, the doctor suggested I try a sample of the Flector Patch. I wore it last night and finally experienced some relief. I'd say the pain is about 75% better, and I managed to get some sleep. ",
                    "As an avid runner, I suffered a painful IT band (iliotibial band) strain on the outside of my left knee. Went to the doctor after a week of pain and not much healing taking place to make sure I didn't suffer any major ligament damage. He diagnosed the IT band issue and gave some samples of Flector Patch and as more of a comic relief, stated that \"these really shouldn't work, but actually do\". Was a little skeptical at first, but these patches do provide wonderful relief. Four patches later I am feeling much improvement in the mobility of my knee strain. Definitely worth a try.",

My doctor put me on this 2 years ago, 50mg once a day, and I honestly don't think I would survive the summer without it. One of my major problems I was getting out of bed in the morning, I couldn't even roll over the pain was so bad. So basically what I do is set my alarm 1/2 hour earlier so I can take it and let it work a little bit before I have to be up and out. I went from having to take so many days off of work to feeling so much relief. Since Physical Therapy didn't work for me, I will probably continue to take this as long as I have pain.",

POOR DESIGN on the pump.",

I get super stiff behind my knee, and it makes it hard to even walk, or straighten my leg all the way. I take ibuprofen, I ice it...and that helps some. I woke up this morning with it being extremely stiff behind my knee. I applied Pennsaid all over the back and front of my knee. No kidding - within 5 minutes, most of that stiffness is GONE. I am in shock. And if you have knee pain, you know how debilitating it can feel. This stuff is INSANE - in a good way!! I'm so glad I have it. I literally can't believe how much it helped me. And no, I don't work for a pharmaceutical company.",

I have not been overly impressed with either thus far. But I have noticed a little less stiffness and some range of motion. But in fairness the inflammation is no doubt very deep in both joints and would take time for the medicine to hit its target area. The Dr told me to give it time which I felt was reasonable. I find the gel to have a pleasant smell and rubs in nice and dries pretty quick. I am using the Voltaren Gel that says, diclofenac sodium topical gel 1%. Don't quote me but I believe they also make it with 2% diclofenac sodium?? With ins my cost was 42.00 for 5 tubes. Greasing both knees uses a lot",

It also decrease my need for vicodin which I'm scared of getting hooked on. I also have had a history of ulsers so I take protonix every day. I haven't had any problems yet!",

It is the fastest acting and most effective pain relief I have tried (comparing to Duexis, Hydrocodone, Prednisone, Tramadol). It does not cause stomach upset like other NSAIDS and the only side effect is sleepiness but, a quick nap and pain is much better and no grogginess.",

I was waking up due to pain and found moving extremely difficult and painful. I was at the point of taking pain relief before bed and again at around 4 a.m. With no expectations but exasperation I tried voltaren. It really has worked very much to my surprise!!! I did not expect such a good result or any result, I was just so fed up I grabbed a tube to mix up with the oral meds! It's helped my sleep in a matter of days and I'm much more comfortable. I don't take oral pain killers now and whilst I can still feel it, it's nowhere near the way it was. I can move properly again",

I have exercised on a regular basis for many years and in 2009 I injured my rotator cuff on a piece of gym equipment. After the physical therapy was finished I was experiencing sharp pain radiating from my shoulder to my neck. I asked my doctor at the time, a rheumatoligist, if this was arthritis now coming from the shoulder. He gave me a tube of Voltaren Gel to try and it has been wonderful.

We have had no side effects and we use it for major flare-ups as it is not intended for long term daily use. We each get a big tube, even though some might find it pricey, you don't have to use a lot it lasts a long time. The relief it provides is priceless. You should not take it with oral anti-inflammatories and ask a doctor before use if you have any medical conditions and/or take medications (even natural remedies). Great product.",

I'm still broken\"  I am on a 75mg dose, and within hours I could breathe and move much better- magical stuff. Pain is still there, but more like a sore muscle at this point... not like the sharp barbed wire in my chest feeling it had been. I have been eating with every dose, the doctor told me that this can be pretty harsh on your stomach if you are not careful. Hopefully I can decease my dose in a week. This is like a sledgehammer to inflamed tissue. No ill effects.",

I have been taking it for a very long time with no side effects what so ever. I cannot tell you that I have no pain at all. I just know that I would not be able to keep my full time job without this medication. I also would not be able to have any quality of life.

The MD this morning said to get blood work done for auto-immune checks and an OV with the surgeon. He then gave me 4 days of Zipsor 4 per day, and after this morning's tablet, it helped with the pain. Now at 4:30PM, it is time for tablet #2. Good Results - Thanks!",

Some days I don't even need to wear my wrist brace anymore. Just wish it wasn't so expensive. Even with my health insurance the prescription was pretty expensive.",

I take it as soon as I feel a migraine coming, and Zipsor stops the migraine in 15 minutes (at the longest 30 mins). It does not leave me in a weird fog like Zomig or Imitrex.

I also suffer from osteoarthritis in my knees with one having had meniscus surgery 3.5 years ago, and also sciatica and disc herniation in lower back ect. I cannot take NSAIDs orally because they affect my heart rate and blood pressure . I am extremely sensitive to medication. My ortho doctor prescribed these to try for my shoulder and I was pleasantly surprised that they help as much as they do. I have since tried them for a sciatica flare up, worked very well, and also cut one in half and put each half on a knee last night because I was in a lot of pain , knees are great today! Tape to reinforce, stretch patch 1st . I only use as needed not daily.",

I go off it for weeks at a time to give my body a chance to recover from any ill effects like stomach rupturing (bleeding etc) then I go back on it again and enjoy the results. I think it makes me feel tired in the early evenings but its worth that inconvenience. I refuse to endure a life of continual discomfort. I take it with Losec to reduce the risk of stomach damage and would highly recommend it.",

I have had metal put into my back to correct the bone structure and then had the metal taken out about 4 years later. I have been on the gel for about one year off and on as needed. It helps bring down the pain I experience on a bad day. It takes a little while to work but it gets me to sleep at night when the pain is really bad. I have degenerative joint/disc disease and also problems with my periformus muscle and this gel helps bring down the pain. I recommend it and only need to use it 2x a day as per the directions.

Gave me some exercises and pain relief meds Nothing really worked then I took cataflam which lets the pain go away for 2-3 days (from one pill) I really don't know how it works but its the best medicine for backpain I have taken so far. I just hope it doesnt have side effects on the long run",

If I had stronger pain, I did diclofenac shots to myself and that helped a lot. What I noticed, the quality of the European diclofenac is much higher. After staying on the US production or maybe because of aging (or both), I've started feeling side effects: GERD and stomachache at night.

Unfortunately, I found out that it is supposed to work to relieve the pain each time it is used. It certainly doesn't do this for me--I may as well be applying lotion for all the good it does me. It really does nothing at all. I'm really disappointed, as my pain management doctor just weaned me off of narcotics, so I don't have anything that helps with the pain at the moment. I'll have to go see him again to get something else. It is so frustrating to try to find something that works, since everyone is different.",

My doctor prescribed this after the pain clinic refused to give me a steroid injection for pain relief. It's more effective than anything else I've tried. I take a prescription drug for the pain and then put this cream on 4 or 5 times a day. Within minutes of applying it the pain dissipates & I'm pain free for several hours. This stuff works better than numbing yourself with ice. It helps the pain in both hips and my lower spine. I was given 3% strength & it rocks!",

I thought it was my imagination but I have tested it out several times, I am not itchy In the area that I apply the gel, but it must get into your bloodstream and I have several areas of my body that start itching at the same time.

First dosage caused me itches (I have had a slight reaction to Naproxen Sodium also) so was not too worried. I don't really see much reduction of pain and it appears a larger dose would give me hives. Many years ago I had tremendous shoulder pain and was prescribed Baclofen. THAT drug helped me completely.

On a bad day I take a dose of Cambia and an Imitrex subcutaneous injection and it completely knocks out my migraine! In all my years of having migraines I never thought that was possible.

The scent is mild after a few minutes, and so is my pain level. After a particularly painful day I may apply twice.

But try cutting these in half and wrapping around thumb down to lower joint, surprised they stay on fairly well but they are ugly white, I can't wear out of the house. Besides, nowhere does it say they are for arthritis pain, just minor aches, sprains, strains etc. Afraid to use continually or long term due to s-e's.

Even though my sisters are pharmacists, they always told me that the less medicines I take, the better it would be. So I tried not to use it.

Today I've been a lot more comfortable - it seems like it took three doses to get started. I was even able to yawn earlier and I spent a little time sleeping lying down this morning - both of which would've been impossible yesterday.",
                    "This is a magic pills for a tooth extraction pain. I had a lower second molar surgical extraction. After 4 days my pills was finished and 5th day I had terrible pain. Doctor gave me Diclofenac tablets again for 5 days. 30 minutes After taken the pill my pain totally gone. That's why I called magic pills.",
                    "I have been treated for plantar fasciitis (heel spurs) in my foot for 8 weeks - having several painful shots with little relief. I have only taken 3 doses of the Voltaren and I am feeling 90% pain free! I hope this will only improve with a little more treatment. I have had no noticeable side effects as of yet.",
                    "I have ulcers so I can't take ANY oral NSAIDS or aspirin or any blood thinning medication. I have severe osteoarthritis in my knees, back, shoulders, elbows, feet, neck, and back. I am only 24 and I also have fibromyalgia. I have been using Voltaren cream from 3 years and it is wonderful. My opiate pain medication helps so much but in between doses I use the cream to get by. Without it I can't function at a normal level and it hurts to bad to cook, shower, or do any basic activity. I have had no side effects. Although after I shave it burns to put it on my knees but that's just because I had just shaved.",
                    "I have been on the patch for about 4 months now. It has by far worked better than anything else I have tried. I am about to change out of it because my body has been building a resistance to it. It is working only about 40% compared to before but I don't blame the patch. I think it's fantastic. Hope it works for you..",
                    "It works very well for my joint pain, my feet hurt so bad when I walk on them for 10 mins or longer and my lower back when I sit or stand 10 mins or longer. Voltaren gel eases the pain but does not take it completely away. I'm much worse without it. I notice someone was taking Motrin while using this gel, I read to not use certain medications when using this gel, double check please, just want people to be safe or ask doctors.",
                    "Took diclofenac 75 mg DR (delayed release) twice / day for 1 month, then once / day for 2 weeks, then stopped.  Worked well with 90-95% improvement in reduced pain and stiffness due to inflammation from one degenerative disk in lower back and some osteoarthritis --- within 3-4 days !  No side effects. Take with food on the stomach. Drink more water than normal to flush system and hydrate kidneys.",
                    "I was diagnosed with sciatic pain that affected my back and right thigh. I used the gel liberally as the pain increased. Eight days ago I stopped as my right thigh was experiencing a burning sensation in the area where I had applied the gel. I still have the burning sensation.I am on various drugs for hypettension.",
                    "Diclofenac really helped with my arthritic hip pain & heel spur pain the first two weeks, but I had to stop taking it because it caused dizziness, nausea, nightmares, insomnia, irritability, headaches, pressure in ears, muscle weakness, fatigue, decreased urine output, worse joint pains when worn-off, liver pain.",

                    "Works really well , but the size of the tube compared to the box it comes in is very very deceiving , when I bought my 50g one thought it was going to be bigger when it came out the box I thought someone had switched it for a smaller version just look before you buy",
                    "I have been using Voltaren for sometime now and it brings me immediate relief. My muscles seem to be effected by the arthritis I have, and the Voltaren helps those muscles to relax and not knot up on me. I love the stuff!",
                    "Just diagnosed with arthritis. I have osteoporosis now. Have only been using this for 3 days and it works wonderful. It eases my neck pain to wear I hardly feel any hurt. I'm weary of the side effects so don't know how long I will use this cream but I tell you what, if I hurt, this cream is the 1st thing I would go for!",
                    "This gel was prescribed to me to help wean me off of strong dose of anti-inflammatory. I have a bone bruise on my knee and the orthopedic doctor said it will take a year to heal. I am unable to do my usual 4 miles on the treadmill or even walk around the block. When I ease off the anti-inflammatory medicine, my knee swells up and I can barely walk. This has not helped my knee that much. However, I have started to use it for some swelling/pain in my thumb and I also have some lower back and neck pain and it helps.",
                    "Before being diagnosed with Ankylosing Spondylitis I was treated for general chronic back pain. I was started on Ibuprofen, but had to up the dosage. My GP changed me to Diclofenac (50mg 2x daily) but I didn't find it effective. I went back to 100mg 4x daily Ibuprofen which was much more effective for me.  I had no side effects while taking it.",
                    "Have only used it twice, and ONLY as a \"rescue\" med from my Dr. It worked within 20 minutes and lasted the whole day. I'm only instructed to use it no more than twice a week. I suffer all the other days and have had this headache for 4 years now. Also starting some new meds to figure out what will PREVENT them.",
                    "I was prescribed Diclofenac 75 mg, for chest pain. It did nothing for me. I think my chest pain was due to anxiety and indigestion, so I stopped taking it after 1 day. A year later I woke up one morning with a stiff neck. I thought nothing of it and went to a trampoline park where I came down with a thud on my bum. No biggie, I'm pretty resilient at 32. The next day I had excruciating pain in my upper left back, neck and shoulder. My muscle at the collar bone was cramped tight! I waited 2 weeks and there was little relief, no sleep. I found my Diclofenac and it helped in an hour! NO PAIN! I slept for a full night! I see doc tomorrow for an MRI and diagnosis.",
                    "My doctor prescribed this for inflammation in my lower back area, I have been on it for one week. My shoulder and neck pain is gone almost completely and my back feels a lot better. As of today its been 5 days I have been on this product. The info says it takes two weeks..am hoping it just gets better. Very impressed.",

I am a 44 year old male employed full time and spend long periods of time on my feet quite frequently.I can not say enough how much this drug improved my life. My knee pain was getting so bad I thought I was going to need replacement surgery. I can take long walks and run up the stairs again. One caution is to make sure you eat with food and drink plenty of water throughout the day. A glass of milk and a banana does the trick. t will give you an upset stomach if you don't.",
                    "In 1981 I had severe heel pain and was living in Germany. I was prescribed a topical gel called Rheumone gel. It worked great. I had occasion to use it several times while we lived there. When I got back to the States, no luck in finding it. Then, about 6 months ago my daughter was prescribed Voltaren Gel. Hurrah! It is made in Germany by the same company as the Rheumone gel. It smells the same and works the same. My doctor has prescribed it to me for the arthritis and pain. It does a wonderful job.",
                    "I was hit by a police car in 2002. I was in recovery for a year. From the head down. Broken jaw, 4 disks crushed my neck. Both collar bones, 7 broken ribs and a shatered pelvis. So many pills, patches and injections. Under the knife many times. A real humpty dumpty story. I have more pins, screws in me than your local hard wear store. Note: I don't want to over state the how effective it is but it works. Talking to my doctor about the pain. He gave me this to try. Well my 1st thought was \"just another snake oil\" But it'sfreak'in amazing, it works like magic. Why did I not recive this years ago. The Drugest gave me a stupid look. And said it just became generic. All those years I would have paid anything. When your in pain, money is no object",
                    "This morning (my first day) I was shaking and in tears. That's how bad my cramps have become during the past year. I was given a diclofenac (voltaren) injection 30 min ago and now am almost completely at ease. Considering that I'd tried nearly everything (ibuprofen, panadol ex, buscopan, spasm relaxers etc etc), I'm umderstandably excited and can't wait to share this. I tried the tablets last month and this morning but they aren't as effective as the injection. My advice is if it's debilitating - definetely go for the injection ASAP. Don't wait.",
                    "My dr gave me Voltaren Gel to help relieve my Ilio-Inguinal Neuralgia as a sample. I don't have a specific dosage, just when it hurts, apply the cream. It works amazing! I mainly use it for break-through pain between doses, and days like this with storms and hectic days at work, I'm able to concentrate on work instead of trying to take my mind off of the pain. Does this come in gallon size with a push handle? Maybe a bath bomb I could put in my jacuzzi tub? Just askin...",
                    "I have severe osteoarthritis in both knees, and arthritis in my back, and shoulders. My doctor prescribed Voltaren because I built up a resistance to ibuprofen and Aleve. I've been in pain for so long I forgot what it was like to be pain free. A little nervous over the long term side effects, so hoping I can get the weight off so I can be medication free. Just thankful to be able to move and do things I love without pain.",
                    "I have been taking Firocet for years and it has been moderately effective for my migraines , which I usually have one per week. My Dr. last week recommended Cambia, was skeptical about it but was in agony and gave it a try. Within 45 minutes I was up and functional. Will only use in severe cases. Also very costly if you have no insurance.",

I have degenerative disc disease in my neck and lower back, as well as osteoarthritis in my hips and right shoulder (right shoulder is due to a broken humeral head and torn muscle from a 4-wheeler accident). 2 years ago I wrecked my 4-wheeler, so bad that I could not walk or even bathe myself for 2 weeks. I have been in severe pain and have tried everything, including nerve block injections, and incredibly high pain medicines (including Valium and Oxycodone). The doctor gave me this gel a week ago and said to use it for my neck. My neck is doing great, and after reading all of these reviews I am going to try it on my hips and shoulder!",
                    "My doctor prescribed this medication for arthritis in my feet. It worked great and within a few days there was no pain in my feet, or anywhere else for that matter. After about 2 weeks, however, I developed heartburn and intestinal cramps so severe that I passed out on 2 occasions. If you can handle the side effects, this medicine works wonders for pain and inflammation.",
                    "I've been on this now for 5 months and it is by far the best pain medicine out there. No high feeling or anything like that. If your doctor has you on Celebrex and you don't feel any relief, ask him for Voltaren. You will most certainly feel the difference. If you are on it for any length of time (like me) then every so often you'll have to have blood work done to check your kidneys and liver to make sure they are functioning right as this medicine can cause problems with that. For me everything is good to go so far. I swear by Voltaren.",
                    "I found this medication online with some web searches during major migraine. I asked my neurologist for a prescription and fortunately she agreed. She'd never heard of it before, so was hesitant. My insurance covers this a better price than other migraine abortants. It's my go to now. I highly recommend. Use as little water as possible, then rinse the cup with water and drink whatever residue. It works wonders and truly dosen't taste bad.",
                    "I used the gel for 2 1/2 months after TKR 3-4 times/day. Part of the time I used the extra-strength version. I thought that it was moderately effective for pain and swelling. However, three weeks after stopping I still cannot get the odor out of my body. The extra-strength version has a different carrier, thicker and with a strong odor, and I would not use it again.",
                    "Due to a recent accident my orthopedic doctor prescribed this for my knee swelling/bursitis condition. I'm a 51yr-old female and after 2-3 weeks of taking this medicine I was experiencing hot flashes frequently about 5X a day especially at night that wakes me up, which never occurred before. I thought I was pretty young to be experiencing this, but this website was the second place where I researched this medicine where it states \"works by reducing hormones\" that explains my hot flashes recently. I still need to take a few more pills and swelling has subsided in my knee but do not intend to take this long-term.",

Had to have an upper endoscopy to find the cause of my symptoms. I had burns to my lower esphagus and mild stomach bleeding. My doctor told me that a side effect of this medication (ointment applied to the skin on my face) can destroy the mucus lining in the stomach. Use with extreme caution!",
                    "I was prescribed Flector patches after surgery to repair my collarbone, which came with frozen shoulder that I've been getting physical therapy on for weeks. I have not used the patches regularly, just when I have a little pain. Early on I had pain in the shoulder area but could not place the patch directly on the shoulder because of the surgical scar. The patches helped somewhat. Now I have some pain for stepping up workouts on the shoulder, and I can place the patch directly on the pain area, and it's working wonderfully. The patch has a kind of numbing feeling, and overall the feeling can be compared to what ibuprofen does in reducing inflammation. The patches can make me a little sleepy. They also can be a little large for certain spots",

Each time I got very stiff with painful joints. I've tried most of the other arthritis NSAIDS and none work nearly as well. My Dr. runs a liver function test every 6 months.",
                    "Use for lower back pain and spine arthritis. The patches make it possible to function, significant pain relief. It helps to tape the edges down with athletic tape otherwise the edges catch on clothing and pull the patch loose. Far fewer side effects than oral NSAIDS and better relief.",

                    "The patch works well as part of a program. It and Percocet (7.5/350) work well together, 800mg ibuprofen less so. They are more effective to prevent pain for me, so don't wait for the pain to use a patch.",
                    "This medicine was a joke it did nothing for my bulging back disc pain",
                    "Personally it's the best gel I have used to warm up my back muscles, making the muscles feel like I've stretched for 15 - 20 min. Don't expect miracles. You should not be expecting this gel to completely alleviate back pain. It's not supposed to do that. It's supposed to get your muscles to a place where you can do other things more easily to attain painlessness via a combined effort. For a lot of back pain, if you use the gel in conjunction with consistent stretching (twice daily) whilst consuming the correct diet and being active enough to lower your body weight, you will be in a much better place in no time - so be encouraged! The gel really helps you do the things you need to do physically to get to that place.",

                    "I have tried 3 other medications and this is the only one that worked well for me.

For the last 3 years I have reduced to 1x50D mg per day and really feel very comfortable. I found it very effective and I didn't noticed any side effects yet.

Worst episodes included my inability to pick up a coffee cup with my left hand, pain level of 7, inability to sleep on my left side etc.  After 6 months of this, I visited my G.P who x-rayed my shoulder and found arthritic changes.

If you're having trouble with it adhering to the skin, make sure the area is free from oils, either naturally or lotions or soap residue. I have no problems at all with them. My RA flared up in addition to my cocyx broken off, literally. The pain was so severe that oral meds weren't effective. It took several days to feel the beginning of relief, and I've improved steadily. If you've used these short term and are the impatient type, chill out and give them a chance. They do work.",

I'm now 80% better and changing the patch every 12 hours as prescribed to me. The first day (for whatever reason), I got a surge of energy when I first put on the patch. The pain subsided to about a level 3 from a level 6 after wearing it for just a few short hours.  Do not stop wearing the patch as the pain will come back quickly. I did have to supplement the pain with additional meds after I did some light home repairs (despite the the warnings) and this kept the pain level down.",

I also have knees that ache and pop and shoulder and elbow issues as well as pain and spasms in my back.

In that year I have had total knee replacement (left knee), then two more \"revisions\" on the same knee to get rid of an infection. Just weeks ago, I came to the conclusion that Celebrex just wasn't getting the job done for my pain, and of course I did not want to take narcotics. I did a lot of research (the reviews on this site were immensely helpful) and decided to give Diclofenac a try. It has been fantastic, and I feel better than I have in years.",

Relief comes within 10 to 15 minutes. Maybe even less on an empty stomach. Pain, throbbing, sensitivity, all of it. Best part- I can take it at work (elementary special needs teacher) with no impairment, drowsiness, or pesky side effects whatsoever. That's a BIG deal when working with kids.

After I stopped taking the pills, about a week now, I've had horrible pain in both knees that I didn't have before, and the pain in my foot is back.

I not only suffer with common symptoms, debilitating headache, nausea, light/sound sensitivities, I also have numbness, unilateral paralysis, and even blindness. I've tried most approved treatments, including \"off label\" medications, with ranging levels of relief.  I've yet to find a preventative aka \"miracle drug\", although, botox has effectively reduced the number of my \"headache\" days. At any rate, my migraine specialist gave me samples of Cambia at last visit and today I remembered I had it. It quickly took a level 9 to a level 3.",

But I noticed weeks later, severe back pain that affected my ability to stand for a long period of time without feeling light headed from the pain. No over the counter pain killers helped. When my doctor prescribed me this, it immediately went away. The only side effect I've experienced is feeling fatigued. Like most medications, though, my tolerance for it has built up quickly. And when I don't take it, the pain catches up on me quickly. It's difficult for me to get out of bed if I go more than a day without it.

After having a large mass removed from my leg, the knee got worse and was swollen until I couldn't walk without a cane or walker. I went to the doctor to see if I could get a shot to help me walk and he gave me a tube of Voltaran Gel to use. I came home, put it on the knee and propped my leg up for an hour. When I was ready to get up, I dreaded it because I just knew I was going to be in horrible pain again. But, the pain was almost all gone.

I used this gel for about 2 months twice daily on the lip. I must mention that there absolutely no effect of this medication on my lip. A total waste of money if you don't have insurance as it can be quite expensive without it.  Then I was prescribed all sort of other creams which was nothing but a waste of money on moisturizers. Don't feel bad to question the dermatologist as to what the cream does and whether it will cure you. The most essential treatment for single or isolated AKs is cryotherapy - liquid nitrogen spray.",

No one can really tell or know when you have went too far because you are suppose to hurt and be in pain. If you are in pain, it means that your body muscles are stretching and you are making room for more muscles to fit. Many people don't understand that when you go home then that's when the adrenaline wears off and you start to think \"I went a little too far that time\".  Since most of what I do is shoulder press, I have to say that this back patch for pain has saved me from several night where I wouldn't have been able to sleep.

                    "My grandmother had Voltaren gel for her, but when my knee wouldn't bend and I began to have pain, she let me use her gel. So far, I've placed it on my right knee and the pain was almost gone. I've placed the gel on again and the pain is disappearing. I'm 19 and there is no way I should be having joint pain...the gel works great.",
                    "Have been using Pennsaid for over eight years but strictly on an as needed basis (2-3) times a week. Very effective for knees and hips (almost instant relief). Only side effect is an occasional oral off taste.",

In desperation and since I have a type of neuropathy in my feet and cannot fall asleep, I applied 1/2 the dosage she was prescribed. To my surprise it allows me to fall asleep at night without the pain and discomfort in my feet. I will be seeing my doctor to get this prescribed for me! I have been looking for relief for over 5 years!",

It's about the same as a single Ibuprofen (Advil) which is to say not useful for serious pain. Everyone's different I guess. Unfortunately my doctor refuses to prescribe anything else.",

When I injured My shoulder, I remembered that had the Voltaren so I figured it couldn't hurt to try it. WOW!! AMAZING!! Nothing I have tried orally can even come close to the Voltaren. It is like a miracle. I have never found any medication for anything that was more effective. I guess it just works better for some injuries than others. It is , however, very short acting. But the pain relief it provides is priceless. I have arthritis in my hands, I don't find it helps with that pain. For the certain types of injury it works better than narcotic medication. Smells great Absorbs quickly.",

I'm 38 now & I've battled this since I was a child. I have this intense burning ache that began as a child in my feet & has gotten worse over time. It also affects my hands. It used to just act up at bedtime, so bad at times that I had to wrap my feet in ice packs to get relief. Now it's all hours & hands/feet and I have a stiffness and severe putting edema that pops up & then disappears with no regularity. There's no explanation from Doctor's YET. I was given this cream and I rub it into my hands, wrists, feet, & lower legs. It does seem to calm things some, reduces the burn.",

I am able to walk 2-3 miles a day with minimal pain, walk up and down steps, and sleep better. I haven't noticed any significant side effects -- perhaps very mild constipation.

But for me I am happy to have the new knee replacements.",

I received the generic Diclofenac 50 mg. and was very excited about receiving any kind of help making it through a migraine which sometimes lasts 8 days, sometimes 2 days. Anyway, I took it three times a day the first two days and sporadically for another two or three days. It worked very well much to my surprise; however, after that I experienced the stomach burn I read someone else experienced. I didn't realize what had caused the burning until I read the reviews on this med. I'm a little afraid to take it again unless I just take it one or two days next time. Try it.",

                    "I had back surgery 6 months ago, three discectomies, and a rod and five screws implanted. While it is stated it is not approved for spinal use, I have found Voltaren extremely beneficial. While I still have pain in the neighborhood of an 8 out of 10, I feel that it would always be a 10 without Voltaren. Many thanks to my PA for recommending it.",
                    "Long story kinda short! My knee swelled up where I couldn't even bend it. My mom gave me a tube of her gel. It worked right away when I applied it. Great stuff. Here's the best part though. I have a bulge in my lower back. I have meloxacam but I don't take it regularly because I feel that it don't help any. So one day my back is as hurting really bad so I decided to apply the gel. Glad I did because wow! It works amazing! They should most definitely test it on the back. I know surgery will be the only thing for permanent relief but I'm only 31 and one can't afford it and two it's not guarantee it would work and could make my problem worse. Next time I go to my doctor I will be asking for my own prescription.",
                    "The first time my doctor suggested Voltaren cream. I have osteo in both knees, right ankle and my spine. After several tubes and no reduction of pain or swelling my doctor suggested Pennsaid . The difference was like day and night. Not only did it reduce the pain but the swelling in my ankle was also reduced. When I investigated both products I was shocked to find that only Pennsaid contains a delivery agent DMSO that Voltaren does not . So it seems the DMSO delivers directly into the joint while the Voltaren only stays on the skin. Bottom line I will never spend my money on anything else going forward ....Pennsaid works for me.",
                    "I love this gel. Just 10 seconds after I put it on an area with severe pain, the pain is gone completely for 2 hours. I couldn't believe it the first time I used it. I take some other strong prescription medication for knee and back pain and the medications don't do as good a job on the pain as this gel. I wish I could use it more than 4 times a day, but during my waking hours, it is a God send. Thank you, thank you, thank you! I would do a commercial for Voltaren Gel anytime, for free!",

The combination provided no discernible pain relief. However, I did suffer from significant stomach and intestinal pain. The stomach & intestinal pain stopped within 12 hours of discontinuing the Zipsor. Overall, not a pleasant experience.",
                    "I had tried Lidoderm and had fair to good results. I was reluctant to try the Flector because of the cost. My insurance did not cover them.  In an impulsive act due to frustration with pain, I got the script filled. Within 2 hours I noticed that the severe pain in my knee was almost gone, and I slept very well through the night. These are a miracle and work as well as or better than any systemic medicine including narcotics. They really do work. ",

                    "My doctor prescribed Voltaren after an extremely painful IUD insertion and subsequent cramping. I've never had cramps like these before. I'd literally be curled up in the fetal position, unable to even talk. Depending on the level of pain, this either completely eradicated it or made it totally bearable, and lasted for 12 hours at a stretch. Voltaren is wonderful and I'm glad my doctor recommended it over a narcotic painkiller.",

I also have bursitis & piriformis syndrome in my right hip as well as achilles tendonitis in the right foot. I take 75mg 2 times a day. My knees are so bad that I had to have Synvisc-One injections as well. Combined I have been able to work my 12 hr shifts as an RN. I still have pain that's about a 6-7 after working three 12's in a row, but would not be able to work at all without the Voltaren. I am looking to have my knees replaced in the near future. The only side effect I have had is stomach upset if I do not take it with food and some mild constipation. I would recommend this medicine to anyone. ",

For a different issue my physician told me to stop the Aleve and try Diclofanac Sodium. My body is very happy. No back, neck, ankle, toe, shoulder pain. My shoulder range of motion is almost 100%.

I've since called my podiatrist asking for a full prescription based on the relief I already feel.",

I'm using much less than the 2gram dose - maybe 1/4 to 1/2 a gram on a joint, tops - and having at least 8 hours pain free. It seems no studies were conducted on it's use on shoulders, but it worked decently enough for mine when I pinched a nerve.  Make sure you read the possible side effects and all the potential negatives, and test on a single area with someone with you for a couple hours just to make sure you're not allergic. It's been problem-free for me, but everyone's body chemistry is different.",

Diclofenac does not relieve all of my pain, but it relieves 60-70 percent of it, or enough to allow me to have a life. For me it appears to be safe and effective. The only side -effect I've experienced is occasional mild constipation. I recommend it highly.",

My ligaments and tendons are weak and has been affecting my joints, needing to have 2 neck surgeries, bunions, and wrist surgery. I switched over to the generic Diclofenac 3% gel. Let me tell you it works! Unfortunately this higher dose costs anywhere from $600.00 - $1,100.00 for a 100 Gram tube. Downside is that it's marketed for skin Actinic Keratosis.",

By the end of second day the arm was black swollen and painful. Emergency room visit did not provide any relief other than telling Me to discontinue use of gel. I have a artificial heart valve that requires that I take blood thinner which was discussed with the prescribing physician and had been used as prescribed. The arm continued to swell and the blackness continued down the arm with pain that became unbearable. A ambulance was summoned to take me back to the hosital emergency room personnel could not diganose the situation completely and I was admitted to the ward. Surgery was required",

My pain had increased to the point where I had to have two radiofrequency (RF) neurotomy procedures performed to varying degrees of success. Pain returned, so tried Percocet 5/325 2x day for a month but only provided a temporary relief until the dose would wear off. I became concerned about opiate dependency so I made the decision to stop. Started Diclofenac 75mg ('551' on one side and a fancy 'R' on the other) 1xday and had a SIGNIFICANT reduction in pain after just two days. Bloodwork shows that it does mildly elevate my liver enzymes (ALT of 60) and has slightly lowered RBC, WBC & platelets which is a common side effect. Benefits outweigh the risk at this point, so will continue.",

This gel works well and very quickly in my case, and with bracing and icing I have experienced a lot of relief. The nature of this pain reliever is anti inflammatory - not numbing - so I don't think you would find use for it if your pain is not of the inflammatory nature. I get spastic and tense neck muscles all the time and find heat and massages work better. So for the right purpose it is excellent stuff. I am sensitive, delicate skinned and had no allergies but I would be careful and spot test nonetheless.",

I am a chiropractic student, so I went the conservative route first: adjustment, ultrasound, cold laser, Alpha-stim, microcurrent probes. Finally I had a series of x-rays on campus and unfortunately, there is a large osteophyte on the volar (palm) side of the base of the 1st metacarpal, along with serious lipping of the scaphoid bone which supports it (you know this combination as the saddle joint). Voltaren helps the crippling pain of trying to unscrew a jar, open a doorknob, or hold a pen. I will however have surgery to remove the osteophyte.",

I only rubbed in a small amount. I can't swear by it but I think it also caused me to have several anxiety attacks which I think are related to the woozy out of it feeling. It says it makes you dizzy on the box.",

I didn't have high hopes, but it is WONDERFUL!  Because I have had Gastric Bypass surgery, I can not take NSAIDS which pretty much leaves me, Tylenol! I did sneak an Aleve after being in so much pain and I was so sick to my stomach. The only negative, if Im in pain and my husband isn't home, it's kind of hard to apply to my own back!!! So I think this is a WONDERFUL medication for a person who can't orally take an anti-inflammatory medication! A true life saver!",

Now on day three my foot pain is much better, allowing me to walk. I have had no skin reaction. The smell of the ammonia carrier can be a bit overwhelming but it dissipates quickly.",

My doctor told me that was very bad for my stomach and to use the Voltaren Gel instead and I found it to be wonderful, comfortable and it smells nice. Two days after I started using the Voltaren Gel I was so much more comfortable and now I alternate the ibuprofen 200 with the Gel and only use the Ibuprofen 200 two times a day.

Tests for many conditions are negative, including rheumatoid arthritis, but we are still looking. Diclofenac was prescribed, and over the course of two weeks, the pain faded. I felt like a human being. I did not experience negative side effects. On the contrary, I did not suffer any of my standard migraines. Unfortunately, after 8 months, the VA hospital changed vendors and the new brand of Diclofenac was not effective. In the week following the change, I suffered all previous symptoms along with a migraine and upsurge in depression symptoms. Very frustrating. Still trying to sort it out.",
                    "Unbelievable. I just used this for the first time and had relief in about 15 minutes. 13 years of pain shots 12 doctors, 2 surgeries and I put on this gel and feel so much better. For me, it is a miracle.",

I had every test run from an Ortho and Neurologist with no reasoning for my neck problems other than Fibro. Sometime the back of my neck swells around two nerves on both sides that go into my arms and head, I've tried every narcotic there is but nothing but a Flector patch helps. Recently I had a very extensive knee surgery with an 8-12 month recovery time and once the incision healed I was given the okay to use these, they helped tremendously. I now have an injury while recovering and they are my life saver once again. They are very expensive but worth every penny.",

It worked for me, I noticed a significant 'loosening' of my 'tight' shoulder muscles with just one application. I'm sold! I'm gonna get mom to give it another go!",

I have very inflamed painful bursitis under my scapula that throws all my muscles in my back/neck out of whack and creates a lot of transferred pain and problems for me. I was hoping this Voltaren gel my rheumatologist prescribed would help since the Celebrex and muscle relaxers alone are not doing the trick. But I do not detect any difference when I use it.

I first experienced drowsiness, which isn't anything to worry about until I started to not feel right in my head. Lasted for about 20 minutes. Then as I was standing in the kitchen making dinner I developed extreme nausea for about 5 minutes. This led to a rush shooting straight to my head and on came a dizzy spell that lasted for about 20 seconds. Followed by a partial black out for a split second, vision came back and I went to sit down moments later I was perfectly ok. Well besides feeling freaked out of course. I would never recommend this medicine to anyone.",

At my recent visit with him I was complaining of the same pain with no relief, he handed me two sample tubes of Voltaren Gel.

These pain patches basically feel like happiness surrounding my wrist. I still have pain but it is at a much more tolerable level. I have my life back. For me, the patches work better than pain pills. They are covered by my insurance at a higher co-pay. And, with each prescription, I have to go through this whole prior authorization wait period. Get samples from your doctor to test them out and make sure they work for you. If they do, then fight the insurance. For my wrist, I am able to cut the patches into 2 halves and makes the prescription last longer. These saved my life.",

I was prescribed the patches with the caveat that \"they may not work.\" They work very well and my pain has decreased between 75-90%. If I use them as directed (1 every 12hrs) they are most effective. There are some issues with the adhesive on the edges but I've found if I warm them with my hand they stick better. True, there is very little movement of fabric over the area as with back issues. I work with a personal trainer 5 days a week so the leg gets a lot of use. Mine is an unusual use for these patches, but they are definitely worth a try.",

Looks like I'll still be getting my Hyalgen shot on Friday. I will follow up with my Doc(I used a free-sample) and go from there.

A friend turned me on to Voltaren Gel . I used it on my knees, neck, and lower back. This is as close to a miracle as I have experienced in my 50 years of arthritis producing activities. The best part is that dosing is applied directly and only to the problem areas so consequently much less ends up in your system overall than if taken orally. Win. Win.",

I have taken other anti inflamitories before but they didn't seem to help but this drug has been fantastic. I have been able to work out again and it has really reduced the amount of knee and ankle pain I get. I take two 75 mgs tablets a day and have not had any side effects and I have been taking it for about 3 months. I would recommend this drug to anyone who has arthritis pain",

I work on a computer all day, typing and mousing. I apply 2 grams, 4 times a day to the elbow area. It makes working very tolerable. I would say Voltaren is a good treatment and really helps bring my arm function back to normal with no pain for tendonitis / Tennis Elbow. Aspercreme was also ok, but the Voltaren does better. Mild stretching, exercise and movement also help and are made much easier with the Voltaren.",

All the alternatives have not worked, so persuaded a new Rhumatologist to re-instate it for short while and life was good again. I had no side effects from this drug.

I occasionally apply Voltaren ahead of time if I know I'm going to be on my feet a lot. ",
                    "Often my jaw cramps up and hurts more than my knees do before a storm. The Voltaren Gel also helps with the bone pain I get along my temples and at the base of my skull, so I am thankful that it is a non-greasy gel instead of a cream. (These areas of pain come from a compression head injury I got as a teenager.) I have a lot of problems trying to take anything for the arthritis in oral form, and I still take Aciphex along with using the Voltaren Gel as a precaution. (This product works well with even less than the amount suggested, so a tube goes further for me; I use up about 1 1/2 tubes each month.)",
                    "Cambia is Diclofenac Potassium. This company added flavor consisting of mint and anis (liquorish flavor). Also they added aspartame which is not a good thing. They charge hundreds of dollars for only nine powders. The actual drug of Diclofenac Potassium is cheap and you get a 30 day supply. I just crushed the pill into a powder and took with water just like the Cambia...worked just as fast and tasted better, because it had NO taste. Don't be fooled by the makers of Cambia. It is just another Epi Pen scandal story.",
                    "I love Cambia. I took 4 doses of Imitrex in a 24 hour period and couldn't get rid of a migraine. Out of desperation I took a sample dose of Cambia my doctor gave me and my migraine was gone in 15 minutes. I called my doctor and had him call in a prescription for me. It was the fastest acting pain reliever ever.",

I had recent shoulder surgery for the third time in my life, and this was prescribed for inflammation and pain. As it did decrease the inflammation, the side effects were not worth it. I developed stomach cramps, and severe diarrhea.",

I am 52 now and my Dr prescribed this medication for the arthritis in my hands, it didn't seem to help my hands a lot but I tried it on my ankle one night and literally within 5 minutes the pain was gone. It is amazing and I love this stuff.",
                    "I have been taking VOLTAREN for about two weeks now. I have found that the medicine works very well. What an advantage to be able to apply the gel right to the affected area, relief comes rather fast. It doesn't last as long as I would like, but when you are in pain, any relief is welcome. Used in conjunction with my other medicines it has helped me to put together a medication regime that helps me to live with this condition. If you have tried oral medicines with negative side effects, please give VOLTAREN a try. I hope you find the relief that I have.",
                    "I had a foot fracture 10 months ago and had my screw removed three months ago. I cannot take oral NSAIDS because of a stomach problem. I was taking lortab every day, one or two, in the later part of the day to make it through. I used one inch of Votaren Gel where I have the residual arthritis and covered it and taped it. After two hours I went for a walk and was able to walk farther in the same amount of time and without as bad of a limp. This morning my foot was tender. I don't think I will use it when my foot is really sore. I have learned to back off or pay for it the next day. There is always a trade off when I try to medicate this kind of pain.",

I have been prescribed oral pain pills & they didn't touch Of course, the insurance won't pay for them. Let me just say that without the patch my life is painful enough that I am pretty much in a recliner all day. I am going without other things to have the patch. My pain level would be 8 to 10. With the pain patch it is 3 to 5.",

I hurt my back June 2010 and it is like everything that caused me pain started to feed off one another and my back was the last straw. I'm going to the chiropractor every 2 weeks. I had 3 epidurals in the space of about 3-4 months with no relief. I swapped pain management doctors and am now on 15mg of oxycodone every 6 hours, 4mg Zanaflex every 8 hours, 500mg of Naproxen every 12 hours, 40mg Celexa once a day and 600mg of Neurontin every 8 hours just to sort of be able to function. Was given a sample of Voltaren today and used it on my hands and back. Amazing! The pain is greatly diminished. Can't wait to try more.",

My GP prescribed me Diclofenac, and it provided instant relief and reduced the inflammation straight away as after just one dose I could move again like almost normal. Two more doses the next day but then had to discontinue due to the unacceptable side-effects: heart palpitations, hot flushes, restlessness, minor anxiety. But I must state here though for you that I can hardly tolerate Ibuprofen or any NSAID pain-killer for that matter, of late that is. Earlier, I'd tolerate medicines like sweets, but after taking Ciprofloxacin 14 months ago, and that has messed up my whole system: I've even developed a number of food intolerances as well. So, it might still work better for you.",

I called my doctor to go with some pain medicines and looked into seeing an orthopedic doctor for steroid shot. They prescribed this and I have been taking it now for 5 days and my back pain is gone. It felt much better on day 1 and each day was better and better. I take one tablet every 12 hours.",

I'm seeing a rheumatologist for a diagnosis (possibly fibromyalgia my GP said) in a couple months but my general practitioner has been treating me til then. I've tried 3 different prescription medications and they did nothing. The second day on this medication I started getting some relief in my back. It's not 100% gone but it really eases my pain. The unfortunate side effect with any nsaid is thin blood resulting in bruising. I have a bleeding autoimmune disorder so it's not the best combo. But I feel like as a first there's promising relief. I hope it continues.",

However, I JUST had an \"ah ha\" moment as to the mysterious, very itchy rash I have developed. The application areas reacted in the intense heat. Last summer while gardening I developed a severe lower back rash which I assumed was somehow sweat related. This year I developed the same painful, itchy rash on my right upper back (deltoid area and shoulder) down to my lower arm. Again, I thought it was from the heat and sweat. As I was applying it yesterday, I realized it was being applied directly on top of my rash. The ONLY places I have my rash. It took me long enough!! However, I did NOT get this rash in the cooler temps.",

After using Voltaren gel 2-3 times a day, after just 2 days pain was greatly reduced. And if there is any pain, it's only about a level 3 or 4. Have recently started using it on knees. Seems to help but not as dramatically as toe. I really like that fact that very little of the diclofenac goes systemic.",

It burns her and she refuses to use it so she gave me a tube for my arthritis in both my knees, my hip, back and ankles. WOW! This is a dream come true. It seems to work immediately for me and putting it on right before bed allows me to sleep all night because I have slight to no pain. I wake up, use it and then my day goes by MUCH better. I'm going to try to remember to actually take it to work with me so I can apply it there. I keep forgetting. Praise God for allowing me to try this gel. I was leery at first but tried it anyway. I am TRULY amazed and will buy more and more and more. Thank you for this amazing discovery.",

Pain was bad with little improvement the past 2 months, even with rehab/exercises and Vicodin and later Mobic (Meloxicam) and finally Motrin. Nothing worked. Couldn't sleep, constant ache from shoulder into my bicep. Rather than get a Cortisone shot yesterday, the doctor suggested I try a sample of the Flector Patch. I wore it last night and finally experienced some relief. I'd say the pain is about 75% better, and I managed to get some sleep. ",

Went to the doctor after a week of pain and not much healing taking place to make sure I didn't suffer any major ligament damage. He diagnosed the IT band issue and gave some samples of Flector Patch and as more of a comic relief, stated that \"these really shouldn't work, but actually do\". Was a little skeptical at first, but these patches do provide wonderful relief. Four patches later I am feeling much improvement in the mobility of my knee strain. Definitely worth a try.",

My doctor put me on this 2 years ago, 50mg once a day, and I honestly don't think I would survive the summer without it. One of my major problems I was getting out of bed in the morning, I couldn't even roll over the pain was so bad. So basically what I do is set my alarm 1/2 hour earlier so I can take it and let it work a little bit before I have to be up and out. I went from having to take so many days off of work to feeling so much relief. Since Physical Therapy didn't work for me, I will probably continue to take this as long as I have pain.",

POOR DESIGN on the pump.",

I get super stiff behind my knee, and it makes it hard to even walk, or straighten my leg all the way. I take ibuprofen, I ice it...and that helps some. I woke up this morning with it being extremely stiff behind my knee. I applied Pennsaid all over the back and front of my knee. No kidding - within 5 minutes, most of that stiffness is GONE. I am in shock. And if you have knee pain, you know how debilitating it can feel. This stuff is INSANE - in a good way!! I'm so glad I have it. I literally can't believe how much it helped me. And no, I don't work for a pharmaceutical company.",

I have not been overly impressed with either thus far. But I have noticed a little less stiffness and some range of motion. But in fairness the inflammation is no doubt very deep in both joints and would take time for the medicine to hit its target area. The Dr told me to give it time which I felt was reasonable. I find the gel to have a pleasant smell and rubs in nice and dries pretty quick. I am using the Voltaren Gel that says, diclofenac sodium topical gel 1%. Don't quote me but I believe they also make it with 2% diclofenac sodium?? With ins my cost was 42.00 for 5 tubes. Greasing both knees uses a lot",

It does not cause stomach upset like other NSAIDS and the only side effect is sleepiness but, a quick nap and pain is much better and no grogginess.",

I was at the point of taking pain relief before bed and again at around 4 a.m. With no expectations but exasperation I tried voltaren. It really has worked very much to my surprise!!! I did not expect such a good result or any result, I was just so fed up I grabbed a tube to mix up with the oral meds! It's helped my sleep in a matter of days and I'm much more comfortable.

After the physical therapy was finished I was experiencing sharp pain radiating from my shoulder to my neck. I asked my doctor at the time, a rheumatoligist, if this was arthritis now coming from the shoulder. He gave me a tube of Voltaren Gel to try and it has been wonderful.

We have had no side effects and we use it for major flare-ups as it is not intended for long term daily use. We each get a big tube, even though some might find it pricey, you don't have to use a lot it lasts a long time. The relief it provides is priceless.

I'm still broken\"  I am on a 75mg dose, and within hours I could breathe and move much better- magical stuff. Pain is still there, but more like a sore muscle at this point... not like the sharp barbed wire in my chest feeling it had been. I have been eating with every dose, the doctor told me that this can be pretty harsh on your stomach if you are not careful. Hopefully I can decease my dose in a week.

It doesn't help uterine pain at all. I took it twice a day for weeks and it never helped. Also had diarrhea and upset stomach. Ibuprofen was infinitely better than diclofenac.",

He found what was wrong just by my x-ray, my hip was about an inch off hitting a nerve. Now I can work again, not 100% but 4 year's suffering to being able to walk somewhat normal is great. Still need meds for pain but way less. If nothing else helps try a chiropractor. Don't wait 4 year's to go. If it don't help in a month stop going its not going to.",

I have been on them for one month, I use them for about 10 hrs a day. The only bad side effect I have experienced is massive weight gain. About 15 lbs in only one month. It does warn you on the label about possible fast weight gain. I have always maintained my weight by give or take 5 lbs...but 15lbs in 1 month is absurd.",

If I had stronger pain, I did diclofenac shots to myself and that helped a lot. What I noticed, the quality of the European diclofenac is much higher. After staying on the US production or maybe because of aging (or both), I've started feeling side effects: GERD and stomachache at night.

Unfortunately, I found out that it is supposed to work to relieve the pain each time it is used. It certainly doesn't do this for me--I may as well be applying lotion for all the good it does me. It really does nothing at all. I'm really disappointed, as my pain management doctor just weaned me off of narcotics, so I don't have anything that helps with the pain at the moment.

My doctor prescribed this after the pain clinic refused to give me a steroid injection for pain relief. It's more effective than anything else I've tried. I take a prescription drug for the pain and then put this cream on 4 or 5 times a day. Within minutes of applying it the pain dissipates & I'm pain free for several hours. This stuff works better than numbing yourself with ice. It helps the pain in both hips and my lower spine. I was given 3% strength & it rocks!",

                    "I was prescribed this medication for use on several areas of my body that are ravaged by osteoarthritis. I have had great results, when used regularly this gel works. It is a fast acting medication, so you can apply it and get on with activities right away. The cost of the medicine is high, but if you have tried products such as aspercreme, biofreeze or joint flex. You will see that the cost and relief you get are directly related. I have and will continue to recommend this medicine to anyone who needs relief from osteoarthritis. Thanks for the help NOVARTIS.",
                    "My doc had me try Diclofenac after bad side effects from Piroxicam. The pain management with Diclofenac is marginal at best for my arthritis and causes severe swelling in my feet and ankles, but I'm now having to take a diuretic because of it.",

                    "This drug is great. It takes away the pain and I don't feel the period pain for a lot of hours. When I don't take during my period, my period gets heavier and lasts for more than five days which is not usual.",
                    "I have severe sciatic pain and the spine doctor prescribed this for me. It worked for a while and after a week my pain started going up. I switched to OTC Ibuprofen and it worked better. So, I guess it depends on person to person.",
                    "Have Cervical Spondylosis, was amazed how well this medicine works. Tylenol, etc does not reduce the inflammation which is very important in pain management. Take pills 75mg 2 X daily, for 2-3 days, then go off of them until I cannot tolerate the pain. Last time I took Voltaren was in mid March, now it's mid April. Very happy.",

Within 24 hours the bursitis and pain in my feet had subsided! I have no trouble getting around at all now and can take long walks without paying for it later. Incredible! Love them. I use them on both insteps 24 hours a day.",
                    "Oh this medicine is amazing I had chest tightness when I would breathe in I would almost cry from the pain and it radiated all the way to my back which was just as bad. I would sleep at night and could barely move certain ways without the pain and almost wanting to cry. I found out i have an enlarged blood vessel in my heart and that's what the pain was from. Being 23 I shouldn't be having this pain but after the 2nd day on this it helped me so much and I can actually get up and go on with my day with no pain. (Thank goodness).",

It doesn't take the pain 100% away but it reduces it to a low enough level that I can sleep. Without it I am up for hours twitching and wiggling trying to find comfort after s a long dayday. The scent is mild after a few minutes, and so is my pain level. After a particularly painful day I may apply twice. I don't need this every day so a tube will last me several months, at $30 each tube it does add up but since I don't need it nightly I manage the expense.",
                    "Painful osteoarthritis in both thumbs; Celebrex works but side-effects terrifying. GP prescribed these. I expected same relief with fewer side effects (s-e's)--possible s-e's turn out to be same. Have used for only 24 hours with some pain relief. But try cutting these in half and wrapping around thumb down to lower joint, surprised they stay on fairly well but they are ugly white, I can't wear out of the house. Besides, nowhere does it say they are for arthritis pain, just minor aches, sprains, strains etc. Afraid to use continually or long term due to s-e's. Terribly expensive for just an NSAID with terrible potential side-effects. (1 box with insurance $140, on retirement)",

Haven't even been able to shut my mouth and hadn't eaten a solid or semisolid since that lunchtime (it's now Saturday). Had to go back today and tooth was infected. Got given this on prescription and took it at lunch and then an hour or two ago. Results within a few hours. Tonight I ate soup, a roll and even some grapes. Am so happy! No side effects.",
                    "I was prescribed diclofenac sodium 75 mg along with gabapentin for severe neck and shoulder pain, and numbness each night in both arms and hands. It takes the edge off. It does not stop the symptoms. It does not alleviate pain for me after 3 months of use. 4 Advil do a better job.",
                    "My sister used to work for Novartis, a company which produces Caraflam. I remembered the first few months of my period, I didn't feel painful as how I do now. My other sisters always need to take Caraflam. So when I couldn't bear the cramps anymore I took it, it started working about an hour later, I didn't feel painful anymore. Even though my sisters are pharmacists, they always told me that the less medicines I take, the better it would be. So I tried not to use it. It was the worst ever, I took one, it didn't work well when it reached the max of pain. I threw up and took another one. After an hour, it worked.  So if you decide to use Caraflam, take it before it's painful.",

Doctor put me on voltaren one week ago. So far I have been pain free. Still have swelling in joints but the morning stiffness and pain is gone. Gave it an 8 rating since I have only been on the drug for 1 week. Have experienced some acid reflux and sleepiness during the day. I don't know if it is because of the medicine or other problem.",

                    "I went to a fancy sports Dr. to no avail. The cortisone shot also didn't help shoulder pain but for a couple of months. I love this product..It has given life back to my arm. I can only use my arm without pain if I use this gel. I use it in the morning when I wake up. If I don't use the gel my shoulder and joints down to my elbow is impossible to deal with.",

I had been receiving pain shots for years to relieve the muscle pain that in turn caused me to have migraine/tension headaches more than 15 days per month. The major problem is that Insurance does NOT cover these patches and I have drained my Dr. of all of their samples. I highly recommend them if you can afford them!",

This along with a 10 day use of AFO brace on my foot just may help prevent surgery. I believe Voltaren definitely is doing the job in reducing inflammation and controlling the pain.",
                    "I was diagnosed with pleurisy yesterday - intense pain on inhalation/yawning/coughing etc - in fact anything that involved inflating the lungs felt like I was being stabbed in the side. Was prescribed Dicloflex (Diclofenac sodium in UK) in 3 x 50mg tablets a day. Didn't seem to make a lot of difference the first day, so I continued using Paracetamol codeine for pain relief. Today I've been a lot more comfortable - it seems like it took three doses to get started. I was even able to yawn earlier and I spent a little time sleeping lying down this morning - both of which would've been impossible yesterday.",

I have severe osteoarthritis in my knees, back, shoulders, elbows, feet, neck, and back. I am only 24 and I also have fibromyalgia. I have been using Voltaren cream from 3 years and it is wonderful. My opiate pain medication helps so much but in between doses I use the cream to get by. Without it I can't function at a normal level and it hurts to bad to cook, shower, or do any basic activity. I have had no side effects. Although after I shave it burns to put it on my knees but that's just because I had just shaved.",
                    "I have been on the patch for about 4 months now. It has by far worked better than anything else I have tried. I am about to change out of it because my body has been building a resistance to it. It is working only about 40% compared to before but I don't blame the patch. I think it's fantastic. Hope it works for you..",

Voltaren gel eases the pain but does not take it completely away. I'm much worse without it. I notice someone was taking Motrin while using this gel, I read to not use certain medications when using this gel, double check please, just want people to be safe or ask doctors.",

I am unable to do my usual 4 miles on the treadmill or even walk around the block. When I ease off the anti-inflammatory medicine, my knee swells up and I can barely walk. This has not helped my knee that much. However, I have started to use it for some swelling/pain in my thumb and I also have some lower back and neck pain and it helps.",
                    "Before being diagnosed with Ankylosing Spondylitis I was treated for general chronic back pain. I was started on Ibuprofen, but had to up the dosage. My GP changed me to Diclofenac (50mg 2x daily) but I didn't find it effective. I went back to 100mg 4x daily Ibuprofen which was much more effective for me.  I had no side effects while taking it.",

                    "I was prescribed Diclofenac 75 mg, for chest pain. It did nothing for me. I think my chest pain was due to anxiety and indigestion, so I stopped taking it after 1 day. A year later I woke up one morning with a stiff neck. I thought nothing of it and went to a trampoline park where I came down with a thud on my bum. No biggie, I'm pretty resilient at 32. The next day I had excruciating pain in my upper left back, neck and shoulder. My muscle at the collar bone was cramped tight! I waited 2 weeks and there was little relief, no sleep. I found my Diclofenac and it helped in an hour! NO PAIN! I slept for a full night! I see doc tomorrow for an MRI and diagnosis.",
                    "My doctor prescribed this for inflammation in my lower back area, I have been on it for one week.

I am a 44 year old male employed full time and spend long periods of time on my feet quite frequently.I can not say enough how much this drug improved my life. My knee pain was getting so bad I thought I was going to need replacement surgery. I can take long walks and run up the stairs again. One caution is to make sure you eat with food and drink plenty of water throughout the day. A glass of milk and a banana does the trick. t will give you an upset stomach if you don't.",

I had occasion to use it several times while we lived there. When I got back to the States, no luck in finding it. Then, about 6 months ago my daughter was prescribed Voltaren Gel. Hurrah! It is made in Germany by the same company as the Rheumone gel. It smells the same and works the same. My doctor has prescribed it to me for the arthritis and pain. It does a wonderful job.",

So many pills, patches and injections. Under the knife many times. A real humpty dumpty story. I have more pins, screws in me than your local hard wear store. Note: I don't want to over state the how effective it is but it works. Talking to my doctor about the pain. He gave me this to try. Well my 1st thought was \"just another snake oil\" But it'sfreak'in amazing, it works like magic. Why did I not recive this years ago. The Drugest gave me a stupid look. And said it just became generic. All those years I would have paid anything. When your in pain, money is no object",

I was given a diclofenac (voltaren) injection 30 min ago and now am almost completely at ease. Considering that I'd tried nearly everything (ibuprofen, panadol ex, buscopan, spasm relaxers etc etc), I'm umderstandably excited and can't wait to share this. I tried the tablets last month and this morning but they aren't as effective as the injection. My advice is if it's debilitating - definetely go for the injection ASAP. Don't wait.",

I mainly use it for break-through pain between doses, and days like this with storms and hectic days at work, I'm able to concentrate on work instead of trying to take my mind off of the pain.

Just thankful to be able to move and do things I love without pain.",

I have been in severe pain and have tried everything, including nerve block injections, and incredibly high pain medicines (including Valium and Oxycodone).

If you can handle the side effects, this medicine works wonders for pain and inflammation.",

If your doctor has you on Celebrex and you don't feel any relief, ask him for Voltaren. You will most certainly feel the difference. If you are on it for any length of time (like me) then every so often you'll have to have blood work done to check your kidneys and liver to make sure they are functioning right as this medicine can cause problems with that. For me everything is good to go so far. I swear by Voltaren.",

She'd never heard of it before, so was hesitant. My insurance covers this a better price than other migraine abortants. It's my go to now. I highly recommend. Use as little water as possible, then rinse the cup with water and drink whatever residue. It works wonders and truly dosen't taste bad.",

I'm a 51yr-old female and after 2-3 weeks of taking this medicine I was experiencing hot flashes frequently about 5X a day especially at night that wakes me up, which never occurred before. I thought I was pretty young to be experiencing this, but this website was the second place where I researched this medicine where it states \"works by reducing hormones\" that explains my hot flashes recently.

I have not used the patches regularly, just when I have a little pain. Early on I had pain in the shoulder area but could not place the patch directly on the shoulder because of the surgical scar. The patches helped somewhat. Now I have some pain for stepping up workouts on the shoulder, and I can place the patch directly on the pain area, and it's working wonderfully. The patch has a kind of numbing feeling, and overall the feeling can be compared to what ibuprofen does in reducing inflammation. The patches can make me a little sleepy. They also can be a little large for certain spots",

You should not be expecting this gel to completely alleviate back pain. It's not supposed to do that. It's supposed to get your muscles to a place where you can do other things more easily to attain painlessness via a combined effort. For a lot of back pain, if you use the gel in conjunction with consistent stretching (twice daily) whilst consuming the correct diet and being active enough to lower your body weight, you will be in a much better place in no time - so be encouraged! The gel really helps you do the things you need to do physically to get to that place.",
                    "I just tried this about 2 weeks ago for my arthritis pain. I am taking the generic version of this, one a day, 75 mg. So far it is working. I would like to see how it works this coming winter when I have the most amount of pain. So far, so good though. ",
                    "I have bulging and degenerative discs from my cervical all the way down to my lumbar.  I would have it rubbed on my back on days when I couldn't get out of bed or stand up. The cream along with my meds would put me to sleep and then allow me to get up pain free. It's really great after a long day.",
                    "This seems to help my pain, but I find the odor a deterrent to using it regularly. I am allergic to most fragrances, and this is no exception. Why do they add fragrance when it is a common issue for people with allergies?",
                    "Voltaren is amazing. It takes away my arthritis pain and helps with overly tight neck muscles. It does nothing for my Occipital Neuralgia, but does help with my chronic tendinitis in my hand.",
                    "I have tried 3 other medications and this is the only one that worked well for me. All others were either too strong, causing stomach pain, or they would help for a few hours, then the pain would come back. Moving around was easier and I had no side effects from this medication.

For the last 3 years I have reduced to 1x50D mg per day and really feel very comfortable. I found it very effective and I didn't noticed any side effects yet. I think that Voltaren helped me to keep my ankylosis under contol. Doctor told me to avoid using it for so long but the pain was coming back the next day. I don't know what problems I may face in future but my life quality is good and I am happy.",

After taking Voltaren for 3 days, 50mg once a day, I am no longer limping and the inflammation in my hands has gone down. I am back to hiking, swimming and piano playing. What a relief.",
                    "I used this for sciatic pain. The first few times it worked. Pain was reduced. Then about the 4th or 5th time I experienced a burning sensation. It was so strong that I had to wash off the medication to get relief.",

                    "I have arthritis in my ankles, knees, sacroiliac area, and hip. I also have fibromyalgia. It hurts so much I can barely move. When ever I have pain, I use Voltaren Gel. This stuff is a lifesaver. It helps me regain my joint flexibility and I can move and walk around again. Also, I am not crying out in pain. My life was horrible before Voltaren Gel. Now, I have a normal life again and can manage my symptoms.",

I have a pain in my shin that wakes me up at night, and have rubbed Voltaren on that area and it gives me 100% relief. I've also rubbed it on my jaw in an area where I have a back tooth that is inflamed. And it also relieves the pain. I am so happy with this medication...thank you Novartis.",

My foot doctor put me on Zipsor three to four times daily. After the second day on Zipsor I really have felt no pain and no side effects. This medicine is a life saver. It also has me feeling better by giving me more energy.",
                    "Gel was given by my G.P. of 27 years for pain in shoulder that I have had for 5/6 months. It was aggravated by exercise with weights. My pain would wax and wane. Worst episodes included my inability to pick up a coffee cup with my left hand, pain level of 7, inability to sleep on my left side etc.  After 6 months of this, I visited my G.P who x-rayed my shoulder and found arthritic changes. He gave me 2 sample tubes and told me to try it. I did with great results.",
                    "I have never used a medication that worked as well as Cataflam. It was as though I was able to actually feel the swelling leaving my body. I had no side effects at all.",

And someone mentioned that is not cover by insurance? Yes it does at least my insurance, But co payment is little high but compare from $300 to $70 co pay not bad.",
                    "I have RSI in the wrist. I have been doing the streching exercise shown to me by my physio therapist as well as using Volt. I get No relief using it at all. Its just an expensive useless smelly cream in my experience.",
                    "I usually have REALLY bad period pain, and it was becoming a real problem to deal with, particularly at school. I tried several other medicines, like paracetemol, but they weren't very effective, even after taking 3 within a few hours of each other. I tried 1 x 50mg diclofenac tablet, and after about an hour, all my pain was gone. It's been about 4 hours now, and I'm still 100% pain-free.",
                    "This is an anti inflammatory. If you have a serious inflammatory response in your system, this will take time to reduce your pain. It is not like oral pain relievers with near immediate results. Patience is needed. If you're having trouble with it adhering to the skin, make sure the area is free from oils, either naturally or lotions or soap residue. I have no problems at all with them. My RA flared up in addition to my cocyx broken off, literally. The pain was so severe that oral meds weren't effective. It took several days to feel the beginning of relief, and I've improved steadily. If you've used these short term and are the impatient type, chill out and give them a chance. They do work.",

I'm now 80% better and changing the patch every 12 hours as prescribed to me. The first day (for whatever reason), I got a surge of energy when I first put on the patch. The pain subsided to about a level 3 from a level 6 after wearing it for just a few short hours.  Do not stop wearing the patch as the pain will come back quickly. I did have to supplement the pain with additional meds after I did some light home repairs (despite the the warnings) and this kept the pain level down.",
                    "Finally, my back pain is gone and with no side effects. I tried everything including OTC, PT, Yoga, etc. This worked and I only take 1 pill as needed every 3 weeks or so at most.",
                    "I have been taking diclofenac for 2 1/2 months for moderate osteoarthritis of the hip. It does not alleviate the pain. I am unhappy with the results and will probably ask my doctor to refer me to an orthopedic surgeon for better treatment options.",

I have had carpal tunnel release surgery in both hands and have a plate and some screws in my right hand from a boxing fracture. I also have knees that ache and pop and shoulder and elbow issues as well as pain and spasms in my back. My doctor put me on diclofenac and my elbow shoulder and especially my hand issues respond greatly to this medication. The back and my knees not so much and use other medications to help with them. Usually after about a half hour my hand pain and stiffness is gone. very happy",

I have taken more ibuprofen over the years, than I could ever count. A year ago I started taking Celebrex because I'd heard that for some people it's a miracle. In that year I have had total knee replacement (left knee), then two more \"revisions\" on the same knee to get rid of an infection. Just weeks ago, I came to the conclusion that Celebrex just wasn't getting the job done for my pain, and of course I did not want to take narcotics. I did a lot of research (the reviews on this site were immensely helpful) and decided to give Diclofenac a try. It has been fantastic, and I feel better than I have in years.",

Now have 3 bulging disks in neck also. 6 discs removed from back (spinal stenosis, herniated discs, scoliosis)- have 6 metal plates, two steel rods and 14 screws~in back. The surgeries did help- but still have pain, burning, & pins and needles sensation in neck, shoulders & arms. Burning pain in hips, and muscular soreness through out my back. I've been on pain meds for years and wasn't getting a lot of relief. I discussed with my MD and he ordered Voltaren Gel. I can't say enough how much relief I receive from this medicine.

I get relief in 10 minutes of application ! Hope this helps someone",

I gave it a go and I found after about 10-15 minutes the pain I had been experiencing was virtually gone. I also found that it helped heal the bruising on my ankle as well. I have fibromyalgia as well and never thought to use it on my joints, I'll for sure give it a go! The only downside to this product is it smells really bad.",

I have been taking the medication for 3 days and this is the best that I have felt in six months. I will defintely follow his instructions and continue for 4 weeks in hopes of feeling even better. No more pain in the hip, no more pain when rising, no more sharp pain when walking, or leg tenderness when trying to sleep. I was recently diagnoised with osteoarthritis.",

First sign was extreme itching and severe sweating with dizziness. If this happens go to hospital quickly and stop taking the drug. When this started Doctors can't always determine it quickly enough as in my case. Second time wasn't as severe but by the third time when my reactions started I knew. So please don't take again if you get these reactions. But I do highly recommend this drug for those able to use it.",

My pain is considerably better, but I am guessing/hoping from the procedure, not from the Zipsor. I am having terrible stomach problems, that are outweighing what I am guessing the pain relief to be. Going to discontinue as a result. If lower back pain level rises, I may go back to it and bear the stomach discomfort.",
                    "Having been diagnosed with degenerative lumbar vertebrae-- this medicine is AWESOME. It works very well. I've used it on my sore feet (lucky me with bunions! Too many years in high heels) and it works very well. Also, I work at a computer and drive for work a lot, it really works miracles on tight/sore shoulder and neck areas, as another poster has mentioned.. you do feel more \"loose\" after you use it. Finally, it smells pretty decent. I was concerned that I'd walk around smelling like Great Auntie Momo... It just has a light, semi fresh smelling scent--not medicinal.",

I tried Naproxen, Celebrex , lodine , Cymbalta and Tramadol nothing took the pain away . I had a MRI and went to see a spine Dr no one could tell me why I had the pain Upon walking into a physical therapy office the receptionist told me about Voltaren gel. I had my Dr. prescribe it after the third day I realized the pain was not as bad and by the fifth day it was barely noticeable. This is a miracle I use a small amount of gel in the morning and maybe another small amount before I go to bed.",

This medication is for inflammation so it takes a little while for swelling to subside enough for pain relief. I use along with oxycodone and muscle relaxers and honestly think I get more relief from the patches. They are just so expensive I can only fill my prescription once my deductible is met for the year and even then I have to download a coupon. My cost for a full month is about $70. Much better than almost $600!",

I have been suffering a from a sharp, stabbing pain in my chest that shoots down my back (costochondritis) & finally decided to go in after 3 sleepless nights. I took one as soon as I got them, & let me tell you..it seriously helps! The pain hasn't fully subsided, but now it's more of a tightness than a unbearable pain. I'm so looking foward to get some sleep tonight! & just a little fyi, I was also told that the only safe anti-inflammatory I can take along with this, was Tylenol!",

Relief comes within 10 to 15 minutes. Maybe even less on an empty stomach. Pain, throbbing, sensitivity, all of it. Best part- I can take it at work (elementary special needs teacher) with no impairment, drowsiness, or pesky side effects whatsoever. That's a BIG deal when working with kids. I keep two packets in my wallet at all times. PS: The taste, mint and black jellybeans, was hard for me to swallow at first.

After I stopped taking the pills, about a week now, I've had horrible pain in both knees that I didn't have before, and the pain in my foot is back.

I've tried most approved treatments, including \"off label\" medications, with ranging levels of relief.  I've yet to find a preventative aka \"miracle drug\", although, botox has effectively reduced the number of my \"headache\" days.

But I noticed weeks later, severe back pain that affected my ability to stand for a long period of time without feeling light headed from the pain. No over the counter pain killers helped. When my doctor prescribed me this, it immediately went away. The only side effect I've experienced is feeling fatigued. Like most medications, though, my tolerance for it has built up quickly. And when I don't take it, the pain catches up on me quickly. It's difficult for me to get out of bed if I go more than a day without it. So I'd recommend doing exercises/stretches and don't just depend on it forever.",
                    "Recently had this prescribed for debilitating menstrual cramps, so I stopped my ibuprofen regimen and the next day started diclofenac 75mg extended release. I swear it's like not taking anything at all. At first I thought it had taken the edge off the cramps, but at 12 hours almost to the dot it wore off, so I took a second, which isn't doing anything. Will try this again next month when I can start taking it in advance of the pain, but as of right now this has been a completely useless medication.",
                    "For 5 years, my knee has caused severe problems and I have had to use a brace or bandage when on my feet. After having a large mass removed from my leg, the knee got worse and was swollen until I couldn't walk without a cane or walker. I went to the doctor to see if I could get a shot to help me walk and he gave me a tube of Voltaran Gel to use. I came home, put it on the knee and propped my leg up for an hour. When I was ready to get up, I dreaded it because I just knew I was going to be in horrible pain again. But, the pain was almost all gone. I couldn't believe that a simple gel could have that effect so fast but, it did! This product is worth its weight in gold! No cane for two days now!",

                    "I had been to the dermatologist for treatment to my lower lip diagnosed as Actinic Keratosis. Initially, he sprayed it with Liquid nitrogen and prescribed Solaraze gel. I used this gel for about 2 months twice daily on the lip. I must mention that there absolutely no effect of this medication on my lip. A total waste of money if you don't have insurance as it can be quite expensive without it.  Then I was prescribed all sort of other creams which was nothing but a waste of money on moisturizers. Don't feel bad to question the dermatologist as to what the cream does and whether it will cure you. The most essential treatment for single or isolated AKs is cryotherapy - liquid nitrogen spray.",

                    "If you are anyone that loves to hit the gym hard like I do, you gotta know what muscle pain feels like. No one can really tell or know when you have went too far because you are suppose to hurt and be in pain. If you are in pain, it means that your body muscles are stretching and you are making room for more muscles to fit. Many people don't understand that when you go home then that's when the adrenaline wears off and you start to think \"I went a little too far that time\".  Since most of what I do is shoulder press, I have to say that this back patch for pain has saved me from several night where I wouldn't have been able to sleep. Absorbine Jr pain patches for back work quickly, absorb fast, and give me pain relief fast no matter what."

There are so many people allergic also someone like me with cancer and very sore and nauseated to spend money on this and it made me so sick I washed up 4 times and my hands and skin still smells strong. It gave me a headache and made my nausea worse. There is no need for perfume not to mention it's just an toxic unnecessary ingredient. I will never use this again and I will be sure to let everyone at clinic know.",

I sometimes get killer tension headaches that first build up in the back of the neck. When I felt one coming on, I used the gel on the back of the neck and shoulders. The headache never developed. Before this experiment I would take 3 or 4 ibuprofen for one of these headaches and hope for the best. The gel is now my standard treatment for these headaches.",

I've taken Advil, Celebrex, and Mobic along with steroid injections and received little or no pain relief. Zipsor is the only medication I've taken that has reduced the inflammation long enough for the joint to begin to heal thus giving my pain relief.",

It has made a big difference in helping me manage the pain of rheumatoid arthritis.",

In desperation and since I have a type of neuropathy in my feet and cannot fall asleep, I applied 1/2 the dosage she was prescribed. To my surprise it allows me to fall asleep at night without the pain and discomfort in my feet. I will be seeing my doctor to get this prescribed for me! I have been looking for relief for over 5 years!",

It is like a miracle. I have never found any medication for anything that was more effective. I guess it just works better for some injuries than others. It is , however, very short acting. But the pain relief it provides is priceless. I have arthritis in my hands, I don't find it helps with that pain. For the certain types of injury it works better than narcotic medication.

It used to just act up at bedtime, so bad at times that I had to wrap my feet in ice packs to get relief. Now it's all hours & hands/feet and I have a stiffness and severe putting edema that pops up & then disappears with no regularity. There's no explanation from Doctor's YET.

I received the generic Diclofenac 50 mg. and was very excited about receiving any kind of help making it through a migraine which sometimes lasts 8 days, sometimes 2 days. Anyway, I took it three times a day the first two days and sporadically for another two or three days. It worked very well much to my surprise; however, after that I experienced the stomach burn I read someone else experienced. I didn't realize what had caused the burning until I read the reviews on this med. I'm a little afraid to take it again unless I just take it one or two days next time. Try it.",

While it is stated it is not approved for spinal use, I have found Voltaren extremely beneficial. While I still have pain in the neighborhood of an 8 out of 10, I feel that it would always be a 10 without Voltaren. Many thanks to my PA for recommending it.",

Here's the best part though. I have a bulge in my lower back. I have meloxacam but I don't take it regularly because I feel that it don't help any. So one day my back is as hurting really bad so I decided to apply the gel. Glad I did because wow! It works amazing! They should most definitely test it on the back. I know surgery will be the only thing for permanent relief but I'm only 31 and one can't afford it and two it's not guarantee it would work and could make my problem worse. Next time I go to my doctor I will be asking for my own prescription.",
                    "The first time my doctor suggested Voltaren cream. I have osteo in both knees, right ankle and my spine. After several tubes and no reduction of pain or swelling my doctor suggested Pennsaid . The difference was like day and night. Not only did it reduce the pain but the swelling in my ankle was also reduced. When I investigated both products I was shocked to find that only Pennsaid contains a delivery agent DMSO that Voltaren does not . So it seems the DMSO delivers directly into the joint while the Voltaren only stays on the skin. Bottom line I will never spend my money on anything else going forward ....Pennsaid works for me.",
                    "I love this gel. Just 10 seconds after I put it on an area with severe pain, the pain is gone completely for 2 hours. I couldn't believe it the first time I used it. I take some other strong prescription medication for knee and back pain and the medications don't do as good a job on the pain as this gel. I wish I could use it more than 4 times a day, but during my waking hours, it is a God send. Thank you, thank you, thank you! I would do a commercial for Voltaren Gel anytime, for free!",

The combination provided no discernible pain relief. However, I did suffer from significant stomach and intestinal pain. The stomach & intestinal pain stopped within 12 hours of discontinuing the Zipsor. Overall, not a pleasant experience.",
                    "I had tried Lidoderm and had fair to good results. I was reluctant to try the Flector because of the cost. My insurance did not cover them.  In an impulsive act due to frustration with pain, I got the script filled. Within 2 hours I noticed that the severe pain in my knee was almost gone, and I slept very well through the night. These are a miracle and work as well as or better than any systemic medicine including narcotics. They really do work. ",

                    "My doctor prescribed Voltaren after an extremely painful IUD insertion and subsequent cramping. I've never had cramps like these before. I'd literally be curled up in the fetal position, unable to even talk. Depending on the level of pain, this either completely eradicated it or made it totally bearable, and lasted for 12 hours at a stretch. Voltaren is wonderful and I'm glad my doctor recommended it over a narcotic painkiller.",

I also have bursitis & piriformis syndrome in my right hip as well as achilles tendonitis in the right foot. I take 75mg 2 times a day. My knees are so bad that I had to have Synvisc-One injections as well. Combined I have been able to work my 12 hr shifts as an RN. I still have pain that's about a 6-7 after working three 12's in a row, but would not be able to work at all without the Voltaren. I am looking to have my knees replaced in the near future. The only side effect I have had is stomach upset if I do not take it with food and some mild constipation. I would recommend this medicine to anyone. ",
                    "This medication has been a God send for me. After PT and a year of Aleve my shoulder was somewhat better but not great. For a different issue my physician told me to stop the Aleve and try Diclofanac Sodium. My body is very happy. No back, neck, ankle, toe, shoulder pain. My shoulder range of motion is almost 100%.

I've since called my podiatrist asking for a full prescription based on the relief I already feel.",

I'm using much less than the 2gram dose - maybe 1/4 to 1/2 a gram on a joint, tops - and having at least 8 hours pain free. It seems no studies were conducted on it's use on shoulders, but it worked decently enough for mine when I pinched a nerve.  Make sure you read the possible side effects and all the potential negatives, and test on a single area with someone with you for a couple hours just to make sure you're not allergic. It's been problem-free for me, but everyone's body chemistry is different.",

My ligaments and tendons are weak and has been affecting my joints, needing to have 2 neck surgeries, bunions, and wrist surgery. I switched over to the generic Diclofenac 3% gel.

I have a artificial heart valve that requires that I take blood thinner which was discussed with the prescribing physician and had been used as prescribed. The arm continued to swell and the blackness continued down the arm with pain that became unbearable.

Pain returned, so tried Percocet 5/325 2x day for a month but only provided a temporary relief until the dose would wear off. I became concerned about opiate dependency so I made the decision to stop. Started Diclofenac 75mg ('551' on one side and a fancy 'R' on the other) 1xday and had a SIGNIFICANT reduction in pain after just two days. Bloodwork shows that it does mildly elevate my liver enzymes (ALT of 60) and has slightly lowered RBC, WBC & platelets which is a common side effect. Benefits outweigh the risk at this point, so will continue.",
                    "I am an artist and a horseback rider and for the last few months have experienced a very painful case of tendinitis in my right arm. This gel works well and very quickly in my case, and with bracing and icing I have experienced a lot of relief. The nature of this pain reliever is anti inflammatory - not numbing - so I don't think you would find use for it if your pain is not of the inflammatory nature. I get spastic and tense neck muscles all the time and find heat and massages work better. So for the right purpose it is excellent stuff. I am sensitive, delicate skinned and had no allergies but I would be careful and spot test nonetheless.",
                    "I received a sample of this from my ortho hand surgeon. He said it should help while I wait for my EMG test. He wasn't lying. I have several trigger points and my right side is painful and numb due to compression from my neck and what he suspects, compression of carpal tunnel radial nerve, ulnar nerve, etc. basically everything is compressed. This patch worked wonders. Very disappointed to learn its not covered by insurance",
                    "I have arthritis is both knees from years of athletics, in my youth. I have moderate to severe pain after long standing, use or cold. The Flector Patch on my knees are perfect. I use them as needed and I experience 90% relief without having to take any oral medicines. I am a FAN!",

                    "Cataflam is a miracle for my period pain. I have suffered for years and wouldn't be even able to walk a few steps with the horrible pain. I've tried everything from Meftalspas to spasmoproxivonne, Brufen, Panadol, etc.. nothing works. With Cataflam in just half an hour my pain is completely gone. I take it every 8 hours in my first two days.",
                    "Occupational Health at my workplace prescribed this patch for me because I apparently strained a muscle below my patellar bone... It did nothing for me! Apparently it works for everyone else, so I may just be an oddball. It was like taking a placebo and I am not even taking other pain meds... So it's not like I have a tolerance level for pain meds... This just doesn't do anything for me. It was def. a miss. ",
                    "I was prescribed Voltaren gel for my MCP joint, which experienced remodeling of bone after my 14-year career as a deep tissue massage therapist. I am a chiropractic student, so I went the conservative route first: adjustment, ultrasound, cold laser, Alpha-stim, microcurrent probes. Finally I had a series of x-rays on campus and unfortunately, there is a large osteophyte on the volar (palm) side of the base of the 1st metacarpal, along with serious lipping of the scaphoid bone which supports it (you know this combination as the saddle joint). Voltaren helps the crippling pain of trying to unscrew a jar, open a doorknob, or hold a pen. I will however have surgery to remove the osteophyte.",
                    "The gel helps with the pain but my stomach was a little upset, I got a mild headache and I felt very drowsy and out of it. Yes I know it's the gel but I still had side effects. I only rubbed in a small amount. I can't swear by it but I think it also caused me to have several anxiety attacks which I think are related to the woozy out of it feeling. It says it makes you dizzy on the box.",
                    "I slipped a disc in my back a year ago and have been in pain ever since! After racking his brain, my doctor gave me a sample of Voltaren Gel. I didn't have high hopes, but it is WONDERFUL!  Because I have had Gastric Bypass surgery, I can not take NSAIDS which pretty much leaves me, Tylenol! I did sneak an Aleve after being in so much pain and I was so sick to my stomach. The only negative, if Im in pain and my husband isn't home, it's kind of hard to apply to my own back!!! So I think this is a WONDERFUL medication for a person who can't orally take an anti-inflammatory medication! A true life saver!",
                    "Had no relief at all from this medicine. Had high hopes that it would lessen pain in knees and hands but unfortunately it did not.",
                    "I've had chronic lower back pain for over two years (herniated disk). I can't say for sure what has relieved my pain, but ever since taking diclofenac my pain almost immediately has gone from being almost completely debilitated, to being able to function physically at the level I was at when pain started. Still have pain and not 100%, but my quality of life is back and I feel much more fluid and agile. For almost six months I could hardly get out of bed, let alone tie my shoes.",
                    "I have psoriatic arthritis with lots of foot pain. I wanted an alternative to the drugs and anti-inflammatories normally prescribed and my doctor suggested this. After reading reviews I expected this to take away the pain immediately. It didn't, but knowing that everyone is different I kept trying and I'm glad I did. Now on day three my foot pain is much better, allowing me to walk. I have had no skin reaction. The smell of the ammonia carrier can be a bit overwhelming but it dissipates quickly.",
                    "It has helped my back, but not completely eliminated pain or discomfort. The patch has greatly enhansed my quality of life, easy to use and does not cause any problems to my stomach.",
                    "Why on earth any company would add fragrance to a medicine is beyond me when so many medical facilities have gone fragrance free. Even the low level fragrance has caused nausea after a half day's use. It's either the fragrance or a reaction to the gel. Didn't make much difference in my pain level.",
                    "I fell and broke the Radial head of my elbow (have never broken anything before and I am 45 yrs old). The doctor put me on Vicodin and it did nothing for that pain, UNTIL he gave me Zipsor, I was much much better in about an hour! The only side effect was that I was a little sleepy.",
                    "I am 38 years old with 4 small kids. I've recently been diagnosed with osteoarthritis in my hips and most likely my knees. I was also having significant shoulder and heel pain. Within 2 days of starting this medication I would say I was 75% better. Now after 1 month I feel better than I have felt in years. I am amazed that 1 medication can work this well. I have not noticed any side effects.",
                    "I was prescribed Diclofenac Sodium tablets for emergency medicine regarding my Chronic Paroxsymal Hemicrania. It was ineffective at alleviating any pain. I'd feel a small reduction in pain level for about 30 minutes then it would spike back up. It caused my blood glucose to shoot up and I am non-diabetic. It also caused me a great deal of stomach cramps, burning pain below sternum, belching, heartburn and diarrhea. I had better response on Ibuprofen and that did very little.",
                    "I have been having severe back and neck pain for years and was taking ibuprofen 24 hours a day. My doctor told me that was very bad for my stomach and to use the Voltaren Gel instead and I found it to be wonderful, comfortable and it smells nice. Two days after I started using the Voltaren Gel I was so much more comfortable and now I alternate the ibuprofen 200 with the Gel and only use the Ibuprofen 200 two times a day. I can sleep a whole night. My back condition is in the muscles and and they are in spasm much of the time. Voltaren calms the spasms down and makes the pain tolerable. I am so glad to have found it.",
                    "I experienced very high levels of pain in my upper back over the course of six months, with hand tremors and trouble swallowing. Muscle and joint pain followed. Tests for many conditions are negative, including rheumatoid arthritis, but we are still looking. Diclofenac was prescribed, and over the course of two weeks, the pain faded. I felt like a human being. I did not experience negative side effects. On the contrary, I did not suffer any of my standard migraines. Unfortunately, after 8 months, the VA hospital changed vendors and the new brand of Diclofenac was not effective. In the week following the change, I suffered all previous symptoms along with a migraine and upsurge in depression symptoms. Very frustrating. Still trying to sort it out.",
                    "Unbelievable. I just used this for the first time and had relief in about 15 minutes. 13 years of pain shots 12 doctors, 2 surgeries and I put on this gel and feel so much better. For me, it is a miracle.",

                    "I began seeing my doctor for neck problems, I cannot take oral NSAID'S due to Crohns disease so my doctor suggested to try them as an alternative. I had every test run from an Ortho and Neurologist with no reasoning for my neck problems other than Fibro. Sometime the back of my neck swells around two nerves on both sides that go into my arms and head, I've tried every narcotic there is but nothing but a Flector patch helps. Recently I had a very extensive knee surgery with an 8-12 month recovery time and once the incision healed I was given the okay to use these, they helped tremendously. I now have an injury while recovering and they are my life saver once again. They are very expensive but worth every penny.",

I suffer from stiff shoulders and neck pain, caused by sitting at a computer all day, carrying a heavy laptop and purse. I used it on my neck and shoulders since it was an anti-inflammatory. It worked for me, I noticed a significant 'loosening' of my 'tight' shoulder muscles with just one application. I'm sold! I'm gonna get mom to give it another go!",

I am having very little pain for the first time in 3 years in my knees and feet. On a recent business trip to Germany I purchased 4 large tubes of a higher strength (over the counter in Germany and Switzerland) for 1/3 the price of my copay. A very effective drug for me.",

I have very inflamed painful bursitis under my scapula that throws all my muscles in my back/neck out of whack and creates a lot of transferred pain and problems for me. I was hoping this Voltaren gel my rheumatologist prescribed would help since the Celebrex and muscle relaxers alone are not doing the trick. But I do not detect any difference when I use it. However, I do occasionally get soreness in my left knee and when I tried it on that, it did seem to help.",
                    "I have been dealing with extreme pain in my hip and groin area. I took one pill but never again. I first experienced drowsiness, which isn't anything to worry about until I started to not feel right in my head. Lasted for about 20 minutes. Then as I was standing in the kitchen making dinner I developed extreme nausea for about 5 minutes. This led to a rush shooting straight to my head and on came a dizzy spell that lasted for about 20 seconds. Followed by a partial black out for a split second, vision came back and I went to sit down moments later I was perfectly ok. Well besides feeling freaked out of course. I would never recommend this medicine to anyone.",

My pain specialist has done various treatments including Facet Joint Injections, with no long terms results. At my recent visit with him I was complaining of the same pain with no relief, he handed me two sample tubes of Voltaren Gel. I have been using it for about a week now and have had a full week without pain. This stuff really works. I have been impressed so far. Thanks Voltaren.",

I've used Lidocaine patches, pain management trigger point injections, and acupuncture. When my PA handed me 2 tubes of this gel, I didn't have much hope for it.

These pain patches basically feel like happiness surrounding my wrist. I still have pain but it is at a much more tolerable level. I have my life back. For me, the patches work better than pain pills. They are covered by my insurance at a higher co-pay. And, with each prescription, I have to go through this whole prior authorization wait period. Get samples from your doctor to test them out and make sure they work for you. If they do, then fight the insurance. For my wrist, I am able to cut the patches into 2 halves and makes the prescription last longer. These saved my life.",

Since I have stomach problems and am unable to take oral NSAIDs, narcotics or Ultram, I tried Lidoderm patches without success. Then I read about Voltaren gel in Arthritis Today magazine and asked my doctor for it. It has worked well and this is the only way I am able to sit without severe pain. ",

                    "Works wonders on lower back pain but sometimes needs a narcotic pain killer or muscle relaxer for days when pain is more severe. Downside of this drug is that taking too much causes excruciating abdominal cramping and stabbing gas pains in the intestines. But it's an 8-hour pill, so pain relief usually lasts and it is not hard to space doses out since it lasts so long.",

I was prescribed the patches with the caveat that \"they may not work.\" They work very well and my pain has decreased between 75-90%. If I use them as directed (1 every 12hrs) they are most effective. There are some issues with the adhesive on the edges but I've found if I warm them with my hand they stick better. True, there is very little movement of fabric over the area as with back issues. I work with a personal trainer 5 days a week so the leg gets a lot of use. Mine is an unusual use for these patches, but they are definitely worth a try.",

Looks like I'll still be getting my Hyalgen shot on Friday. I will follow up with my Doc(I used a free-sample) and go from there.

A friend turned me on to Voltaren Gel . I used it on my knees, neck, and lower back. This is as close to a miracle as I have experienced in my 50 years of arthritis producing activities. The best part is that dosing is applied directly and only to the problem areas so consequently much less ends up in your system overall than if taken orally. Win. Win.",

I have taken other anti inflamitories before but they didn't seem to help but this drug has been fantastic. I have been able to work out again and it has really reduced the amount of knee and ankle pain I get. I take two 75 mgs tablets a day and have not had any side effects and I have been taking it for about 3 months. I would recommend this drug to anyone who has arthritis pain",

I work on a computer all day, typing and mousing. I apply 2 grams, 4 times a day to the elbow area. It makes working very tolerable. I would say Voltaren is a good treatment and really helps bring my arm function back to normal with no pain for tendonitis / Tennis Elbow. Aspercreme was also ok, but the Voltaren does better. Mild stretching, exercise and movement also help and are made much easier with the Voltaren.",

I couldn't even do simple things like sweep the floor or do laundry. I went and seen my orthopedic surgeon and she put me on Voltaren 75mg and I feel like a new person.

After 18 years the Myocrisin was not working, so medication was changed. Since then quality of life has not been good, and the only relief from pain was Diclofenac, which settled things down in 1-2 days. Now told it was being discouraged from use, so taken off it. All the alternatives have not worked, so persuaded a new Rhumatologist to re-instate it for short while and life was good again. I had no side effects from this drug. When a flare up occurs I take 2 in the day 75mg and everything quietens down, then it may be weeks before another attack. To me it is a wonder drug. All drugs are a risk, and for me this is good",

Maybe because my pain is bone related with the addition of torn cartilage and nerve problems? Glad that it works so well for some. Anything to get off of narcotic medicines and the crutches pre-op would be nice! So, for me and my dysplasia Zipsor has not been the miracle I was hoping for.",

It also helps my very sore feet, probably plantar fasciatis.  I don't know why they did not give this to me earlier, its much more effective than oral NSAID's or even Vicodin, as this works faster, much faster.  I use it less often than recommended (up to 4 times a day), because its not needed. Once or twice a day for me relieves the pain, pronto. It also helps my wife, with her osteoarthritis pain.",

(These areas of pain come from a compression head injury I got as a teenager.) I have a lot of problems trying to take anything for the arthritis in oral form, and I still take Aciphex along with using the Voltaren Gel as a precaution.

I swapped pain management doctors and am now on 15mg of oxycodone every 6 hours, 4mg Zanaflex every 8 hours, 500mg of Naproxen every 12 hours, 40mg Celexa once a day and 600mg of Neurontin every 8 hours just to sort of be able to function.

But I must state here though for you that I can hardly tolerate Ibuprofen or any NSAID pain-killer for that matter, of late that is. Earlier, I'd tolerate medicines like sweets, but after taking Ciprofloxacin 14 months ago, and that has messed up my whole system: I've even developed a number of food intolerances as well.

I've tried 3 different prescription medications and they did nothing. The second day on this medication I started getting some relief in my back. It's not 100% gone but it really eases my pain. The unfortunate side effect with any nsaid is thin blood resulting in bruising. I have a bleeding autoimmune disorder so it's not the best combo. But I feel like as a first there's promising relief.

Last summer while gardening I developed a severe lower back rash which I assumed was somehow sweat related. This year I developed the same painful, itchy rash on my right upper back (deltoid area and shoulder) down to my lower arm. Again, I thought it was from the heat and sweat. As I was applying it yesterday, I realized it was being applied directly on top of my rash. The ONLY places I have my rash. It took me long enough!!

It burns her and she refuses to use it so she gave me a tube for my arthritis in both my knees, my hip, back and ankles. WOW! This is a dream come true. It seems to work immediately for me and putting it on right before bed allows me to sleep all night because I have slight to no pain. I wake up, use it and then my day goes by MUCH better. I'm going to try to remember to actually take it to work with me so I can apply it there. I keep forgetting. Praise God for allowing me to try this gel. I was leery at first but tried it anyway.

Couldn't sleep, constant ache from shoulder into my bicep. Rather than get a Cortisone shot yesterday, the doctor suggested I try a sample of the Flector Patch.

Went to the doctor after a week of pain and not much healing taking place to make sure I didn't suffer any major ligament damage. He diagnosed the IT band issue and gave some samples of Flector Patch and as more of a comic relief, stated that \"these really shouldn't work, but actually do\". Was a little skeptical at first, but these patches do provide wonderful relief. Four patches later I am feeling much improvement in the mobility of my knee strain. Definitely worth a try.",

My doctor put me on this 2 years ago, 50mg once a day, and I honestly don't think I would survive the summer without it. One of my major problems I was getting out of bed in the morning, I couldn't even roll over the pain was so bad. So basically what I do is set my alarm 1/2 hour earlier so I can take it and let it work a little bit before I have to be up and out. I went from having to take so many days off of work to feeling so much relief. Since Physical Therapy didn't work for me, I will probably continue to take this as long as I have pain.",

I woke up this morning with it being extremely stiff behind my knee. I applied Pennsaid all over the back and front of my knee. No kidding - within 5 minutes, most of that stiffness is GONE. I am in shock. And if you have knee pain, you know how debilitating it can feel. This stuff is INSANE - in a good way!! I'm so glad I have it. I literally can't believe how much it helped me.

I have not been overly impressed with either thus far. But I have noticed a little less stiffness and some range of motion. But in fairness the inflammation is no doubt very deep in both joints and would take time for the medicine to hit its target area. The Dr told me to give it time which I felt was reasonable. I find the gel to have a pleasant smell and rubs in nice and dries pretty quick. I am using the Voltaren Gel that says, diclofenac sodium topical gel 1%. Don't quote me but I believe they also make it with 2% diclofenac sodium?? With ins my cost was 42.00 for 5 tubes. Greasing both knees uses a lot",

I was waking up due to pain and found moving extremely difficult and painful. I was at the point of taking pain relief before bed and again at around 4 a.m. With no expectations but exasperation I tried voltaren. It really has worked very much to my surprise!!! I did not expect such a good result or any result, I was just so fed up I grabbed a tube to mix up with the oral meds! It's helped my sleep in a matter of days and I'm much more comfortable. I don't take oral pain killers now and whilst I can still feel it, it's nowhere near the way it was. I can move properly again",

Since the 1950's I have suffered neck pain when doing a chore in one position for a long period of time. I have exercised on a regular basis for many years and in 2009 I injured my rotator cuff on a piece of gym equipment. After the physical therapy was finished I was experiencing sharp pain radiating from my shoulder to my neck. I asked my doctor at the time, a rheumatoligist, if this was arthritis now coming from the shoulder. He gave me a tube of Voltaren Gel to try and it has been wonderful. I only rub two pea sized drops between my shoulder and neck in the morning and have no pain the rest of the day.",

We have had no side effects and we use it for major flare-ups as it is not intended for long term daily use. We each get a big tube, even though some might find it pricey, you don't have to use a lot it lasts a long time. The relief it provides is priceless. You should not take it with oral anti-inflammatories and ask a doctor before use if you have any medical conditions and/or take medications (even natural remedies). Great product.",

I'm still broken\"  I am on a 75mg dose, and within hours I could breathe and move much better- magical stuff. Pain is still there, but more like a sore muscle at this point... not like the sharp barbed wire in my chest feeling it had been. I have been eating with every dose, the doctor told me that this can be pretty harsh on your stomach if you are not careful. Hopefully I can decease my dose in a week. This is like a sledgehammer to inflamed tissue. No ill effects.",

Unfortunately, I found out that it is supposed to work to relieve the pain each time it is used. It certainly doesn't do this for me--I may as well be applying lotion for all the good it does me. It really does nothing at all. I'm really disappointed, as my pain management doctor just weaned me off of narcotics, so I don't have anything that helps with the pain at the moment. I'll have to go see him again to get something else. It is so frustrating to try to find something that works, since everyone is different.",

My doctor prescribed this after the pain clinic refused to give me a steroid injection for pain relief. It's more effective than anything else I've tried. I take a prescription drug for the pain and then put this cream on 4 or 5 times a day. Within minutes of applying it the pain dissipates & I'm pain free for several hours. This stuff works better than numbing yourself with ice. It helps the pain in both hips and my lower spine. I was given 3% strength & it rocks!",

I thought it was my imagination but I have tested it out several times, I am not itchy In the area that I apply the gel, but it must get into your bloodstream and I have several areas of my body that start itching at the same time. So in addition to not feeling any pain relief, I am reacting with all over body itching. I will now we put this back to my doctor, And hope to find pain relief for my hip.",

                    "My doctor prescribed this medication for arthritis in my feet. It worked great and within a few days there was no pain in my feet, or anywhere else for that matter. After about 2 weeks, however, I developed heartburn and intestinal cramps so severe that I passed out on 2 occasions. If you can handle the side effects, this medicine works wonders for pain and inflammation.",
                    "I've been on this now for 5 months and it is by far the best pain medicine out there. No high feeling or anything like that. If your doctor has you on Celebrex and you don't feel any relief, ask him for Voltaren. You will most certainly feel the difference. If you are on it for any length of time (like me) then every so often you'll have to have blood work done to check your kidneys and liver to make sure they are functioning right as this medicine can cause problems with that. For me everything is good to go so far. I swear by Voltaren.",
                    "I found this medication online with some web searches during major migraine. I asked my neurologist for a prescription and fortunately she agreed. She'd never heard of it before, so was hesitant. My insurance covers this a better price than other migraine abortants. It's my go to now. I highly recommend. Use as little water as possible, then rinse the cup with water and drink whatever residue. It works wonders and truly dosen't taste bad.",
                    "I used the gel for 2 1/2 months after TKR 3-4 times/day. Part of the time I used the extra-strength version. I thought that it was moderately effective for pain and swelling. However, three weeks after stopping I still cannot get the odor out of my body. The extra-strength version has a different carrier, thicker and with a strong odor, and I would not use it again.",
                    "Due to a recent accident my orthopedic doctor prescribed this for my knee swelling/bursitis condition. I'm a 51yr-old female and after 2-3 weeks of taking this medicine I was experiencing hot flashes frequently about 5X a day especially at night that wakes me up, which never occurred before. I thought I was pretty young to be experiencing this, but this website was the second place where I researched this medicine where it states \"works by reducing hormones\" that explains my hot flashes recently. I still need to take a few more pills and swelling has subsided in my knee but do not intend to take this long-term.",
                    "I had a surgery in my spine 10 years ago (herniated disc L5) and around 2 months ago my back start bothering again, after 2 days taking it my pain was gone , walking again and sleeping well, I highly recommend this marvelous medication.",
                    "I use the Voltaren gel for my back pain. I have herniated disc from L3 to L5 on both right and left with pinched nerve at S1 so I have very severe pain which radiates down the back of my legs. My doctor gave me the Voltaren gel to use and it has worked wonders for me.",
                    "It just gives me stomach ache and makes my period worse. It has never relieved my cramps.",

                    "I was experiencing pain in my stomach and upper abdomen after about a month of using Solaraze twice per day (was prescribed for three months). Had to have an upper endoscopy to find the cause of my symptoms. I had burns to my lower esphagus and mild stomach bleeding. My doctor told me that a side effect of this medication (ointment applied to the skin on my face) can destroy the mucus lining in the stomach. Use with extreme caution!",
                    "I was prescribed Flector patches after surgery to repair my collarbone, which came with frozen shoulder that I've been getting physical therapy on for weeks. I have not used the patches regularly, just when I have a little pain. Early on I had pain in the shoulder area but could not place the patch directly on the shoulder because of the surgical scar. The patches helped somewhat. Now I have some pain for stepping up workouts on the shoulder, and I can place the patch directly on the pain area, and it's working wonderfully. The patch has a kind of numbing feeling, and overall the feeling can be compared to what ibuprofen does in reducing inflammation. The patches can make me a little sleepy. They also can be a little large for certain spots",
                    "I had a Torn tendon in left shoulder Ltd movement of arm. I used patch 200mg for seven days, did not help an iota, very disappointed , no idea what medicines were penetrated into my body, would not recommend.",
                    "I've taken Voltaren for over 25 years 3 times a day. For 5 days before each of 4 complete joint replacements, I had to quit taking it since it is a slight blood thinner. Each time I got very stiff with painful joints. I've tried most of the other arthritis NSAIDS and none work nearly as well. My Dr. runs a liver function test every 6 months.",
                    "Use for lower back pain and spine arthritis. The patches make it possible to function, significant pain relief. It helps to tape the edges down with athletic tape otherwise the edges catch on clothing and pull the patch loose. Far fewer side effects than oral NSAIDS and better relief.",
                    "Initial dose was effective. However second dose seems to be not as effective. Experiencing pain as if medication was not taken. Will continue to take until pain or heaviest part of cycle declines. Fearful or combining with other pain medication",

Podiatrist prescribed for plantar fasciitis Relieved it as well as OA in knees....small amt. twice per day, pep in,y step...finally!!",
                    "I had been having major pain in my neck and lower back. Also awful joint pain in my elbows. The pain left so fast I forgot that I had been hurting. Worked great for me only thing negative is that it makes me sweat also I've been gaining weight. And I believe the weight gain is because of the medicine.",
                    "I've used voltaren rapid 25 and 50 by far the best joint pain medication I've ever had. I use it to ease my pain when gout attacks come on I take to 2 with milk or before I eat something. My partner also uses it only if her period pain is unbearable seems to help her cope..",
                    "The patch works well as part of a program. It and Percocet (7.5/350) work well together, 800mg ibuprofen less so. They are more effective to prevent pain for me, so don't wait for the pain to use a patch.",
                    "This medicine was a joke it did nothing for my bulging back disc pain",
                    "Personally it's the best gel I have used to warm up my back muscles, making the muscles feel like I've stretched for 15 - 20 min. Don't expect miracles. You should not be expecting this gel to completely alleviate back pain. It's not supposed to do that. It's supposed to get your muscles to a place where you can do other things more easily to attain painlessness via a combined effort. For a lot of back pain, if you use the gel in conjunction with consistent stretching (twice daily) whilst consuming the correct diet and being active enough to lower your body weight, you will be in a much better place in no time - so be encouraged! The gel really helps you do the things you need to do physically to get to that place.",
                    "I just tried this about 2 weeks ago for my arthritis pain. I am taking the generic version of this, one a day, 75 mg. So far it is working. I would like to see how it works this coming winter when I have the most amount of pain. So far, so good though. ",
                    "I have bulging and degenerative discs from my cervical all the way down to my lumbar.  I would have it rubbed on my back on days when I couldn't get out of bed or stand up. The cream along with my meds would put me to sleep and then allow me to get up pain free. It's really great after a long day.",
                    "This seems to help my pain, but I find the odor a deterrent to using it regularly. I am allergic to most fragrances, and this is no exception. Why do they add fragrance when it is a common issue for people with allergies?",
                    "Voltaren is amazing. It takes away my arthritis pain and helps with overly tight neck muscles. It does nothing for my Occipital Neuralgia, but does help with my chronic tendinitis in my hand.",
                    "I have tried 3 other medications and this is the only one that worked well for me. All others were either too strong, causing stomach pain, or they would help for a few hours, then the pain would come back. Moving around was easier and I had no side effects from this medication.

For the last 3 years I have reduced to 1x50D mg per day and really feel very comfortable. I found it very effective and I didn't noticed any side effects yet. I think that Voltaren helped me to keep my ankylosis under contol. Doctor told me to avoid using it for so long but the pain was coming back the next day. I don't know what problems I may face in future but my life quality is good and I am happy.",

After taking Voltaren for 3 days, 50mg once a day, I am no longer limping and the inflammation in my hands has gone down. I am back to hiking, swimming and piano playing. What a relief.",
                    "I used this for sciatic pain. The first few times it worked. Pain was reduced. Then about the 4th or 5th time I experienced a burning sensation. It was so strong that I had to wash off the medication to get relief.",

This stuff is a lifesaver. It helps me regain my joint flexibility and I can move and walk around again. Also, I am not crying out in pain. My life was horrible before Voltaren Gel. Now, I have a normal life again and can manage my symptoms.",

I have a pain in my shin that wakes me up at night, and have rubbed Voltaren on that area and it gives me 100% relief. I've also rubbed it on my jaw in an area where I have a back tooth that is inflamed. And it also relieves the pain. I am so happy with this medication...thank you Novartis.",

My foot doctor put me on Zipsor three to four times daily. After the second day on Zipsor I really have felt no pain and no side effects. This medicine is a life saver. It also has me feeling better by giving me more energy.",

Worst episodes included my inability to pick up a coffee cup with my left hand, pain level of 7, inability to sleep on my left side etc.  After 6 months of this, I visited my G.P who x-rayed my shoulder and found arthritic changes. He gave me 2 sample tubes and told me to try it. I did with great results.",

And someone mentioned that is not cover by insurance? Yes it does at least my insurance, But co payment is little high but compare from $300 to $70 co pay not bad.",
                    "I have RSI in the wrist. I have been doing the streching exercise shown to me by my physio therapist as well as using Volt. I get No relief using it at all. Its just an expensive useless smelly cream in my experience.",
                    "I usually have REALLY bad period pain, and it was becoming a real problem to deal with, particularly at school. I tried several other medicines, like paracetemol, but they weren't very effective, even after taking 3 within a few hours of each other. I tried 1 x 50mg diclofenac tablet, and after about an hour, all my pain was gone. It's been about 4 hours now, and I'm still 100% pain-free.",
                    "This is an anti inflammatory. If you have a serious inflammatory response in your system, this will take time to reduce your pain. It is not like oral pain relievers with near immediate results. Patience is needed. If you're having trouble with it adhering to the skin, make sure the area is free from oils, either naturally or lotions or soap residue. I have no problems at all with them. My RA flared up in addition to my cocyx broken off, literally. The pain was so severe that oral meds weren't effective. It took several days to feel the beginning of relief, and I've improved steadily. If you've used these short term and are the impatient type, chill out and give them a chance. They do work.",

I'm now 80% better and changing the patch every 12 hours as prescribed to me. The first day (for whatever reason), I got a surge of energy when I first put on the patch. The pain subsided to about a level 3 from a level 6 after wearing it for just a few short hours.  Do not stop wearing the patch as the pain will come back quickly. I did have to supplement the pain with additional meds after I did some light home repairs (despite the the warnings) and this kept the pain level down.",
                    "Finally, my back pain is gone and with no side effects. I tried everything including OTC, PT, Yoga, etc. This worked and I only take 1 pill as needed every 3 weeks or so at most.",

I have had carpal tunnel release surgery in both hands and have a plate and some screws in my right hand from a boxing fracture. I also have knees that ache and pop and shoulder and elbow issues as well as pain and spasms in my back. My doctor put me on diclofenac and my elbow shoulder and especially my hand issues respond greatly to this medication. The back and my knees not so much and use other medications to help with them.

I have taken more ibuprofen over the years, than I could ever count. A year ago I started taking Celebrex because I'd heard that for some people it's a miracle. In that year I have had total knee replacement (left knee), then two more \"revisions\" on the same knee to get rid of an infection. Just weeks ago, I came to the conclusion that Celebrex just wasn't getting the job done for my pain, and of course I did not want to take narcotics. I did a lot of research (the reviews on this site were immensely helpful) and decided to give Diclofenac a try. It has been fantastic, and I feel better than I have in years.",

The surgeries did help- but still have pain, burning, & pins and needles sensation in neck, shoulders & arms. Burning pain in hips, and muscular soreness through out my back. I've been on pain meds for years and wasn't getting a lot of relief. I discussed with my MD and he ordered Voltaren Gel. I can't say enough how much relief I receive from this medicine.

I have fibromyalgia as well and never thought to use it on my joints, I'll for sure give it a go! The only downside to this product is it smells really bad.",

First sign was extreme itching and severe sweating with dizziness. If this happens go to hospital quickly and stop taking the drug. When this started Doctors can't always determine it quickly enough as in my case. Second time wasn't as severe but by the third time when my reactions started I knew. So please don't take again if you get these reactions. But I do highly recommend this drug for those able to use it.",

My pain is considerably better, but I am guessing/hoping from the procedure, not from the Zipsor. I am having terrible stomach problems, that are outweighing what I am guessing the pain relief to be. Going to discontinue as a result. If lower back pain level rises, I may go back to it and bear the stomach discomfort.",

Also, I work at a computer and drive for work a lot, it really works miracles on tight/sore shoulder and neck areas, as another poster has mentioned.. you do feel more \"loose\" after you use it.

I had a MRI and went to see a spine Dr no one could tell me why I had the pain Upon walking into a physical therapy office the receptionist told me about Voltaren gel. I had my Dr. prescribe it after the third day I realized the pain was not as bad and by the fifth day it was barely noticeable.

This medication is for inflammation so it takes a little while for swelling to subside enough for pain relief. I use along with oxycodone and muscle relaxers and honestly think I get more relief from the patches. They are just so expensive I can only fill my prescription once my deductible is met for the year and even then I have to download a coupon. My cost for a full month is about $70. Much better than almost $600!",

I have been suffering a from a sharp, stabbing pain in my chest that shoots down my back (costochondritis) & finally decided to go in after 3 sleepless nights. I took one as soon as I got them, & let me tell you..it seriously helps! The pain hasn't fully subsided, but now it's more of a tightness than a unbearable pain. I'm so looking foward to get some sleep tonight! & just a little fyi, I was also told that the only safe anti-inflammatory I can take along with this, was Tylenol!",

Saw specialist who did biopsy. Non malignant. Treated with Solaraze. Lesion changed to open sore. Stopped treatment until sore healed. Used Paw paw ointment to soften it. That worked. Resumed Solaraze. Other smaller lesions have appeared close by. Will see specialist soon for assessment.",

Whether this is the result of stress and/or carrying a heavy purse, I don't know. Anyhow....I tried the patch and within 90 minutes my pain was gone! I have since recommended this product to other women at work with the same issues and they also had good results.",

I had mild dizziness and upset stomach early in treatment but now have no side effects at all. When my back gets bad, I still take muscle relaxers, narcotic pain relievers, and chiropractic treatment (when I can afford it), but diclofenac helps me manage things so as to reduce the need for stronger medicines.",

Relief comes within 10 to 15 minutes. Maybe even less on an empty stomach. Pain, throbbing, sensitivity, all of it. Best part- I can take it at work (elementary special needs teacher) with no impairment, drowsiness, or pesky side effects whatsoever. That's a BIG deal when working with kids. I keep two packets in my wallet at all times. PS: The taste, mint and black jellybeans, was hard for me to swallow at first. But it's no worse than NyQuil or Robitussin or any of the other horrid things we take to feel better. So what?",

I was told to drop it to 1 pill per day for 3 more weeks. I had been in menopause for over a year. I got a period and one of the side effects is changes in your menstrual cycle. Not happy. After I stopped taking the pills, about a week now, I've had horrible pain in both knees that I didn't have before, and the pain in my foot is back. I have a popping in the back of one knee that someone says sounds like it may be a baker's cyst. I can't even walk normal. I have an appointment this coming week and will try to follow up. Not sure if this caused it, but too much of a coincidence.",

I also do botox migraine every three months. I not only suffer with common symptoms, debilitating headache, nausea, light/sound sensitivities, I also have numbness, unilateral paralysis, and even blindness. I've tried most approved treatments, including \"off label\" medications, with ranging levels of relief.  I've yet to find a preventative aka \"miracle drug\", although, botox has effectively reduced the number of my \"headache\" days. At any rate, my migraine specialist gave me samples of Cambia at last visit and today I remembered I had it. It quickly took a level 9 to a level 3.",

But I noticed weeks later, severe back pain that affected my ability to stand for a long period of time without feeling light headed from the pain. No over the counter pain killers helped. When my doctor prescribed me this, it immediately went away. The only side effect I've experienced is feeling fatigued. Like most medications, though, my tolerance for it has built up quickly. And when I don't take it, the pain catches up on me quickly. It's difficult for me to get out of bed if I go more than a day without it. So I'd recommend doing exercises/stretches and don't just depend on it forever.",

I swear it's like not taking anything at all. At first I thought it had taken the edge off the cramps, but at 12 hours almost to the dot it wore off, so I took a second, which isn't doing anything. Will try this again next month when I can start taking it in advance of the pain, but as of right now this has been a completely useless medication.",

After having a large mass removed from my leg, the knee got worse and was swollen until I couldn't walk without a cane or walker. I went to the doctor to see if I could get a shot to help me walk and he gave me a tube of Voltaran Gel to use. I came home, put it on the knee and propped my leg up for an hour. When I was ready to get up, I dreaded it because I just knew I was going to be in horrible pain again. But, the pain was almost all gone. I couldn't believe that a simple gel could have that effect so fast but, it did! This product is worth its weight in gold! No cane for two days now!",

I used this gel for about 2 months twice daily on the lip. I must mention that there absolutely no effect of this medication on my lip. A total waste of money if you don't have insurance as it can be quite expensive without it.  Then I was prescribed all sort of other creams which was nothing but a waste of money on moisturizers. Don't feel bad to question the dermatologist as to what the cream does and whether it will cure you. The most essential treatment for single or isolated AKs is cryotherapy - liquid nitrogen spray.",

I now have burning feet. It will go away, but what kind of cure is burning feet , not less pain. Also if you get on hands it can cause problems so make sure you wash it off This OTC cream should say SEVERE BURNING FEELING POSSIBLE. I never have pain at night when I sleep. Last night I had burning feeling!THIS PRODUCT SHOULD BE BANNED!!!!!!!!!!!!",

I have bursitus in my shoulder and it is very painful particularly when I sleep wrong on my shoulder. Capsaicin is the only relief I get.  Now able to sleep through the night, yes, it burns, that's the point, it exhausts the pain receptors in the area.

After, I use in very mall doses, all I can say is IT WORKS. Took pain away, and I can traverse the stairs, and walk with almost NO pain. I like this better than taking pain meds. I HIGHLY recommend this.",

I used capsaicin patches for nerve damage pain in my rib after a car accident. It worked, the more you use it the more effective it was. I am now using it on my neck (cream) my PCP told me it is one of those medications that the more you use it the more benefit you will get....and the less the burn. I am hoping the cream works as well on my neck as the patches did for my rib.",

                    "I recommend this product if you have pain. I would like to say that this is the best of two evils, because it burns at the start when you first start to use it. It is really important to read the instructions to use it properly. But nice to relocate the pain a little. For my part, the product works very well. However, if you do not have major pain, the product will be worse for you. Anyway, a great product to measure your pain level ",
                    "Capsaicin cream works amazingly well for my sciatica. I apply on the side of my leg, foot, lower back, or wherever I have pain. So, the version 0.1% is too strong. You should buy the .025% version at  Look for Rugby Capsaicin 0.025%. There is also a product called Zostrix which you can find with .025% Also: use plastic gloves to apply. You are applying essence of hot peppers to your skin and if you transfer it to your eyes it will really burn. It stays on your skin, so after 8-12 hours I scrub the area down with a soapy washcloth. It reheats if you sweat or take a bath.  Without scrubbing it will reactivate if your skin gets wet.",

My toes and bottoms of my feet near the toes were (and still are) completely numb and I have frequent pain and burning in those areas. I bought the Capsaicin cream without a prescription at Walmart, for $10. I applied it liberally to both feet and massaged the areas well. I then put on white ankle socks so I could walk on my wood floors without leaving residue. I did not experience any bad side effects--no burning, etc. The relief from my nerve pain subsided very quickly. After about 15 minutes, I removed the socks and elevated my legs. The medication definitely provided great relief. DO wash your hands thoroughly with soap.",

Severe burning, stinging pain. Even showering to wash the medication off was painful. I had to use calamine lotion to counter the effects. Perhaps my skin is more sensitive than others out there, but I would use caution with this medication.",
                    "If I could post a picture of what this cream did to me! Picture the worst burning EVER! It took several wipes and a shower to get it off my back and it still had bad pain from middle to the tailbone area which was red. I was in SO much pain from this medicine it felt like my skin was on fire. I tried putting lidocaine spray on it and the the spray just melted onto my skin",

My physician prescribed 3 kinds of tablets (tramadol, carbamazepine and paracetamol) which gave relief to some extent. Thereupon I searched \"PHN\" on internet and found capsaicin and, on this website. I asked for an additional prescription of capsaicin (0.075 %) which I now apply 4 times a day. I feel 90% back to normal and I too can say: Got my life back!",

                    "I'm 61, female, and have had arthritis in my hands, knees and feet over the past ten years. Since using capsaicin over the last two years I've found tremendous relief. It burned when I first started using it, but the burning \"wore off\" after a week, and I find it totally painless to use. I apply it in the morning as well as in the evening. I learned to NOT use my fingers to apply it. Instead, I use the topside of my thumbs, between the first and second joints from the tip of the thumb. That way, I don't accidentally get capsaicin in my eyes (especially when applying my contact lenses an hour later!). I highly recommend capsaicin and suggest sticking with it, even if at first it burns. It's well worth trying.",

If you like hot showers in the morning it may warm up a bit while in the hot shower. I wont live without it. I only use it at bed time and when the pain is to great to fall asleep.",
                    "I was suffering due to sciatic nerve compression (not sure it is because of lumbar hernia or piriformis muscle spasm the doc did not mention) for long time. I used capsaicin patch on my lower back (applied only for 8 hours). I felt much better the next day.",

                    "This works for nerve pain, but is waaay stronger than Bengay, Tiger Balm & the sort. Honestly, this should have a more serious alert on the bottle. My dr had me start nerve de-senitizing-i think its called. I have two types of nerve pain & the pain can get real ugly. I used a brush on my hamstrings and adductors to \"densitize\". I was still just going crazy in pain, meditated-well tried. Prayed & am now suffering the consequences of putting Capzasin HP on my Scrubbed legs...maybe 30 min past the scrubbing. Honestly, this pain rivals my nerve pain-awful close anyway. Good product, but BE careful, w/kids, pets, older folks & especially people in crazy pain undertreated by a propaganda driven war on pain medicine & the Pain Drs.",
                    "I began using Capsaicin-HP for severe pain from by neck to top of my buttocks caused by fibromyalgia. I found it to decrease my pain as much or better than non-narcotic oral medications. Then I had an injury to my back which required a lumbar spinal fusion at L5-S1. Capsaicin again helped my pain incredibly. I applied everyday 2 to 4 times a day before surgery and then limited used to areas of neck and back away from incision until site healed, then resumed use over entire back. It does get very \"hot\" at times, but I learned not to focus on that and realized that was the time it seemed to be removing pain the best. I am a nurse and eventually learned to allow it to \"heat\" which typically lasts about 30 min and I got the best results.",
                    "Suffering for over 2 months with Sciatic Nerve and Hamstring pain, using Advil 400 mg per 8 hours, which just wasn't completely relieving the pain. A bottle of Absorbine (not Jr.), produced in 2000 was in the medicine cabinet and contains capsaicin, along with herbals and other ingredients. After application, the pain almost immediately was reduced from 10 to about 7 (still taking Advil).  But about the 4th application of the Absorbine described above, noticed pain subsided for a longer period. Now we are unable to locate Absorbine with like ingredients. Found a creme called Capzicin and it seems to being working satisfactorily (2 times a day), along with the 400 mg Advil (taken every 8 hrs.).",
                    "I used Trixaicin HP for Thoracic Spine Damage to the nerve root at the C5, C6 level (C6 root) causing numbness in my index finger and thumb. I used gloves and put the Trixaicin directly on the pain. That caused the Trixaicin to heat up so much it burned. Not unbearably but it did cause me to wonder if it heated up worse on the pain because that was the most painful spot.",
                    "I just found out about Capzasin today and tried it for the first time for my fibromyalgia. I have OTC .025% and while I have only been using it a few hours I am so excited to have found it. The burning sensation is mild compared to my pain and doesn't bother me in the least. I tried it on one thigh to start and make sure it didn't bother me too much. I had so much relief in the one leg I couldn't wait to use it on the other.  My only complaint is the smell. It has a strong scent of menthol. I am in most pain at night when trying to sleep so I think I will use it then. I did read that showering can be uncomfortable but also that a milk compress helps.",
                    "It does produce a burning sensation the first two weeks. After that it is a gentle warming sensation and really eases the pain in my back injury. It is absolutely worth putting up with the initial burning sensation.",
                    "I applied two doses the first day I got it, to my thumbs, about eight hours apart. Yes, it's true that it's easy to get in your eyes, nose or mouth, and it burns. Even after a shower, I could still feel it on my skin. I expected to have to reapply it each day. But here's the funny part: The pain in my hands is nowhere near as intense as it was, even two days after that initial application. Why? It's welcomed, but kinda weird.",
                    "Works best after a few doses.",
                    "I prefer the initial pain of application than the pain in my spine, hip, and legs. Be careful going out in the sun, even the day after application some residual effects will be felt. Wear latex or plastic gloves when applying and wash your hands after applying. If you touch a part of your body that has capzasin on it, be sure to rewash your hands and DO NOT touch your eyes without washing your hands!",
                    "I have had PHN for 2 years and have been in extreme pain. My Internist told me about Zostrix HP along with the warning to be careful applying it and to wash it off my hands. I started using latex gloves to administer it on my body and after 2 weeks my pain began to subside. I am now at a very manageable pain level. On a 1-10 with 10 being the highest pain I am now finally at 0.5 (point five) after 2 years of being at a pain level of 10 day and night. I use it sparingly (pea sized amount) 3-4 x a day. I highly recommend it if you had shingles and then PHN.",
                    "I have been suffering from sciatica for about 10 years now. It has gradually gotten worse. Ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and naproxin no longer help to relieve the pain in my left thigh. I have found that a generic capsaicin patch placed on my lower back relives the pain. It doesn't fully disappear but it becomes a lot more bearable (0.025%)",
                    "Used it last night for knee pain and it started burning so bad it felt like my skin was melting off! I would rather deal with the knee pain than ever use this stuff again!",
                    "Althought it does not last long, it does help with the pain. I use it on my lower back & my neck for arthritis. My lower back has developed a rash after several uses. I have left it off for several days to see if the rash goes away.",
                    "If you are anyone that loves to hit the gym hard like I do, you gotta know what muscle pain feels like. No one can really tell or know when you have went too far because you are suppose to hurt and be in pain. If you are in pain, it means that your body muscles are stretching and you are making room for more muscles to fit. Many people don't understand that when you go home then that's when the adrenaline wears off and you start to think \"I went a little too far that time\".  Since most of what I do is shoulder press, I have to say that this back patch for pain has saved me from several night where I wouldn't have been able to sleep. Absorbine Jr pain patches for back work quickly, absorb fast, and give me pain relief fast no matter what."

                    "This is an AMAZING product. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND TRYING IT. Truly a must try.",
                    "I think the use of putting perfume in the gel is really stupid. There are so many people allergic also someone like me with cancer and very sore and nauseated to spend money on this and it made me so sick I washed up 4 times and my hands and skin still smells strong. It gave me a headache and made my nausea worse. There is no need for perfume not to mention it's just an toxic unnecessary ingredient. I will never use this again and I will be sure to let everyone at clinic know.",
                    "I used Voltaren gel on some sore joints (and a tennis elbow). It worked as well as anything I have ever tried. I sometimes get killer tension headaches that first build up in the back of the neck. When I felt one coming on, I used the gel on the back of the neck and shoulders. The headache never developed. Before this experiment I would take 3 or 4 ibuprofen for one of these headaches and hope for the best. The gel is now my standard treatment for these headaches.",
                    "Amazing topical relief. I 100% recommend it.",
                    "Because of an auto accident a year ago I had a partial separation of my right sacroiliac joint. I've taken Advil, Celebrex, and Mobic along with steroid injections and received little or no pain relief. Zipsor is the only medication I've taken that has reduced the inflammation long enough for the joint to begin to heal thus giving my pain relief.",
                    "I have been on diclofenac 75mg twice a day for 5 years. The first year I took it 2 X each day. After the methotrexate began to kick in, I now only take it when needed when I get a flare up. At the most, only about once per week, sometimes less. It has made a big difference in helping me manage the pain of rheumatoid arthritis.",
                    "I use the gel and it may take a little time to work (about 30-45 minutes), but the effect is pretty good. It will take my pain from a 9 down to a 5 (that's pretty good for me).",
                    "My grandmother had Voltaren gel for her, but when my knee wouldn't bend and I began to have pain, she let me use her gel. So far, I've placed it on my right knee and the pain was almost gone. I've placed the gel on again and the pain is disappearing. I'm 19 and there is no way I should be having joint pain...the gel works great.",
                    "Have been using Pennsaid for over eight years but strictly on an as needed basis (2-3) times a week. Very effective for knees and hips (almost instant relief). Only side effect is an occasional oral off taste.",
                    "Really did the trick for my migraine with no side effects. Tastes terrible but I'll take that over a migraine any day!",
                    "Voltaren 1% gel was prescribed for my elderly (92 year old) friend for foot pain. She had a negative reaction to the first application and would not try it again. In desperation and since I have a type of neuropathy in my feet and cannot fall asleep, I applied 1/2 the dosage she was prescribed. To my surprise it allows me to fall asleep at night without the pain and discomfort in my feet. I will be seeing my doctor to get this prescribed for me! I have been looking for relief for over 5 years!",
                    "Have used off and on for three years for severe back pain/spasms as well as tendinitis of the elbow. Diclofenac (75mg) is moderately effective at best, at least for me. It's about the same as a single Ibuprofen (Advil) which is to say not useful for serious pain. Everyone's different I guess. Unfortunately my doctor refuses to prescribe anything else.",
                    "Have Full Meals with this medicine to keep your stomach safe.",
                    "I had a bad reaction to this medicine; trouble breathing, tight throat, cold hands and feet, increased pulse, strong headache, then fatigue. It was very frightening, but did go away after several hours.",
                    "I have a sprained rotator cuff. I was prescribed Voltaren for Plantar Facilities several months ago. I found no relief from the Voltaren for my feet. When I injured My shoulder, I remembered that had the Voltaren so I figured it couldn't hurt to try it. WOW!! AMAZING!! Nothing I have tried orally can even come close to the Voltaren. It is like a miracle. I have never found any medication for anything that was more effective. I guess it just works better for some injuries than others. It is , however, very short acting. But the pain relief it provides is priceless. I have arthritis in my hands, I don't find it helps with that pain. For the certain types of injury it works better than narcotic medication. Smells great Absorbs quickly.",
                    "This drug works so fast, I had my migraine gone in 15 minutes. It's fabulous!",
                    "Not sure exactly what condition I have, Doctor's have just generically named it \"Peripheral Neuropathy\" but there's more to it than that. I'm 38 now & I've battled this since I was a child. I have this intense burning ache that began as a child in my feet & has gotten worse over time. It also affects my hands. It used to just act up at bedtime, so bad at times that I had to wrap my feet in ice packs to get relief. Now it's all hours & hands/feet and I have a stiffness and severe putting edema that pops up & then disappears with no regularity. There's no explanation from Doctor's YET. I was given this cream and I rub it into my hands, wrists, feet, & lower legs. It does seem to calm things some, reduces the burn.",
                    "I'm a 58 year old woman with osteoarthritis and pain in my knees. Tried a lot of things that didn't work including other NSAIDs, shots, tramadol, but have been on this for about 2 months and it is a life saver. I am able to walk 2-3 miles a day with minimal pain, walk up and down steps, and sleep better. I haven't noticed any significant side effects -- perhaps very mild constipation. I will be deferring the knee replacements for a while thanks to this drug. I take it twice a day, 75 mg.",
                    "This works great.",
                    "Not a bad anti-inflamatory. Better if taking it with a Vicodin or Percocet.",
                    "Worked great on a muscle strain! Even helped to heal it faster. Nice mild smell. I gave it a 8/10 and not a 10/10 because it gave me side effects. Ringing in ears quite frequently as well as a very strong dizzy feeling. This began after a week of use.",
                    "I was having hand pains a friend put some on my hand,I had no pain for days,I went to my Dr.got a prescription, it works no ordor,it also helps my roto tear,I had a botched surgery, it helps that pain. Thanks to my friend and this company.",
                    "I have been taking Voltaren for the past 6 years in conjunction with omapromazin. I would not have been able to walk, sleep or enjoy life. It is only now after having two knee replacements that I no longer need to take any medication. I think Voltaren is a way to enjoy life again, without pain. But for me I am happy to have the new knee replacements.",
                    "Only took twice a day for my ankylosing spondylitis . Had little relief if any at all. Vimovo worked much better but after a couple months had horrible GI side effects.",
                    "I've had migraines for 25 plus years and it's almost impossible to get pain medication these days even at an urgent care facility. My new doctor offered me Cataflam. I received the generic Diclofenac 50 mg. and was very excited about receiving any kind of help making it through a migraine which sometimes lasts 8 days, sometimes 2 days. Anyway, I took it three times a day the first two days and sporadically for another two or three days. It worked very well much to my surprise; however, after that I experienced the stomach burn I read someone else experienced. I didn't realize what had caused the burning until I read the reviews on this med. I'm a little afraid to take it again unless I just take it one or two days next time. Try it.",
                    "Liver problems, severe stomach pain, severe constipation, memory issues, trouble sleeping, loss of appetite, nausea to name just a few. Otherwise it took my knee pain away.",
                    "I started taking Disclofenac today for severe back pain caused by shingles. Immediately I felt some relief and I'm able to take a deep breathe without it hurting. This is the only pain med that really helped.",
                    "I have taken this medicine on and off for the past few years and it has done wonders! My doctor tried a number of medications for years of back pain and nothing worked. Diclofenac worked immediately. At times I go off of it for a few months, but when pain comes back, it works immediately. Fortunately no side effects.",
                    "I had back surgery 6 months ago, three discectomies, and a rod and five screws implanted. While it is stated it is not approved for spinal use, I have found Voltaren extremely beneficial. While I still have pain in the neighborhood of an 8 out of 10, I feel that it would always be a 10 without Voltaren. Many thanks to my PA for recommending it.",
                    "Long story kinda short! My knee swelled up where I couldn't even bend it. My mom gave me a tube of her gel. It worked right away when I applied it. Great stuff. Here's the best part though. I have a bulge in my lower back. I have meloxacam but I don't take it regularly because I feel that it don't help any. So one day my back is as hurting really bad so I decided to apply the gel. Glad I did because wow! It works amazing! They should most definitely test it on the back. I know surgery will be the only thing for permanent relief but I'm only 31 and one can't afford it and two it's not guarantee it would work and could make my problem worse. Next time I go to my doctor I will be asking for my own prescription.",
                    "The first time my doctor suggested Voltaren cream. I have osteo in both knees, right ankle and my spine. After several tubes and no reduction of pain or swelling my doctor suggested Pennsaid . The difference was like day and night. Not only did it reduce the pain but the swelling in my ankle was also reduced. When I investigated both products I was shocked to find that only Pennsaid contains a delivery agent DMSO that Voltaren does not . So it seems the DMSO delivers directly into the joint while the Voltaren only stays on the skin. Bottom line I will never spend my money on anything else going forward ....Pennsaid works for me.",
                    "I love this gel. Just 10 seconds after I put it on an area with severe pain, the pain is gone completely for 2 hours. I couldn't believe it the first time I used it. I take some other strong prescription medication for knee and back pain and the medications don't do as good a job on the pain as this gel. I wish I could use it more than 4 times a day, but during my waking hours, it is a God send. Thank you, thank you, thank you! I would do a commercial for Voltaren Gel anytime, for free!",
                    "Zipsor is the ONLY med that gives me relief from intense pain in both shoulders due to widespread inflammation. This drug is absolutely amazing.",
                    "I've been taking Diclofenac 50mg once a day for many years. If I forget for any reason the pain immediately returns. I am now 60 and the arthritis in my fingers is getting worse, but as I can take up to 3 tablets a day I can just increase my dosage. I recently recommended Diclofenac to a friends 90 year old mother, she had immediate relief and was so thankful.",
                    "I use it for Osteoarthritis of the knee and shoulder arthritis from torn rotator cuffs. It has helped me alleviate the need for surgery for many years. It is very effective.",
                    "better than pain pills works the best and goes right to the pain",
                    "I had pain from shingles. Gabapentin was giving me minimal relief, I tried diclofence suggested by a friend, it gave me relief in minutes. I use the 10%, and thankful I found it worked for me.",
                    "This gel is so effective that I don't need to take ibuprofen anymore. Very soothing, quick acting, long lasting, pleasant smell that soon dissipates.",
                    "I did physical therapy, icing, resting, every technique to try to stop the pain in my knee. I have osteoarthritis as well. This medication was the only thing that worked and stopped the pain in my knee. I am so happy my doctor prescribed this drug for me.",
                    "Cataflam is a life saver but it takes about an hour after swallowing to start working. I take 2 at a 6 hr interval and can take up to six at the end of the day, but that's only for the first day of the period. ",
                    "Works for Osteoarthritis and sciatica.",
                    "I was suffering from an impingement of a nerve root exiting the left side of the T10 - T11 junction. I was prescribed Zipsor in combination with Skelaxin (muscle relaxant). The combination provided no discernible pain relief. However, I did suffer from significant stomach and intestinal pain. The stomach & intestinal pain stopped within 12 hours of discontinuing the Zipsor. Overall, not a pleasant experience.",
                    "I had tried Lidoderm and had fair to good results. I was reluctant to try the Flector because of the cost. My insurance did not cover them.  In an impulsive act due to frustration with pain, I got the script filled. Within 2 hours I noticed that the severe pain in my knee was almost gone, and I slept very well through the night. These are a miracle and work as well as or better than any systemic medicine including narcotics. They really do work. ",
                    "I had this for Broken Back, Shoulder Surgery (rotator cuff). I literally taste the medication when I apply it to my skin on my shoulder / arm area. Had a bit of gastric upset for about a half hour after using. Seemed to help relieve some of my pain though. Just wondering if you've had people report the taste on application.",
                    "My doctor prescribed Voltaren after an extremely painful IUD insertion and subsequent cramping. I've never had cramps like these before. I'd literally be curled up in the fetal position, unable to even talk. Depending on the level of pain, this either completely eradicated it or made it totally bearable, and lasted for 12 hours at a stretch. Voltaren is wonderful and I'm glad my doctor recommended it over a narcotic painkiller.",
                    "My doctor gave me samples for a pulled muscle under my right breast; glad I did not have to pay for them because they've done nothing for me!",
                    "I started taking Voltaren back in October for osteoarthritis of my knees, right hip & left hand. I also have bursitis & piriformis syndrome in my right hip as well as achilles tendonitis in the right foot. I take 75mg 2 times a day. My knees are so bad that I had to have Synvisc-One injections as well. Combined I have been able to work my 12 hr shifts as an RN. I still have pain that's about a 6-7 after working three 12's in a row, but would not be able to work at all without the Voltaren. I am looking to have my knees replaced in the near future. The only side effect I have had is stomach upset if I do not take it with food and some mild constipation. I would recommend this medicine to anyone. ",
                    "This medication has been a God send for me. After PT and a year of Aleve my shoulder was somewhat better but not great. For a different issue my physician told me to stop the Aleve and try Diclofanac Sodium. My body is very happy. No back, neck, ankle, toe, shoulder pain. My shoulder range of motion is almost 100%. For me, Diclofenac Sodium DR 50mg has been wonderful.",
                    "I need to take Cytotec (misoprostol) with it.",
                    "I have \"jumpers knee\" tendonitis. I play softball and I am a outfielder...I also workout 5 times a week. Back in my days I ran track as well...I guess it all caught up to me in my early 30's ..I couldn't lift my leg below my knee it was so painful, my sports dr prescribed Voltaren and when I used it as prescribed 4x's a day I saw a good bit of improvement...",
                    "My podiatrist gave me a sample containing 2 patches for heel spur/achiles tendon pain. I've been using the patch for 3 days and have noticed a marked improvement in the amount of pain. Based on other reviews with issues of sticking, I use veterinary wrap to hold it in place. I've since called my podiatrist asking for a full prescription based on the relief I already feel.",
                    "This medicine is pretty miraculous as far as my joints are concerned. I'm using much less than the 2gram dose - maybe 1/4 to 1/2 a gram on a joint, tops - and having at least 8 hours pain free. It seems no studies were conducted on it's use on shoulders, but it worked decently enough for mine when I pinched a nerve.  Make sure you read the possible side effects and all the potential negatives, and test on a single area with someone with you for a couple hours just to make sure you're not allergic. It's been problem-free for me, but everyone's body chemistry is different.",
                    "I'm a great fan of diclofenac. I have severe lumbar stenosis and osteoarthritis of the hips and knees, and could not function without some relief of the pain. Diclofenac does not relieve all of my pain, but it relieves 60-70 percent of it, or enough to allow me to have a life. For me it appears to be safe and effective. The only side -effect I've experienced is occasional mild constipation. I recommend it highly.",
                    "Since i got my period when I was 12 years I experience an unbearable pain that stops my life completely accompanied by vomiting and diarrhea and so many times went to hospital emergency. I may faint of pain all the ppl arround me  know what i suffer in school, university or at work Voltaren ampoule worked well so far to extent that i can give myself the injection in the butt like a boss It makes me sleepy and from the huge pain I feel dizzy head and very tired but its better than the pain for sure I wish there would be no side effects in the long run .. I'm 26 years now .",
                    "I've been on Vicodin, Percocet, etc. My body doesn't react to those. I was diagnosed with a cervical strain and was put on this. Absolutely love it for muscle pain. I have arthritis and fibromyalgia and this medicine is great. Also no side effects.",
                    "Although no medication completely rids my migraines (I get stroke like symptoms with my migraines) aura with numbness on right or left side- depending on side of pain, dizziness and off balance. It's absolutely horrible! But when I take Cambia right away it relives the killer pain! I still get my warning signs but the migraine passes much more quickly with this medication! It does tend to make me feel a little weird-my nerves feel over sensitive. But I got a migraine around 8am today took cambia! And on my way to work at 12:30pm! Miracle!",
                    "My doctor gave me 3 samples of Pennsaid while waiting on the prescription. I don't understand any of these reviews. It does absolutely nothing for me. I was in a car accident and it appears I may have partially torn a ligament in my wrist. Maybe I was misdiagnosed and this is just the wrong medication for that? My doctor told me it would help the inflammation but all the reviews I've read are claiming \"pain relief\"? Thankfully I had the samples before I was forced to spend upwards of $75.00 for this useless medication.",
                    "I started using Voltaren Gel 1% in 2015 and it really did help decrease my pain in my neck, lower back, hips, knees, ankles, elbows, and wrists. But do need to apply 4 times per day.  I have Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type III hypermobility . My ligaments and tendons are weak and has been affecting my joints, needing to have 2 neck surgeries, bunions, and wrist surgery. I switched over to the generic Diclofenac 3% gel. Let me tell you it works! Unfortunately this higher dose costs anywhere from $600.00 - $1,100.00 for a 100 Gram tube. Downside is that it's marketed for skin Actinic Keratosis.",
                    "I have rheumatoid arthritis and use Voltaren topically on my joints. This helps.",
                    "Amazing! Perfect!",
                    "After purchasing the medicine for shoulder pain I followed directions and applied 4 times a day. The second day the applied area ( upper arm and shoulder ) was turning dark. By the end of second day the arm was black swollen and painful. Emergency room visit did not provide any relief other than telling Me to discontinue use of gel. I have a artificial heart valve that requires that I take blood thinner which was discussed with the prescribing physician and had been used as prescribed. The arm continued to swell and the blackness continued down the arm with pain that became unbearable. A ambulance was summoned to take me back to the hosital emergency room personnel could not diganose the situation completely and I was admitted to the ward. Surgery was required",
                    "I did take it without food and my stomach did not like the pain like gas high in the stomach and right side pain. Given by the VA.",
                    "I started on this medication to relieve inflammation for tennis elbow. It has done a decent job on that, but it has done an amazing job in reducing pain from plantar fascitis! I've only been on it for about 3 weeks. I've noticed no side effects.",
                    "I have cervical osteoarthritis extending from C5-T1. My pain had increased to the point where I had to have two radiofrequency (RF) neurotomy procedures performed to varying degrees of success. Pain returned, so tried Percocet 5/325 2x day for a month but only provided a temporary relief until the dose would wear off. I became concerned about opiate dependency so I made the decision to stop. Started Diclofenac 75mg ('551' on one side and a fancy 'R' on the other) 1xday and had a SIGNIFICANT reduction in pain after just two days. Bloodwork shows that it does mildly elevate my liver enzymes (ALT of 60) and has slightly lowered RBC, WBC & platelets which is a common side effect. Benefits outweigh the risk at this point, so will continue.",
                    "I am an artist and a horseback rider and for the last few months have experienced a very painful case of tendinitis in my right arm. This gel works well and very quickly in my case, and with bracing and icing I have experienced a lot of relief. The nature of this pain reliever is anti inflammatory - not numbing - so I don't think you would find use for it if your pain is not of the inflammatory nature. I get spastic and tense neck muscles all the time and find heat and massages work better. So for the right purpose it is excellent stuff. I am sensitive, delicate skinned and had no allergies but I would be careful and spot test nonetheless.",
                    "I received a sample of this from my ortho hand surgeon. He said it should help while I wait for my EMG test. He wasn't lying. I have several trigger points and my right side is painful and numb due to compression from my neck and what he suspects, compression of carpal tunnel radial nerve, ulnar nerve, etc. basically everything is compressed. This patch worked wonders. Very disappointed to learn its not covered by insurance",
                    "I have arthritis is both knees from years of athletics, in my youth. I have moderate to severe pain after long standing, use or cold. The Flector Patch on my knees are perfect. I use them as needed and I experience 90% relief without having to take any oral medicines. I am a FAN!",
                    "I hit my toe and half my foot swollen.",
                    "This product didn't work for me. The risks did not outweigh the side effects. I used it after my colonoscopy and had to use other pain medicines as well.",
                    "Cataflam is a miracle for my period pain. I have suffered for years and wouldn't be even able to walk a few steps with the horrible pain. I've tried everything from Meftalspas to spasmoproxivonne, Brufen, Panadol, etc.. nothing works. With Cataflam in just half an hour my pain is completely gone. I take it every 8 hours in my first two days.",
                    "Occupational Health at my workplace prescribed this patch for me because I apparently strained a muscle below my patellar bone... It did nothing for me! Apparently it works for everyone else, so I may just be an oddball. It was like taking a placebo and I am not even taking other pain meds... So it's not like I have a tolerance level for pain meds... This just doesn't do anything for me. It was def. a miss. ",
                    "I was prescribed Voltaren gel for my MCP joint, which experienced remodeling of bone after my 14-year career as a deep tissue massage therapist. I am a chiropractic student, so I went the conservative route first: adjustment, ultrasound, cold laser, Alpha-stim, microcurrent probes. Finally I had a series of x-rays on campus and unfortunately, there is a large osteophyte on the volar (palm) side of the base of the 1st metacarpal, along with serious lipping of the scaphoid bone which supports it (you know this combination as the saddle joint). Voltaren helps the crippling pain of trying to unscrew a jar, open a doorknob, or hold a pen. I will however have surgery to remove the osteophyte.",
                    "The gel helps with the pain but my stomach was a little upset, I got a mild headache and I felt very drowsy and out of it. Yes I know it's the gel but I still had side effects. I only rubbed in a small amount. I can't swear by it but I think it also caused me to have several anxiety attacks which I think are related to the woozy out of it feeling. It says it makes you dizzy on the box.",
                    "I slipped a disc in my back a year ago and have been in pain ever since! After racking his brain, my doctor gave me a sample of Voltaren Gel. I didn't have high hopes, but it is WONDERFUL!  Because I have had Gastric Bypass surgery, I can not take NSAIDS which pretty much leaves me, Tylenol! I did sneak an Aleve after being in so much pain and I was so sick to my stomach. The only negative, if Im in pain and my husband isn't home, it's kind of hard to apply to my own back!!! So I think this is a WONDERFUL medication for a person who can't orally take an anti-inflammatory medication! A true life saver!",
                    "Had no relief at all from this medicine. Had high hopes that it would lessen pain in knees and hands but unfortunately it did not.",
                    "I've had chronic lower back pain for over two years (herniated disk). I can't say for sure what has relieved my pain, but ever since taking diclofenac my pain almost immediately has gone from being almost completely debilitated, to being able to function physically at the level I was at when pain started. Still have pain and not 100%, but my quality of life is back and I feel much more fluid and agile. For almost six months I could hardly get out of bed, let alone tie my shoes.",
                    "I have psoriatic arthritis with lots of foot pain. I wanted an alternative to the drugs and anti-inflammatories normally prescribed and my doctor suggested this. After reading reviews I expected this to take away the pain immediately. It didn't, but knowing that everyone is different I kept trying and I'm glad I did. Now on day three my foot pain is much better, allowing me to walk. I have had no skin reaction. The smell of the ammonia carrier can be a bit overwhelming but it dissipates quickly.",
                    "It has helped my back, but not completely eliminated pain or discomfort. The patch has greatly enhansed my quality of life, easy to use and does not cause any problems to my stomach.",
                    "Why on earth any company would add fragrance to a medicine is beyond me when so many medical facilities have gone fragrance free. Even the low level fragrance has caused nausea after a half day's use. It's either the fragrance or a reaction to the gel. Didn't make much difference in my pain level.",
                    "I fell and broke the Radial head of my elbow (have never broken anything before and I am 45 yrs old). The doctor put me on Vicodin and it did nothing for that pain, UNTIL he gave me Zipsor, I was much much better in about an hour! The only side effect was that I was a little sleepy.",
                    "I am 38 years old with 4 small kids. I've recently been diagnosed with osteoarthritis in my hips and most likely my knees. I was also having significant shoulder and heel pain. Within 2 days of starting this medication I would say I was 75% better. Now after 1 month I feel better than I have felt in years. I am amazed that 1 medication can work this well. I have not noticed any side effects.",
                    "I was prescribed Diclofenac Sodium tablets for emergency medicine regarding my Chronic Paroxsymal Hemicrania. It was ineffective at alleviating any pain. I'd feel a small reduction in pain level for about 30 minutes then it would spike back up. It caused my blood glucose to shoot up and I am non-diabetic. It also caused me a great deal of stomach cramps, burning pain below sternum, belching, heartburn and diarrhea. I had better response on Ibuprofen and that did very little.",
                    "I have been having severe back and neck pain for years and was taking ibuprofen 24 hours a day. My doctor told me that was very bad for my stomach and to use the Voltaren Gel instead and I found it to be wonderful, comfortable and it smells nice. Two days after I started using the Voltaren Gel I was so much more comfortable and now I alternate the ibuprofen 200 with the Gel and only use the Ibuprofen 200 two times a day. I can sleep a whole night. My back condition is in the muscles and and they are in spasm much of the time. Voltaren calms the spasms down and makes the pain tolerable. I am so glad to have found it.",
                    "I experienced very high levels of pain in my upper back over the course of six months, with hand tremors and trouble swallowing. Muscle and joint pain followed. Tests for many conditions are negative, including rheumatoid arthritis, but we are still looking. Diclofenac was prescribed, and over the course of two weeks, the pain faded. I felt like a human being. I did not experience negative side effects. On the contrary, I did not suffer any of my standard migraines. Unfortunately, after 8 months, the VA hospital changed vendors and the new brand of Diclofenac was not effective. In the week following the change, I suffered all previous symptoms along with a migraine and upsurge in depression symptoms. Very frustrating. Still trying to sort it out.",
                    "Unbelievable. I just used this for the first time and had relief in about 15 minutes. 13 years of pain shots 12 doctors, 2 surgeries and I put on this gel and feel so much better. For me, it is a miracle.",

                    "I began seeing my doctor for neck problems, I cannot take oral NSAID'S due to Crohns disease so my doctor suggested to try them as an alternative. I had every test run from an Ortho and Neurologist with no reasoning for my neck problems other than Fibro. Sometime the back of my neck swells around two nerves on both sides that go into my arms and head, I've tried every narcotic there is but nothing but a Flector patch helps. Recently I had a very extensive knee surgery with an 8-12 month recovery time and once the incision healed I was given the okay to use these, they helped tremendously. I now have an injury while recovering and they are my life saver once again. They are very expensive but worth every penny.",

I suffer from stiff shoulders and neck pain, caused by sitting at a computer all day, carrying a heavy laptop and purse. I used it on my neck and shoulders since it was an anti-inflammatory. It worked for me, I noticed a significant 'loosening' of my 'tight' shoulder muscles with just one application. I'm sold! I'm gonna get mom to give it another go!",

I am having very little pain for the first time in 3 years in my knees and feet. On a recent business trip to Germany I purchased 4 large tubes of a higher strength (over the counter in Germany and Switzerland) for 1/3 the price of my copay. A very effective drug for me.",

I was a little skeptical about a Cambia pack I got from doctor, but after 3 hours and no relief I took it and within 30 minutes it was gone. Been suffering from these for 18 years and will keep some this on hand just in case.",

I have very inflamed painful bursitis under my scapula that throws all my muscles in my back/neck out of whack and creates a lot of transferred pain and problems for me. I was hoping this Voltaren gel my rheumatologist prescribed would help since the Celebrex and muscle relaxers alone are not doing the trick. But I do not detect any difference when I use it. However, I do occasionally get soreness in my left knee and when I tried it on that, it did seem to help.",
                    "I have been dealing with extreme pain in my hip and groin area. I took one pill but never again. I first experienced drowsiness, which isn't anything to worry about until I started to not feel right in my head. Lasted for about 20 minutes. Then as I was standing in the kitchen making dinner I developed extreme nausea for about 5 minutes. This led to a rush shooting straight to my head and on came a dizzy spell that lasted for about 20 seconds. Followed by a partial black out for a split second, vision came back and I went to sit down moments later I was perfectly ok. Well besides feeling freaked out of course. I would never recommend this medicine to anyone.",

My pain specialist has done various treatments including Facet Joint Injections, with no long terms results. At my recent visit with him I was complaining of the same pain with no relief, he handed me two sample tubes of Voltaren Gel. I have been using it for about a week now and have had a full week without pain. This stuff really works. I have been impressed so far. Thanks Voltaren.",

I've used Lidocaine patches, pain management trigger point injections, and acupuncture. When my PA handed me 2 tubes of this gel, I didn't have much hope for it.

These pain patches basically feel like happiness surrounding my wrist. I still have pain but it is at a much more tolerable level. I have my life back. For me, the patches work better than pain pills. They are covered by my insurance at a higher co-pay. And, with each prescription, I have to go through this whole prior authorization wait period. Get samples from your doctor to test them out and make sure they work for you. If they do, then fight the insurance. For my wrist, I am able to cut the patches into 2 halves and makes the prescription last longer. These saved my life.",

Since I have stomach problems and am unable to take oral NSAIDs, narcotics or Ultram, I tried Lidoderm patches without success. Then I read about Voltaren gel in Arthritis Today magazine and asked my doctor for it. It has worked well and this is the only way I am able to sit without severe pain. ",
                    "Is expensive but takes the edge off. I use for L-spine DJD and combine with 300mg Neurontin for best effect.

                    "Works wonders on lower back pain but sometimes needs a narcotic pain killer or muscle relaxer for days when pain is more severe. Downside of this drug is that taking too much causes excruciating abdominal cramping and stabbing gas pains in the intestines. But it's an 8-hour pill, so pain relief usually lasts and it is not hard to space doses out since it lasts so long.",

I was prescribed Flector patches and I could not believe how much better I felt the next day. I was able to get out of bed and bend over with little to no pain. These patches are so GREAT!!!!!",
                    "This medicine really helped my back pain, but lead to a whole other problem. My stomach was damaged and I had to get a tube down my throat to check my esophagus.

I was prescribed the patches with the caveat that \"they may not work.\" They work very well and my pain has decreased between 75-90%. If I use them as directed (1 every 12hrs) they are most effective. There are some issues with the adhesive on the edges but I've found if I warm them with my hand they stick better. True, there is very little movement of fabric over the area as with back issues. I work with a personal trainer 5 days a week so the leg gets a lot of use. Mine is an unusual use for these patches, but they are definitely worth a try.",

I should have looked further (http://www.drugs.com/cdi/voltaren-gel-gel.html). The maker (Novartis) issued a warning letter in December, noting problems. Looks like I'll still be getting my Hyalgen shot on Friday. I will follow up with my Doc(I used a free-sample) and go from there.

My Rheumatologist gave me a script this past week for Diclofenac Sod EC 75 mg tab 2x day. It is my miracle! Absolutely NO pain, bones, joints, skin, muscles, anywhere!

A friend turned me on to Voltaren Gel . I used it on my knees, neck, and lower back. This is as close to a miracle as I have experienced in my 50 years of arthritis producing activities. The best part is that dosing is applied directly and only to the problem areas so consequently much less ends up in your system overall than if taken orally. Win. Win.",

I have taken other anti inflamitories before but they didn't seem to help but this drug has been fantastic. I have been able to work out again and it has really reduced the amount of knee and ankle pain I get. I take two 75 mgs tablets a day and have not had any side effects and I have been taking it for about 3 months. I would recommend this drug to anyone who has arthritis pain",

After using for 2 days, the pain is diminished and movement of the forearm, grasping with the fingers, and range of motion is very near back to normal with very little pain. I work on a computer all day, typing and mousing. I apply 2 grams, 4 times a day to the elbow area. It makes working very tolerable. I would say Voltaren is a good treatment and really helps bring my arm function back to normal with no pain for tendonitis / Tennis Elbow. Aspercreme was also ok, but the Voltaren does better. Mild stretching, exercise and movement also help and are made much easier with the Voltaren.",

All the alternatives have not worked, so persuaded a new Rhumatologist to re-instate it for short while and life was good again. I had no side effects from this drug.

Immediately I had relief and could rise from a chair, lean over a table, and pick up objects. Things I couldn't do for a year prior. If I miss a day of this medicine the pain and stiffness returns.

I have tried numerous pain medicines and although I did not have any noticeable side effects with the Zipsor, it did no more for me than taking 2 Aleves. Maybe because my pain is bone related with the addition of torn cartilage and nerve problems? Glad that it works so well for some. Anything to get off of narcotic medicines and the crutches pre-op would be nice! So, for me and my dysplasia Zipsor has not been the miracle I was hoping for.",

It also helps my very sore feet, probably plantar fasciatis.  I don't know why they did not give this to me earlier, its much more effective than oral NSAID's or even Vicodin, as this works faster, much faster.  I use it less often than recommended (up to 4 times a day), because its not needed. Once or twice a day for me relieves the pain, pronto. It also helps my wife, with her osteoarthritis pain.",

If I get up walk around for a few minutes sometimes the pain vanishes. Otherwise I apply Voltaren gel- about the size of a small grape over the sore place and the pain goes away pretty quickly. I occasionally apply Voltaren ahead of time if I know I'm going to be on my feet a lot. ",

The Voltaren Gel also helps with the bone pain I get along my temples and at the base of my skull, so I am thankful that it is a non-greasy gel instead of a cream. (These areas of pain come from a compression head injury I got as a teenager.) I have a lot of problems trying to take anything for the arthritis in oral form, and I still take Aciphex along with using the Voltaren Gel as a precaution. (This product works well with even less than the amount suggested, so a tube goes further for me; I use up about 1 1/2 tubes each month.)",

They charge hundreds of dollars for only nine powders. The actual drug of Diclofenac Potassium is cheap and you get a 30 day supply. I just crushed the pill into a powder and took with water just like the Cambia...worked just as fast and tasted better, because it had NO taste. Don't be fooled by the makers of Cambia. It is just another Epi Pen scandal story.",

What an advantage to be able to apply the gel right to the affected area, relief comes rather fast. It doesn't last as long as I would like, but when you are in pain, any relief is welcome. Used in conjunction with my other medicines it has helped me to put together a medication regime that helps me to live with this condition.

After two hours I went for a walk and was able to walk farther in the same amount of time and without as bad of a limp. This morning my foot was tender. I don't think I will use it when my foot is really sore. I have learned to back off or pay for it the next day. There is always a trade off when I try to medicate this kind of pain.",

I had 3 epidurals in the space of about 3-4 months with no relief. I swapped pain management doctors and am now on 15mg of oxycodone every 6 hours, 4mg Zanaflex every 8 hours, 500mg of Naproxen every 12 hours, 40mg Celexa once a day and 600mg of Neurontin every 8 hours just to sort of be able to function.

But I must state here though for you that I can hardly tolerate Ibuprofen or any NSAID pain-killer for that matter, of late that is. Earlier, I'd tolerate medicines like sweets, but after taking Ciprofloxacin 14 months ago, and that has messed up my whole system: I've even developed a number of food intolerances as well.

I've tried 3 different prescription medications and they did nothing. The second day on this medication I started getting some relief in my back. It's not 100% gone but it really eases my pain. The unfortunate side effect with any nsaid is thin blood resulting in bruising. I have a bleeding autoimmune disorder so it's not the best combo. But I feel like as a first there's promising relief.

Last summer while gardening I developed a severe lower back rash which I assumed was somehow sweat related. This year I developed the same painful, itchy rash on my right upper back (deltoid area and shoulder) down to my lower arm. Again, I thought it was from the heat and sweat. As I was applying it yesterday, I realized it was being applied directly on top of my rash. The ONLY places I have my rash. It took me long enough!!

It burns her and she refuses to use it so she gave me a tube for my arthritis in both my knees, my hip, back and ankles. WOW! This is a dream come true. It seems to work immediately for me and putting it on right before bed allows me to sleep all night because I have slight to no pain. I wake up, use it and then my day goes by MUCH better. I'm going to try to remember to actually take it to work with me so I can apply it there. I keep forgetting. Praise God for allowing me to try this gel. I was leery at first but tried it anyway.

Couldn't sleep, constant ache from shoulder into my bicep. Rather than get a Cortisone shot yesterday, the doctor suggested I try a sample of the Flector Patch. I wore it last night and finally experienced some relief. I'd say the pain is about 75% better, and I managed to get some sleep. ",

Went to the doctor after a week of pain and not much healing taking place to make sure I didn't suffer any major ligament damage. He diagnosed the IT band issue and gave some samples of Flector Patch and as more of a comic relief, stated that \"these really shouldn't work, but actually do\". Was a little skeptical at first, but these patches do provide wonderful relief. Four patches later I am feeling much improvement in the mobility of my knee strain. Definitely worth a try.",

My doctor put me on this 2 years ago, 50mg once a day, and I honestly don't think I would survive the summer without it. One of my major problems I was getting out of bed in the morning, I couldn't even roll over the pain was so bad. So basically what I do is set my alarm 1/2 hour earlier so I can take it and let it work a little bit before I have to be up and out. I went from having to take so many days off of work to feeling so much relief. Since Physical Therapy didn't work for me, I will probably continue to take this as long as I have pain.",

I woke up this morning with it being extremely stiff behind my knee. I applied Pennsaid all over the back and front of my knee. No kidding - within 5 minutes, most of that stiffness is GONE. I am in shock. And if you have knee pain, you know how debilitating it can feel. This stuff is INSANE - in a good way!! I'm so glad I have it. I literally can't believe how much it helped me.

I have not been overly impressed with either thus far. But I have noticed a little less stiffness and some range of motion. But in fairness the inflammation is no doubt very deep in both joints and would take time for the medicine to hit its target area. The Dr told me to give it time which I felt was reasonable. I find the gel to have a pleasant smell and rubs in nice and dries pretty quick. I am using the Voltaren Gel that says, diclofenac sodium topical gel 1%. Don't quote me but I believe they also make it with 2% diclofenac sodium?? With ins my cost was 42.00 for 5 tubes. Greasing both knees uses a lot",

I did not expect such a good result or any result, I was just so fed up I grabbed a tube to mix up with the oral meds! It's helped my sleep in a matter of days and I'm much more comfortable.

We have had no side effects and we use it for major flare-ups as it is not intended for long term daily use. We each get a big tube, even though some might find it pricey, you don't have to use a lot it lasts a long time. The relief it provides is priceless.

I'm still broken\"  I am on a 75mg dose, and within hours I could breathe and move much better- magical stuff. Pain is still there, but more like a sore muscle at this point... not like the sharp barbed wire in my chest feeling it had been. I have been eating with every dose, the doctor told me that this can be pretty harsh on your stomach if you are not careful. Hopefully I can decease my dose in a week. This is like a sledgehammer to inflamed tissue. No ill effects.",

Pain and swelling have been reduced, but not totally gone. I'd have to say I'm happy with the result as it has enabled me to keep working, but side effects are troublesome: I get headaches close to migraine level, my vision is so blurred sometimes, I'm VERY groggy in the morning and have a hard time getting out of bed, and the ringing in my ears has gotten worse.

Unfortunately, I found out that it is supposed to work to relieve the pain each time it is used. It certainly doesn't do this for me--I may as well be applying lotion for all the good it does me. It really does nothing at all. I'm really disappointed, as my pain management doctor just weaned me off of narcotics, so I don't have anything that helps with the pain at the moment.

I take a prescription drug for the pain and then put this cream on 4 or 5 times a day. Within minutes of applying it the pain dissipates & I'm pain free for several hours.

                    "This is a miracle! I've had migraines since I was 6, diagnosed with chronic daily migraines when I was 14 and have not been able to find a reprieve from the pain. On a scale of 1 to 10 my pain is usually around a 4 on a good day and a 8 or 9 on a bad one. On a bad day I take a dose of Cambia and an Imitrex subcutaneous injection and it completely knocks out my migraine! In all my years of having migraines I never thought that was possible. Even when I don't take the injection the Cambia alone brings a level 8 migraine down to a 3 which is manageable.",
                    "I was given Toradol for five days post operation (which is another wonderful medication) and Loratab to take along with it. I never had the need or desire to take the latter. But after Toradol was gone (I was able to stretch it over nine days) I still needed something else.  I began to take Naproxen over-the counter strength and the pain and stiffness gradually came back. I had Cataflam, which after 2-3 dosages, controlled the discomfort that was building up. ",

I have been on this med for 5 days now. It helped with the pain, but I don't know if I can deal with the side effects of muscle aches, irritability, weakness, fatigue,stomach issues. It is seeming like the side effects are winning. I can not continue to take this medication. I will be contacting my Dr. and giving him the details and will need to try something else, does anyone have any suggestions on a different medication?",

It is a fast acting medication, so you can apply it and get on with activities right away. The cost of the medicine is high, but if you have tried products such as aspercreme, biofreeze or joint flex. You will see that the cost and relief you get are directly related. I have and will continue to recommend this medicine to anyone who needs relief from osteoarthritis. Thanks for the help NOVARTIS.",

The scent is mild after a few minutes, and so is my pain level. After a particularly painful day I may apply twice. I don't need this every day so a tube will last me several months, at $30 each tube it does add up but since I don't need it nightly I manage the expense.",

I expected same relief with fewer side effects (s-e's)--possible s-e's turn out to be same. Have used for only 24 hours with some pain relief. But try cutting these in half and wrapping around thumb down to lower joint, surprised they stay on fairly well but they are ugly white, I can't wear out of the house. Besides, nowhere does it say they are for arthritis pain, just minor aches, sprains, strains etc. Afraid to use continually or long term due to s-e's. Terribly expensive for just an NSAID with terrible potential side-effects. (1 box with insurance $140, on retirement)",

My other sisters always need to take Caraflam. So when I couldn't bear the cramps anymore I took it, it started working about an hour later, I didn't feel painful anymore. Even though my sisters are pharmacists, they always told me that the less medicines I take, the better it would be. So I tried not to use it. It was the worst ever, I took one, it didn't work well when it reached the max of pain. I threw up and took another one. After an hour, it worked.

Gave it an 8 rating since I have only been on the drug for 1 week. Have experienced some acid reflux and sleepiness during the day. I don't know if it is because of the medicine or other problem.",

Was prescribed Dicloflex (Diclofenac sodium in UK) in 3 x 50mg tablets a day. Didn't seem to make a lot of difference the first day, so I continued using Paracetamol codeine for pain relief. Today I've been a lot more comfortable - it seems like it took three doses to get started.

My opiate pain medication helps so much but in between doses I use the cream to get by. Without it I can't function at a normal level and it hurts to bad to cook, shower, or do any basic activity. I have had no side effects. Although after I shave it burns to put it on my knees but that's just because I had just shaved.",

A year later I woke up one morning with a stiff neck. I thought nothing of it and went to a trampoline park where I came down with a thud on my bum. No biggie, I'm pretty resilient at 32. The next day I had excruciating pain in my upper left back, neck and shoulder. My muscle at the collar bone was cramped tight! I waited 2 weeks and there was little relief, no sleep. I found my Diclofenac and it helped in an hour! NO PAIN! I slept for a full night! I see doc tomorrow for an MRI and diagnosis.",

Note: I don't want to over state the how effective it is but it works. Talking to my doctor about the pain. He gave me this to try. Well my 1st thought was \"just another snake oil\" But it'sfreak'in amazing, it works like magic. Why did I not recive this years ago. The Drugest gave me a stupid look.

If your doctor has you on Celebrex and you don't feel any relief, ask him for Voltaren. You will most certainly feel the difference. If you are on it for any length of time (like me) then every so often you'll have to have blood work done to check your kidneys and liver to make sure they are functioning right as this medicine can cause problems with that.

The patches helped somewhat. Now I have some pain for stepping up workouts on the shoulder, and I can place the patch directly on the pain area, and it's working wonderfully. The patch has a kind of numbing feeling, and overall the feeling can be compared to what ibuprofen does in reducing inflammation. The patches can make me a little sleepy.

You should not be expecting this gel to completely alleviate back pain. It's not supposed to do that. It's supposed to get your muscles to a place where you can do other things more easily to attain painlessness via a combined effort. For a lot of back pain, if you use the gel in conjunction with consistent stretching (twice daily) whilst consuming the correct diet and being active enough to lower your body weight, you will be in a much better place in no time - so be encouraged! The gel really helps you do the things you need to do physically to get to that place.",

My RA flared up in addition to my cocyx broken off, literally. The pain was so severe that oral meds weren't effective.

The pain subsided to about a level 3 from a level 6 after wearing it for just a few short hours.  Do not stop wearing the patch as the pain will come back quickly.

In that year I have had total knee replacement (left knee), then two more \"revisions\" on the same knee to get rid of an infection. Just weeks ago, I came to the conclusion that Celebrex just wasn't getting the job done for my pain, and of course I did not want to take narcotics.

                    "I have tried a dozen different medications but none as effective as this. I tried Celebrex last year and was in so much pain after three days I went back to my Voltaren. I take 100mg twice a day that helps me work and function normally.",
                    "I have heel spurs and find every few weeks the pain is unbearable. This is the only thing that relieves the pain. And I take 2 and that seems to fix me for a couple of days, not sure why that is but as long as it works that's the main thing.",

                    "My trial with Diflucanec has been approx eight weeks now and it has eased my lower back pain. However, my liver enzymes have spiked, my urine output is in large volumes, and my upper back has a irritable rash cascading on it. I failed the trial due to my body trying to tell me something about this and medication.",

Often I'm so sore that I can hardly move. I take one of these and it's like a miracle pill, pain goes away. I don't take them often, but when I do...it works BIG TIME!",
                    "My back pain was caused by continuously lifting heavy furniture the wrong way. There was no immediate pain from doing it. But I noticed weeks later, severe back pain that affected my ability to stand for a long period of time without feeling light headed from the pain. No over the counter pain killers helped. When my doctor prescribed me this, it immediately went away. The only side effect I've experienced is feeling fatigued. Like most medications, though, my tolerance for it has built up quickly. And when I don't take it, the pain catches up on me quickly. It's difficult for me to get out of bed if I go more than a day without it. So I'd recommend doing exercises/stretches and don't just depend on it forever.",
                    "Recently had this prescribed for debilitating menstrual cramps, so I stopped my ibuprofen regimen and the next day started diclofenac 75mg extended release. I swear it's like not taking anything at all. At first I thought it had taken the edge off the cramps, but at 12 hours almost to the dot it wore off, so I took a second, which isn't doing anything. Will try this again next month when I can start taking it in advance of the pain, but as of right now this has been a completely useless medication.",
                    "For 5 years, my knee has caused severe problems and I have had to use a brace or bandage when on my feet. After having a large mass removed from my leg, the knee got worse and was swollen until I couldn't walk without a cane or walker. I went to the doctor to see if I could get a shot to help me walk and he gave me a tube of Voltaran Gel to use. I came home, put it on the knee and propped my leg up for an hour. When I was ready to get up, I dreaded it because I just knew I was going to be in horrible pain again. But, the pain was almost all gone. I couldn't believe that a simple gel could have that effect so fast but, it did! This product is worth its weight in gold! No cane for two days now!",

                    "I had been to the dermatologist for treatment to my lower lip diagnosed as Actinic Keratosis. Initially, he sprayed it with Liquid nitrogen and prescribed Solaraze gel. I used this gel for about 2 months twice daily on the lip. I must mention that there absolutely no effect of this medication on my lip. A total waste of money if you don't have insurance as it can be quite expensive without it.  Then I was prescribed all sort of other creams which was nothing but a waste of money on moisturizers. Don't feel bad to question the dermatologist as to what the cream does and whether it will cure you. The most essential treatment for single or isolated AKs is cryotherapy - liquid nitrogen spray.",

I have only had intermittent pain and it was extremely mild in comparison to before this combination.",
                    "I have suffered severe pain for 20 years following a motorcycle accident. During this time I have tried every sort of pain relief available to me, mainly narcotic drugs which I found as bad as the pain itself. Earlier this year I was prescribed Lyrica as far as pain relief goes...fantastic. After a few months (1x 75mg cap per day) I experienced total confusion and was unable to perform my daily tasks at work or at home. I was becoming agitated and experienced suicidal thoughts. Things returned to normal after a week or so of not taking Lyrica. Because it worked so well I am tempted to give it another go. It was just so good to not feel the pain anymore.",

                    "For the past 3 years I have been dealing with nerve pain left from shingles in my neck. I have tried EVERYTHING for this pain including injections and narcotics. Nothing really helped unless I was a zombie. I am allergic to a lot of medications including Tegretol and Neurontin. So when my neurologist suggested I try this medication I was VERY skeptical. I have been on this medicaton for a week now. I started on 25mg twice a day and felt some relief. I thought it was in my head. Now I am on 50mg twice a day and I can't believe the difference. I am relieved I can finally get my life back. I am a mother of 2. I did not realize how much the pain had taken over my life until now.",

                    "Hi I have been on pregabalin for over a year. Started at 75 mgs and thought it was going to work but it only lasted 1  day. I got up to 150 mgs twice a day with no positive effect. I am now down to 100 mgs twice a day. I have had no weight gain. I am on a few other meds but I still suffer daily with this awful anxiety. I am trying transcranial magnetic simulation right now and have about 3 weeks of treatments left, it hasn't helped me yet. The only thing that works for me is benzodiazepines and I become tolerant very quickly.",
                    "I have a pinched sciatic nerve in my lower back due to a compression fracture, and also severe nerve damage in my left arm. After being on different narcotics that didn't work, I gave up and just lived with the aching in my arm that never stopped. My Doctor put me on Lyrica, and I swear, I started crying because I had NO pain in my arm for the first time since my accident: 5 years. Lyrica has been a God send for me. It helps both my back and my arm. When my Doctor increases the dose, the side effects go away after 2 weeks. I recommend this medicine to anybody with nerve damage.",

Underwent a laminotomy for spinal compression due to synovial cyst and facet joint disease. Have a couple herniated discs, but left alone in surgery...felt I would recover from this on its own as I have very mild degenerative disc disease.. Since taking Lyrica for only 3 days at a low dose my pain has subsided enough so I could actually leave my home to go out to dinner. Pain went from about \"10\" at its worst down to about a m \"2-3\".  I would say try it as it may work for you. Side effects are less than gabapention.",
                    "I have had fibromyalgia for as long as I can remember. The pain was so bad 6 months ago from too much stress that I wasn't sleeping which made it worse. I had to quit my job and I would just lay in bed and cry moving my heating pad all around my body. It was a nightmare. I wanted my life back. I found a doctor to do all the tests and diagnose me. I tried gabapentin first and did nothing for me and I was a zombie so we switched to Lyrica. I take 300mg a day. It's not perfect ALL the time. Some days I am back in pain. And three days before my period I'm in a lot of pain. It has also helped my anxiety and insomnia. For me, the dizziness went away after a month. And the other side effects are minimal.",
                    "I was prescribed Lyrica (pregabalin) about 6 months ago. I was so shocked by the feelings of unreality it initially caused that I quickly stopped taking it. My fibromyalgia got so bad at the end of the year, that I decided to try it again.  I take low doses, 25 mg 2x a day, sometimes a 50 mg. The effect sets in within hours. My fibromyalgia pain is almost completely gone. A late evening dose allows me to sleep longer. I do feel strange when I take it and my intellectual capacity is quite affected, but the lack of distraction by the pain and a better social interaction with increased confidence levels makes up for that. I have to make sure that authorities and decision-making bodies are aware of my reduced competence, and close friends should know of these side effects, so that they can make allowances for any out-of-character behaviour on my part i.e. my inability to repair their car stereo.",

I was started on Pre Gabling two months ago and for me, it was a miracle, I have my life back! I know the Doctors say meds arent the answer for GAD but they are for me, I have had CBT, counselling, hypnotherapy, and nothing worked. But with pre gablin I have been on holiday with no probs, was actually able to relax for the first time in 8 years. I can go into any social scene and be really calm and enjoy it. All I hope is that it lasts and I dont get used to it. All my friends and family have said how well i am and relaxed and happy I appear. And I really am.",

Thank you Pfizer for Lyrica it has made such a difference in my quality of life!",

Everything about this drug was far worse than the problems it was supposed to address.  Do not take this toxic garbage. My Dr insisted I had to give it time to work... Any more time and I'd likely be dead or blind! Avoid like the plague and/or carefully read of myriad side effects and hope you can stop in time to avoid permanent problems from side effects. IMO this med s/b taken off the market!",

I have not noticed an increase in appetite but I have noticed food tastes better. I am also sleeping harder and it is hard to wake up. After 4 days I am so happy to have found this.",
                    "Makes me swell up, eat too much, bump into things, forget words and does nothing for my pain. Stupid, expensive drug. I've been taking 150mg. 2X per day for almost three months. It doesn't work.",
                    "I feel the need to warn everybody about the side effects and how difficult it can be to get off this drug. I've been on it for approximately 8 years before the side effects really started kicking in. Began as morning anxiety attacks, severe GI upset, mood swings and low to mid level depression. Tried changing the schedule from twice a day to three times a day. It helped at first but about two months later my body began anticipating new schedule and the side effects would start kicking in about an hour before next dose. Its taken me 8 months to get dosage down from 225 mg a day to 75mg a day and every step down has been sheer hell. Every step down leads to a period of depression, and it gets worse the closer you get to zero.",

I developed a problem with my kidneys, not from Lyrica, and had to decrease the dose to 300 mg twice a day. I have to say that I get little pain relief from this med but do get a feeling of well-being, or contentment. So, I call it my little happy pill. When I miss a dose, I notice I'm a bit depressed. It's not an antidepressant but it works that way for me. Thank you",
                    "Hi, I was prescribed Pregabalin about 8 years ago and have been taking it ever since. I suffer quite badly from anxiety and agitation and I can't tell you just how much this medication has helped. Even if I could just about get through the daytime without it, when I am asleep and my mind can follow any path it wishes to, it chooses to go down really bad avenues and I wake up feeling absolutely dreadful and this reached a terrible climax 8 years ago and resulted in me not eating at all and therefore losing a frightening amount of weight. However on my last pharmacy visit, I was a generic version of the drug which has not worked at all and so I am hoping my GP will put me back on Lyrica. If not, I am very fearful for the future.",
                    "I started taking Lyrica about 8 months ago. In about 3 days I had felt a significant change. It was working great for my Fibro, but I also have spinal arthritis. It did nothing for that or my sciatica. Finally I was bumped up to high dose, but do to other things in life I had to stop because of financial difficulties. I couldn't even afford copays. So I'm on gabapentin and it barely works. If I could, I would get back on Lyrica!                Thank you all for sharing your experiences!",

It relieved the aches and body spasms almost instantly. I could sleep at night, and woke up pain free and was able to live a somewhat normal life. I did however gain 40 lbs. I am now experiencing severe depression, and I feel it is the Lyrica. I ran out once and experienced the worst withdrawal symptoms. I felt like I was dying and the pain was severe. This medicine is wonderful, but getting off of it is very hard. ",

I'm constantly hungry, sleepy, dizzy and I feel like I'm drunk. I worked VERY hard to lose the weight that I gained when I was pregnant and since I've been on this medication, I've put it all back on and then some (40 lbs). It's hard to say if the pain is better or if I'm so caught up with the side effects that I don't care. I'm being weened off of it right now and being put on a different medicine. I'd rather go back to the opiates and itch like crazy.",

It has taken care of the larger muscle pains but does NOTHING for the life-sucking body ache that I have suffered with since 1978. Nor does it stop my back pain. I take hydrocodone to deal with the body ache/back pain. I have good days and bad days still, but when the day is good, very little muscle pain. Downside: I have gained a great deal of weight. Also there seems to be a great deal of fluid retention with Lyrica, a diuretic helps. ",

I almost never left my bed and I moved as little as possible because the pain was so severe. My doctor prescribed Lyrica for me and it changed my life. I still have good and bad days, but I can bear the bad days because of Lyrica. It gave me my life back. When I first took it, I did have the \"high\" feeling the side effects mention, but it was only my first two doses. Also, I HAVE to take it with food, otherwise I get extremely nauseous and dizzy. I have gained a lot of weight (about 40 lbs), but I also have CFS which has caused me to have a very sedentary lifestyle. overall, Lyrica saved my life.",

I had to start taking a water pills because of the water retention, my memory& cognitive thinking were really effected. On three separate occasions, I was sent home from work because I was so drowsy I kept falling asleep. I was staggering, slurring my speech. My supervisor thought I had been drinking. It was very embarassing. If I did not have all these side effects, I would've stayed on these meds but it was getting out of control-my weight has sky rocketed also. I'm weening off.Pain is back.",

I started of on 50 at night just to see how I would cope it chilled me out and when I woke I didn't feel heavy so that was good. Because when I take a pill on the night and next day get up heavy makes my anxiety mad. But started on 50. Now am on 100s 3 times a day. Can talk to people can go for hair cut can sit in the same room as people look at there face when talking to me. With out almost passing out. If I was to say if you wanted to get anxiety under control these are well worth ago. Plus I also recommend propranolol beta blockers 40mg 4 times a day They are great as well",

I did experience a huge emotional roller coaster at first and even had suicidal thoughts for the first time ever. I figured it was just the adjustment period and gave it more time. It has been about 2 months now and I just wish I could figure out if it is the Lyrica causing the fatigue. I ache too much without it to test the theory.",

My prescription medications are covered by Medicare & other insurance, but I do not believe in indiscriminately spending Medicare money. So, again, only because of the cost, I stopped. My feet went wild, burning pain, could not even have the bed covers on them at night. I got my Rx for Lyrica renewed and when it came I first took 2 caps in order to see if it would get started again. It did! I'm going to be doing a bit of research on the internet for a lower cost alternative. Gabapentin looks good at the moment, maybe on my next doc appt. I'll try it. I gave it only a 9 because of the cost, but for effectiveness I'd give it as high a number as allowed.",

After a year of being on the Lyrica it might have gone to a 7 or 8 but it caused me to put on about 40 lbs, my skin changed, and caused a lot of other side effects.

I started taking Lyrica when diagnosed, and within just a day or two I felt incredible! I didn't hurt when I woke up in the morning. I could move and do regular activities around the house without the horrible pain I had before. I did have some of the loopy/confusion/unable to focus for a short time, but that went away.

After fighting with my insurance company for two weeks I was approved. Within one week I have minimal pain! It is a miracle for me. I take 25mg three times a day. Love it! Thank you!",
                    "I was diagnosed with Degenerative disc disease in 1999, and then in 2009 I was diagnosed with Spinal Stenosis, Neuropathy & Sciatica. I was practically crippled and couldn't walk by 2011. My Doctor decided to try me on Lyrica and I can say with 100% truth and honesty that 4 days after I started it, on just 75mgs a day, I can walk again. I am still walking now in 2013 but just in short jaunts. I'm glad this pill exists.",
                    "I was on Lyrica for a total of four days. It got rid of my pain (almost completely!) but the side effects were terrible. I got anxious, depressed, confused, blurred vision, and a general \"high\" (not a good high) feeling. I felt very dumb and had a lot of trouble articulating my thoughts. Overall a terrible drug for me. The side effects out weighed the benefits of this medication. ",

Also driving the car my leg was in so much pain I had to lift it up with my hand to ease the pain. No medication I had taken stopped the pain which was unbearable and I couldn't sleep at night, My Doctor prescribed Lyrica and at first I did not like it because it made my feet puffy however I went back on it with the prescribed dose of 150mg twice a day. Now I have to try to recall the pain because I have no sciatic pain at all with this drug.  It also had the side effect of making me a bit \"dreamy\" which I rather like but I do forget names and things I am saying which I do not like. Can't have it all though!",

One day it would be in my legs, then my torso, then my arm, my throat, my ear and then shingles surfaced on my torso-right side. I took an antiviral for the shingles, and Neurontin for pain. The blisters were painful and they went away in a couple weeks but the pain remained and I took Neurontin in high doses, with Tylenol so I could sleep but my right leg hurt all the time. I couldn't walk up/down stairs on that leg, or sleep on either of side without pain and I am a side sleeper so I was miserable. A neurologist was skeptical that the cause was shingles but prescribed Lyrica and it was magic! 75 mg once a day and the pain is 95% gone, 6 months later still works.",

                    "50 mg twice a day was tolerable but didn't do much for central cord syndrome pain. 75 mg three times a day isn't helping with pain so far, makes me dizzy and puts me to sleep most of the day. I got leg spasms at night after not taking it. Walking around a little stopped the spasms. I'd like to give it a better try, but the side effects prevent me from functioning.",

Currently I'm feeling spaced all the time, gaining weight each day, and kind of depressed, but my psychiatrist said that could be anxiety coming through. I have been taking Xanax also for about 6 years, before that I was tried on Lexapro and went crazy on it. Also the Xanax was a disaster long term, as they become very addictive. Well the moral of the story is I'm praying for the Lyrica to work.",

I got a new Auto CPAP last week as well as started taking Lyrics 75mg twice a day and I already notice a difference. So far my appetite has decreased. The first 3 days I was only taking one a day and incredibly tired having to take naps on my lunch hour. The extra sleepiness has subsided substantially even while increasing the dose. It has not been a week yet but I can feel a difference. The numbness, tingling and muscle spasms that keep me awake or start by the time I get out of bed have decreased as well as the pain. I'm looking forward and hoping it works out.",

I now take Lyrica, 1 at 8 am, 1 at 3pm and 3 at bedtime. This dose was gradually increased over time. Although very fatigued I am 50% better and am able to function better. The initial drowsiness subsided after a couple of months. Do still have a bit of brain fog, not sure if it's the Lyrica or lack of sleep.",
                    "The side effects were too hard to tolerate, for me to continue to take it for more than a couple of months.

The surgeon removed the cyst, realigned my vertebrae and used instrumentation to hold the vertebrae in place. Unfortunately, after the surgery, the most painful part was the pain in my arms. I had taken Lyrica in the past for a very short time and it caused weight gain. I kept the medication on hand because it was expensive. After 2 trips back into the ER, the surgeon wanted me to take the Lyrica. His RN said that I will know if it will work in 1 1/2 - 2 days. She was right, thank God! The pain decreased dramatically. I'll deal with the weight gain later.",
                    "I have been on Lyrica for a little over a year now. My doctor started me on it as soon as it was approved. At first, with the smaller dosage it did nothing. Now I take 225mg in the morning and another 225mg at bedtime. It has helped me sleep at night a little better but other than that, I haven't had the relief as some have described here. It's frustrating to say the least. Considering the fact that I am also on Xanax, Clonazepam, Hydrocodone, Tramadol, Trazadone and Savella. Some I only take 1 x per day, others 3 x per day and a couple 2x per day. Lyrica was added after Tramadol. I had no side effects from it and it did not interfere with the other medicines that I am on. I was losing weight easily before, but now it is a bit harder. I'm staying on it.",

Since I have been on the higher dosages, it has definitely made a difference. I still have some really bad days of fibromyalgia pain, but those usually precede getting my period.",
                    "It took a couple of days but it did stop my restless legs.  The downside is that in the few weeks I was taking it, I put on about a stone in weight.  It's good for making you sleepy.  I now use tramadol and am trialling trazodone.",
                    "Lyrica is a great medicine. It is very expensive but highly effective for Anxiety and works totally differently to other medicines. Unlike SSRI's it gives me no sexual side effects and no feelings of apathy.  It's highly effective for anxiety. I take 300mg daily. At this dose I still have some anxiety but it is greatly reduced.  I have no serious side effects other than an increase in appetite which may lead to weight gain. Dizziness and feelings of being 'high' pass in a week. I highly recommend giving Lyrica a go. Having your life back is worth the cost.",
                    "I've suffered with widespread pain my whole life along with extreme difficulty sleeping. Took Lyrica (300mg/day) for 3 years & it worked initially to calm the aching but became less effective after a few months. It helped me get restful sleep & calmed my anxiety but I couldn't think, had very poor memory & felt very depressed (got worse overtime). When I stopped taking it I had the worst withdrawal symptoms imaginable (way worse than benzos). I literally felt worse than dying & all I could think of was when the hellish experience would stop . Took about a month to start feeling better & several months to really feel better. Doctors say that Lyrica doesn't have withdrawal (or it should be minor) but that's rubbish. Withdrawal eventually passes",

A week ago my dosage increased to 150mg twice a day and my back pain is good and sciatica is gone. Additionally my general anxiety is eased. There's no worsening of my depression symptoms (I manage depression/anxiety with efexor). Aside from mild sedation I've had a great result from lyrica so far. Hope it continues working this well! :)",
                    "Although for some reason Lyrica seemed to make my pain medications oxycontin last longer or work better, Lyrica made my legs swell up. The pain was unbearable from the swelling and in the end I had a lot of broken veins. If you're swelling up and your doctor says \"oh, you just ate too much salt this week\" get another opinion to get off Lyrica and see if the swelling doesn't stop. I wish I could take it, it really did help. Good luck to all with Fibromyalgia, it's an awful and painful disease.",

Prior to Lyrica I was taking 60mg/day of methadone with significant relief but with plenty of room for improvement. With the addition of Lyrica to my Methadone regimen, my relief now stands at approx. 80% analgesia which is a God send considering the severity of my pain. As a welcome side benefit, significant anxiety, hot flushes and insomnia were relieved as well. For me, Lyrica has been something of a miracle drug.",

Those medicines worked great, however, they do not hold up as they claim. My doctor put me on Lyrica at 300mg a day and what a difference it has made! My mobility is much better as well as my mental outlook on life. This medicine seems to do the job. I like it and recommend it.",

Doc finally had me gave me lyrica (after I had to try everything else first) ams at first, it worked. I did feel \"high\" but that slowly went away. After approx. 2 weeks of 75mg a day, I had horrible side effects..feeling depressed, like people were talking about me or didnt like me, had no memory or wasn't able to concentrate but what finally got me to stop was I had thoughts of driving my car off of a hill that i drive down daily. I may suffer from pain so intensely that I cry all the time, can't leave my home at times or feel blue because of it, but I had never thought of taking my own life. I stopped immediately despite my docs orders.",

The doctor had said that it was the worse shingles he had seen. After the scabs had gone I was Prescribed lyrica.  I take 300mg at night and 25mg in the morning. It has been 5 weeks since I developed shingles and my face and scalp are still numb. I have intermittent pain shocks. I believe the lyrica is effective as I can't imagine what it would be like if I didn't take it. I'm not sure how long I am suppose to take this but I imagine by other feedbacks that it could be months.",

My doctor originally prescribed Vicodin, then switched me to Lyrica in anticipation of my return to work. Lyrica was very effective at reducing the severity of the pain, but it caused me to be very drowsy. I slept for 14 hours a night, and had difficulty concentrating during the day. I would also have trouble remembering things I had done while taking Lyrica. I had to discontinue using it.",

I take 150mg twice a day and now the pain is so manageable that I get my life back. If you have really bad nerve pain that makes you feel depressed and debilitated give the medication a go! I have had a few side effects like memory fog but the pain relief is worth it!",

I have suffered on and off for years and a few months ago I was bed/couch ridden and found it impossible to even leave my house. My family has told me I am a completely different person since starting it. I feel alive again. I also used to take Xanax for years for social and general anxiety and I have found that it is helping with that also. Only side effect was feeling high the first two doses but now I just feel like a normal person, which is what I have always wished for. I hope it continues to work and gets better as I up my dose. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who suffers from fibromyalgia. Good luck to all.",

One day I pushed myself too hard at work, and I got to what I call \"final stage\". Half hour after getting a shot of Dilodid in the ER I was still crying and writhing. Doctor came in and sat down looking worried. \"There's probably nothing more you can do for me.\" I said \"No, there's not.\" She sent me home with maximum doses of every painkiller on the planet-nothing got rid of the deep burning aching pain. It hurt to stand, sit, walk, lie down. I laid in bed for days not knowing what to do. I tried Lyrica. That pain has been gone ever since. I got my life back.",

After years of being a long term sufferer I know there are triggers but I've never been able to control the symptoms that over took me even though I've tried to fight it and fight hard.

In the hospital they started giving me Lyrical 75mg 3 times per day that just took the edge off. Then I went to the pain Dr it was increased to 150mg 3 times a day and I had such relief to the point I could touch my skin, it has worked so great that when it is time for my next dose I begin to feel the pins and needles severe and the fire on my shoulders and hands.

I also notice that if I'm stressed the medication seems to not work as well so I don't know if I need the dosage increased, but there is a major difference in how much pain I feel. I do not like the side effects, but which would I rather have - sharp pains or side effects?

Now I'm back to work full time which i'd never thought i'd be able to do again. Doing more than simple tasks is a joy, and being able to play with my grand kids is more enjoyable than I can say. I do have to say I have to take pain medicines and muscle relaxers and had a pain pump placed inside my stomach, but with everything I'm almost back to normal.

I have however gained 30 pounds in 4 months. That is NOT normal. So it's come to the point that I'm gaining weight too rapidly to control and I must stop the meds.

I am very sensitive to medications and the side effects from anti-depressants cause more depression than relief. So, to try another drug was scary for me. I saw a Rheumatologist, and he dx my Arthritis called DISH in my spine. He recommended Lyrica. I finally saw my PCP MD and said let's try this drug.

After trying pregabalin over a two years, with limited success. 150mg once a day (which I was advised, but its not right dosage as it dissipates in 12 hours as I understand it). I then tried 150mg twice a day with limited success and then 300mg twice a day (this had no different). But then I hit on, the idea of taking it, three times, a day, exactly every eight hours (8am, 4pm, 12am) and this completely eliminated my GAD, making me functional, but I have to be very careful to stick to the correct times to take the dose, out by an hour and my GAD returns with vengeance.",

I was prescribed pregablin for Fibromyalgia pain and I can't say I've noticed a difference with pain but its done EVERYTHING for my anxiety! I am way less irritable and moody and feel like I can actually enjoy living a happy and complete life for once without worry, fear or nervousness. I went from being a procrastinating home body to a normal feeling, confident person! My side effects have been blurred vision, sometimes a little sleepy and dizziness. Its 100% worth trying!!",

Greatly reduced the pain, but I felt like I was constantly forgetful & would have brain fogs constantly. Have gained just a little weight, but can't do much with my hip anyway. The one thing that has made my Dr decrease the dose back to one a night very quickly, was I became depressive. Unfortunately, would prefer to deal with the pain & find something else, than feel that way. It is effective for pain relief (I found), but unfortunately I suffered some of the bad side effects.",

Doctor gave me some samples of Lyrica for Restless Leg Syndrome and I found that it made me quite sociable, talkative and able to let go some of my inhibitions, but without the sloppiness and horrible side effects as something like alcohol. I've tried Benzos and found they just made me feel dulled out and depressed. Lyrica, used periodically (a few times a month) never fails to brighten my mood and make me feel a bit closer to people.

                    "This used in conjunction with Cymbalta is about as good as it gets for nerve pain. In the past I was given Neurontin, Gabapentin, and many others but none were as effective. On the down side I found that the Lyrica in higher doses (150MG - 600MG) left me tired and unable to enjoy my days. I found that I received no greater pain relief taking the larger doses, just more / worse side effects. Even with Lyrica and the Cymbalta some people with extreme pain may still need to use some other type of pain relief in addition to this drug. I take 300MG of Lyrica spread over 4 doses per day and the Cymbalta, and 120MG of OxyContin and up to 40MG Oxycodone for breakthrough pain. In severe cases, a second anti-depressant may be needed in addition to The Cymbalta to help fight the depression that comes with chronic pain. The big down side to both of these name brand medicines is the cost. A months supply of Lyrica with no insurance is over $330 and the Cymbalta will set you back just over $300 each month. Even with insurance these both will end up on the top tier (My co-pay is $50.00 each) and neither of them has a generic equivalent.",

My MD switched me to Lyrica (75 mg), but when I got to 3 per day, I rapidly gained weight - 10 lbs. in 2 wks!  As a med student, I knew the two meds worked in a similar way and were metabolized similarly. I decreased the Lyrica to 1/ day, which stopped the weight gain, but didn't control the nerve pain, so I added back in one 300 mg. Neurontin per day (both at bedtime, to minimize drowsiness) - still not enough pain control. I added another Neurontin, and that was optimal for me. I take it all at bedtime.",

This may have been due to lack of movement and also the Christmas eating but I put on 3 kilos in two weeks which is a lot for me.

Focus here is to be less dependent on benzos which seem less defective.

Lastly, it does work well for depression and anxiety. The downside is that it will dull cognition greatly and can also greatly increase depression at certain doses. For me, the best dose for sleep isn't great for those reasons however lowering the dosage (after a break) has provided better results. Takes experimenting with dosages.",

                    "I have an entrapped nerve in my leg causing shooting nerve pain in my foot. Lyrica has really helped stop the pain. It was so bad I couldn't sleep at night. However, I am gaining weight and having some difficulty in concentrating.",
                    "I will start off by saying it did cause weight gain. My clothes fit the same but the number on the scale went up about 7-10 pounds depending on the day. I cannot say this is solely because the drug- I think I can safely say that this is because my pain has improved so drastically that I have appetite again. I can keep the weight off if I really want to, but I am not overweight and I am content with my appetite finally being back after years of struggles that I don't think it's a problem. Regardless, I have been on lyrica for almost a year now. It has drastically improved my nerve pain, joint stiffness and swelling (along with a gallon of water a day), appetite, energy, and sleep. I am not pain free but no fibromyalgia patient truly ever is pain free but my pain has gone from an average of 8-9 down to a 4-5 on my good days. My flare ups are far less frequent and I only experience them once every two or so months which is a huge improvement over every other week. The length of the flare ups is also shortened from 3-5 days down to 2 days maximum. At the beginning of taking the medicine I was slightly drowsy but nothing dangerous. I only take it once a day and I am trying to keep it that way to avoid moving up to 2 doses a day. Lyrica is my miracle drug and has definitely given me my life back. My biggest complaint is the cost and insurance but it could be worse. It costs me $2 a day to feel normal again.",
                    "I have not experienced any decrease in pain and I have had trouble sleeping, feeling constantly drowsy and find it difficult to concentrate at work. Have had some instances of irritability.",
                    "I have spinal stenosis, my spine is cracked on both sides of my spine as well as a bulging disc pushing on the cracks, Fibromyalgia and some form of arthritis. Lyrica packed on the pounds, blurred vision, constantly tired , my body aches more when I take lyrica. I use cannibis oil CBD form it helps with inflammation , it sure helps considerably better with no side effects! The cbd form does NOT get you 'stoned, high, or buzzed' it removes the pain. I am extremely grateful for my Cannibis oil, the effects last longer then lyrica tooo! I can enjoy my grandkids again!",
                    "Treatment for frostbite - A little bit expensive, but it beats getting my toes cut off and learning how to walk again. It works better than narcotic pain medicines without all the bad side effects too.",
                    "So far Lyrica is the only medication that relieves my neuropathic and fibromyalgia pain. I have to take large dosage to be effective but it is well worth it for me. I can only take it at night because it makes me dizzy and sleepy sometimes.",
                    "I suffer from trigeminal neuralgia. This is the first medicine that has ever worked. So far, I have no pain.",
                    "For me all the side effects were extreme. Too extreme to continue taking the medicine for more than a week.",
                    "Helps me fall asleep, but doesn't control my pain as much as I would like.",
                    "I have had severe pain to the point I have lost my ability to walk and need to use a wheel chair for the past seven years. My DR. (last year) put me on Lyrica and it saved my life! I had been put on every type of pain killer and I needed a lot of them. Now I have lower doses of my pain medicines and I feel tons better! Anyone who is looking into this medication PLEASE at least try it, take it as you told to by your DR. and give it four weeks to fully work it's magic, I almost asked my DR. to take me off it, three weeks into taking it, but my wife told me to give it one more week and BOOM! she was right. It's not like anything you have ever tried! My only problem with it is it needs time to work. It's worth the wait!",
                    "I injured my back in 1991 which lead to 2 major spinal fusions . After the fusions i became depressed. Subsequently , I was put on Cymbalta 60 mg and a various array of pain medication . One year later , I was diagnosed with bowel cancer at 40 and a year after that , prostate cancer . After 11 operations I was depressed and very very sore. both in the abdomen and of course the spine . I drank and drank . It seemed like the only thing that would ameliorate the pain. Three months ago my GP started me on Lyrica . After 3 days , pain was gone, also my anxiety seemed to just hop up and walk away . Im only drinking a few beers on a saturday now. Lyrica saved my life . I dont say that flippantly .",
                    "Started on 75mg twice daily, noticed some effect, just a tease or a promise. Upped it to 150mg twice daily and yes, it definitely works to eliminate \"one level of pain\", while leaving some \"levels of pain\" still there. I do feel side effects of feeling calm while having more motivation for projects, some slight feeling of alcohol-like impairment (not so much after less than a week of 300mg/day). I also occasionally use oral cannabis and the Lyrica potentiates it quite a bit. I'm feeling very positive about this medicine, even though it doesn't get at all levels of my pain, I like what it does do for me.",
                    "I have been taking Lyrica for the last three years and I don't know how I would live without it. In 2012, I was involved in a serious accident, sustaining an incomplete spinal cord injury, as well as severe injuries to my lower limbs. The pain is not as bad as it was in the beginning, but I am in constant pain and, according to my pain management and spinal and lower limb reconstruction consultants, this will probably always be the case. Initially I thought if I found the right combination of medications I could stop it and so I tried all of the other drugs prescribed for neuropathy, as well as some more experimental ones. Without Lyric I spent a lot of time crying and ended up in hospital a few times because the pain was so bad.",
                    "Side effects were debilitating, headaches, nausea. Did not experience much in the way of pain relief.",
                    "I am taking 50mg but it only worked for 2 days. Pain is back and so is the numbness. I think I need a higher dosage. Side effects are headache and it triggers my migraine.",
                    "I was working at a plant nursery and watered the plants everyday. I stood in water with converse all stars on for about 3 hours. My feet went numb, which was normal for me. When I got in the shower that night to thaw my feet out they started hurting and black blisters developed. Neurontin did not help much, but the Lyrica took all pain out with no side effects other than feeling a little tired. It saved me from total misery. It is the best medicine I have ever taken.",
                    "I'm 63 and have struggled with depression and anxiety, starting at age 30. In late March 2015 a significant life event occurred that sent me spiraling downhill. Extreme anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts. The worst episode ever. Dr. prescribed 150mg Lyrica. I began taking it on June 11. By noon on June 13 I felt incredibly good, invincible ,euphoric. Weird in that I just felt SO GOOD, almost too good, Then side effects hit. Bad dizziness, but still felt good mentally. Cut the dose to 100mg. Over the next 2 weeks side effects resolved themselves. No weight gain. The artificial high dissipated. What I'm left with is this...NORMAL LIFE. Lyrica gave me my life back. Pray it works for others as well as it's worked for me.",
                    "Hello all A short story,I had chemical poisoning while working 25 years ago, which caused multiple health conditions causing Brian Damage and Central and Peripheral nervous system disorders, The main Problem is debilitating anxiety not caused by the thought process but by Physical damage as the above. Ultimately after being on most horrific psychotic drugs i found Valium and mirtazapine ( currently on Valium 35mg and mirtazipine 45mg) which calm me down. Anyway i was recently prescribed Pregabalin at 150mg per day running along with the above drugs, I cannot stress how much this has changed my life for the better although still in the early days for the first time in 25 years I am a different person,calmer kinder and finally in control.",
                    "I'm on Pregabalin 300mg, olanzapine 10mg, duloxetine 60mg and lamotragine 400mg. Pregabalin has worked well for me the last two years in conjunction with the other meds. It is the most recent medication added to the mix. I am bipolar 1 with significant clinical depression and agitated depression when hyper. My collection of meds works well with Pregabalin an important element.",

So....asked doc for Lyrica, in high hopes of relief bit it isn't touching it. Fully believe I have damaged nerves/FM from long term opioid intake.....but this drug is not helping at all Can't bear the thought of needing to stay on Tramadol. 60 yrs old now, it's not on.. Don't know which way to turn now",

                    "I've had huge troubles with anxiety and couldn't find an antidepressant that worked, so I got prescribed this. I started off with 75mg in the morning and before bedtime. It worked wonders and first few weeks I felt great - for the first time I could speak in front of a group, I had strength to do daily chores and my anxiety pains disappeared. However, after some time I grew tolerant to it and my pains and anxiety started coming back slowly, so my dose got upped to 150mg twice a day. It works for my anxiety and pains but it makes me really sleepy now. Side effects were only at first weeks, some stomach troubles which disappeared. PS! This is a temporary solution, since you get tolerant to it. Antidepressant is still needed for anxiety.",
                    "After suffering from painful burning feet for ten years ,and due to the pain getting only a few hours sleep per night (if lucky) I started taking Lyrica 75mg twice per day . The very first day my feet started to feel better, but I thought it might be wishful thinking however after taking the second capsule before bed I slept for nine hours straight and woke up to manageable foot pain. My life is back to normal",
                    "I am taking 2 x 300mg per day (plus 20 mg Lexapro, plus 30 mg Mirap). Anxiety is decreased, confidence is increased. I have dizziness, but I am able to drive ok. I have tremors and heart racing. No weight gain or other side effects yet. I feel the medicien helps my brain to be more constructive and ordered. I stopped taking the Lexapro a year ago, but my doctor doesn't know. Tried missing the Lyrica for two days and felt very low, not easy to get off this.",

I served 8 years in the united states military 4 overseas and 4 in the U.S. I left the military 100% disabled diagnosed with Panic disorder with agoraphobia, GAD, Major Depression and of course some PTSD. I have tried everything. I was put on lyrica for nerve damage originally but found it soooo helpful for crippling anxiety. But this does not last long tolerance builds so fast its unreal and it almost feels as if the anxiety gets worst over time. I have tried to stop this cold turkey but found my self in a state of BENZO and OPIATE withdrawal feeling and it was a nightmare. Now I'm weaning! Bye lyrica..OH ya klonopin works wonders ;).",

                    "I have been in pain for years, since my second son was born. After my daughter, I lived with it for 5 years, thinking it was carpal tunnel. Finally the doctor sent me to a specialist after wearing braces from 1 1/2 years. Fibromyalgia is what the diagnosis was, I was not shocked, until she said NO CARPAL TUNNEL AT ALL. She gave me some 50 mg, Lyrica, worked wonderfully. I did not have to lay in bed for an hour or more before getting the children up for school. I got right out of bed and felt pretty good all day. It did make me a bit tired, but the doctor said you have to build your way up on it, but now, the insurance does not pay for it.",

I am still tired but that will come with conditioning my body again. I have intensive physio therapy twice a year and have founf improvements after each session. I have gained about 30lbs but part of that is due to inactivity. Only downside is that if I miss a dose I feel dreadful.",
                    "I was taking 450mg of Lyrica a day and it was a great medicine to help with my fibromyalgia. I took it along with Tramadol. After a few months of taking it I would wake up in the morning feeling as if a train had hit me. I also gained 40lbs on Lyrica. I recently switched to Neurontin and it works great. Also, coming off Lyrica gave me horrible withdrawals for almost 2 weeks. I have been off of it for about 17 days and have lost 8lbs. Lyrica is a great medicine if you don't mind gaining weight.",
                    "I was prescribed Lyrica for nerve pain in my leg and foot and found the \"side effect\" to be a lightening of my depression without the fogginess of other, more conventional medications prescribed for depression. I'm glad to see that it can be used for anxiety. It certainly makes a positive impact on my mood.",

I took the capsules 1 day (2days ago) and after I woke up the next morning, I was completely disorientated, neuasious and vomiting, sleepy, drowsy, forgetful, having uncontrallable shakes in hands and fingers. I thought it will get better soon if I do not take it again. My husband took me to work where I slept the whole time. I had dry nose and mouth, couldnt eat or drink, muscle stiffness drunk feeling, and walking abnormal. I stopped taking it and feeling today better. Could have a shake for breakfast.",
                    "for the last 22 years I have been suffering from severe form of Trigeminal Neuralgia had the Alcohol Block as well as the Gamma Knife procedures but to no avail. Help came when I was given high dosage of Lyrica in combination with Carbatrol. With time I was able to reduce it to half of the quantity of both medications. For the last 8-9 years I have been taking 900 mg of Lyrica and 600 mg of Tegretol. Before the Lyrica I was disabled, I couldn't talk, eat. open and close my eyes, touch my face, shave, have a haircut, or have my teeth cleaned, the list is too long. Basically noting could touch or move on the right side of my face. When I tried to eat, tears will stream down my face. I am taking Lyrica since February 2002, it saved my life.",
                    "It is difficult to rate this medication. I have all forms of Neuropathy, very painful and Lyrica has been the best so far at eliminating pain, allowing me to overcome the insomnia from the Neuropathy and opiate medication. Even at very small doses. I take 50mg once daily before bed and it works. The problem is the side effects, the worst being that after three days my eyesight is so degraded that I can not drive, I cannot read anything on the television 6 feet away, there is some eye pain and my eyes seem dry and burning. Eye problems can be serious. Wandering eye, crossed eyes and most commonly blurred vision. It also causes peripheral edema in my legs and feet.",

This drug is not side-effect free - but compared to the others out there (Including anti-depressants) it's Definitely the best option. After the initial euphoria wains it stabilizes however, so don't give up after the first effects go.",
                    "I have found Lyrica very helpful. I have fibromyalgia and I also suffer from depression. (I am also a diabetic). I used Lyrica with no expectations of any kind. I was so surprised when for the first time in I don't know how long I could move my head easily and what a reduction in pain. I am so happy I was not afraid to try it.",
                    "I was just diagnosed with fibromyalgia. After taking the first dose my hands and feet swelled up and I couldn't bend my figures. If I tried the pain was intense. Then I stated to stagger. I wobbled when I tried to stand still. My mind fogged up. I felt drunk and hungry. I got a sandwich and it slipped off of my plate to the floor and I picked up and continued to eat, at least a couple of times. Every thing I ate that night tasted so good. I was so sleepy. When I got up in the morning there were things in places that should never of been. (ie: TV remote in the bathroom, food on the floor near my bed and other things misplaced. I felt like I had a hangover. NEVER AGAIN. I had the same experience with Gabapentin. Just say no!",
                    "I take Lyrica primarily for non-diabetic polyneuropathy. The bottoms of my feet felt like they were on fire before. I could not walk. Now, though painful, I take long daily walks. I can only tolerate the lowest dose three times daily, maybe four times if the doctor allowed it. An increased dose made me too drowsy. I find it helpful for fibromyalgia too, but I could only choose one category. I still have too much pain.",
                    "I agree with almost everyone here. I have been on all the narcotics for pain, for arthritis, since 2001. Finally, a wonderful doctor recognised the fibromyalgia aspect of my pain and prescribed Lyrica. What a difference! I sleep all night and can move in the morning. My narcotic usage is lowered along with lower muscle relaxants. At this point, I wouldn't do without my Lyrica.",
                    "I love this medication. I feel calm and rid of anxiety, I currently take 600mg daily and it lasts throughout the day. I would highly recommend this medication, its both calming and stimulating. I have the confidence to go out and hang out with people, I finally feel like I can socialize and relax like a 'normal' person. It's approved for generalized anxiety disorder in Europe. ",

Your body feels active and you can't relax, I find my teeth are clenched or my hand, or my foot. So had enough three weeks ago took to my bed for three days crying, depressed, I take tramadol everyday, venlafaxine for anxiety, none of which take it away. So went to doctors she said give this ...all I can say is at present I have been on it for three weeks I now remember what a good nights sleep is , I can switch the engine off and actually properly relax its wonderful.",

Doc then changed prescription to 50mg twice daily. As a painkiller it is fantastic. I've never known a painkiller like it, however one bad side effect is my swollen feet. I fear that I will have to change to something else if it continues to make my feet swell, because it is extremely uncomfortable. Another side effect is the feeling of being drunk. It does however help me to sleep. I haven't slept this well in years, though I wake up feeling groggy. I could live with all these side effects, if I could overcome the swollen feet.",

If you suffered my pain you wouldn't either. I've never felt high and taken it for 5 yrs. 75mg x 3 daily. I'm grateful for it. I would suffer so bad w/o it.",

Could not stand the pain in my feet, outer thighs and now along my belt line. I noticed that the weight gain seemed to be from an increased appetite. I have been able to keep the weight off by being very mindful of my hunger, or mindless eating. I am 5'10\" 185lbs. Without Lyrica I don't really get hungry. Mind is bigger than the belly when I order food. With Lyrica I find I could eat a horse, and a cow and maybe a squirl as an after dinner snack ..LOL. It makes me lose what ever normal appetite suppresent that I may have. It does wonders for my nerve pain that started 6 months ago and seems to get worse without Lyrica.",

My fibromyalgia got so bad at the end of the year, that I decided to try it again.  I take low doses, 25 mg 2x a day, sometimes a 50 mg. The effect sets in within hours. My fibromyalgia pain is almost completely gone. A late evening dose allows me to sleep longer. I do feel strange when I take it and my intellectual capacity is quite affected, but the lack of distraction by the pain and a better social interaction with increased confidence levels makes up for that. I have to make sure that authorities and decision-making bodies are aware of my reduced competence.",

Needless to say, I discontinued it, and was given Lyrica....but that made me nervous as well. With my pain over a 10, and the inability to sleep, I decided to try it. I slept well, my pain is decreased some, but isn't gone. I'm only at day 3, and I'm pretty dizzy, sick to my stomach, and sleepy, but that's all so far. I do hope it helps my pain a little more, it's about an 8 now, so we shall see! I'm glad to hear some good stories.",

In fact, she hardly recognized that shingles pain was significant. My PHN kicked in when the rash disappeared. I've still got it. I monitored the internet for PHN meds and when Lyrica came out I notified my new doc immediately. He started me out at 100 mg three times a day and when that was only modestly effective he kicked it up to 150 mg X 3. It works very nicely. However there are side effects. My weight gain has been significant. Brain fog happens. I get double vision on an irregular basis. I feel tired. Now my liver values are increasing.",

                    "My doctor prescribed Lyrica for fibromyalgia. As I am very sensitive to medication, I was prescribed 75 mg at bedtime each night.  The first month, I did feel better taking Lyrica. However, after about 4 months I began experiencing strange symptoms.  I could not remember things. My brain was foggy. I wasn't myself and my pain returned. It was a no brainer, so I informed my doctor that I wanted off of this medication.  I've been off Lyrica now for two months and my brain is back to normal. It was very scary to even think how little I was taking and what an impact it made on me.   I am taking apple cider vinegar with honey every morning, exercising a little day, even if I don't want to, and resting when my body needs it.",
                    "Lyrica was the first medication that helped with the nerve pains. It calmed down some of the burning in my toes, especially. It also gave me some hope in addition to pain relief.",
                    "I was prescribed Lyrica nine months ago and ever since I've been on this drug my quality of life has greatly increased because not only does it greatly relieve me of muscle tension and pain it greatly improves my mood and makes me feel like doing things that I normally wouldn't have the energy for.",
                    "My husband was perscribed Lyrica for neuropathic pain. He has been in pain with low back issues since 2005. He has had shots, surgeries, a stim unit inplant. The pain continues to get increase. The lyrica within three days made him completely crazy. Couldn't sleep, very emotional. Started weaning right away. He had side effects all the way to cold and flu like symtoms. This Lyica is horrible, worst medicine he has ever taken and now we're stuck for $100.00",
                    "Made my feet swell",
                    "I have been dealing with Fibromyalgia for many years and my doctor was so excited when Lyrica came out, like it was going to be the cure or something; but it did not help my FMS at all. Not to mention, I had horrific fluid retention! I couldn't wear normal shoes, my hands so swollen I couldn't get my wedding ring on. The swelling lasted for a while even after I discontinued the medication.",
                    "I've tried sertraline, amitriptyline and trazodone for depression and anxiety in the past, but none helped my anxiety as much as this. I was told I couldn't use other anxiety meds because I have low blood pressure, but I can use pregablin. It has helped tremendously. I still have panic attacks but instead of many times daily, it's the odd one here and there when something has particularly stressed me out. It doesn't take away the anxiety completely, it's still there and I have really bad days still and it doesn't help depression, but it's much more manageable than before, likewise my OCD isn't as bad either. The only side effect I experience is weird dreams, insomnia and poor memory/memory loss. I recommend!!!",
                    "Works pretty well for nerve pain and numbness. I have degenerative disc disease along with several other cervical and spinal issues. I started at higher dose that had too many side effects but when my dosage was lowered I had a lot of relief.",
                    "I had been quite a bit of pain for a little over four months. We couldn't figure out what was causing the pain in my face. My doctor figured out that I had Trigeminal Euralgea Facial Nerve Pain. So he started my on Lyrica. We started at 75mg x 2 times a day, and then had to move up to 150mg x 2 times a day. Lyrica really helps to keep the pain away. My chiropractor has said that since taking Lyrica that my back and neck can be manipulated easier than before. I love being able to feel better!",
                    "Helped TREMENDOUSLY with my pain, which is not cured of course, but at LEAST cut my daily pain in half. My old boyfriend is also on this and feels the same way as I do.",
                    "I started taking pregabalin yesterday - start at a low dose 75mg in morning, then 75mg in the evening. The effect was pretty much instant I swear.  I went from being hypersensitive, worrying, stressing and having all these horrible physical symptoms ( from the anxiety disorder I have been diagnosed with ) to being calm, having a subtle feeling of well being... my acid reflux stopped, my muscles have started to lose their tension, the tension headaches are lifting too. Side effects ? a little sleepy, but nothing too severe. I haven't listened to music for months and been able to enjoy it, but today I AM ! ... amazing ! I feel like a normal person, its like the volume has been turned down on life to a level I can manage :)",
                    "I recently stopped taking lyrica after 6 months. I was taking lyrica for nerve pain following a terrible car accident. I wish I had never started taking lyrica. It not only did not help with the pain but only made my condition worse, not to mention the 30 pounds of weight I put on. Also the horrible withdrawal's was worse than I ever could of imagined. I absolutely do not recommend ever starting lyrica",
                    "It didn't work.",
                    "I was on this drug for many years and while in the beginning I felt it helped with both the frequency of headaches and fibromyalgia associated with ME, over time it stopped working. On the flip side, it definitely had a negative effect on my memory. I VERY slowly weaned myself off of it and most of my memory has returned. My insurance only paid a small part of the cost and it is very expensive. I would not use it again. No upside and plenty of downside.",
                    "This drug changed my life with unexpected benefits. I started taking for herniated disc and a lot of nerve damage. I started feeling pain relief immediately. It made me feel very high the first week and I had to be careful how and when I would take it / 150MGs 3xs a day. The high feeling eventually, gradually dissipated  After a week, I noticed my wife smiling a lot with great caution I asked her why and she said she likes how calm and relaxed I am. I'm naturally a very high strung, intense person. I thought about what she said and noticed I actually was very relaxed and things that typically set me off they just didn't anymore. I then read about how the drug helps with anxiety. My insurance doesn't really cover it...I pay 50 for a months",
                    "For 18 months have had severe lumbar, butt and leg pain. Got spinal injections that helped some, but leg pain still was especially bad. Finally had back surgery, which helped the lower back, but not the pain in my hips and legs, which was intense. As usual, had physical therapy, massage, and finally acupuncture. Nothing worked. My doctor finally started me on Lyrica at 50 mg before bed, then 100, and finally at 200 mg before bedtime. It has reduced the pain about 70 percent. It also helps me sleep like a log, and the only side effects are some dizziness in the morning, but by around 10 AM that goes away. Great stuff!",
                    "I too progressed from Gabapentin to Lyrica, 100mg 3x a day. I have chemically-induced neuropathy from 6 months of chemo. My hands and feet are numb, tingling, like they are asleep. Lyrica is supposed to be an advanced form of the Gabapentin, though I have seen little difference. I have increased appetite and some swelling in my hands and ankles. I continue using Lyrica because I need something for the hot shooting pain. This was the last med prescribed for my neuropathy.",
                    "This is poison, destroyed my life, horrible side effects and made my pain so much worse. Detoxing is a living hell and makes coming off narcotics a walk in the park. It's horrible and should be taken off the market.",
                    "On narcotics, muscle relaxers for neuropathic pain from inoperable herniated discs, arthritis in back. Narcotics cut in half by doctor and prescribed Lyrica, 75mg once at night, then 75mg am and pm and on til taking 150mg am, pm. Nothing. Today an additional 75 mg to be added midday.  Decided to check here before taking more. Wow. I have had left hand/arm jerks where my arm just flies up, once throwing iPad mini across the room, another time scatting nuts everywhere while chopping them. I now realize this condition started with Lyric and gets worse with increased dosage. I am going to slowly stop this drug because a) it does nothing for pain, and b) what has it done to my brain?",
                    "It helps with my seizures as well as my fibromyalgia so I've always been really happy with my Lyrica. I've been on it for years now.",
                    "Had a slipped disc with sciatic pain diagnosed before new year.  Had been having heart palpitations, anxiousness, blurry vision and having suicidal thoughts. Felt could be due to the drugs I'm taking and turns out... it's all from lyrica. ",
                    "I've used Lyrica for a while now and it seems that my body is getting so used to the drug that it's not working like it first did. I take 75mg in the morning and 75mg at bedtime. I either need to increase my dose or find something else that will work. It's hard to function during my days because of the pain.",
                    "I suffer from severe peripheral neuropathy. It is unusual in the sense that it is not diabetes caused, but is apparently idiopathic and hereditary. I have excellent relief from Lyrica with few side effects. I find myself nodding out occasionally at my computer or watching TV. I exercise more, drink more coffee, and allow more time for sleep. The more I take, the greater the relief. I take 400mg per day. ",
                    "Instant joint pain gone....anxiety gone....only been 1 week...hopeful it lasts...so far it's a miracle for me..I'm also on cymbalta and klonipin",
                    "I was given this medicine from my Dr. I told her I would research it but I paid $25 and picked it up. What a waste of money, I should've researched first. After reading this I'm deathly afraid to take this drug so I won't be. Thank you for all the reviews.",
                    "I have only been diagnosed for about a year now. I have completely lost my life due to fibromyalgia pain. My doctor started me on Cymbalta, which worked for awhile but then stopped, then put me on Lyrica without weaning me off Cymbalta....WITHDRAWALS hello. Had to start again and wean off while also taking Lyrica. The Lyrica seemed to help at first too, then wham just like everything else, stopped working....EXCEPT on weight gain and brain fog. I was a zombie. So now I'm worsening day by day even though I try to stay active have cut all caffeine, etc. because my doctors just don't believe pain medicines help and say there isn't much else they can do for me. Glad for the people it has helped.",
                    "I have Fibromyalgia and developed horrific back/sciatic pain last year. I started taking lyrica about 3 months ago and within a week,I could walk properly. I could sleep, I could exercise and I thought it had fixed everything.  Then my elbow started hurting. I just thought I'd strained it at the gym. The pain became excruciating. Then it hit the other arm until 3 days ago when it got so bad, I couldn't move my arms properly. It felt like my arms were inflamed from my shoulders to my finger tips. I stopped taking it 2 days ago and the arm pain is starting to go. But the back pain is starting to come back. I also have had no idea what day it is for the last 3 weeks which I thought was stress but suspect is the lyrica.",
                    "When I first started Lyrica, my pain almost totally disappeared. After about 3 weeks, my pain started returning. My tongue started to tingle and was sore.",
                    "I was prescribed Pregabalin by my GP for anxiety disorder. I am 27 and have had anxiety since a teenager. I have never tried meds before. I have just gone up to 600mg. I have definitely experienced side effects (blurred vision/dizziness/drowsiness). The side effects do wear off but it does take some perseverance in the beginning to get to grips with it. I felt 'out of it' for a few days. I definitely feel less anxious. It's hard to tell how well it is working but I definitely have the ability to look at 'stressful' and 'anxious' situations with far more clarity. I am a designer and I always worried if taking meds would suppress my creativity but in fact - I think it helps me to have more confidence in my ideas.",
                    "I was diagnosed with adult onset Diabetes last Dec. I started on Metformin 750 and almost immediately my fasting glucose dropped to 94. That is what it has been since but I have been bothered with neuropathy for months. I tried Lyrica for 3 months and it did absolutely nothing for the pain. I am presently taking gabapentin 300 mg at bedtime and it helps slightly. The cost for the Lyrica was money out the window.",
                    "I am glad that Lyrica has helped many, just did nothing for my nerve pain and tons of side effects.",
                    "Just started Lyrica 75mg twice a day yesterday. My first dose, I felt extremely drunk, and could not function. I took my second dose at bedtime, and slept through the night, and woke up refreshed! I had no aches or pain. My 3rd dose, this morning, again feeling a little drunk, and off balance... but again, I feel good. I can actually sit still at work, without having to move around and try to be comfortable. I am going to stick with this medication, and hope that the side effects go away in a couple of days.",
                    "I had been experiencing major depressive disorder and I have an anxiety disorder. I have tried every antidepressant on earth and had suicidal ideation with each one, even after one pill! I have some nerve pain so I tried gabapentin but didn't really get any relief from it so I asked my doctor for some lyrica. The NEXT DAY I felt the depression lift and the anxiety came to a manageable level where I felt I could function well and go out in public. I recently started vaping nicotine and the anxiety is back. I am going to quit and continue to take the lyrica. When I feel really anxious I take 10 mg of valium with it and I am in heavenly bliss. No pain, no worries, just normal albeit a bit sedated but still very functional.",
                    "I had an accident in April 2016. Riding lawnmower fell on top of me in a deep ditch. It knocked me out and caused severe lumbar spinal stenosis , pinched nerves . Up until this year I was in a lot of pain due to the nerves being pinched by my spine. All this time I have seen 3 doctors, really 4, one neurologist, 2 neurosurgeons, internist. No one even suggested Lyrica for my pain...except the neurologist who did the nerve conduction study. He said it worked for restless leg syndrome which I also have. I go some Lyrica and tried it. It has brought me from 10 pain level to a 2 or 3. I get up early now like I used to, I have the will to do things on my property etc. I had lost the desire to even get out of bed, I wish I had tried Lyrica a lot sooner, it gave me my life back.",
                    "I have had FM for about 10 years. For the past 2 years I have been on Duragesic patch for pain. It intensified the fatigue. I started on Lyrica a couple of months ago and am now off of the Duragesic patch. I am getting as good or better pain control with the Lyrica alone as I was with the Duragesic patch and without the added fatigue.",
                    "I couldn't make it without my Lyrica! This medicine has absolutely changed my life. I was hurting all the time and used all my energy just to work. There was no joy in my life until I was prescribed this medicine. Now I work and feel like doing the things I enjoy, like working in my flower garden. I thank God everyday for this medication!",

After many years of being tried on just about every drug out there FINALLY a drug that actually helped me!..I now drive again and sometimes leave the house alone and even on occasion brave the supermarket ALONE..After 3 years on the same dose and with its effect starting to wane I am now on 150mg twice a day..And yes I am very tired, vague and spaced out, but this will wear of with time as my body adjusts..And regarding the weight gain, I have lost 5 stone, and have regained some control.",
                    "I was prescribe Lyrica for a pinched nerve in my elbow after a dislocation. The pain made physical therapy intolerable. With just one dose of 75mg of Lyrica, I could bend my elbow without wincing. Absolutely marvelous. Unfortunately there were 2 side effects that make me stop taking it. First one was that I fell asleep almost immediately after taking it for about 2 hours and my brain felt very foggy after I woke up. Second issue was a slight tightness in the chest and feeling a little out of breath. Not severe, but enough to let me know that I couldn't take it again. Made me sad because it really worked.",

Once could top out any IQ tests but my husband says I can't even find my \"behind\" anymore. Taking it for neuropathy & came home from complete knee surgery with foot drop in leg operated on. Now the other foot has dropped half way so I am all but an invalid. No more going outside for me to enjoy our horses on our farm. The dry mouth I got with Lyrica also frightens me as afraid I will lose my teeth as others have. Lyrica also causes severe sleepiness. I guess it MIGHT have stopped the shooting pains in my feet at night?",

                    "My doctor prescribed it for me and gave me samples. I have been taking the samples while fighting with the insurance company because they want me to try Neurontin first. I think the Lyrica is really working. I am still tired, but I feel it is a normal tired from having two kids and running around with them. The way I felt before, I couldn't move. I really don't want to use the Neurontin, I don't want to lose the benefits that I have gained.",
                    "Lyrica works well on my chronic neck pain which I have had for 4 years. But I have gained about 30 pounds so am considering trying Neurontin to see if effects are the same but without the weight gain!",
                    "Lyrica the wonder medicine. After having a nerve crushed in Afghanistan, I had RSD/CRPS in my left leg. Doctors put me on Neurontin which just made me neurotic...and did not help the pain. A month after switching to Lyrica, I was able to lose the crutches, and a few weeks later the prosthetic supporting my leg. After four months, yes I still have a crushed nerve, but pain and hypersensitivity dropped to bearable levels and after six months off all medication but Motrin. Four years later... I have a resurgence of RSD due to a back injury. Lyrica had me back walking in two weeks and has continued to reduce the pain levels.",
                    "I take Lyrica for seizures and Fibromyalgia. The side effects are tremendous and I have had a hard time adjusting. True enough I have had no more seizures however, frequently, I am unable to consentrate or think with any lever of clarity.",
                    "I was on Lyrica for 2 years. At first it was fabulous! But over time I needed to keep increasing the dosage to get the same result. The side effects were bad for me. In the two years I was on it I gained 60 lbs and my hair started falling out. I have since switched to Neurontin with no side effects and my hair is slowly coming back. Lyrica was a miracle for me for about 18 months but as they say all good things must come to an end.",
                    "I would give it a 10, then a 1. At first the medicine worked GREAT but then 30 days later it just quit. After a few months I gave up on it, I occasionally retry the medicine but no luck.",
                    "Taking Lyrica hasn't helped my Fibrmyalgia symptoms at all, and even though I'm on a starter dose of 75 mg once per day the side effects are terrible! I tremble so badly it appears as if I have Parkinson's disease. I can't hand write at all and let alone many other daily functions. It has affected my thinking terribly and makes my mind race and my thoughts are very jumbled which makes me feel extremely anxious, plus when talking my speech is very shaky sounding and very fast and slurry. I also have a lot of trouble urinating. I find it extremely difficult to empty my bladder and at times very painful. I was already taking sleeping tablets ( Temazipan), but Lyrica has made getting to sleep even worse. My chest and nose both feel congested.",

I suffer from back, buttock, leg & feet pain from a 360 degree double spinal fusion of L4-L5 & L5 & S1 done 20 years ago. Nerve pain is now ruining my life. However since being on this medicine my pain is now around a 2-3 out of 10 from being anywhere between 5-9. The only real side effect I am having is feeling \"High\" 24 hrs a day. Supposedly this will go away in time. I also feel uplifted and it has helped with my depression. I do feel a bit aggressive at times too. I have been keeping a close check on my weight too but nothing has changed. My normal weight is 75 kgs and I'm fit & strong as I workout in the gym regularly which helps control back pain.",

I had previously taken Cymbalta 60mg for 7/8 years and was feeling that it was no longer as effective so my doctor prescribed Lyrica. I noticed a large amount of weight gain (which I would not have minded if helped the pain!) about 50 pounds over 6 months before it stabilized. After some time of taking the medication (9 months or a year I forget) I was always complaining to my doctor about pain and fatigue being bad so he switched me to Savella. I noticed a huge difference and I lost the weight!",
                    "Lyrica was great as a pain reliever. It is not a pain killer. The side effects were brutal - weight gain, swelling, water retention yikes. I only stayed on Lyrica a few months. I am now trying Robaxasil.",

I've been on lorazepam, alprazolam, and clonazepam and all 3 became ineffective after 6 months to 1 year and were extremely difficult to get off of. I don't notice any tolerance issues with pregabalin either. I've been on the same dose for about 2 years. Better than any of the benzodiazepines and other medications I've tried for anxiety. Only side effects I've noticed are calmness, sedation, and increased appetite but exercise and healthy eating take care of any weight gain.",

I have to do every thing from chores to running errands before I take it. Once I take I become unbalanced, forget words and become extremely tired. I sleep a lot and very heavy and usually can't remember the previous day. I definitely cannot function after I take it. I don't care for the side effects but so far has been the only thing that has worked for me. I tried cymbalta, neurton, zanaflex, flexeral lots of things. To me its worth taking the lryica as those terrible rib and back spasms keep at bay..and after two years of dealing with those I don't ever want to again. btw does kill my appetite.",

I lost those yrs of my life sleeping 17 hours a day and the pain was horrible even taking 90mg a day and 30mg of Valium. I went to Wilmington Treatment Center to stop the medicines & so they started me on the Lyrica 450mg per day. It saved my life. Without the Lyrica I was awake for 3 days crying in pain, could not lay in a bed due to the sheets touching me, my core temperature would not come up, I was freezing but everything burned my skin if it touched me. The Lyrica within 2 hours gave me hope and I started turning around for the better. My life is so much better now. My family is glad to have me back!",

Tried hydrocortisone shots in my back and the pain went away for 3-4 days. I've been on vicodin and skelaxin as well as Aleve twice a day. I've had to take my vicodin every 4 hours instead of every 6 hours because the pain has been so bad. Just in the last 48 hours, I've noticed such a difference with Lyrica. I keep waiting for the pain to be there, but it is NOT. I'm still titrating my way up on the dosage, but in another day or two, my maximum dose will be 50 mg 3 times a day. Currently, I'm taking 50 mg 2 times a day. It really works.",
                    "Started taking Lyrica about a week ago for anxiety and tremors in my hands. Already notice a big improvement. Tremors are almost gone. Lyrica mellows me out big time. The things that bothered me before no longer bother me. I am a smoker and since starting Lyrica I no longer crave cigarettes. I have had severe back pain due to arthritis and I no longer have back pain! It does however make me hyper. I can live with that, and it makes me hungry, but this stuff works really well for me.",
                    "Worked wonders at the start. Was up to 600mg a day. I don't eat the best but I do think this did make me gain weight. I live in the great white north but I struggled with balance, fell often, and also had trouble putting my thoughts into words. These side effects are now gone now that I'm off this. Balance and communication much better now that I'm off.",
                    "I recently started taking Lyrica for two herniated discs. The doctor said I have massive nerve damage that will result in surgery but suggested taking this medication temporarily until surgery because my pain was unbearable! At first I was a little off balance but within a week I wasn't constantly in pain....within a month my pain was almost gone and I refuse to do surgery now! Thanks Lyrica for making this happen!",
                    "75mg x2 daily - no noticeable effect. 150mg x2 daily - slight effect of calm, not really therapeutic. 300mg x2 daily - feeling calm, a little sleepy, but I quite like that... it is still early days, but I don't feel the need to take any valium anymore. I stopped it weeks ago. I like being in this calm fluffy state, rather than sweating and thinking 100 miles an hour and stressing out. I am taking this medication for an anxiety disorder, panic attacks and lower limbs pain and walking problems...supposedly they are all linked.",
                    "I have been on Lyrica for the past 8 months, I have fibromyalgia and pain was unbearable. It was amazing at first as I could finally sleep. Over the few months however I have had increased swelling in my joints and gained 15 lbs with no change in eating habits. I started feeling confused with memory loss, then two weeks ago I started feeling suicidal. I did not ever suffer from depression but could not get the thought of just taking a bottle of pills. Due to my experience of working with mental health I knew something was not right so I am now working at reducing Lyrica and going off of it . I think it was amazing for the pain but not worth the risk with the change in my mental state.",

I tried nuerotin years ago but after the second day I could not function, so any one with nerve pain should give this a try. .it sure has helped me",
                    "I have had long-term treatment-resistant depression with various treatment regimens resulting in partial, but never complete regression. I started taking Lyrica for some unresolved jaw pain thought to have arisen from my wisdom tooth extraction. It was like a switch had been flipped, the next morning I woke up completely refreshed; a feeling I hadn't experienced in years. I experimented on-and-off to determine whether Lyrica was indeed the reason for this change in energy and mood. Indeed, nights that I took Lyrica (75mg) I was completely refreshed and motivated the next day. This contrasted my normal routine greatly, where I would typically take high doses of vyvanse (75mg-max dose) at 5 am just to wake up. Game changer for depression.",

Over the next 5 months it pretty much stopped working for the pain and the side effects became very worrying. I could not think straight and was dangerously clumbsy. I was is a malaise and did not wish to do anything so I decided to quit. I followed the instructions to taper over at least a week, then the real problems began. This is a horrendous drug to come off, I had to reinstate as I went out of my mind. I am now tapering at 10% as and when I can. I feel so unwell, anxiety has spiralled, depression, suicidal thoughts, insomnia, lack of appetite, sweats, the list could go on it has been a hellish period.",

I was diagnosed with bipolar II, GAD and mixed anxiety and depressive disorder, all I can say week 2 on this medication has saved my life! I'm on 75mg twice a day and can increase if I wish too, but with the way I am feeling at the moment I feel I don't need too. I can leave the house, I'm going back to work next week, and my girls have their mummy back, also suffer from damaged nerves in my lower back, it's helped so much with the pain. It's a miracle",
                    "The first night I took Lyrica I slept 9 hours. Got out of bed without any pain. This has been a lifesaver for me. I am so happy with the results. I am only on 50mg at night. Not seeing a reason to increase the dose yet.",
                    "I started taking lyrica about 4 years ago for fibromyalgia and found it lowered my daily pain by about 60%. While I do not suffer from GAD, I have always had feelings of anxiousness and physical feeling of restless uneasiness, and also restless leg syndrome. It was an unexpected side benefit that the lyrica helped control these feelings. After about a year and a half of taking 150 mg twice a day, I began to worry about addiction, and decided to cut back in an effort to possibly quit altogether. I soon found that my anxiousness and restlessness seemed worse than before, so I went back to my full 300mg per day dose, and have remained at that dosage. While on lyrica, I intentionally lost 35 lbs, and have not gained any weight back for 3 years",

After surgery I was also experiencing new pain of stabbing, electrical sensations in addition to the pain I previously had. I was prescribed Neurontin and the doctor kept raising the dose with no difference in my pain. I heard of similar experiences and being switched to Lyrica and it made a huge difference. I was in so much pain day after day. I switched to Lyrica and I have had nearly full relief of the pain I was having. I can't even describe how much this medication has helped me. If you find yourself in the same experience there is hope. Keep communicating with your surgeon and try Lyrica.",

I don't have the side effects from it that most have, and it works to control the pain, although I do have neuropathy flare ups from time to time. I'm taking it as a result of neuropathy from spinal chord injury. and my insurance pays for it so no out of pocket costs. I recommend this to people who have nerve pain.",
                    "Like many others, my pain doctor had me on gabapentin first, then after several months without relief, switched me to Lyrica. Without a generic version available, it can cost a small fortune depending on your insurance. Without any insurance, 100mg capsules 3X daily, 90 pills will cost upward of $600! With my Part D, and not qualifying for \"Extra Help\" through the state, I'm now paying $140 for a 2 week supply, $280 monthly. That's a car payment! I have no idea what to do once the free samples run out, it's a very good medication but unaffordable. If your doctor tells you gabapentin (Neurontin) works the same, chemically there's no difference, that just isn't true. It may be similar, but Lyrica works much better with significantly less mg's",

It did nothing for me except give me insomnia, make me forgetful, and increase my neuropathy pain and burning.  I already have difficulty sleeping because of neuropathy and L5 compression agony. This pill made it worse. I took 50 mg at bedtime for about a week. The doctor said it takes a while to get into the system. I'm not waiting that long.

The dose increased again with good effect. I do notice if I am late on a dose or miss a dose, sure pay for it, takes some time for pain to come back under control. I say as I write this at 5 am having not slept a wink. I'm currently on 150 mg twice daily. I'm gaining a belly but have not gotten on the scales, initially giddy and absent minded but that has subsided even with dosage increases. I think its a good drug choice for me. here hoping.",

This is very effective, as all other migraine prevention medication has been unsuccessful.",

So last year I stopped taking it as I still had a lot of nerve pain. But since I have been off it I realized just how much it actually did for me. I started suffering from crippling anxiety, my pain has gotten progressively worse and my hand tremors have returned. So after 9 months off it I am back on it again as I need a quality of life and Lyrica gives me that. It may not work for everyone but it does for me. I have fibromyalgia and General Anxiety.",

I just feel normal. My anxiety got so bad it was causing severe stomach problems, I almost had my gallbladder removed. Not only did it cure my anxiety, my stomach issues are gone, as well as my IBS that was a seperate issue, my restless legs are gone!!! GONE, RLS was torture, it stopped me from going to movies or on planes.. but that's not even the best part! My chronic leg pain which I saw many specialists about when I was young and had since given up on IS GONE! I thought I had to live in pain forever. My life is drastically improved. No words can explain",

The only side effect that MAY have been due to Lyrica is vision loss, but I have worn glasses for 30 years, so no big deal for my eyesight to slightly worsen over 2 yrs on the drug. Some of the side effects that people mention could be due to menopause rather than Lyrica. I gladly spend $60 for a monthly supply. Other meds I took previously left me like a zombie.

For 6 years, everyday I would have to lay in the tub and the shower hit my back or lay on a heating pad and even at night just to fall asleep I use sleep aids and constant showers or heating pads to get the muscles to stop hurting and spasms and then I couldn't take it anymore. The muscle relaxers wouldn't work and my back and neck were burning and stiff and spasms all day and night and I couldn't sleep and went desperately to a my new doctor that I was seeing and got his associate.

The nerve damage got so bad, I spoke to my doctor about it and he prescribed Lyrica which took care of all the nerve damage. At first probably the first 2 months only side effect I had was a little swelling of my hands. Lyrica was a wonder miracle for me. The doctor had me on it for over 3 years with no problems, then my insurance refuses to pay for it now, because a 30 day supply is $900.00. They wanted to give me Neurontin, which I am allergic too. Now all the nerve pain is back and worse. I want the Lyrica back and would recommend it to any one.",
                    "I've had problems with my feet burning for several years. Every year it was worse than the year before. It got to the point that I couldn't stand anything on my feet. Lyrica helped a lot, with much less frequency and severity of burning. Finally some relief. Unfortunately, I had to discontinue because of side effects. I had almost all side effects listed in the info sheet. Most I could have tolerated, but the ones I couldn't was weight gain, confusion, and fast progressing blurred vision. Also, I had severe clinical depression over 18 years ago until I received the correct antidepressant. I've had no depression since. However, the Lyrica caused it to return, although not as severe. It also caused anger flareups, very unlike me.",

Baclofen has been one medicine that has \"helped\" with minimal side effects. Please come up with something without the side effects!",

Day 2, Pain was gone but I was very sleepy not able to concentrate. Day 3, slept all day could not keep my balance and my dreams was almost real. Day 4, very sleepy and unresponsive, it was so bad that I could not feel my low blood sugar until all my body was shaking and I needed help to take sugar. Day 5, STOP taking the dame thing. Day 6, Pick up the phone, called my doctor and used every word I have learned in English on him and those scientist, who came up with this IDEA.

I am 25 and took Lyrica for at least 6 years. I experienced severe brain fog, difficulty breathing, cognitive difficulties n others while on this medication. I thought they were all due to my conditions, but after truly reflecting on my journey Lyrica surely hurt me more than it helped me. I have been off of the medication for about 3 weeks now. I did some research and learned that my detox period would be both difficult and long because 1, I took the medication for several years, I took a high dosage andi stopped the medicatiod cold turkey. It's getting easier for sure. The creator on my side!",

I'm really surprised that the Drs didn't tell my about \"Excedrin abuse\" since I told all that I was taking that much. However, when prescribed Lyrica for fibro pain, my headaches were gone to maybe 3 a week. So I highly recommend this for serious headache problems. Does help with Fibro pain. But, weight gain and dry mouth are my biggest side effect and is to the extent that I almost want to go back to 8 Excedrin a day. Hope this helps someone!",

The medicine is astoundingly good for me at combating depression, anxiety, overall body pain & morning stiffness. It takes higher doses of Lyrica to feel pain relief for most people with Fibromyalgia- those who say it doesn't work have often only tried it at <300mg a day. I take 300mg twice a day. The only bad side effect is weight gain- 100lbs. (And I'm naturally overweight to begin with, so this was terrible). It did eventually stop making me gain, but I have to eat less and work out more than everyone else I know, just to maintain my weight, let alone lose.",

I also take 37mg Tramadol IR whenever I have breakthrough pain. This is the minimum I need to function, but it does allow me to work and improves my overall mood.

I also managed to severely rupture a few discs in my neck while stretching of all things. Was misdiagnosed by the surgeon who only fixed one of the ruptures with a fusion of C7. Off course this still left me with pain and numbness from my neck down both arms. About a month or so ago I switched to a spine and pain management doctor and he put me on the Lyrica (75mg 3x daily) and a Duragesic patch. These two drugs have worked wonders for my pain and Quality of life. The only side effect is that my short term memory is a little sketchy and my mind doesn't want to shut down.",

Suddenly I realized, I forgot my walker. I completely forgot it. I wake in the morning, pain free. I am walking now without the walker, it has also improved my mood.

Eventually I was put on Pregabalin by a Psychiatrist and it was very helpful almost from day one. We increased my dose until I take the maximum of 300mg twice a day. At this dose my anxiety has been pretty much eliminated, I am happy and now an active person. However a word of warning to anybody taking this medicine for a long time: DO NOT allow yourself to suddenly withdraw from it. I recently had to go a week without it and it was a living hell for me. Withdrawal symptoms for me were as follows: severe anxiety and depression, suicidal ideation, inability to sleep, nausea and vomiting",

I read that I am in the minority with this. I can say for the most part Lyrica helped, but I had to take Advil with it. Overall, it helped.",

I was put on Pregabalin for generalized anxiety disorder and seasonal affective disorder by my Doctor. At first I was put on a very low dose of 75mg, which did next to nothing. I immediately requested to have the dose increased until finally I reached a dose that was effective enough for me (600mg). For a while the medicine did its job and I actually felt like my anxiety had been reversed. I suffer bad social anxiety, and 300mg of this made me quite extroverted and confident. I would say it was 'pro social' for sure. Alas tolerance set in and now even 800mg doesn't do much of anything apart from prevent withdrawals.",

A clinical research was recently done in Australia on lyrica (for Acute and Chronic Sciatica) and the findings stated it had the same effect as the research subjects getting placebos or sugar pills. The makers have racked in 3 billion dollars on it. I told my doc it isn't working but he still prescribes it to me, finding another doc this week.

It took awhile but each day that went by more of my pain left me, and now I am pain free from Fibromyalgia. My side effects was gaining weight and that was about it. Any day I would gain 20-30 lbs. to get rid of that terrible pain. Thank you Lyrica.",
                    "I'm only taking 50 mg at night for my leg sciatica pain and I feel dizzy at times. I'm also using Dr. Ho TENS machine on my lower back for 40 minutes to scramble the signal pain. I think both are helping right now. I was on a higher dose over 300mg a few years ago and my hands and feet swelled up and I gained 30 pounds I can't get rid of now even with water pills, so I had to stop med. I've had shingles right when I turned 50 before I could get the Shingles vaccine which I recommend to everyone as shingles is painful! I took only Lyrica 25mg two or three times a day to stop the shingles pain, A low dose due to side effects from a larger dose.",
                    "Lived with a severe generalized anxiety disorder for the last 10 years, last 5 years particularly full of anguish and \"crippling\" discomfort. Always misdiagnosed as a depression: been on SSRIs for 4 years with no success; also resistant to benzodiazepines. I was starting to believe I'd have to live like this forever until today! I got my very first dose of Lyrica (just a tiny 25mg) and after it kicked in (4 hours) I've been feeling myself, like I didn't since I was a boy! Layers of heavy bricks lifted away from my chest, and I finally feel like any human is supposed to feel. Today is undoubtedly the happiest day of my last 5 years. I feel lighthearted and motivated, serene and willing to restart my life like I was born again.",
                    "After very successful spinal surgery in Thailand, I went without pain for almost 3 years. I was all but in a wheel chair prior to surgery. I then took a bad fall and pain came back. Fully expecting surgery I returned to Thailand and doctor suggested Neurontin. Although I got some relief, the side effects were intolerable. He then put me on Lyrica. It stopped the pain within 24 hours. He said it would take a few days. I was on it about 45 days and then weaned myself off. I think anyone with spinal stenosis should ask your doctor about this. I think they have just approved it for back pain here in the States. My surgery was in 2005, and went back in 2008. It was a miracle for me.",
                    "Lyrica stops the pain in the ball of my feet. It's wonderful to be able to walk without the pain. I am diabetic and take insulin. I too have had a weight gain of 35 lbs over the past 6 months. I seem to suffer from a bit more memory loss than before and I fatigue easily. I have caught myself dozing off in front of the computer at work, so I force myself to get up and walk around a bit. All in all a small price to pay for the relief of the pain in my feet.",
                    "This is very good for my generalized anxiety disorder along with olanzapine. I take 100mg at night, it helps me sleep too.",
                    "After suffering from horrible post herpatic neuralgia in the trigeminal nerves on the left side of my face, I went to a neurologist who put me on Lyrica. A small dose of 50 mg each night keeps my symptoms under control. I tried adding a morning dose, but it made me giggle at inappropriate times, so I went back to only taking it at night. For over two years my pain has been controlled well. One night I forgot to take my medicine and the next day I had a painful attack. I'll never forget it again! I'm so thankful for this medicine. There are so many other medicines that I tried and could not take, but this one works great for me.",
                    "Good for generalized anxiety disorder but side effects were bad.",
                    "Works pretty well for the pain, but having severe side effects (involuntary musclular movement involving jerking of legs and difficulty speaking, urinary retention and inability to urinate, dramatic weight gain of 30 pounds so far)",
                    "Had neuropathic pain in right upper jaw after dental work. Tried many different medicines including tricyclic's eventually put onto Lyrica went up to 900mg as well as Endep 40mg. Couldn't tolerate Endep, worked my way back down to 600mg Lyrica and after 6 months the nerve pain is tolerable. What I didn't' realize was all the side effects that I now believe stems from Lyrica, severe bloating, sore eyes, memory loss, word problems, hand and feet pains, plus more. I have now found that it makes little difference between 75 or 300mg for pain relief. I have difficulty sleeping without any, 75 will eventually help but 300 gets me to sleep faster. After reading so many people complaining about the same side effects, I will be seeing my Dr.",
                    "I just started with this medication. I took one 75 mg pill in the late evening before going to sleep. When I took it I said to myself yea right this little tiny pill will somehow give my life back to me...the next morning when I awoke to my surprise, I felt like I did years ago. I could walk and stand without the aching and hurting. I was not as tired nor as sore in my muscles. What a wonderful little miracle this little pill is!!!",

An episode of severe pain and nerve issues recently meant I was signed off for 4 weeks to rest, however during this time my whole nervous and neurological pain got worse as well as physical collapse and spread to my face hands, arms and body functionality. The lowest point in five years thus far. I was put on Pregablin 75mg /2x day and although the first week was strange with hyper elation, a foggy mind and some humorous speech issues but when it kicked in the transformation was amazing. 3 months later I'm far more stable and working fulltime. Some back pain has returned with occasional sciatica.",

                    "I just weaned myself off of Cymbalta/Neurontin and started taking 50mg Lyrica capsules twice a day. I have been taking Lyrica for only TWO DAYS and have had amazing results. I may be reporting on this drug too soon but I am finding my pain receding greatly. I am feeling almost \"normal\", my spirits are definitely raising and hope that I can avoid nerve cutting surgery that would be my last choice for relief. I am an optimist by nature and am so hoping that 100mg a day will keep me pain free and away from the scalpel.",
                    "Lyrica has its pros and cons like any other medicine in the market. Lyrica has helped me in many ways including neuropathic pain and depression together with other antidepressants. The only side effect that bothers me a little is the fact that I feel tired most of the time but I can still function with a lot of calmness. On the other hand I have tried every single medicine for insomnia during the last 12 years with not so great results until I found this medicine. Now I sleep like a baby at 150mg twice a day.",
                    "I had minor back surgery and one result was nerve damage to the nerves from my right leg socket to my hip. Severe burning several times per year. Lyrica stops the severe pain slowly and reduces it to tolerable pain. I use 75mg on a nine day regimen - 3x for 3 days, 2x for 3 days and 1x for 3 days. It works good. The pain slowly resides and is gone by 6th day. No serious side effects. Slight vision blurring and minor lack of mental focus. Very minor. Overall, I think it works for me. Has not affected appetite, weight, mental attitude or sleeping habits.",
                    "My own experience was awful. I did not gain weight but I had been suffering with depression because of all the pain I was in. My doctor prescribed these which in my option she should have never done specially when I was very down at the time. I've never experienced such thoughts in my life the only time I got a break from my own thoughts was when I was sleeping. If you are feeling down at all while taking these my advice go see your doctor ASAP do not continue with these not advisable to anyone with depression",

It helped a little, but still had substantial back pain requiring Ultracet 3x per day and Lortabs when pain peaked. Have been on Lyrica 75mg 3x per day for past 11 days. Really reduced the pain the first few days, but pain came back a bit. Still, the Lyrica is helping and I've not had to take the Lortabs since starting Lyrica. I'm going to stick with Lyrica for a few more weeks before deciding to try more injections or other medicines.",
                    "I have been taking Lyrica for about 1 year and I went from hurting all the time to just my occasional spells. I don't know what I would do without it.",
                    "The real problem I had and still do is dosing. I started out on 150mg twice a day and found it too much at first. GP reduced dose to 75mg three times a day and 1 x 75mg when needed. That is my current dose and the side effects are worth it based on the fact that I've had painful neuropathy in both my feet and lower legs. The breakthrough pain was the main issue I was having trouble with and DID NOT want any more narcotics than I currently take...60mg. MS Contin x 24hours and 2 Statex when required per 24 hours. It can mess with your head a little like feeling like you are a bit spaced out. Works wonderfully and I hope I don't build a tolerance. ",
                    "I am an 81 year old male with back pain. The epidurals gave relief for only 3 weeks. I took Lyrica 50mg two times a day for only ten days. I stopped due to adverse reactions. I'm now in the process of gradually reducing the dose over a period of 8 days. My main reaction was a feeling of being drunk. I refused to drive during this time. On a scale of 1-10 I rate the pain relief a 5 or 6.",
                    "This medication has made a tremendous difference in my life. My pain was due to arthritis and none of the drugs prescribed for this condition worked. After two weeks on Lyrica I feel like a different person and my back is back to normal.",

                    "I have had fibromyalgia now for more than 20 years and my back pain was getting out of control. I had been taking a low dose of Lyrica (25mg) for some years, along with a cocktail of about 15 other drugs. I did some research, and came up with the fact that Lyrica was licensed for fibromyalgia, and took this to my doctor, who thought it would be an idea to try increasing the dose. After 3 months I am now up to 100mg night and morning, and am getting reasonable pain relief. However, I have severe side effects,the worst one being disturbed sleep every night through foot and leg cramps. I only have to stretch my legs slightly and it starts. Am getting disrupted sleep every night because of it. ",
                    "I really didn't notice much difference after 6 months on Lyrica - still had minor headaches, but apparently swelling went down (MRI). I DID notice the sleepiness at first, followed by insomnia and 30 lbs weight gain in that 6 months and swollen fingers and belly area.",
                    "I didn't even know Lyrica was prescribed as an off lable treatment for anxiety. I was mainly taking it for my fibromyalgia and phantom pain from an amputation. And I didn't realize until now I had full blown GAD and have probably had it since my teens.  I thought it was mostly depression. I journal and I can see that when I have been on Lyrica I didn't reach the extreme kind of depression I've been in. I recently tried to quit again because it causes me to be lethargic and to not be able to lose weight. It may have been some withdrawal symptoms, but within a week I was in grueling depression-anxiety. The DAY I started back on my 75mg/day Lyrica I started feeling better!",
                    "This didn't really change the pain levels but what it did do was make me gain weight substantially. This lead to me getting depressed which made the fibro flare up again. I stopped taking it.",
                    "I was prescribed Lyrica for fibromyalgia. The first hour after I took Lyrica I felt better and at night, I slept like a dream. I was on for a total of two weeks in which time I started feeling bloated and put on weight. I am a heart patient and I started getting angina. My blood pressure started to raise. I started getting headaches. My only wish was that I could have continued taking Lyrica as the fibromyalgia pain was gone. But I'll just have to keep looking. ",
                    "I started taking Lyrica 4 months ago. I am always anxious when taking a new medicine as I am also on Paxil, which is horrible if I do not have a dose within 24 hours. Within an hour I felt 'weird' like I do if i miss a dose of Paxil. That feeling subsided throughout the day. Over the next days I did feel quite vague and forgetful (like I couldn't remember my bank account number, which I use daily). Again I persisted, taking 75mg twice a day, on waking and then at 2pm. I noticed an increase in energy and a decrease in pain. ",

I also get pain \"breakthrough\" where pain attacks can reach up to 10 on a pain scale. I started Lyrica last year, and now am on 225Mg twice a day and have the same amount of pain control as the Gabapentin, but at a much lower dose. My wife says that I am much more \"aware\" and \"responsive\" on Lyrica and my short term memory issues are not quite as severe, however still there. My weight gain has ceased, however I am having a tough time trying to lose all the weight I have gained.",

She dropped me as her patient and subsequent doctors ignored my pain complaints. In 2004 I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia but my Neurologist said not to take Lyrica. Fortunately, I recently got a new Primary Care Physician and new Neurologist. Two weeks ago, my new PCP gave my samples of Lyrica. I am amazed at my improved ability to function already. I think of the years of being bedridden at age 36-41. I can't believe that I wasn't prescribed Lyrica, a decade ago. No side effects so far. I still have pain 24/7, but the relief due to Lyrica, is a miracle.",

The anti depressants had effects but not desirable ones.At times they replaced some anxieties with others and bad side effects. Sleep, sex drive, confusion. From someone who has experimented with recreational drugs including ecstasy the feeling I had from anti depressants was sometimes similar to a moderate come down from recreational drugs. I pretty much gave up on drugs Then along came pregablin which I hadn't spotted before. It is by far the best thing I've taken I started on 150mg a day now on 225mg won't go higher I don't feel as scared anymore I can do things. Try it.",

I also have to take Cymblata and tramadol with morphine but like I said I have full body RSD. Only side effect is my vision and I feel like I'm high but the benefits outweigh the side affects",
                    "I am 36, have a bad case of herniated disc that hits me in the back. Lyrica has helped a lot with pain and overcoming my hernia's crisis twice, at 150-300 mg daily. This is not an example of chronic use, although I might be such one case in the future if the problem persists.  In lower doses it seems to take more time (days) to take effect, in higher doses the side-effects are more pronounced.  My side-effects were: slight sedation, euphoria, strange body coordination, all in all: the psychoactivity. One can have an accident on these, so caution should be exercised and doctors instructions followed strictly. Using cars or other potential dangerous machines should probably be avoided too.  ",

My doctorr tested for inflammatory diseases and autoimmune diseases and nothing showed up. He decided to treat me as if I have fibromyalgia and gave me Lyrica (not sure what dose but supposed to take 2x a day) this little capsule is great. I can move and actually sleep comfortably at night. Only issue is it does make me sleepy so I can only take at night but that's good for me right now.",
                    "I took lyrica for long standing neuropathic pain. I took it before bed and woke up the next day completely in a haze, dizzy , uncoordinated and could not function.

Either this, or combined first 3 days muscle relaxant made my pain vanish. I was prescribed for 15 days and after 8 days, I forgot to take one night. I felt much better next day (after not taking).

I still can't believe it. I was sure I had Alzheimers. I now know I don't. I'm 65 and can't believe I may be able to be a normal person after being so mentally ill for more than 20 years.

                    "Lyrica works. Unfortunately, I am on the verge of discontinuing use because of significant side effects. The most troubling for me are the eye disorders (conjunctivitis and blurred vision), and the dementia. I am 53 years old and I have trouble remembering elementary words! It's very embarrassing. I also have a significant taste disorder... many things taste like \"burnt garlic\" to me... that's the best way I can describe it. Finally, I have facial bloating, weight gain, and dizziness. I have been on the maximum dose of Lyrica for chronic pain due to degenerative disc disease in my neck. I was willing to endure the weight and dizziness, but the eye, memory and taste problems are intolerable. Too bad, because Lyrica really helps pain.",

Tried everything, but Lyrica has been the one that worked. Not completely, but they may bump up the dosage, I'm told. Trying for 2 more months til I see my GP again. Lucky my insurance pays- otherwise I'd never be able to afford it.",
                    "The best way to describe how well Lyrica works for me is to say, \"I'm young again! I'm a 50 yr old who has suffered with fibromyalgia for many years. Every morning on waking I would just lay in bed dreading the pain and discomfort of something as simple as getting up and out of bed. I was prescribed Cymbalta, Celebrex and Tramadol which help; but nothing works as well as Lyrica. I am able to get more done now without slowing down. Like I said before, I feel years younger. I have read that Lyrica poses an abuse warning, but what I experience isn't really euphoria (High) as one might experience with opiates. I experience relief of pain and maybe \"light on my feet\" and actually stronger muscles %u2014 but not the euphoria of opiates.",
                    "It helped with the pain but every few months the doctor would have to increase the dose for me to have relief. Bad side it caused weight gain.",
                    "This is a miracle medicine. My pain prior to taking this medicine was so bad. I was having a hard time waking up in the mornings cause the pain was just wearing me down. It was harder to function at work too. My imagination started running wild as I started wondering if I was going to end up on social security disability. I've had 2 back surgeries C4-C7, and started to have new pain in the T spine below the 3 level fusion. I started taking Neuronton a few months ago for my pain and it did help some, but after a few months it wasn't helping anymore. My pain was strong and deep. I just didn't have much hope in this medicine but it is AMAZING! I have my life back. It helped with my anxiety also.",
                    "Like most others, I've tried everything possible for fibromyalgia over the past several years. I also have 3 herniated discs and chronic back pain. I tried Lyrica in the past and it did not help. Two years later I tried it again and in fact am still on 300 mg/day in combination with Flexeril 10 mg at night. It helped to take the edge off for about a month then suddenly stopped working. As I am going on a vacation soon, I am not beginning to wean off yet as I will wait until we return. Perhaps increasing the dosage would help? We will see. So far all I had was a month with a little less pain and am having a hard time maintaining my weight. My memory loss and grasping for words has also noticeably increased (and I am young). ",
                    "I was taking only 75mg per day of Lyrica for Fibromyalgia pain. I found it to be very helpful to me and helped me to get much needed rest at night. I took my dosage at night 2 - 3 hours before bed. My only issue with it was there were occasions where I felt a little \"spacy\" but overall, the pain left and I was able to carry out most of my day without significant pain. It was a very low dosage, so a lot of the side effects that some people experience could be from taking a much larger dosage. I am no longer taking it because I lost my insurance and can't afford the cost. However, I was told about Neurontin, will be starting it tomorrow and hoping to get some similar relief.",
                    "I was formally diagnosed with fibromyalgia August 2009. After 8 months of trying other medicines and physical therapy I finally gave in to my Doctor and tried Lyrica. I was nervous because I had used Neurontin in the past with bad side effects and thought Lyrica would be the same. I was wrong. Lyrica does make me sleepy but I take 75 mg at night about 2 hours before bed. My Doctor started me out on the lowest dosage and it has worked miracles for me. I have less pain and my muscles don't seem to spasm or twitch as much, I am able to increase my activity levels which helps with the stiff muscles. It also has helped to calm the nerves in my foot that were irritated in an unrelated injury. This medicine has been a miracle for me.",
                    "When I took Lyrica, I gained 40 lbs myself and my eyes were blurry. Once I got off of the medicine it has been still hard to lose the weight. It did work for my leg pain but the side effects were to much!",
                    "I have found I have an increased urge to eat sweet foods. I have tried to control this by eating fruit. However, this does not stop the craving for sweets. Also I have noticed an increased thirst and less urination. Further I have been able to stop using morphine patches and taking Mersyndol Forte since starting Lyrica. The lessening of pain has enabled me to sleep better",
                    "The nerve pain became so unbearable that it forced me to take lyrica despite the bad reviews and long list of negative side effects. I was told by many that it worked a lot better that neurontin with less drastic negative effects. Well, it has eased my pain some, but the side effects have taken my life from me. I'm dizzy at times, my head is always foggy and not clear thinking, I have depression, anger outbursts I've never had before, daily nausea, and am so tired that I can sleep all day and night long and can barely function. Unfortunately the alternative medications have even worse negative side effects, so what are we supposed to do in order to have some normalcy?",

I gained about 20 pounds within 2 months which I desperately needed to do. Overall, I have a better life now thanks to Lyrica. Nothing that I have been prescribed in the last 14 years has even came close to treating my condition.",
                    "I've suffered from Fibromyalgia since I was 16 years old (I'm now 24). My doctor put me on pain killers/ muscle relaxers, anti-inflammatories, Cymbalta and the list goes on. I've been told to change my diet. Nothing truly worked. Then I saw the Lyrica commercial. Asked my Doctor about it and he told me he had heard great things about it. I was given a free week trial. The FIRST pill- I could tell a slight difference. It's day 7 for me and I LOVE this pill thus far. ",
                    "It works for the muscle aches and it actually makes me a lot calmer. I don't know if that's just because I feel better so I can relax or if it's the medicine. I was so happy and blessed to find a doctor who listened to what was wrong with me and actually followed through with treatment. Hope that it can help more people and that there are no long term side effects but I am happy with the results and how quickly I felt a difference.",
                    "If you are debating on whether to take this, please don't hesitate. I was in car accident Dec 2012 and have whiplash/cervical strain. Injured my neck and shoulder. I was in pain for the past 9 months and no doctor would prescribe me narcotics due to Ohio law. I was miserable, crying, irritable and nothing I took (IB, Tylenol) wouldn't touch the pain. I got a prescription for Gabapentin, which I am allergic to BAD side effects. Finally the doc gave me Lyrica, within 15 min of taking pain GONE. I feel like I'm back to normal again (like the day before accident). Lyrica is a miracle although pricey. There is a program you can get through Lyrica website to qualify for free prescription. Try it.",
                    "Initially, this medicine was a godsend. Burning pain finally fizzled away. Muscle pains, didn't help as much. Still got numb and weak as well. The real problem came months later when I realized I was having memory problems. Had to wean off it. Memory loss was permanent. Chunks of time just gone. I still think because of the state of pain I was in I would do it over. Maybe the pain made me block out the time. I wish I would have just risked stopping it sooner to see if the nerve had healed. I still take them when I am desparate for relief. But just one maybe two until the zingers stop. Oh ya, nerves were damaged from electricity. Hand to my neck and face.",
                    "Hi. I have been on methotrexate 10 pills once a week and embrel injection 50mg once a week and now added Lyrica 50 mg 2 x a day. Told I have RA, and fibromyalgia. But even with these great meds I feel bad. From my waist to botton of my feet I hurt so. I do see my legs are swelling so very large and skin gets tight it hurts to walk. I dont know what else to do. I work and am on my feet all day. I go up and down the stairs at home I try to get extra walks in going around the blocks. But it hurts too bad. Im very tolerant to pain but this is to the point of no return. I feel bad for my family that maybe I'm a burden. And if I feel this way now how will I feel if I'd ever need some one to help me with everyday chores and hygiene. They may not see",
                    "After a head/neck/spine injury I found the drug to be very helpful with the neuropathic pain in my arm, face and various body parts. Weight gain is a minor issue. I don't suffer night terrors but feel as though I've been dragged through a hedge backwards upon awakening. I do NOT feel rested upon awakening. Cognitive issues due to the injury have been exaggerated after taking Lyrica.",
                    "This medicine was my neuropathic calming wonder medicine until my body over the course of several years had progressed to full body pain. I recommend anyone who has new or has out grown their pain medication to talk to your doctor about this.",
                    "The first time I used Lyrica I experienced an amazingly profound reaction; layers of depression and anxiety that had built up over several years melted away within minutes. That was years ago and I have since both weaned myself off the drug and restarted taking it again. One thing I rarely see mentioned is the terrifyingly bad withdrawal effect- missing more than one dose for me throws me into the absolute darkest pits of despair. Has anyone else experienced this? When I went off the drug the first time I felt like I had performed a miracle; so strong was the feeling that it took a long time for me to convince myself that things were bad enough to warrant going back on. It still helps, but nothing as miraculous as the first time.",
                    "Lyrica is the best medication for generalized anxiety disorder. I am on 75mg twice a day and been able to slowly get off my clonazepam without the benzodiazepine withdrawal. Brain fog will go away after being on it for about a month. Only other side effect is the cost.",
                    "Lyrica 25mg has been my beginning dose and I have been sleeping well, waking up feeling no pain, have no pain during the day, have a good mood and best of all no side effects! My doctor says that if I am comfortable on this dose I can stay at this amount and I don't have to go up if I don't need to!",

CBT, 40mg Citalopram, nothing. I then discovered pregabalin on this website. It was a struggle to get it prescribed on the NHS in the UK, but I'm so glad I persevered. This medicine is nothing short of a miracle. Within 24 hours I was a new person. I've only been taking it a week, but now I feel light and happy, and the anxiety has just faded away. I don't need alcohol any more. In fact, the thought of drinking now makes me feel ill.  If you have GAD - please try this. I'm only on 75mg twice a day as well.",
                    "This gave me incredibly bad nightmares not read other reviews with this problem but main reason I'm coming off it... does help slightly with anxiety but feel a bit too relaxed not good for daytime and work... does 150mg taken at night also causes dizziness and my eyes can't focus extremely groggy in the morning not great for me",

Lyrica 75mg 2-3 x day has made the biggest difference in my life and pain in over 12 years. I can walk without a cane and I feel like doing things. There was some initial weight gain, but that seems to have leveled off. I've been amazed and very pleased.",
                    "I used Hydrocodone and Tramadol for persistent joint and neck/back pain. Didn't appreciate the foggy out of body living experience but it did help the pain. Although with narcotics, I became easily resistant and constant increasing of dosage doesn't seem like the most practical idea for long term pain. Lyrica took about one month to actually show it's benefits, luckily I had gotten free samples for that trial period. After the 1st month I noticed significant relief from my persistent joint pain. I am able to function normally for most of the day without any issues. So happy to have found Lyrica, just wish it wasn't so expensive!",
                    "I have been on lyrica for 1 month, starting at one 75mg twice daily for two weeks, then stayed on 150mg twice daily for two weeks. I had horrible side effect so my doctor told me to split the morning dose that was 150mg in to taking 75mg in the morning and 75mg afternoon, then 150 at nite. So the side effects got better. I suffered from extreme dizziness, increased anxiety, had a feeling my legs couldn't carry me, burning sensation throughout the whole body. After one month of medication, when side effect had gone away a little bit, I talked to my doctor and he told me than since I still suffer from anxiety we should increase the dose to 150/75/150. Side effects are back, I take oxazepam 30 mg to get through the worst side effect and waiting for a better effect on anxiety. However I am better than before.",
                    "My doctor just put me on Lyrica 25 mg tablet twice a day. The first day I took one dose around lunch the other before bedtime and got sleepy in the day. Anyway I emailed doctor he said only take the one at nite but I decided to take both at nite and feel great! I have suffered for years with fibromyalgia and cymbalta was not working for the fibromyalgia but I also take cymbalta for depression so still on that added the Lyrica and feel that the great pain is so much less, my knees and ankle pain, burning sensation all down, and finally get a good sleep without all the leg pain. I am thankful for this drug and finally can get my life back on track and finally see light at the end of my long tunnel of dealing with this horrible condition.",

Also my fingers and face are very puffy to the point of being uncomfortable.And the worst part is the chronic dry mouth.I have to keep a water bottle on hand to sip on constantly!(Having a chronic dry mouth puts you at a higher risk of cavities.)And weight gain",

I honestly didn't think pregabalin would be effective but I noticed immediately it helping with the pain in my foot where I'm sure there is nerve damage as well as in my arm where I broke it. Later on in the day I set about doing a chore and realized my anxiety was gone. I mean I still had worry but it was managable? Hard to explain. Started off at 300 mg a day and went up to 450 a day then after a few weeks it was like my anxiety worsened.(I have GAD and take Clonazepam) I was going to go off the Pregbalin but I'm down to 100mg in the morning 50mg at dinner and 50 mg at night. Ok so far",

My life was pretty limited as to what I could do, which was pretty much sitting in a chair at the computer or watching tv. My love for the outdoors was pretty much squashed since it requires bending over, which I can't do, due to the rods and screws in my back. I have only taken this medicine for two days, and I have already have noticed a huge difference. I am actually able to move around more. I also have osteoarthritis, and my joints were hurting. Not anymore. This stuff is amazing. The only drawback is the cost. I have to take it three times a day, and it's really expensive.",

I was prescribed Lyrica 50mg about 2 months ago and felt a little relief. Doctor raised the dosage and now I take 150mg 3 times a day and the results are amazing. I'm alert, energetic, and pain free. Have a little dizziness now and then, but this medicine is great.",

I am on 300mg per day and have experienced no side effects and absolutely no weight gain. I am so much calmer and happier, my mood doesn't plummet suddenly, I am not anxious at all anymore and I am sleeping like a log! 10/10 don't let fear of sudden weight gain effect your decision to take this drug, remember that when they test drugs they don't take into consideration the lifestyles of the test subjects, that 1 in 10 person could just eat to much day to day which would result in weight gain and have nothing to do with the drug. Don't worry too much about it!",

I explained to the dr that I didn't feel depressed but I worried constantly through the night about things, and would also wake suddenly with chest pain. The dr sent me for ECG but I knew the pain was linked to anxiety. Anyway, after the ECG came back clear, he prescribed Pregabalin (a much lower dose than most people on here) and I only take one at night. I now sleep better, I have not woken with a panic attack since taking them, and my anxiety is no longer controlling me. I've been on them 6 months.",

My feet still sting and burn on and off everyday. One time, I decided to slowly stop taking Pregabalin and take the generic drug, Gabapentin and my feet flared up by a 1000 percent. I asked my doctor if he could prescribe Pregabalin again. I have had zero/none side effects taking Pregabalin but recently I came across reading peoples \"hellish/nightmare\" experiences trying to wean and stop taking this drug. That scares me and I do not want to be dependent on this drug or any drug. I am going to slowly wean myself off and find other ways to deal with my nerve pain. Prayers needed!",

My relationship with my husband and my baby (with whom I have had terrible difficulties bonding/guilt/PND. I've started having fun with her, I have finally somehow managed to stop fretting about what I think went wrong/I could've done better and started to enjoy now.

Lyrica has been the miracle drug for me and I have been taking it for about 3 years. It takes time for any drug to work properly and I couldn't function with out it. 150mg a day is my dosage.

My head was spacey and I couldn't register what people were saying, and once I realised I couldn't come up with a reply. Today, I woke up and I felt drunk and stoned at the same time but not as severe. I found it hard walk straight, my balance was off. I feel happier but not less anxious?

I am trying it for GAD (general anxiety disorder) after trying antidepressants; I tried SSRI's like Paxil and Lexapro and these were horrible failures. The SSRI's made me suicidal BUT Lyrica seems to really be doing the trick! The weight of anxiety is totally gone, and I feel somehow stronger and more self confident, although the feeling is a little manic at times and irregular, like feeling quite drowsy, then quite manic, in a short period of time. But I am assuming that this might stabilize after a few more days. So far I feel like a new person!",

Sleeping better, emotions have come back and I am not an anxious wreck! very helpful and no side effects.

It helped with some of the fibro pain and I felt tired and a little dizzy along with having dry mouth which I expected as common side effects. What surprised me was I got new pains in new places--my big toe felt like it was on fire and my lower back hurt badly. I started weaning off of Lyrica and the new pains went away. I also had insomnia from weaning process. I think it does work to dull the fibro pain but not sure if it's worth it if there are new pains.",

It definitely relieved my leg pain. I was also taking Tramadol which I decreased because Lyrica does the job as well and I don't like the tramadol as it makes me sleepy. Lyric does not make me sleepy. I have had no problems with Lyrica and been on it several months . Have gone off it also for several weeks with no problems at all. Maybe it helps some people and others not. For me, it really relieved my nerve pain in my legs.",

The thing I didn't like about it though was that it always made me feel like I was in a cloud. My thinking wasn't clear. I would get dizzy. I didn't notice too much of a weight gain, but there was some. In the end, I chose to try a different med (Savella) after my daughter was born and have been happier with that. Still works and fewer side effects.",

I have only been taking it for 3 days and I can already tell a significant difference. My hands and feet have no burning pain and I seem to have less numbness. I have also noticed that it helps tremendously with my anxiety. I was taking Xanax 1mg 3x a day and now I only take it once a day if that. I seem to feel more relaxed and less anxious so maybe this will actually help me stop taking the Xanax which I've tried so many times in the past. So far I am super impressed with this medication.",

Have your Doctor consult with a psychiatrist - because they know effective drugs to layer with this anticonvulsant - and you can continue to reap the benefits of Lyrica. I know it sure worked for me & life is so worth living now.",

Lately, I was having more pain in those areas, and my hips have started really hurting me. My doctor and I ran tests, and by process of elimination we feel that I have chronic fatigue, which can contribute to a lot of the allergy/asthma symptoms, the pains and exhaustion.

Anti depressants, exercise, narcotics, you name it. So I was excited about the dramatic pain reduction from Lyrica. But now I have developed severe muscle weakness, headache, abdominal cramping, blurry vision, bad judgement which causes accidents to my fingers and toes I have recently had difficulty thinking clearly. I can barely hold myself up and I can't lift anything over a few pounds. I have asked my doctor if I can safely stop taking it. She said stop daytime and only take at bedtime. every other night till I ween off. My quality of life has worsened. I have started Chondroiden, MSM powder and ALpha Lipoid",

Tried stopping lycria for 1 day as I gained confidence. Went back on it within 1 day leg and lower back pain unbearable. Sleep much better on it . Would advise anyone to try for chronic pain- side effects much less than Gabapentin by far. Had to stop work lost cognitive ability and brain fog worsened",

I now have a doctor who has prescribed Lyrica for me for the last 4 months. At a starting dose of 75mgs twice daily there was noticeable relief. Still hurting, however, my dosage was increased to 300 mgs twice daily which has successfully reduced the pain so that I am able to function at a higher level than I have experienced in years with minor side effects, the most annoying of which is sleepiness. I am grateful and relieved to have been introduced to Lyrica and to have insurance that will cover it as it is obscenely expensive.",

I have very bad social anxiety but on that day I was not afraid of anything, I felt any goal that I had always wanted to pursue I suddenly could, and even if I failed, I would deal with it. My only fear that day was that this would be temporary, and sadly, it was. The next day I took it, and I got only the slightest hint of what I had the day before, the tiny effect maybe lasted for the next couple days, then nothing, I kept taking it, thinking it might somehow kick in after time, but then I started to notice I was gaining lots of weight I stopped.",

Was given various prescriptions and decided I did not want to live dependent on pills - the side effects were just too much. Yesterday my doctor encouraged me to try Lyrica. With hesitation I took the first pill last night and woke up feeling like I did 10 years ago! I'm still shocked. I haven't noticed any side effects, but this is definitely worth every penny!",
                    "I suffer from fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis and surgically induced menopause. I am 40 years old. I have tried all medicines like Cymbalta, etc. but none really helped. My main issue has been a lack of deep restorative healing sleep as it exacerbates the fibromyalgia pain and inability to exercise. My Rhematologist has given me Lyrica to try and I have to say so far so good. I have only taken 3 doses and already I am getting a better quality sleep. So much so that my husband has noticed my improved overall state of mind. I am a little cloudy the next day but I am hoping this will ease over time. Worth the cost of a cup of coffee a day if it helps!",
                    "I was prescribed this for fibromyalgia, I've tried it several times at low doses and have had a horrible experience. I can not explain this but within an hour of taking lyrica I get the most severe tooth pain, like every tooth suddenly has a hole in it ? I went to my dentist the first time NO HOLES?? My doctor thought it was amusing ? Bizarre. My real problem is the next morning after taking lyrica I have horrendous stomach pain for days, hurts to urinate, poop or fart. Feels like I really have to push to urinate, my doctor said sounds like stomach/intestine inflammation which is on the common side, so I've been taken off it. I will say I sleep like a baby after taking it!",

Pain increasingly has become worse for the past year and a half! Rt arm /fingers numbness tingling and reduced strength of hand! Must say have arthritis at the base of both wrists with pain in wrists!Put on pregabalin! Took it for first time last night woke up at 4 am with pounding headache dry mouth! Took paracetamol! Pounding headache with nausea still on for most of the morning took painkillers with some effect! Head foggy sleepy!!Felt panicky!!!So didn't take pregabalin dose of the morning as became concerned and scared not being able to endure more!! What to do now???not sure???",
                    "I was on Lyrica for a year. Then my insurance decided hey we aren't paying for this anymore and I had to stop. And it was a just stop completely not a wean off of it. Started on. Gabapentin 800 3x a day. Has done Nothing for me. I am miserable. If you need help paying for it go to there website and they will actually pay for the medication for you. For a year then you just reapply. I will be getting mine back finally this week. And I can't wait to get back on it so I can actually be a mom and a wife again.

                    "I have had firbo for 16 years. My stupid doctor , who knew nothing about fibro, put me on some opiates and the one that worked was morphine. it was great, I loved it and then 2 months ago my doctor took me off morphine-paranoid I think about people overdosing.. I was furious with her and plan on changing doctors soon. I called Pfizer and qualified for no charge Lyrica . I received it 4 days ago, 150 mg . I sleep great with it and I also take xanex, trazadone, amitriptyline for sleep, I take it in the morning with my antidepressents and feel ok then I take it around noon and sometimes I feel really flaky. I need to gain about 10 pounds so I am not worried about weight gain.So far it is ok, still have pain but its not horrible..",

The meds do come with some side affects, short term memory loss and sometimes blurred vision being the worse. I've thankfully not had issue with weight gain. You have take the good with the bad sometimes. Without the prescribed meds life would be hell.",
                    "Thus is intended as a warning about sudden cessation of long term Lyrica use. I've been taking 75mg twice daily Lyrica for severe pain resulting from crush fractures in my spine. I started to feel a slight benefit from the drug a few weeks after beginning to take it but it wasn't until I started swimming that my long standing pain completely disappeared. I never missed a dose until a few days ago: just ran out, had to wait til the next day, effectively missing two doses. I went through an incredibly harrowing experience in that time without the drug...it wasn't psychological: I could almost physically feel the chemistry in my brain and body going totally haywire. It was extremely alarming, nothing can describe how nasty it was.",

                    "Lyrica works very well with pins, needles, tingling and numbness. The negative side effects were \"loopiness\", and inability to feel full after eating. I gained 40 lbs very quickly.",

                    "I have been in pain for years and started Lyrica. I cannot believe the difference. It is shocking. My pain is so much better. My bladder spasms are gone. I sleep so well. Wake up in the morning without hurting my back and ribs to breath. My chronic diarrhea is gone too. The only thing I have noticed on the negative side is I am super hungry, which doesn't surprise me. Overall, loving it and praying it continues to work. No side affects other than being hungry:)",
                    "I was diagnosed with Lupus 3 yrs. ago.Several months ago,during one of my doctor's visits, I discussed feeling more pain. He prescribed Lyrica. I was taking 3x daily, changed to twice daily. (I was experiencing \"foggy\" thinking with 3x daily). I have been VERY pleased with the results I feel.",
                    "I've had Fibromyalgia for ten years now, along with other health problems and up until a week ago I was using Flexerel and Cataflam to help with the pain and discomfort. Until last week, I was under a lot of stress at work, mind you I teach infants and toddlers up to age 3, and I woke up one morning in pain. Pain over my entire body. Pain I have never felt before. I felt like I had a supped up version of the Flu. I went to work in tears and left in tears and headed straight to my doctor. I began Lyrica that day and I was pretty out of it the first night and especially the next day when I took the next dose. I slept most of the first day and the second day I was a little dizzy headed and off balance. So far Lyrica is working well",
                    "I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia about 18 years ago. I stopped working a few years after due to the pain. I tried many medications so I could have some quality of life with my husband and 2 children. I spent most of my time in bed or on the couch because the pain was so debilitating. I was taking Ultram and Zanex but these just didn't take away the pain and then my doctor started me on Lyrica. I started feeling like a new person because slowly the pain started to decrease. The only side effect which could also be part of Fibromyalgia is with speech. I have trouble sometimes finding the words I want to say. I now take 75 mg 3 times per day and have been taking it for over 10 years. I'm so grateful to have my life back.",
                    "I had shingles in January 2014. I have had terrible PHN ever since. 2.5 years of pain. It has been awful!! Shingles is the worst pain I have ever experienced and it isn't going away. I tried everything out there from Gabapentin to acupuncture, to percocet, to injections in my back and nothing helped, or it would help for a few weeks, but the pain always managed to come back strong. I was wary of Lyrica because of the side effects, but I finally decided to try it. It has definitely helped me and I can do things like ride my bike again with little pain. However, I have put on 8 lbs in 6 months and I am an extremely active person, so this is tough for me. I also have pain in my joints and sometimes my hands go numb, but less pain.",
                    "Have had fibromyalgia for about 20 years. Have been on Lyrica 600mg for 2 years. To date this has offered me the best pain relief. I was also taking Zytram, up until 2 months ago. ",
                    "I have been taking Lyrica for three months. I started out with 75mg twice a day. It took the edge off my fibromyalgia pain during the day but at night I would wake up due to muscle pain when laying on one side too long. My doctor increased me to 150mg twice a day and for the first time in months, I was able to sleep through the night. I feel like a new person. It's a wonder drug. For once I am not walking around like a zombie due to pain and lack of sleep. I have gained a couple of pounds but I can live with that.",
                    "The pain from Fibromyalgia comes as MUSCLE cramping, tingling, twitching, spasms, etc. It is not a \"nerve\" illness per se, yet doctors think people are stupid and prescribe this anyway. It does nothing for the pain or fatigue from Fibromyalgia or Chronic Fatigue/M.E. Until people realize that legitimate users of meds such as Hydrocodone, morphine ER, etc are rarely abused by people in genuine chronic pain, doctors will continue to jeopardize patients lives by giving them meds like this as a placebo with nasty side effects. One doctor also put me on Paxil which gave me Serotonin Syndrome and I was in Intensive care for a week! This was when SSRI's first came out and I went into med journals. Avoid this for chronic MUSCLE pain.",

I was prescribed Lyrica for fibromyalgia pain, and chronic fatigue. I was on almost the highest dose for 2 months and did NOTHING for me but make me gain 25 pounds! I am 5'6\" 125 and went up to 150lbs. 125 pounds is a high weight for me so 150 is too much for my frame. ",

Neurontin was like whiskey hit hard and had \"hangover\", Lyrica is like a fine wine, subtle and mellow and doesn't have the zombie effect. DON'T DRINK ALCOHOL WITH IT this was only a reference. I am taking 75mg at night and 50 in the morning. I also don't need the antidepressants anymore.",

Nothing worked, opioids almost led to death. 2 months ago begam Lyrica (100mg, 3x/day). At beginning: brain felt \"foggy\"; walking unstable; total urinary incontinence (some bowel incontinence). To say I was shocked at how the Lyrica relieved my spine pain is an undersatement! I read all the horror stories, but decided to give it time. This is the first time since the early eighties I have had NO pain! The side effects are gone.",
                    "I take 75 mg at bedtime. I started Lyrica in 2015 when I had shingles. I noticed that I wasn't having crippling anxiety. I was able to stop Klonopin. I went back on Klonopin when we moved out of state. I also started Ambien 5mg. For sleep issues. I thought I could stop Lyrica. That was a big mistake. Last night I didn't take the Lyrica and I am so anxiety ridden and feel physically sick. I will definitely take the Lyrica tonight.",
                    "I was taking 50mg Lyrica every 2 hrs or sooner each day; while it did seem like I had more energy and could work a little longer before resting, the pain never stopped or lightened up. Lyrica  amitriptyline did help me sleep better. I quit taking Lyrica and started taking gabapentin 300mg 3Xper day and the pain lessened a lot, and sleep is better and some of the brain fog is gone.

                    "I found this to be very effective in treating the after effects of double fusion of cervical vertebrae. Then I found I was having less difficulty with fibromyalgia. I was on 3 a day and only side effect was weight gain.",

I see it as my salvation when compared to some of the medications I have taken over the years. YES, withdrawal from any form of medication is horrific and with uncertainty and discomfort. I personally am prepared to go through this horrible time to give Lyrica it's chance to work and improve my life, as I have seen an improvement already. Thanks to those who worked so hard to make this medicine for those of us who need it, know that your work is appreciated.",

Fentanyl for fms is like a heavy bat for the wrong ball but was the only bat available.  I have been taking Lyrica for 1 1/2 yrs now. Had 1st pain free days in years when 1st started. Unfortantely, still on fentanyl in addition because I cannot take more then 50mg a day of lyrica w/o it knocking me out. Tried to build tolerance over 3 wks w/o success. Have had wild vision changes also.",
                    "My Anxiety had crippled me to a state which my life could no longer function. The first few days on Lyrica I noted a sense of euphoria and confusion but by the 4th day I found myself able to think about trigger points for my anxiety and was almost in awe of how it didn't raise its head. It seemed like anxiety had left my body, to the point where I had to look in a mirror and say \"why did you care about all that so much?\" Almost in disbelief of my previous behaviour, not being able to connect with those feelings or attitudes became freeing. lyrica gave me my life back it seems. Importantly, I'm still me. Friends and family all commented how much better I am without losing personality which i believe is one of the best qualities of the drug.",
                    "On my first day taking Lyrica, it was incredible - I was patient, calm, and chilled out. I could deal with stress better than I have been able to in my entire life. However, I quickly grew a tolerance, and I spent weeks chasing that feeling by upping my dose. When I finally reached 250mg, I was an absolute zombie. I was taking much longer to finish my sentences and I felt like I was constantly in a fog. My depression has reached an all-time high and my anxiety is still present - I'm just not having panic attacks any more. The past few months have been particularly bad and I just don't think it's worth being on any more. I think I'm especially disappointed now because it started out so well and I'm significantly worse off now.",
                    "It makes the pain go away and I can finally sleep at night. I'm so glad they have this medicine. The only side effect that I have had is the weight gain, which is 25 pounds so far and I have only been on it a month. At first I had some dizziness and minor hand and face swelling but that has gone away. If they could only improve so it wouldn't make you gain weight it would be a perfect medicine.",

Severe joint pain and urinary retention developed within 24 hours and I found it incredibly difficult to remain conscious. Hospital staff did not recognise the symptoms as an adverse effect of the medication, even though I handed them the advisory notes from the medication, and treated me as though I was just having an anxiety attack or attention seeking. It wasn't until I was discharged and read up on the medication that I was able to confirm that all the symptoms I had were listed as side effects. needless to say I did not take any more.",

I still have difficulty moving around in the morning, but within an hour of taking my morning dosage the majority of my pain, etc is gone.",

I am going to go back to Gabapentin which helped me get off morphine. My eyes are dry and blurry. I fart all the time and I am fat! I was off of it the beginning of the year and I was hurting but side affects are too much.",

What I didn't realise was it also helps with anxiety and depression, after 3 weeks I noticed a calmness I thought I could never achieve, did some googling on the benefits of Lyrica last night and was amazed at everyone's experience on Lyrica. This is great stuff, would recommend it highly, thank you Lyrica, back to fun time with the kids again.",

                    "With the recent changes to pain medication guidelines I was reduced from opiates and given Lyrica to try. RUN, don't walk away from this medicine. My memory got fuzzy, I stumbled and fell in injurying my back, it keeps new synapsis from forming in your brain (I.e. brain damage long term), I have rashes, etc. Most importantly, I started having thoughts of death. All of this on 50mg at bed time.  In a few years I'm sure TV lawyers will be soliciting patients for lawsuits. This is a strong chemical to introduce into a already weak person's system.",
                    "I have suffered a very long time to the point where my bones ached so bad that it brought me to a complete halt in life. My mother also suffers as well as my daughter who is showing many of the symptoms that I had at her age. I have been on Lyrica for ten days now and can not believe the difference it has made. I hope that this med can improve other's lives as well as it has mine, because FM is a horrible thing to have to live with. No side effects so far. Here is hoping it is for you..",
                    "My doctor prescribed this for me when I was dealing with pain from a fractured sternum. After dealing with the pain for over a year we tried this. Fantastic results. Required only 3 weeks of treatment and the pain resolved.",

When I tried to stop this drug I experienced severe anxiety and feelings of gloom. Went back on see and say the pain clinic who advised tapering 25mgs every 2 weeks. I am down to 50mgs am and pm. The withdrawal is one of the hardest things I have been through and cannot wait until this drug is totally out of my system. Lesson learnt to research prescribed drugs, their side effects and withdrawal before blindly accepting them.",
                    "I rated Lyrica as \"one\" because IF your prescription plan does not pay for it, it is worth nothing to you UNLESS you are prepared to pay about $350.00 a month out of your own pocket. It's effectiveness for a few of my problems was very good, but since I cannot afford it, it's effectiveness is actually ZERO to me now.  Don't take the free sample that will be offered to you (unless you can afford it later). Stopping Lyrica will be the one of the most miserable things you have ever tried in your life! It is a horrible withdrawal. the company is just like a street dealer of drugs. BOTH give you \"free samples\" to get you dependent on the drug and they charge big money for you to continue taking it.",
                    "Initial euphoric effects wore off so dosage was increased. Was told would treat nerve pain and later told good for anxiety. My anxiety got worse on med as when it was due or late I was ill, it has addictive qualities I do not like. My health took a nose dive on this and I had to come off due to blurred vision, weight gain, blocked bowel. My Doctor advised decreasing of 75mg a week. My first drop was hell completely threw me into panic as I felt so ill, no one explained withdrawal when I saw medics in a state no one comforted me saying it could be the reduction too high/quick for me, after all in hindsight if I felt unwell late taking one dose then dropping 75mg wouldn't be helpful quickly, lower doses not easy to get as more costly to NHS etc",

I had been in pain every minute of every day, with some days being completely overwhelmed by the pain. Now I feel like I can live again. I just noticed that increased suicide risk was a potential side effect of Lyrica, which might concern me as I've suffered from major depressive disorder for >25 years. But being on this medicine has raised my mood a great deal because I don't have chronic pain to deal with on top of my baseline mood disorder. It is so wonderful. I'm waiting to hear that it causes something dreadful - because isn't that usually the case when something works so well.",

Heating pads aren't therapeutic, I sleep on 4 ice packs (I know, eeww, but whatever works). They help with inflammation, try them. Lyrica gave me agonizing, shooting pains from deep within shoulder and hip joints down humerus and femur. And unwelcome 35 lb weight gain. And blurry vision that meant I couldn't drive. Lyrica was useless for me, so glad you all have something to fight this fibromyalgia.",

I had a dry mouth and throat constantly, and my vision was hard to focus, jumpy. I had stopped and restarted after 4 months, still the same. Breathing is harder, so I've noticed this time.   I have stopped for good!",

The side effects have been extreme dizziness, edema in the feet, weight gain (about 15lbs). At my last appointment the Doctor adjusted the dose to 50mg x 4 times a day. The dizziness comes and goes. This is a great medicine for me. I can handle dizziness at this level.",

I have suffered with chronic pain mostly my adult like. I have undergone nearly every pain management regime one can think of: Epid nerve blocks, rhizotomy, physical therapies and of course every narcotic medicine that was available. Yet within just a few months, and after all these years, Doctor and I have finally found a medication regimen that truly works! Lyrica 75 2x a day and MS 60mg 2x daily. And since starting Lyrica, my acute pain episodes are less frequent.",
                    "I was given this medication for pain after suffering from two herniated disks. The medication worked great, but I did not know how good until my doctor took me off of it and my pain returned to its debilitated state.",
                    "I find it helpful for sleep 150 mg with seroquel and Xanax. Sometimes it makes me dreamy or spacey not unpleasant but maybe for its reputation as a street drug in larger doses I have never tried. I don't have much anxiety so have nothing to add.",
                    "I was already overweight and went on Lyrica because of the tingling in my hands and feet being intolerable. Three weeks later, its like I woke up one morning and none of my clothes fit. I got on the scale and from the time my doctor gave me this pill to current and have gained over 25 lbs. It's a shame I have to decide between being obese or able to sleep and be pain free.",
                    "Brilliant, like an anti depressant but I don't get nervous anymore",
                    "I suffered severe sciatica for two years before my doctor prescribed Lyrica. After a few days of building up in my system, the medication completely killed all of the pain, numbness, and tingling in my right leg. It was so effective, I thought I was suddenly cured! I stopped taking the Lyrica and the symptoms returned after a couple of days. I have now been taking Lyrica for two years and swear it is the best solution available for my bulging disk problem.",
                    "VERY MIXED RESULTS. Had a severe attack of shingles on the face and scalp (3 weeks in most of the hair on one side of my head was literally gone). I refused morphine (in hindsight, I should have taken it) but I did take Percocet which helped the internal pain but not the nerve pain in the skin. For that they gave me Neurontin, but I could not tolerate it due to extreme drowsiness, loss of appetite, loss of concentration and dry mouth (before I could chew food it was too dry to swallow it). Tried Lyrica 75mg 3 times daily. First dose seemed to really work but effect declined significantly so that the fifth dose had no effect. During the fourth week he increased to 100mg 3 times daily. Second dose helped then effects declined.",
                    "I have had chronic pain from Spinal Stenosis for over 25 years. Neck shoulders and lower back. I was on Lyrica 150 mg twice a day a couple years ago & truthfully can not remember why I stopped taking it. Since the \"war on pain meds\" My Dr. ask me to try it again. I took for 2 weeks then I started getting blurred vision, confusion, memory loss, & I would be standing in a store and twice the husband had to catch me because I was just falling over. I felt sick inside, instead of my quality of life improving it went down hill. I will never take this so called med again. I will live with the 10 to 15 pain level somehow if I have to spend the rest of my life just sitting still or in the bed. I also got to the point I was severely depressed. Do NOT take this drug.",
                    "Apart from putting on weight - Lyrica has been great. I sleep (a miracle in itself) and have felt no pain.",
                    "Started using LYRICA about 6 months ago. It seems to have minimized the toe/foot pain I have when I go to bed. This was keeping me awake with pain and restless legs. Now I can get to sleep easier. Did notice some weight gain... but am working on it. No other side effects noted at this time. Sure has helped me at night!",
                    "Lyrica has saved my life, just wish I'd have started taking it sooner and it would have saved my marriage. My pain is completely controlled and I am no longer taking anti-depressants. I didn't realize it helped with GAD, but it does. I actually feel human again and interact with others. It does have some side effects, can't concentrate and a drunk feeling but compared to the pain I was enduring, these side effects are worth it to me.",
                    "600 mg of lyrica works wonders for me. Its a very good drug and completely takes away the pain. Without this drug I would go insane I've gone days with so much pain that I thought of committing suicide. Really awful feeling because I have always enjoyed life and I'm only 38. Nerve pain is by far the most painful pain I have ever had. To all of you who suffer out there, there will always be a medicine that can help you. Don't give up there is a way this horrible condition. I hope everyone find relief",
                    "Started taking Lyrica yesterday for severe diabetic neuropathy in both feet and lower legs. I am currently on Suboxone for a 15 year addiction to opiates and was concerned that Lyrica wouldn't work because my body is so screwed up from all the years of opiate use and most medications do not work well for me. Thirty minutes after the first dose I noticed a significant improvement in the neuropathic pain. My bedtime dose was another 75 milligram capsule and I slept better than I have slept in months! This medicine has been a God send for me so far. Hoping that it continues to work well for me! Thanks Pfizer!",
                    "I'm a 41 year old male and I suffer from diabetic Neuropathy in my feet. It's steadily gotten worse over the last 2 years and wasn't even diagnosed properly until 3 months ago. I've been taking Lyrica started with 75mg twice a day which didn't much of anything. I'm now taking 150mg twice a day, it's somewhat effective but not quite there yet not sure if dosage will have to be increased or I'll have to try something else? I haven't had a lot of the side effects others have mentioned except for memory loss. I've noticed that my short term memory hasn't been the best of late but other than that not really many side effects for me.",
                    "I was just diagnosed with fibromyalgia earlier this year. My old doctor prescribed me Cymbalta and it didn't work. I was off from work for 2 months because of the pain. All I did was layed in bed suffering. Seemed like I would never have my normal life back. I went to another doctor and he prescribed me Lyrica it lessened the pain within a day or two. Now I have some of my life back. I still have a little pain but Lyrica has helped me and changed my life.",
                    "I am 37 with multiple illnesses, fibromyalgia, diabetes, arthritis, and schizophrenia being the tip 4. My Doctor put me on 300 mg of Lyrica 3 times a day. Initially, it stopped my severe symptoms of fibromyalgia, initially. I began to have sleeplessness, which became 3 hrs of sleep every other night. My legs from knee down began to tingle, then it felt like worms crawling in them. I had fuzzy vision, and then 60 voices came out in my head, very loud and clear. My Doctor refused to stop lyrica, I stopped taking it and within a month the side effects disappeared.",
                    "Side effects are worse than Fibromyalgia pain. I've been taking Lyrica for two months. It was a miracle drug for the first few weeks. I've been living with Fibromyalgia for over 35 years and have tried eveything. Anti depressants, excersise, bio-feedback, acupuncture, narcotics, you name it. So I was excited about the dramatic pain reduction from Lyrica.But now I have developed severe muscle weakness, headache, abdominal cramping, acne and difficulty thinking clearly. I can barely hold myself up and I can't lift anything over a few pounds. I have asked my doctor if I can safely stop taking it. I'm just waiting g for him to return my call. I would rather just live with my horrible pain than take any more of these toxic drugs.",
                    "I started with 75 mg of Pregabalin which was raised to 100 mg at bedtime. While it helped me in reducing neck pain and I had substantial reduction in anxiety, it started giving me huge side effects. I started having throat pain, sinusitis, vivid dream early morning and some feeling of dizziness. I also added 5 kg of weight in 2 months. I am now tapering it off gradually. While I would say it worked for my main symptoms, unfortunately it gave me too much side effects.",
                    "For the past year I have suffered pain in calf of leg which travels up theough thigh hips and back on walking it becomes extreme and I have to sit down, awaiting MRI scan on spine... physio say stenosis of spine and that I have a slight curve in spine... After reading reviews I decided to try these tabs I have only taken them for 2 nights ( 1 x 75mg cap) supposed to take 2 daily but I feel I cant wake up in mornings and have to force myself to get out of bed, for a couple hours after i still feel groggy and light headed throughout the day. I dont know whether to perservere with them, I have to say slight improvement with being able to walk with a little less pain. I live in Scotland so my prescription is free for this drug.",
                    "I was on Lyrica until last year until my insurance would not pay for it. They started me on gabapentin which does work very well with me.",
                    "Have been rock bottom down by the river, then re-started Pregabalin. IT IS AMAZING. It only took about 24 hours to notice the difference, and wow. A week later and I am nearly 100%. I knew I was anxious not depressed! It should be prescribed as a first-line choice. Previously on it for 3 yrs. I am a 59yr old housewife.",
                    "I first started taking this for trapped nerve causing cramps in my hand. I started off 25mg 3 times a day for first week. The first thing I felt was calm all my worries went away second week upped to 100mg 3 times a day feel like a lotto winner walking and talking like a new man. No prob with sex its all still working! Slight foggy brain but got my old job back cramps in hand gone all looking well, booking to go away with the wife soon xx",
                    "I couldn't remember the last time I had a \"good\" day since diagnosed having Fibromyalgia until 2010, when I was first told about Lyrica by an emergency doctor. The symptoms & pain had got so bad that I drove myself to a Baylor emergency room. Physically and mentally I just felt defeated. I was so stressed out that I developed an ulcer and my potassium/magnesium levels were so low they admitted me several times for as long as a week on time. Bags of blood had to be given and IV fluids. Ugh..I was a hot mess. I don't recall the doctor that introduced me to Lyrica, cause I was in and out a few times, but all I can say is a BIG thank-you. I've been on Lyrica 300mg a day since 2010. I can get what I need done and function like a normal woman.",
                    "I used this for my last herniated disk issue. I had a sequestered herniated L5 L4 issue and suffered from nerve pain down my left leg and drop foot. Pain Medications (e.g. 10mg Percocet 3-4 times daily) did nothing for my leg pain though helped my back. Lyrica at 150mg twice daily did the trick for my leg nerve pain. The sciatica makes your leg kill while you know nothings wrong with it, so with Lyrica I was amazed to have the leg pain just disappear. No side effects. Sciatica went away by itself after 3 months so no need for Lyrica anymore.",
                    "It's simply a miracle.",
                    "This medicine reduced the pain but immediately caused severe swelling of the legs and feet.I also had constant dizziness.I could not tolerate the swelling and weight gain.",
                    "I had put off taking Lyrica because I was afraid of the side effects. Eventually my nerve pain got to the point where I had no choice. It was completely debilitating. Searing burning pain with no relief. Pain meds didn't touch it. I couldn't sleep because the pain was that bad. My clothes hurt. Soft feather light brushes against my skin stung and BURNED for minutes after contact (more intensely than the consistent present burning). After about three weeks on Lyrica I finally found relief from the worst of it. What I am left with as far as the burning goes is completely tolerable (of course it does nothing for my other symptoms). I'm grateful I caved but am concerned about weight gain & significant cravings for sweets.",
                    "I am a 22 year old female who was in a car accident over a year ago, and 6 months ago started having tension headaches, migraines, and overall muscular pain. I had to quit my job and have barely been able to keep up with school. I took Lyrica for the first time last night. It caused some upset stomach and a weird buzz, but this morning I woke up feeling like a different person. I am still sore from my muscles being weak and tight all the time, but today is the first day I could feel that I was still sick from a headcold. The pain and discomfort had drowned out any other discomfort. I am hopeful for the first time in months.",
                    "I have Rhuematoid Arthritis so I have joint and tendon pain just about everywhere but mainly in hands, wrists, forearms, legs and feet. I have been on Oxy ER 80mg 2x day and was still not getting full relief (4 out of 10) and having difficulty remembering. Doctor added Lyrica 75mg 2x day three months ago and the day after I felt euphoric. I felt no pain! After one week some pain came back but no peaks as before. Some weight gain. Want to get off of Oxy and try Lyrica or other non-narcotic drugs.",
                    "I have just started lyrica but so far it works great for my anxiety and my back pain. Don't give up when you first start with the side effects they pass and this medication works a lot better than any SSRI or lorazapam which is horribly addictive I think I finally found something that can help and I hope that whoever reads this feels the same",
                    "I use Lyrica 75mg (4 X day), Fentanyl Patch and Percocet up to 8 times a day and I have little times that my feet aren't throbbing. My A1C is 6 and I am not on insulin. There has to be something out there that can help. I have been on Cymbalta, Neurontin,and many others.",
                    "Attackef at age 60. Totally bedridden many years. Husband took me to many neuros who ended up not believing in fibromyalgia. Very insulting suggesting it was\"all in my head\". Many days could just not make myself move or interact. I had great tired feeling and feeling of pain running thru all parts of my body. Oct 2014 I was lucky. Went to another neuro, prescribed 25mg bid lyrica. In 2 weeks I was myself and have not looked back. Befote this I was an avid runner, pilates, overall exerciser. This came fromnowhere. My lyrica is very low but I just needed it evidently.",
                    "Was prescribed Lyrica for fibromyalgia. Since starting it 2 yrs ago, I haven't had RLS! What a nice bonus!!",

                    "I started taking lyrica 25mg 2 weeks ago. I was sleepy day 1, took nap. Next day 25mg felt well and energetic. I'm combining low dose which a massage every 2 weeks. I'm interested in what others have to say about long term use at a low dose.",

                    "I am an RN and had been hesitant trying any medicines for fibromyalgia. I take Pristiq for maintenance depression medicine and I have to say that after only 3 weeks I have had a 8/10 improvement in trigger point pain, no headaches at all. I do have to say that I will probably come off it though because I have probably gained 5-8 lbs and had a lot of edema of hands and feet.",
                    "I take 75 mg. X 2 per day. It seemed to help the first couple of days, now nothing. I have gained 12+ lbs, too. My appetite is getting out of control. I'm going to talk to my doctor about trying something else. Anyone else having problems with weight gain like me? I still need to take an OTC pain medicine with my Lyrica. Anybody ever try muscle relaxers?",

Started Lyrica 7 months ago, now at 75mg x 2, twice daily.  Reduced oxycodone from 80mg daily to 40mg daily, tramadol for breakthrough. Hope to increase Lyrica and further reduce oxy. Still do PT for flares. PT is needling with electricity, like acupuncture with electricity running thru needles. It is amazing. No side effects, no weight gain but possibly weight moved to stomach area, no problem. 5ft 3in, 125 lbs Lyrica is no miracle but finally found combo of therapy, meds (Lyrica inc) for some quality of life.",
                    "I've tried other things for pain. Already take a strong pain medicine, which is getting harder and harder to get, because in my State, one must go to a pain clinic to get it. Pain clinics are horrors. Lyrica seems to work with the amount of pain medicine that I take and seems to have even reduced the \"break through\" pain. No unpleasant symptoms yet.",

                    "I started taking Lyrica after seeing an orthopedic surgeon, for widespread pain and tendinitis. After taking 50 mg a day, I had no difference, then up to 75mg a day, I still had pain in my wrists (most likely because I work on a computer). But MIRACULOUSLY!, I noticed that along with 'Some' pain, my social anxiety is all but GONE! It's not even the reason I started taking it! As for my wrist pain, we've bumped up the mg to 175 per day and it's only been two days, I'm very groggy in the morning. I didn't get that on the 75mg, but I am confident it will subside. I feel like a new person because the easing of the social anxiety was a total surprise! I would recommend this medicine to ANYONE with pain/social anxiety.",
                    "The first time I used Lyrica I experienced an amazingly profound reaction; layers of depression and anxiety that had built up over several years melted away within minutes. That was years ago and I have since both weaned myself off the drug and restarted taking it again. One thing I rarely see mentioned is the terrifyingly bad withdrawal effect- missing more than one dose for me throws me into the absolute darkest pits of despair. Has anyone else experienced this? When I went off the drug the first time I felt like I had performed a miracle; so strong was the feeling that it took a long time for me to convince myself that things were bad enough to warrant going back on. It still helps, but nothing as miraculous as the first time.",
                    "I have taken 3 x 75mg, and amazed at how well Lyrica worked for me after only taking 1 pill. I feel like I can get comfortable for the first time in years. I have high hopes that this doesn't wear off and I can continue to feel so good. I feel like a miracle, really has helped my all over body pain that I live with for years.",
                    "I am suffering from burning pain in my body. I was on the Fentanyl patch for 15 years. That gave me complete relief. Because of drug issues in my state, I tapered off of Fentanyl in Feb. I don't think that Lyrica was around before I started the patch. Since the burning pain came back, I was put on Lyrica. It certainly helped and I can live somewhat pain free. Now the doctor has refused to give me a script for Lyrica because he is afraid of repercussions from authorities. I will have to find another doctor. I am dependent on anything that will take this pain away and I hope I can find a doctor who will give me Lyrica again. It is not giving me a good reputation to be constantly changing doctors.",
                    "I have had Fibromyalgia for 4 years now and recently my doctor put me on Lyrica and Cymbalta. The Lyrica is a true lifesaver, it really helps with the pain. But has a lot of side effects. Cons-Feeling like a zombie, shakes, sick at my stomach, itching and blurry eyes, drowsiness. Pros-My pain is almost all gone, happy mood, and can move free with barely any pain. And I feel like I'm on cloud nine and can't wait to go to sleep. Overall, the Lyrica has really helped me a lot. I have tried the generic gabapentin and Savella. They do not work! I'm so happy that I found this website, for all the people whom have aches and pains as well as I. Thank you.",

I put on over 10 lbs in weight when I first started taking it, but with correct food choices , I lost what I had put on and more. I did at first have an increased balance problem. I now take 200mgs of Lyrica 3 times a day because I have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, I take metformin 500mg twice a day and I've got neuropathy pain. I have no side effects with Lyrica now.The other pain meds I am on is a 500mg Fentanyl patch and Arcoxia and Quinine for leg cramps. I live in the UK and get my pain medication free .",

I am very active in trying to keep the fibromyalgia pain as controlled as possible and just not been able to get to a plateau of any type. After a rough adjustment period of about 5 wks I noticed a drastic change in fibro pain. I have gained a significant amount of weight but over the last three months have been able to maintain. Now I am able to start losing the weight but have to be very careful to not take in complex carbohydrates or sugars in afternoon or evening. I have gone to an almost vegetarian style diet and have noticed that the weight just starts to come off with ease but slowly. My balance and vision are the only consistent side effects that I have.",

I'm taking 2 @ 100 mg a day and from the first day it was like flicking a light switch on my pain, which is severe pain do to lower spine accident and also developed fibromyalgia. I just want to thank all doctors that prescribe this medication because it is a life saver.",
                    "I have been on Lyrica for 3 years. It has really helped with my pain (dulls it). However, I am now wanting to switch to Neurontin because Lyrica has caused me to gain over 40lbs. I also have had to raise the dose to 150mg 3 x daily. It really helped with the insomnia that I had suffered with for 10 years. If Lyrica did not have the side effect of weight gain, I would stay on it. Would I recommend this drug, yes I would.",

I researched ways to counteract the negative effects, and started taking a B6 supplement (for weight gain) and an herbal diuretic (for the bloat). I no longer feel bloated, and the headaches are gone. I'm on my 4th (or 5th?) week of lyrica, and am feeling much better. I don't think I'm still gaining weight, but it's too soon to tell. I wasn't eating any more or less than usual, so if the B6 helps, that would be nice.",

                    "I started Lyrica for chronic pain, but realized it was SO great for anxiety - worries disappeared, ruminating thoughts just didn't matter anymore, it was like my troubles were over because none of them mattered anymore (things I should have cared about tho, too). I had been taking 2mg valium everyday for 4 years and was able to taper VERY quickly because of lyrica. Pregabalin helps as a precursor to anxiety; it stops it before it can start, hence the 'PRE'-gabalin. It works on the gaba receptors which are responsible for anxiety. I take 150mg every 8 hours like another reviewer talked about, as I discovered that this was the golden ticket for keeping anxiety away. In Europe, the suggested dose for anxiety is between 400mg-MAX 600mg.",

It began each morning with a small 'knot' in my stomach and then spread during the day causing tightness if chest, throat and often tension down my arms. It was stupid because there seemed to be no trigger, I just felt tension and worry all day. I was placed on a number of drugs, nothing worked. Busiprone helped but I remained anxious for no valid reason. About 18 months ago my doctor gave me Lyrica to try. Within a couple of days everything returned to normal I was even a bit euphoric but that subsided in a week or so. I started out taking Lyrica 50mg twice a day along with 20mg Busiprone twice a day. I have had to increase dosage over time and now take 200mg a day along with 40mg Busiprone.",

Now we are working our way up to doing the same thing for the second dose in the morning. I must admit I am glad she is doing it this way. The first weekend after I started taking it was the first weekend I actually wanted to do something, like move when I did not have to. I've adjusted slowly to the drowsiness and confusion to where it is not nearly as bad as when I first started taking it. There has been weight gain but I am slowly getting to the point of wanting to get back into that gym. Thank you Lyrica.",

                    "I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia when I was 14 and I have taken a myriad of medications to help with the pain. Lyrica although it does help with the pain, the side effects are just too much for me. I have been on it for over 2 years now and the water retention and weight gain is great. I weened down and stopped taking it a week ago and have already lost 10 lbs and the edema in my legs is gone. If I could take the Lyrica without the weight gain and water retention I would in a heart beat. Hopefully something else will work well for me.",
                    "I have been using Pregabalin for about 6 weeks and I have found it highly effective with my anxiety. I have had very little side effects. I have found that as my anxiety is worry,overthinking and my mind constantly racing. It has slowed down my rate of thinking and worrying, whilst I am aware they are there I find I am able to process them easier and thoughts become less irrational. Coupled with some CBT therapy I find this medication highly effective. The only thing to be wary of is on higher doses (I'm on 75mg) they can have a drunk feeling effect and so I asked my Dr to prescribe me with a lower dosage for daytime (incase of driving or working etc) so I take 25mg in the day and the 75mg at night and find this works for me.",
                    "I was on Lyrica for 5 months. It seemed to help with the pain somewhat for a while, but didn't stop it. Also, I GAINED 40 POUNDS. The doctor told me if I was careful about my eating habits that I wouldn't gain too much weight, but this was not true. After I went off it, I lost 22 pounds in 2 weeks - just from water weight. I have yet to be able to lose the rest of the weight.",
                    "This medication gave me relief but then the major effects came. In my 7th year severe headache every day, retina tore from blood vessels bursting, rash started on ankle spread all the way up my right leg. Finally I decided to find some other way to handle this terrible pain.",
                    "It's like a miracle. I've had almost no side effects and significant pain relief and much better sleep already. I felt a bit lightheaded at first but that is decreasing, and a bit sleepy, also decreasing. It's the first time I've actually felt nearly normal in years.",
                    "People please stop using this drug NOW. Throw it in your docters face because they dont know what they gave you. This is the most damaging drug for your brain that is legal.  Search with google of you dont believe me. I took it for about a year, yes it worked for my problems the first couple but you arent aware yet what it is doing to you. It does permanent brain aging , you will be confused and have terrible memory the rest of your life and this problem becomes very clear to you when you quit. I did for 5 years now and still can't function  That is when you can quit because this drug is highly addictive and the withdrawal when you decide to quit is stuff out of nightmares. Fainting, restlesness, insomnia, drained of energy, depression",

                    "Lyrica is effective against anxiety but I have recently chosen to go off it due to side effects. The side effects are okay (not as bad as the SSRI's) but the main side effects I was concerned about were: Brain Fog (I became much dumber), forgetfulness, loss of physical sensations including less feeling during sex. All in all I would rate it better than any SSRI. ",

I've been taking it at night and experienced involuntary tremors, muscle spasms, twitching of my fingers, arms and legs.The twitching is scary! It's involuntary, I have no control of my body when this happens. My leg started twitching and it stuck straight up, waking me from a deep sleep! The twitching and tremors linger all day. Lyrica caused severe swelling in my feet,ankles and legs. It's very uncomfortable. I also experienced loss of balance, dizziness, blurred vision and ulcer sores on my tongue and in my mouth. I felt far better before taking this medicine. Needless to say I'm no longer taking it.",

He got overruled by a doctor with a brain, but doctor Weisman seems to think Lyrica does't work for the treatment of peripheral neuropathy his reasoning was because the doctor didn't put diabetic in front of peripheral neuropathy. Lyrica won't work the thing this doctors doesn't understand is that the Lyrica is treating only the peripheral neuropathy the diabetic part mean nothing except that the peripheral neuropathy is being cause by the diabetes. If this Doctor had taken just say five minutes and read a little bit more of the notes!",
                    "I just started .75 mg. Lyrica two nights ago. Helped me sleep and not annoyed by RLS or diabetic nerve annoyance (not pain). Also, have had issues with back pain and it seems to be helping after such a short time.",

Its been a month and I am still swollen and been to the worthless ER in Grants Pass, Oregon which is Asante Three Rivers Hospital where they after 5 1/2 hours diagnoised me with shortness of breath.No treatment for the convulsion the swelling from head to toe, confusion,and the list went on.I was first turned away from Asante Urgent Care saying they do not treat patients with side effects from Medications.",

I began with 50mg twice a day and had to increase to 100mg twice a day and have been on that regimen for 9 months. Occasionally I need to up my dosage for a day or two. Usually I take an extra 100mg at night. I am have been fearful that I would need to keep upping the dosage but that hasn't been the case.",

I now have burning feet. It will go away, but what kind of cure is burning feet , not less pain. Also if you get on hands it can cause problems so make sure you wash it off This OTC cream should say SEVERE BURNING FEELING POSSIBLE. I never have pain at night when I sleep. Last night I had burning feeling!THIS PRODUCT SHOULD BE BANNED!!!!!!!!!!!!",

I have bursitus in my shoulder and it is very painful particularly when I sleep wrong on my shoulder. Capsaicin is the only relief I get.  Now able to sleep through the night, yes, it burns, that's the point, it exhausts the pain receptors in the area.  Best product but you have to expect to burn, that's what it does, that's how it works.",

After, I use in very mall doses, all I can say is IT WORKS. Took pain away, and I can traverse the stairs, and walk with almost NO pain. I like this better than taking pain meds. I HIGHLY recommend this.",

I used capsaicin patches for nerve damage pain in my rib after a car accident. It worked, the more you use it the more effective it was. I am now using it on my neck (cream) my PCP told me it is one of those medications that the more you use it the more benefit you will get....and the less the burn. I am hoping the cream works as well on my neck as the patches did for my rib.",

I followed the directions on the box to remove it but I suffered for hours. My skin looked like I had sun poisoning. I almost made a trip to the ER. Today my skin is still very tender. I made a bad situation much worse. Never, ever AGAIN!",

At first i was putting on a fair bit and the burning was unbearable but found that sweating interacts so now i put a tiny bit on and now i have movement",
                    "I recommend this product if you have pain. I would like to say that this is the best of two evils, because it burns at the start when you first start to use it. It is really important to read the instructions to use it properly. But nice to relocate the pain a little. For my part, the product works very well. However, if you do not have major pain, the product will be worse for you. Anyway, a great product to measure your pain level ",
                    "Capsaicin cream works amazingly well for my sciatica. I apply on the side of my leg, foot, lower back, or wherever I have pain. So, the version 0.1% is too strong. You should buy the .025% version at  Look for Rugby Capsaicin 0.025%. There is also a product called Zostrix which you can find with .025% Also: use plastic gloves to apply. You are applying essence of hot peppers to your skin and if you transfer it to your eyes it will really burn. It stays on your skin, so after 8-12 hours I scrub the area down with a soapy washcloth. It reheats if you sweat or take a bath.  Without scrubbing it will reactivate if your skin gets wet.",

My toes and bottoms of my feet near the toes were (and still are) completely numb and I have frequent pain and burning in those areas. I bought the Capsaicin cream without a prescription at Walmart, for $10. I applied it liberally to both feet and massaged the areas well. I then put on white ankle socks so I could walk on my wood floors without leaving residue. I did not experience any bad side effects--no burning, etc. The relief from my nerve pain subsided very quickly. After about 15 minutes, I removed the socks and elevated my legs. The medication definitely provided great relief. DO wash your hands thoroughly with soap.",

Severe burning, stinging pain. Even showering to wash the medication off was painful. I had to use calamine lotion to counter the effects. Perhaps my skin is more sensitive than others out there, but I would use caution with this medication.",
                    "If I could post a picture of what this cream did to me! Picture the worst burning EVER! It took several wipes and a shower to get it off my back and it still had bad pain from middle to the tailbone area which was red. I was in SO much pain from this medicine it felt like my skin was on fire. I tried putting lidocaine spray on it and the the spray just melted onto my skin",
                    "I'm not sure it helped at all but when I woke up in the middle of the night sweating, the burning sensation it caused was intense! Very painful. An ice pack helped but I'm afraid to use again after this.",

My physician prescribed 3 kinds of tablets (tramadol, carbamazepine and paracetamol) which gave relief to some extent. Thereupon I searched \"PHN\" on internet and found capsaicin and, on this website. I asked for an additional prescription of capsaicin (0.075 %) which I now apply 4 times a day. I feel 90% back to normal and I too can say: Got my life back!",
                    "Tried it for foot pain, diabetic neuropathy, terrible results. Pain increased, had to wash it off. Wash your hands very well after use, even if you don't see the cream on your hands, some residue may still exist and if you get it in your eyes, it will really burn.",
                    "I'm 61, female, and have had arthritis in my hands, knees and feet over the past ten years. Since using capsaicin over the last two years I've found tremendous relief. It burned when I first started using it, but the burning \"wore off\" after a week, and I find it totally painless to use. I apply it in the morning as well as in the evening. I learned to NOT use my fingers to apply it. Instead, I use the topside of my thumbs, between the first and second joints from the tip of the thumb. That way, I don't accidentally get capsaicin in my eyes (especially when applying my contact lenses an hour later!). I highly recommend capsaicin and suggest sticking with it, even if at first it burns. It's well worth trying.",
                    "Worked well the first time. If you have severe burning like I had my second time, milk applied provides instant relief.",
                    "When I lay in bed with osteoarthritis pain and nerve pain...this tends to give a warming sensation to a bit burning which takes my mind off the nerve pain and after a bit (and with my pain meds) I can fall asleep. If you like hot showers in the morning it may warm up a bit while in the hot shower. I wont live without it. I only use it at bed time and when the pain is to great to fall asleep.",
                    "I was suffering due to sciatic nerve compression (not sure it is because of lumbar hernia or piriformis muscle spasm the doc did not mention) for long time. I used capsaicin patch on my lower back (applied only for 8 hours). I felt much better the next day.",

                    "This works for nerve pain, but is waaay stronger than Bengay, Tiger Balm & the sort. Honestly, this should have a more serious alert on the bottle. My dr had me start nerve de-senitizing-i think its called. I have two types of nerve pain & the pain can get real ugly. I used a brush on my hamstrings and adductors to \"densitize\". I was still just going crazy in pain, meditated-well tried. Prayed & am now suffering the consequences of putting Capzasin HP on my Scrubbed legs...maybe 30 min past the scrubbing. Honestly, this pain rivals my nerve pain-awful close anyway. Good product, but BE careful, w/kids, pets, older folks & especially people in crazy pain undertreated by a propaganda driven war on pain medicine & the Pain Drs.",
                    "I began using Capsaicin-HP for severe pain from by neck to top of my buttocks caused by fibromyalgia. I found it to decrease my pain as much or better than non-narcotic oral medications. Then I had an injury to my back which required a lumbar spinal fusion at L5-S1. Capsaicin again helped my pain incredibly. I applied everyday 2 to 4 times a day before surgery and then limited used to areas of neck and back away from incision until site healed, then resumed use over entire back. It does get very \"hot\" at times, but I learned not to focus on that and realized that was the time it seemed to be removing pain the best. I am a nurse and eventually learned to allow it to \"heat\" which typically lasts about 30 min and I got the best results.",
                    "Suffering for over 2 months with Sciatic Nerve and Hamstring pain, using Advil 400 mg per 8 hours, which just wasn't completely relieving the pain. A bottle of Absorbine (not Jr.), produced in 2000 was in the medicine cabinet and contains capsaicin, along with herbals and other ingredients. After application, the pain almost immediately was reduced from 10 to about 7 (still taking Advil).  But about the 4th application of the Absorbine described above, noticed pain subsided for a longer period. Now we are unable to locate Absorbine with like ingredients. Found a creme called Capzicin and it seems to being working satisfactorily (2 times a day), along with the 400 mg Advil (taken every 8 hrs.).",
                    "I used Trixaicin HP for Thoracic Spine Damage to the nerve root at the C5, C6 level (C6 root) causing numbness in my index finger and thumb. I used gloves and put the Trixaicin directly on the pain. That caused the Trixaicin to heat up so much it burned. Not unbearably but it did cause me to wonder if it heated up worse on the pain because that was the most painful spot.",
                    "I just found out about Capzasin today and tried it for the first time for my fibromyalgia. I have OTC .025% and while I have only been using it a few hours I am so excited to have found it. The burning sensation is mild compared to my pain and doesn't bother me in the least. I tried it on one thigh to start and make sure it didn't bother me too much. I had so much relief in the one leg I couldn't wait to use it on the other.  My only complaint is the smell. It has a strong scent of menthol. I am in most pain at night when trying to sleep so I think I will use it then. I did read that showering can be uncomfortable but also that a milk compress helps.",
                    "It does produce a burning sensation the first two weeks. After that it is a gentle warming sensation and really eases the pain in my back injury. It is absolutely worth putting up with the initial burning sensation.",
                    "I applied two doses the first day I got it, to my thumbs, about eight hours apart. Yes, it's true that it's easy to get in your eyes, nose or mouth, and it burns. Even after a shower, I could still feel it on my skin. I expected to have to reapply it each day. But here's the funny part: The pain in my hands is nowhere near as intense as it was, even two days after that initial application. Why? It's welcomed, but kinda weird.",
                    "Works best after a few doses.",
                    "I prefer the initial pain of application than the pain in my spine, hip, and legs. Be careful going out in the sun, even the day after application some residual effects will be felt. Wear latex or plastic gloves when applying and wash your hands after applying. If you touch a part of your body that has capzasin on it, be sure to rewash your hands and DO NOT touch your eyes without washing your hands!",
                    "I have had PHN for 2 years and have been in extreme pain. My Internist told me about Zostrix HP along with the warning to be careful applying it and to wash it off my hands. I started using latex gloves to administer it on my body and after 2 weeks my pain began to subside. I am now at a very manageable pain level. On a 1-10 with 10 being the highest pain I am now finally at 0.5 (point five) after 2 years of being at a pain level of 10 day and night. I use it sparingly (pea sized amount) 3-4 x a day. I highly recommend it if you had shingles and then PHN.",
                    "I have been suffering from sciatica for about 10 years now. It has gradually gotten worse. Ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and naproxin no longer help to relieve the pain in my left thigh. I have found that a generic capsaicin patch placed on my lower back relives the pain. It doesn't fully disappear but it becomes a lot more bearable (0.025%)",
                    "Used it last night for knee pain and it started burning so bad it felt like my skin was melting off! I would rather deal with the knee pain than ever use this stuff again!",
                    "Althought it does not last long, it does help with the pain. I use it on my lower back & my neck for arthritis. My lower back has developed a rash after several uses. I have left it off for several days to see if the rash goes away.",
                    "If you are anyone that loves to hit the gym hard like I do, you gotta know what muscle pain feels like. No one can really tell or know when you have went too far because you are suppose to hurt and be in pain. If you are in pain, it means that your body muscles are stretching and you are making room for more muscles to fit. Many people don't understand that when you go home then that's when the adrenaline wears off and you start to think \"I went a little too far that time\".  Since most of what I do is shoulder press, I have to say that this back patch for pain has saved me from several night where I wouldn't have been able to sleep. Absorbine Jr pain patches for back work quickly, absorb fast, and give me pain relief fast no matter what."

                    "This is an AMAZING product. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND TRYING IT. Truly a must try.",
                    "I think the use of putting perfume in the gel is really stupid. There are so many people allergic also someone like me with cancer and very sore and nauseated to spend money on this and it made me so sick I washed up 4 times and my hands and skin still smells strong. It gave me a headache and made my nausea worse. There is no need for perfume not to mention it's just an toxic unnecessary ingredient. I will never use this again and I will be sure to let everyone at clinic know.",
                    "I used Voltaren gel on some sore joints (and a tennis elbow). It worked as well as anything I have ever tried. I sometimes get killer tension headaches that first build up in the back of the neck. When I felt one coming on, I used the gel on the back of the neck and shoulders. The headache never developed. Before this experiment I would take 3 or 4 ibuprofen for one of these headaches and hope for the best. The gel is now my standard treatment for these headaches.",
                    "Amazing topical relief. I 100% recommend it.",
                    "Because of an auto accident a year ago I had a partial separation of my right sacroiliac joint. I've taken Advil, Celebrex, and Mobic along with steroid injections and received little or no pain relief. Zipsor is the only medication I've taken that has reduced the inflammation long enough for the joint to begin to heal thus giving my pain relief.",
                    "I have been on diclofenac 75mg twice a day for 5 years. The first year I took it 2 X each day. After the methotrexate began to kick in, I now only take it when needed when I get a flare up. At the most, only about once per week, sometimes less. It has made a big difference in helping me manage the pain of rheumatoid arthritis.",
                    "I use the gel and it may take a little time to work (about 30-45 minutes), but the effect is pretty good. It will take my pain from a 9 down to a 5 (that's pretty good for me).",
                    "My grandmother had Voltaren gel for her, but when my knee wouldn't bend and I began to have pain, she let me use her gel. So far, I've placed it on my right knee and the pain was almost gone. I've placed the gel on again and the pain is disappearing. I'm 19 and there is no way I should be having joint pain...the gel works great.",
                    "Have been using Pennsaid for over eight years but strictly on an as needed basis (2-3) times a week. Very effective for knees and hips (almost instant relief). Only side effect is an occasional oral off taste.",
                    "Really did the trick for my migraine with no side effects. Tastes terrible but I'll take that over a migraine any day!",
                    "Voltaren 1% gel was prescribed for my elderly (92 year old) friend for foot pain. She had a negative reaction to the first application and would not try it again. In desperation and since I have a type of neuropathy in my feet and cannot fall asleep, I applied 1/2 the dosage she was prescribed. To my surprise it allows me to fall asleep at night without the pain and discomfort in my feet. I will be seeing my doctor to get this prescribed for me! I have been looking for relief for over 5 years!",
                    "Have used off and on for three years for severe back pain/spasms as well as tendinitis of the elbow. Diclofenac (75mg) is moderately effective at best, at least for me. It's about the same as a single Ibuprofen (Advil) which is to say not useful for serious pain. Everyone's different I guess. Unfortunately my doctor refuses to prescribe anything else.",
                    "Have Full Meals with this medicine to keep your stomach safe.",
                    "I had a bad reaction to this medicine; trouble breathing, tight throat, cold hands and feet, increased pulse, strong headache, then fatigue. It was very frightening, but did go away after several hours.",
                    "I have a sprained rotator cuff. I was prescribed Voltaren for Plantar Facilities several months ago. I found no relief from the Voltaren for my feet. When I injured My shoulder, I remembered that had the Voltaren so I figured it couldn't hurt to try it. WOW!! AMAZING!! Nothing I have tried orally can even come close to the Voltaren. It is like a miracle. I have never found any medication for anything that was more effective. I guess it just works better for some injuries than others. It is , however, very short acting. But the pain relief it provides is priceless. I have arthritis in my hands, I don't find it helps with that pain. For the certain types of injury it works better than narcotic medication. Smells great Absorbs quickly.",
                    "This drug works so fast, I had my migraine gone in 15 minutes. It's fabulous!",
                    "Not sure exactly what condition I have, Doctor's have just generically named it \"Peripheral Neuropathy\" but there's more to it than that. I'm 38 now & I've battled this since I was a child. I have this intense burning ache that began as a child in my feet & has gotten worse over time. It also affects my hands. It used to just act up at bedtime, so bad at times that I had to wrap my feet in ice packs to get relief. Now it's all hours & hands/feet and I have a stiffness and severe putting edema that pops up & then disappears with no regularity. There's no explanation from Doctor's YET. I was given this cream and I rub it into my hands, wrists, feet, & lower legs. It does seem to calm things some, reduces the burn.",
                    "I'm a 58 year old woman with osteoarthritis and pain in my knees. Tried a lot of things that didn't work including other NSAIDs, shots, tramadol, but have been on this for about 2 months and it is a life saver. I am able to walk 2-3 miles a day with minimal pain, walk up and down steps, and sleep better. I haven't noticed any significant side effects -- perhaps very mild constipation. I will be deferring the knee replacements for a while thanks to this drug. I take it twice a day, 75 mg.",
                    "This works great.",
                    "Not a bad anti-inflamatory. Better if taking it with a Vicodin or Percocet.",
                    "Worked great on a muscle strain! Even helped to heal it faster. Nice mild smell. I gave it a 8/10 and not a 10/10 because it gave me side effects. Ringing in ears quite frequently as well as a very strong dizzy feeling. This began after a week of use.",
                    "I was having hand pains a friend put some on my hand,I had no pain for days,I went to my Dr.got a prescription, it works no ordor,it also helps my roto tear,I had a botched surgery, it helps that pain. Thanks to my friend and this company.",
                    "I have been taking Voltaren for the past 6 years in conjunction with omapromazin. I would not have been able to walk, sleep or enjoy life. It is only now after having two knee replacements that I no longer need to take any medication. I think Voltaren is a way to enjoy life again, without pain. But for me I am happy to have the new knee replacements.",
                    "Only took twice a day for my ankylosing spondylitis . Had little relief if any at all. Vimovo worked much better but after a couple months had horrible GI side effects.",
                    "I've had migraines for 25 plus years and it's almost impossible to get pain medication these days even at an urgent care facility. My new doctor offered me Cataflam. I received the generic Diclofenac 50 mg. and was very excited about receiving any kind of help making it through a migraine which sometimes lasts 8 days, sometimes 2 days. Anyway, I took it three times a day the first two days and sporadically for another two or three days. It worked very well much to my surprise; however, after that I experienced the stomach burn I read someone else experienced. I didn't realize what had caused the burning until I read the reviews on this med. I'm a little afraid to take it again unless I just take it one or two days next time. Try it.",
                    "Liver problems, severe stomach pain, severe constipation, memory issues, trouble sleeping, loss of appetite, nausea to name just a few. Otherwise it took my knee pain away.",
                    "I started taking Disclofenac today for severe back pain caused by shingles. Immediately I felt some relief and I'm able to take a deep breathe without it hurting. This is the only pain med that really helped.",
                    "I have taken this medicine on and off for the past few years and it has done wonders! My doctor tried a number of medications for years of back pain and nothing worked. Diclofenac worked immediately. At times I go off of it for a few months, but when pain comes back, it works immediately. Fortunately no side effects.",
                    "I had back surgery 6 months ago, three discectomies, and a rod and five screws implanted. While it is stated it is not approved for spinal use, I have found Voltaren extremely beneficial. While I still have pain in the neighborhood of an 8 out of 10, I feel that it would always be a 10 without Voltaren. Many thanks to my PA for recommending it.",
                    "Long story kinda short! My knee swelled up where I couldn't even bend it. My mom gave me a tube of her gel. It worked right away when I applied it. Great stuff. Here's the best part though. I have a bulge in my lower back. I have meloxacam but I don't take it regularly because I feel that it don't help any. So one day my back is as hurting really bad so I decided to apply the gel. Glad I did because wow! It works amazing! They should most definitely test it on the back. I know surgery will be the only thing for permanent relief but I'm only 31 and one can't afford it and two it's not guarantee it would work and could make my problem worse. Next time I go to my doctor I will be asking for my own prescription.",
                    "The first time my doctor suggested Voltaren cream. I have osteo in both knees, right ankle and my spine. After several tubes and no reduction of pain or swelling my doctor suggested Pennsaid . The difference was like day and night. Not only did it reduce the pain but the swelling in my ankle was also reduced. When I investigated both products I was shocked to find that only Pennsaid contains a delivery agent DMSO that Voltaren does not . So it seems the DMSO delivers directly into the joint while the Voltaren only stays on the skin. Bottom line I will never spend my money on anything else going forward ....Pennsaid works for me.",
                    "I love this gel. Just 10 seconds after I put it on an area with severe pain, the pain is gone completely for 2 hours. I couldn't believe it the first time I used it. I take some other strong prescription medication for knee and back pain and the medications don't do as good a job on the pain as this gel. I wish I could use it more than 4 times a day, but during my waking hours, it is a God send. Thank you, thank you, thank you! I would do a commercial for Voltaren Gel anytime, for free!",
                    "Zipsor is the ONLY med that gives me relief from intense pain in both shoulders due to widespread inflammation. This drug is absolutely amazing.",
                    "I've been taking Diclofenac 50mg once a day for many years. If I forget for any reason the pain immediately returns. I am now 60 and the arthritis in my fingers is getting worse, but as I can take up to 3 tablets a day I can just increase my dosage. I recently recommended Diclofenac to a friends 90 year old mother, she had immediate relief and was so thankful.",
                    "I use it for Osteoarthritis of the knee and shoulder arthritis from torn rotator cuffs. It has helped me alleviate the need for surgery for many years. It is very effective.",
                    "better than pain pills works the best and goes right to the pain",
                    "I had pain from shingles. Gabapentin was giving me minimal relief, I tried diclofence suggested by a friend, it gave me relief in minutes. I use the 10%, and thankful I found it worked for me.",
                    "This gel is so effective that I don't need to take ibuprofen anymore. Very soothing, quick acting, long lasting, pleasant smell that soon dissipates.",
                    "I did physical therapy, icing, resting, every technique to try to stop the pain in my knee. I have osteoarthritis as well. This medication was the only thing that worked and stopped the pain in my knee. I am so happy my doctor prescribed this drug for me.",
                    "Cataflam is a life saver but it takes about an hour after swallowing to start working. I take 2 at a 6 hr interval and can take up to six at the end of the day, but that's only for the first day of the period. ",
                    "Works for Osteoarthritis and sciatica.",
                    "I was suffering from an impingement of a nerve root exiting the left side of the T10 - T11 junction. I was prescribed Zipsor in combination with Skelaxin (muscle relaxant). The combination provided no discernible pain relief. However, I did suffer from significant stomach and intestinal pain. The stomach & intestinal pain stopped within 12 hours of discontinuing the Zipsor. Overall, not a pleasant experience.",
                    "I had tried Lidoderm and had fair to good results. I was reluctant to try the Flector because of the cost. My insurance did not cover them.  In an impulsive act due to frustration with pain, I got the script filled. Within 2 hours I noticed that the severe pain in my knee was almost gone, and I slept very well through the night. These are a miracle and work as well as or better than any systemic medicine including narcotics. They really do work. ",
                    "I had this for Broken Back, Shoulder Surgery (rotator cuff). I literally taste the medication when I apply it to my skin on my shoulder / arm area. Had a bit of gastric upset for about a half hour after using. Seemed to help relieve some of my pain though. Just wondering if you've had people report the taste on application.",
                    "My doctor prescribed Voltaren after an extremely painful IUD insertion and subsequent cramping. I've never had cramps like these before. I'd literally be curled up in the fetal position, unable to even talk. Depending on the level of pain, this either completely eradicated it or made it totally bearable, and lasted for 12 hours at a stretch. Voltaren is wonderful and I'm glad my doctor recommended it over a narcotic painkiller.",
                    "My doctor gave me samples for a pulled muscle under my right breast; glad I did not have to pay for them because they've done nothing for me!",
                    "I started taking Voltaren back in October for osteoarthritis of my knees, right hip & left hand. I also have bursitis & piriformis syndrome in my right hip as well as achilles tendonitis in the right foot. I take 75mg 2 times a day. My knees are so bad that I had to have Synvisc-One injections as well. Combined I have been able to work my 12 hr shifts as an RN. I still have pain that's about a 6-7 after working three 12's in a row, but would not be able to work at all without the Voltaren. I am looking to have my knees replaced in the near future. The only side effect I have had is stomach upset if I do not take it with food and some mild constipation. I would recommend this medicine to anyone. ",
                    "This medication has been a God send for me. After PT and a year of Aleve my shoulder was somewhat better but not great. For a different issue my physician told me to stop the Aleve and try Diclofanac Sodium. My body is very happy. No back, neck, ankle, toe, shoulder pain. My shoulder range of motion is almost 100%. For me, Diclofenac Sodium DR 50mg has been wonderful.",
                    "I need to take Cytotec (misoprostol) with it.",
                    "I have \"jumpers knee\" tendonitis. I play softball and I am a outfielder...I also workout 5 times a week. Back in my days I ran track as well...I guess it all caught up to me in my early 30's ..I couldn't lift my leg below my knee it was so painful, my sports dr prescribed Voltaren and when I used it as prescribed 4x's a day I saw a good bit of improvement...",
                    "My podiatrist gave me a sample containing 2 patches for heel spur/achiles tendon pain. I've been using the patch for 3 days and have noticed a marked improvement in the amount of pain. Based on other reviews with issues of sticking, I use veterinary wrap to hold it in place. I've since called my podiatrist asking for a full prescription based on the relief I already feel.",
                    "This medicine is pretty miraculous as far as my joints are concerned. I'm using much less than the 2gram dose - maybe 1/4 to 1/2 a gram on a joint, tops - and having at least 8 hours pain free. It seems no studies were conducted on it's use on shoulders, but it worked decently enough for mine when I pinched a nerve.  Make sure you read the possible side effects and all the potential negatives, and test on a single area with someone with you for a couple hours just to make sure you're not allergic. It's been problem-free for me, but everyone's body chemistry is different.",
                    "I'm a great fan of diclofenac. I have severe lumbar stenosis and osteoarthritis of the hips and knees, and could not function without some relief of the pain. Diclofenac does not relieve all of my pain, but it relieves 60-70 percent of it, or enough to allow me to have a life. For me it appears to be safe and effective. The only side -effect I've experienced is occasional mild constipation. I recommend it highly.",
                    "Since i got my period when I was 12 years I experience an unbearable pain that stops my life completely accompanied by vomiting and diarrhea and so many times went to hospital emergency. I may faint of pain all the ppl arround me  know what i suffer in school, university or at work Voltaren ampoule worked well so far to extent that i can give myself the injection in the butt like a boss It makes me sleepy and from the huge pain I feel dizzy head and very tired but its better than the pain for sure I wish there would be no side effects in the long run .. I'm 26 years now .",
                    "I've been on Vicodin, Percocet, etc. My body doesn't react to those. I was diagnosed with a cervical strain and was put on this. Absolutely love it for muscle pain. I have arthritis and fibromyalgia and this medicine is great. Also no side effects.",
                    "Although no medication completely rids my migraines (I get stroke like symptoms with my migraines) aura with numbness on right or left side- depending on side of pain, dizziness and off balance. It's absolutely horrible! But when I take Cambia right away it relives the killer pain! I still get my warning signs but the migraine passes much more quickly with this medication! It does tend to make me feel a little weird-my nerves feel over sensitive. But I got a migraine around 8am today took cambia! And on my way to work at 12:30pm! Miracle!",
                    "My doctor gave me 3 samples of Pennsaid while waiting on the prescription. I don't understand any of these reviews. It does absolutely nothing for me. I was in a car accident and it appears I may have partially torn a ligament in my wrist. Maybe I was misdiagnosed and this is just the wrong medication for that? My doctor told me it would help the inflammation but all the reviews I've read are claiming \"pain relief\"? Thankfully I had the samples before I was forced to spend upwards of $75.00 for this useless medication.",
                    "I started using Voltaren Gel 1% in 2015 and it really did help decrease my pain in my neck, lower back, hips, knees, ankles, elbows, and wrists. But do need to apply 4 times per day.  I have Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type III hypermobility . My ligaments and tendons are weak and has been affecting my joints, needing to have 2 neck surgeries, bunions, and wrist surgery. I switched over to the generic Diclofenac 3% gel. Let me tell you it works! Unfortunately this higher dose costs anywhere from $600.00 - $1,100.00 for a 100 Gram tube. Downside is that it's marketed for skin Actinic Keratosis.",
                    "I have rheumatoid arthritis and use Voltaren topically on my joints. This helps.",
                    "Amazing! Perfect!",
                    "After purchasing the medicine for shoulder pain I followed directions and applied 4 times a day. The second day the applied area ( upper arm and shoulder ) was turning dark. By the end of second day the arm was black swollen and painful. Emergency room visit did not provide any relief other than telling Me to discontinue use of gel. I have a artificial heart valve that requires that I take blood thinner which was discussed with the prescribing physician and had been used as prescribed. The arm continued to swell and the blackness continued down the arm with pain that became unbearable. A ambulance was summoned to take me back to the hosital emergency room personnel could not diganose the situation completely and I was admitted to the ward. Surgery was required",
                    "I did take it without food and my stomach did not like the pain like gas high in the stomach and right side pain. Given by the VA.",
                    "I started on this medication to relieve inflammation for tennis elbow. It has done a decent job on that, but it has done an amazing job in reducing pain from plantar fascitis! I've only been on it for about 3 weeks. I've noticed no side effects.",
                    "I have cervical osteoarthritis extending from C5-T1. My pain had increased to the point where I had to have two radiofrequency (RF) neurotomy procedures performed to varying degrees of success. Pain returned, so tried Percocet 5/325 2x day for a month but only provided a temporary relief until the dose would wear off. I became concerned about opiate dependency so I made the decision to stop. Started Diclofenac 75mg ('551' on one side and a fancy 'R' on the other) 1xday and had a SIGNIFICANT reduction in pain after just two days. Bloodwork shows that it does mildly elevate my liver enzymes (ALT of 60) and has slightly lowered RBC, WBC & platelets which is a common side effect. Benefits outweigh the risk at this point, so will continue.",
                    "I am an artist and a horseback rider and for the last few months have experienced a very painful case of tendinitis in my right arm. This gel works well and very quickly in my case, and with bracing and icing I have experienced a lot of relief. The nature of this pain reliever is anti inflammatory - not numbing - so I don't think you would find use for it if your pain is not of the inflammatory nature. I get spastic and tense neck muscles all the time and find heat and massages work better. So for the right purpose it is excellent stuff. I am sensitive, delicate skinned and had no allergies but I would be careful and spot test nonetheless.",
                    "I received a sample of this from my ortho hand surgeon. He said it should help while I wait for my EMG test. He wasn't lying. I have several trigger points and my right side is painful and numb due to compression from my neck and what he suspects, compression of carpal tunnel radial nerve, ulnar nerve, etc. basically everything is compressed. This patch worked wonders. Very disappointed to learn its not covered by insurance",
                    "I have arthritis is both knees from years of athletics, in my youth. I have moderate to severe pain after long standing, use or cold. The Flector Patch on my knees are perfect.

                    "I hit my toe and half my foot swollen.",
                    "This product didn't work for me. The risks did not outweigh the side effects. I used it after my colonoscopy and had to use other pain medicines as well.",
                    "Cataflam is a miracle for my period pain. I have suffered for years and wouldn't be even able to walk a few steps with the horrible pain. I've tried everything from Meftalspas to spasmoproxivonne, Brufen, Panadol, etc.. nothing works. With Cataflam in just half an hour my pain is completely gone. I take it every 8 hours in my first two days.",
                    "Occupational Health at my workplace prescribed this patch for me because I apparently strained a muscle below my patellar bone... It did nothing for me! Apparently it works for everyone else, so I may just be an oddball. It was like taking a placebo and I am not even taking other pain meds... So it's not like I have a tolerance level for pain meds... This just doesn't do anything for me. It was def. a miss. ",
                    "I was prescribed Voltaren gel for my MCP joint, which experienced remodeling of bone after my 14-year career as a deep tissue massage therapist. I am a chiropractic student, so I went the conservative route first: adjustment, ultrasound, cold laser, Alpha-stim, microcurrent probes. Finally I had a series of x-rays on campus and unfortunately, there is a large osteophyte on the volar (palm) side of the base of the 1st metacarpal, along with serious lipping of the scaphoid bone which supports it (you know this combination as the saddle joint). Voltaren helps the crippling pain of trying to unscrew a jar, open a doorknob, or hold a pen. I will however have surgery to remove the osteophyte.",
                    "The gel helps with the pain but my stomach was a little upset, I got a mild headache and I felt very drowsy and out of it. Yes I know it's the gel but I still had side effects. I only rubbed in a small amount. I can't swear by it but I think it also caused me to have several anxiety attacks which I think are related to the woozy out of it feeling. It says it makes you dizzy on the box.",
                    "I slipped a disc in my back a year ago and have been in pain ever since! After racking his brain, my doctor gave me a sample of Voltaren Gel. I didn't have high hopes, but it is WONDERFUL!  Because I have had Gastric Bypass surgery, I can not take NSAIDS which pretty much leaves me, Tylenol! I did sneak an Aleve after being in so much pain and I was so sick to my stomach. The only negative, if Im in pain and my husband isn't home, it's kind of hard to apply to my own back!!! So I think this is a WONDERFUL medication for a person who can't orally take an anti-inflammatory medication! A true life saver!",
                    "Had no relief at all from this medicine. Had high hopes that it would lessen pain in knees and hands but unfortunately it did not.",
                    "I've had chronic lower back pain for over two years (herniated disk). I can't say for sure what has relieved my pain, but ever since taking diclofenac my pain almost immediately has gone from being almost completely debilitated, to being able to function physically at the level I was at when pain started. Still have pain and not 100%, but my quality of life is back and I feel much more fluid and agile. For almost six months I could hardly get out of bed, let alone tie my shoes.",
                    "I have psoriatic arthritis with lots of foot pain. I wanted an alternative to the drugs and anti-inflammatories normally prescribed and my doctor suggested this. After reading reviews I expected this to take away the pain immediately. It didn't, but knowing that everyone is different I kept trying and I'm glad I did. Now on day three my foot pain is much better, allowing me to walk. I have had no skin reaction. The smell of the ammonia carrier can be a bit overwhelming but it dissipates quickly.",
                    "It has helped my back, but not completely eliminated pain or discomfort. The patch has greatly enhansed my quality of life, easy to use and does not cause any problems to my stomach.",
                    "Why on earth any company would add fragrance to a medicine is beyond me when so many medical facilities have gone fragrance free. Even the low level fragrance has caused nausea after a half day's use. It's either the fragrance or a reaction to the gel. Didn't make much difference in my pain level.",
                    "I fell and broke the Radial head of my elbow (have never broken anything before and I am 45 yrs old). The doctor put me on Vicodin and it did nothing for that pain, UNTIL he gave me Zipsor, I was much much better in about an hour! The only side effect was that I was a little sleepy.",
                    "I am 38 years old with 4 small kids. I've recently been diagnosed with osteoarthritis in my hips and most likely my knees. I was also having significant shoulder and heel pain. Within 2 days of starting this medication I would say I was 75% better. Now after 1 month I feel better than I have felt in years. I am amazed that 1 medication can work this well. I have not noticed any side effects.",
                    "I was prescribed Diclofenac Sodium tablets for emergency medicine regarding my Chronic Paroxsymal Hemicrania. It was ineffective at alleviating any pain. I'd feel a small reduction in pain level for about 30 minutes then it would spike back up. It caused my blood glucose to shoot up and I am non-diabetic. It also caused me a great deal of stomach cramps, burning pain below sternum, belching, heartburn and diarrhea. I had better response on Ibuprofen and that did very little.",
                    "I have been having severe back and neck pain for years and was taking ibuprofen 24 hours a day. My doctor told me that was very bad for my stomach and to use the Voltaren Gel instead and I found it to be wonderful, comfortable and it smells nice. Two days after I started using the Voltaren Gel I was so much more comfortable and now I alternate the ibuprofen 200 with the Gel and only use the Ibuprofen 200 two times a day. I can sleep a whole night. My back condition is in the muscles and and they are in spasm much of the time. Voltaren calms the spasms down and makes the pain tolerable. I am so glad to have found it.",
                    "I experienced very high levels of pain in my upper back over the course of six months, with hand tremors and trouble swallowing. Muscle and joint pain followed. Tests for many conditions are negative, including rheumatoid arthritis, but we are still looking. Diclofenac was prescribed, and over the course of two weeks, the pain faded. I felt like a human being. I did not experience negative side effects. On the contrary, I did not suffer any of my standard migraines. Unfortunately, after 8 months, the VA hospital changed vendors and the new brand of Diclofenac was not effective. In the week following the change, I suffered all previous symptoms along with a migraine and upsurge in depression symptoms. Very frustrating. Still trying to sort it out.",
                    "Unbelievable. I just used this for the first time and had relief in about 15 minutes. 13 years of pain shots 12 doctors, 2 surgeries and I put on this gel and feel so much better. For me, it is a miracle.",

                    "I began seeing my doctor for neck problems, I cannot take oral NSAID'S due to Crohns disease so my doctor suggested to try them as an alternative. I had every test run from an Ortho and Neurologist with no reasoning for my neck problems other than Fibro. Sometime the back of my neck swells around two nerves on both sides that go into my arms and head, I've tried every narcotic there is but nothing but a Flector patch helps. Recently I had a very extensive knee surgery with an 8-12 month recovery time and once the incision healed I was given the okay to use these, they helped tremendously. I now have an injury while recovering and they are my life saver once again. They are very expensive but worth every penny.",

                    "My mom was given this medicine by her 'pain doctor' for chronic pain in her ankle, hip and knees. She said it didn't do anything for her. I suffer from stiff shoulders and neck pain, caused by sitting at a computer all day, carrying a heavy laptop and purse. I used it on my neck and shoulders since it was an anti-inflammatory. It worked for me, I noticed a significant 'loosening' of my 'tight' shoulder muscles with just one application. I'm sold! I'm gonna get mom to give it another go!",

                    "My Rheumatologist prescribed the Voltaren Gel to use with my oral Meloxicam and the combination is tremendous. I am having very little pain for the first time in 3 years in my knees and feet. On a recent business trip to Germany I purchased 4 large tubes of a higher strength (over the counter in Germany and Switzerland) for 1/3 the price of my copay. A very effective drug for me.",
                    "I suffer from cluster headaches and they are no fun. Had one this morning and took 10 mg Percocet. It did not take it away. I was a little skeptical about a Cambia pack I got from doctor, but after 3 hours and no relief I took it and within 30 minutes it was gone. Been suffering from these for 18 years and will keep some this on hand just in case.",

                    "I think it's probably a good product but not the right medicine for my condition. I have very inflamed painful bursitis under my scapula that throws all my muscles in my back/neck out of whack and creates a lot of transferred pain and problems for me. I was hoping this Voltaren gel my rheumatologist prescribed would help since the Celebrex and muscle relaxers alone are not doing the trick. But I do not detect any difference when I use it. However, I do occasionally get soreness in my left knee and when I tried it on that, it did seem to help.",
                    "I have been dealing with extreme pain in my hip and groin area. I took one pill but never again. I first experienced drowsiness, which isn't anything to worry about until I started to not feel right in my head. Lasted for about 20 minutes. Then as I was standing in the kitchen making dinner I developed extreme nausea for about 5 minutes. This led to a rush shooting straight to my head and on came a dizzy spell that lasted for about 20 seconds. Followed by a partial black out for a split second, vision came back and I went to sit down moments later I was perfectly ok. Well besides feeling freaked out of course. I would never recommend this medicine to anyone.",

I had also developed plantar fasciitis in the opposite foot from hobbing and it immediately was gone also! I can tell after 12 hours when it is wearing off because the pain starts to return.",
                    "I was in a car accident in December of 07' and have had severe neck and left shoulder pain since. My pain specialist has done various treatments including Facet Joint Injections, with no long terms results. At my recent visit with him I was complaining of the same pain with no relief, he handed me two sample tubes of Voltaren Gel. I have been using it for about a week now and have had a full week without pain. This stuff really works. I have been impressed so far. Thanks Voltaren.",

I've used Lidocaine patches, pain management trigger point injections, and acupuncture. When my PA handed me 2 tubes of this gel, I didn't have much hope for it. Within minutes of applying as directed, not only was my pain gone, but so was the muscle stiffness! I urge you to try it!",

These pain patches basically feel like happiness surrounding my wrist. I still have pain but it is at a much more tolerable level. I have my life back. For me, the patches work better than pain pills. They are covered by my insurance at a higher co-pay. And, with each prescription, I have to go through this whole prior authorization wait period. Get samples from your doctor to test them out and make sure they work for you. If they do, then fight the insurance. For my wrist, I am able to cut the patches into 2 halves and makes the prescription last longer. These saved my life.",

Since I have stomach problems and am unable to take oral NSAIDs, narcotics or Ultram, I tried Lidoderm patches without success. Then I read about Voltaren gel in Arthritis Today magazine and asked my doctor for it. It has worked well and this is the only way I am able to sit without severe pain. ",
                    "Is expensive but takes the edge off. I use for L-spine DJD and combine with 300mg Neurontin for best effect.

                    "Works wonders on lower back pain but sometimes needs a narcotic pain killer or muscle relaxer for days when pain is more severe. Downside of this drug is that taking too much causes excruciating abdominal cramping and stabbing gas pains in the intestines. But it's an 8-hour pill, so pain relief usually lasts and it is not hard to space doses out since it lasts so long.",

I was prescribed Flector patches and I could not believe how much better I felt the next day. I was able to get out of bed and bend over with little to no pain. These patches are so GREAT!!!!!",
                    "This medicine really helped my back pain, but lead to a whole other problem. My stomach was damaged and I had to get a tube down my throat to check my esophagus. Now I can't take any anti-inflammatory medicines as a result. If you start getting a sore belly or heart burn. Stop taking it and ask the doctor for another type of painkiller.",

I was prescribed the patches with the caveat that \"they may not work.\" They work very well and my pain has decreased between 75-90%. If I use them as directed (1 every 12hrs) they are most effective. There are some issues with the adhesive on the edges but I've found if I warm them with my hand they stick better. True, there is very little movement of fabric over the area as with back issues. I work with a personal trainer 5 days a week so the leg gets a lot of use. Mine is an unusual use for these patches, but they are definitely worth a try.",

I should have looked further (http://www.drugs.com/cdi/voltaren-gel-gel.html). The maker (Novartis) issued a warning letter in December, noting problems. Looks like I'll still be getting my Hyalgen shot on Friday. I will follow up with my Doc(I used a free-sample) and go from there. I have liver tests every 6 months due to blood pressure medicines and the beer I drink too much of. I hope I will be able take this medicine safely: it sure does work.",

My Rheumatologist gave me a script this past week for Diclofenac Sod EC 75 mg tab 2x day. It is my miracle! Absolutely NO pain, bones, joints, skin, muscles, anywhere!

A friend turned me on to Voltaren Gel . I used it on my knees, neck, and lower back. This is as close to a miracle as I have experienced in my 50 years of arthritis producing activities. The best part is that dosing is applied directly and only to the problem areas so consequently much less ends up in your system overall than if taken orally. Win. Win.",

Then a co-worker told me about diclofenac  and how it was a wonder drug for him so I asked my doctor to let me try the drug. I have taken other anti inflamitories before but they didn't seem to help but this drug has been fantastic. I have been able to work out again and it has really reduced the amount of knee and ankle pain I get. I take two 75 mgs tablets a day and have not had any side effects and I have been taking it for about 3 months. I would recommend this drug to anyone who has arthritis pain",

After using for 2 days, the pain is diminished and movement of the forearm, grasping with the fingers, and range of motion is very near back to normal with very little pain. I work on a computer all day, typing and mousing. I apply 2 grams, 4 times a day to the elbow area. It makes working very tolerable. I would say Voltaren is a good treatment and really helps bring my arm function back to normal with no pain for tendonitis / Tennis Elbow. Aspercreme was also ok, but the Voltaren does better. Mild stretching, exercise and movement also help and are made much easier with the Voltaren.",

Since then quality of life has not been good, and the only relief from pain was Diclofenac, which settled things down in 1-2 days. Now told it was being discouraged from use, so taken off it. All the alternatives have not worked, so persuaded a new Rhumatologist to re-instate it for short while and life was good again. I had no side effects from this drug.

I have tried numerous pain medicines and although I did not have any noticeable side effects with the Zipsor, it did no more for me than taking 2 Aleves. Maybe because my pain is bone related with the addition of torn cartilage and nerve problems? Glad that it works so well for some. Anything to get off of narcotic medicines and the crutches pre-op would be nice! So, for me and my dysplasia Zipsor has not been the miracle I was hoping for.",

It also helps my very sore feet, probably plantar fasciatis.  I don't know why they did not give this to me earlier, its much more effective than oral NSAID's or even Vicodin, as this works faster, much faster.  I use it less often than recommended (up to 4 times a day), because its not needed. Once or twice a day for me relieves the pain, pronto. It also helps my wife, with her osteoarthritis pain.",

If I get up walk around for a few minutes sometimes the pain vanishes. Otherwise I apply Voltaren gel- about the size of a small grape over the sore place and the pain goes away pretty quickly. I occasionally apply Voltaren ahead of time if I know I'm going to be on my feet a lot. ",

The Voltaren Gel also helps with the bone pain I get along my temples and at the base of my skull, so I am thankful that it is a non-greasy gel instead of a cream. (These areas of pain come from a compression head injury I got as a teenager.) I have a lot of problems trying to take anything for the arthritis in oral form, and I still take Aciphex along with using the Voltaren Gel as a precaution. (This product works well with even less than the amount suggested, so a tube goes further for me; I use up about 1 1/2 tubes each month.)",

They charge hundreds of dollars for only nine powders. The actual drug of Diclofenac Potassium is cheap and you get a 30 day supply. I just crushed the pill into a powder and took with water just like the Cambia...worked just as fast and tasted better, because it had NO taste. Don't be fooled by the makers of Cambia. It is just another Epi Pen scandal story.",

What an advantage to be able to apply the gel right to the affected area, relief comes rather fast. It doesn't last as long as I would like, but when you are in pain, any relief is welcome. Used in conjunction with my other medicines it has helped me to put together a medication regime that helps me to live with this condition. If you have tried oral medicines with negative side effects, please give VOLTAREN a try. I hope you find the relief that I have.",

I was taking lortab every day, one or two, in the later part of the day to make it through. I used one inch of Votaren Gel where I have the residual arthritis and covered it and taped it. After two hours I went for a walk and was able to walk farther in the same amount of time and without as bad of a limp. This morning my foot was tender. I don't think I will use it when my foot is really sore. I have learned to back off or pay for it the next day. There is always a trade off when I try to medicate this kind of pain.",

I had 3 epidurals in the space of about 3-4 months with no relief. I swapped pain management doctors and am now on 15mg of oxycodone every 6 hours, 4mg Zanaflex every 8 hours, 500mg of Naproxen every 12 hours, 40mg Celexa once a day and 600mg of Neurontin every 8 hours just to sort of be able to function. Was given a sample of Voltaren today and used it on my hands and back. Amazing! The pain is greatly diminished. Can't wait to try more.",

Two more doses the next day but then had to discontinue due to the unacceptable side-effects: heart palpitations, hot flushes, restlessness, minor anxiety. But I must state here though for you that I can hardly tolerate Ibuprofen or any NSAID pain-killer for that matter, of late that is. Earlier, I'd tolerate medicines like sweets, but after taking Ciprofloxacin 14 months ago, and that has messed up my whole system: I've even developed a number of food intolerances as well.

I've tried 3 different prescription medications and they did nothing. The second day on this medication I started getting some relief in my back. It's not 100% gone but it really eases my pain. The unfortunate side effect with any nsaid is thin blood resulting in bruising. I have a bleeding autoimmune disorder so it's not the best combo. But I feel like as a first there's promising relief.

Last summer while gardening I developed a severe lower back rash which I assumed was somehow sweat related. This year I developed the same painful, itchy rash on my right upper back (deltoid area and shoulder) down to my lower arm. Again, I thought it was from the heat and sweat. As I was applying it yesterday, I realized it was being applied directly on top of my rash. The ONLY places I have my rash. It took me long enough!!

It burns her and she refuses to use it so she gave me a tube for my arthritis in both my knees, my hip, back and ankles. WOW! This is a dream come true. It seems to work immediately for me and putting it on right before bed allows me to sleep all night because I have slight to no pain. I wake up, use it and then my day goes by MUCH better. I'm going to try to remember to actually take it to work with me so I can apply it there. I keep forgetting. Praise God for allowing me to try this gel. I was leery at first but tried it anyway.

Couldn't sleep, constant ache from shoulder into my bicep. Rather than get a Cortisone shot yesterday, the doctor suggested I try a sample of the Flector Patch. I wore it last night and finally experienced some relief. I'd say the pain is about 75% better, and I managed to get some sleep. ",

Went to the doctor after a week of pain and not much healing taking place to make sure I didn't suffer any major ligament damage. He diagnosed the IT band issue and gave some samples of Flector Patch and as more of a comic relief, stated that \"these really shouldn't work, but actually do\". Was a little skeptical at first, but these patches do provide wonderful relief. Four patches later I am feeling much improvement in the mobility of my knee strain. Definitely worth a try.",

My doctor put me on this 2 years ago, 50mg once a day, and I honestly don't think I would survive the summer without it. One of my major problems I was getting out of bed in the morning, I couldn't even roll over the pain was so bad. So basically what I do is set my alarm 1/2 hour earlier so I can take it and let it work a little bit before I have to be up and out. I went from having to take so many days off of work to feeling so much relief. Since Physical Therapy didn't work for me, I will probably continue to take this as long as I have pain.",

I get super stiff behind my knee, and it makes it hard to even walk, or straighten my leg all the way. I take ibuprofen, I ice it...and that helps some. I woke up this morning with it being extremely stiff behind my knee. I applied Pennsaid all over the back and front of my knee. No kidding - within 5 minutes, most of that stiffness is GONE. I am in shock. And if you have knee pain, you know how debilitating it can feel. This stuff is INSANE - in a good way!! I'm so glad I have it. I literally can't believe how much it helped me.

I have not been overly impressed with either thus far. But I have noticed a little less stiffness and some range of motion. But in fairness the inflammation is no doubt very deep in both joints and would take time for the medicine to hit its target area. The Dr told me to give it time which I felt was reasonable. I find the gel to have a pleasant smell and rubs in nice and dries pretty quick. I am using the Voltaren Gel that says, diclofenac sodium topical gel 1%. Don't quote me but I believe they also make it with 2% diclofenac sodium?? With ins my cost was 42.00 for 5 tubes. Greasing both knees uses a lot",

I was at the point of taking pain relief before bed and again at around 4 a.m. With no expectations but exasperation I tried voltaren. It really has worked very much to my surprise!!! I did not expect such a good result or any result, I was just so fed up I grabbed a tube to mix up with the oral meds! It's helped my sleep in a matter of days and I'm much more comfortable.

After the physical therapy was finished I was experiencing sharp pain radiating from my shoulder to my neck. I asked my doctor at the time, a rheumatoligist, if this was arthritis now coming from the shoulder. He gave me a tube of Voltaren Gel to try and it has been wonderful.

We have had no side effects and we use it for major flare-ups as it is not intended for long term daily use. We each get a big tube, even though some might find it pricey, you don't have to use a lot it lasts a long time. The relief it provides is priceless.

I'm still broken\"  I am on a 75mg dose, and within hours I could breathe and move much better- magical stuff. Pain is still there, but more like a sore muscle at this point... not like the sharp barbed wire in my chest feeling it had been.

Pain and swelling have been reduced, but not totally gone. I'd have to say I'm happy with the result as it has enabled me to keep working, but side effects are troublesome: I get headaches close to migraine level, my vision is so blurred sometimes, I'm VERY groggy in the morning and have a hard time getting out of bed, and the ringing in my ears has gotten worse. So I can only give it a 7 out of 10.",

He found what was wrong just by my x-ray, my hip was about an inch off hitting a nerve. Now I can work again, not 100% but 4 year's suffering to being able to walk somewhat normal is great. Still need meds for pain but way less. If nothing else helps try a chiropractor. Don't wait 4 year's to go. If it don't help in a month stop going its not going to.",

Unfortunately, I found out that it is supposed to work to relieve the pain each time it is used. It certainly doesn't do this for me--I may as well be applying lotion for all the good it does me. It really does nothing at all. I'm really disappointed, as my pain management doctor just weaned me off of narcotics, so I don't have anything that helps with the pain at the moment.

I take a prescription drug for the pain and then put this cream on 4 or 5 times a day. Within minutes of applying it the pain dissipates & I'm pain free for several hours.

Even when I don't take the injection the Cambia alone brings a level 8 migraine down to a 3 which is manageable.",
                    "I was given Toradol for five days post operation (which is another wonderful medication) and Loratab to take along with it. I never had the need or desire to take the latter. But after Toradol was gone (I was able to stretch it over nine days) I still needed something else.  I began to take Naproxen over-the counter strength and the pain and stiffness gradually came back. I had Cataflam, which after 2-3 dosages, controlled the discomfort that was building up. ",

I have been on this med for 5 days now. It helped with the pain, but I don't know if I can deal with the side effects of muscle aches, irritability, weakness, fatigue,stomach issues. It is seeming like the side effects are winning. I can not continue to take this medication. I will be contacting my Dr. and giving him the details and will need to try something else, does anyone have any suggestions on a different medication?",

It is a fast acting medication, so you can apply it and get on with activities right away. The cost of the medicine is high, but if you have tried products such as aspercreme, biofreeze or joint flex. You will see that the cost and relief you get are directly related. I have and will continue to recommend this medicine to anyone who needs relief from osteoarthritis. Thanks for the help NOVARTIS.",

The scent is mild after a few minutes, and so is my pain level. After a particularly painful day I may apply twice. I don't need this every day so a tube will last me several months, at $30 each tube it does add up but since I don't need it nightly I manage the expense.",

I expected same relief with fewer side effects (s-e's)--possible s-e's turn out to be same. Have used for only 24 hours with some pain relief. But try cutting these in half and wrapping around thumb down to lower joint, surprised they stay on fairly well but they are ugly white, I can't wear out of the house. Besides, nowhere does it say they are for arthritis pain, just minor aches, sprains, strains etc. Afraid to use continually or long term due to s-e's. Terribly expensive for just an NSAID with terrible potential side-effects. (1 box with insurance $140, on retirement)",

My other sisters always need to take Caraflam. So when I couldn't bear the cramps anymore I took it, it started working about an hour later, I didn't feel painful anymore. Even though my sisters are pharmacists, they always told me that the less medicines I take, the better it would be. So I tried not to use it. It was the worst ever, I took one, it didn't work well when it reached the max of pain. I threw up and took another one. After an hour, it worked.

Gave it an 8 rating since I have only been on the drug for 1 week. Have experienced some acid reflux and sleepiness during the day. I don't know if it is because of the medicine or other problem.",

A year later I woke up one morning with a stiff neck. I thought nothing of it and went to a trampoline park where I came down with a thud on my bum. No biggie, I'm pretty resilient at 32. The next day I had excruciating pain in my upper left back, neck and shoulder. My muscle at the collar bone was cramped tight! I waited 2 weeks and there was little relief, no sleep.

Note: I don't want to over state the how effective it is but it works. Talking to my doctor about the pain. He gave me this to try. Well my 1st thought was \"just another snake oil\" But it'sfreak'in amazing, it works like magic. Why did I not recive this years ago. The Drugest gave me a stupid look.

If you are on it for any length of time (like me) then every so often you'll have to have blood work done to check your kidneys and liver to make sure they are functioning right as this medicine can cause problems with that.

The patches helped somewhat. Now I have some pain for stepping up workouts on the shoulder, and I can place the patch directly on the pain area, and it's working wonderfully. The patch has a kind of numbing feeling, and overall the feeling can be compared to what ibuprofen does in reducing inflammation. The patches can make me a little sleepy.

                    "I had been having major pain in my neck and lower back. Also awful joint pain in my elbows. The pain left so fast I forgot that I had been hurting. Worked great for me only thing negative is that it makes me sweat also I've been gaining weight. And I believe the weight gain is because of the medicine.",
                    "I've used voltaren rapid 25 and 50 by far the best joint pain medication I've ever had. I use it to ease my pain when gout attacks come on I take to 2 with milk or before I eat something. My partner also uses it only if her period pain is unbearable seems to help her cope..",
                    "The patch works well as part of a program. It and Percocet (7.5/350) work well together, 800mg ibuprofen less so. They are more effective to prevent pain for me, so don't wait for the pain to use a patch.",

                    "Personally it's the best gel I have used to warm up my back muscles, making the muscles feel like I've stretched for 15 - 20 min. Don't expect miracles. You should not be expecting this gel to completely alleviate back pain. It's not supposed to do that. It's supposed to get your muscles to a place where you can do other things more easily to attain painlessness via a combined effort. For a lot of back pain, if you use the gel in conjunction with consistent stretching (twice daily) whilst consuming the correct diet and being active enough to lower your body weight, you will be in a much better place in no time - so be encouraged! The gel really helps you do the things you need to do physically to get to that place.",

                    "This seems to help my pain, but I find the odor a deterrent to using it regularly. I am allergic to most fragrances, and this is no exception. Why do they add fragrance when it is a common issue for people with allergies?",

For the last 3 years I have reduced to 1x50D mg per day and really feel very comfortable. I found it very effective and I didn't noticed any side effects yet. I think that Voltaren helped me to keep my ankylosis under contol. Doctor told me to avoid using it for so long but the pain was coming back the next day. I don't know what problems I may face in future but my life quality is good and I am happy.",

                    "I used this for sciatic pain. The first few times it worked. Pain was reduced. Then about the 4th or 5th time I experienced a burning sensation. It was so strong that I had to wash off the medication to get relief.",

This stuff is a lifesaver. It helps me regain my joint flexibility and I can move and walk around again. Also, I am not crying out in pain. My life was horrible before Voltaren Gel. Now, I have a normal life again and can manage my symptoms.",

I have a pain in my shin that wakes me up at night, and have rubbed Voltaren on that area and it gives me 100% relief. I've also rubbed it on my jaw in an area where I have a back tooth that is inflamed. And it also relieves the pain. I am so happy with this medication...thank you Novartis.",

It also has me feeling better by giving me more energy.",

Worst episodes included my inability to pick up a coffee cup with my left hand, pain level of 7, inability to sleep on my left side etc.  After 6 months of this, I visited my G.P who x-rayed my shoulder and found arthritic changes. He gave me 2 sample tubes and told me to try it. I did with great results.",

                    "I have RSI in the wrist. I have been doing the streching exercise shown to me by my physio therapist as well as using Volt. I get No relief using it at all. Its just an expensive useless smelly cream in my experience.",
                    "I usually have REALLY bad period pain, and it was becoming a real problem to deal with, particularly at school. I tried several other medicines, like paracetemol, but they weren't very effective, even after taking 3 within a few hours of each other. I tried 1 x 50mg diclofenac tablet, and after about an hour, all my pain was gone. It's been about 4 hours now, and I'm still 100% pain-free.",

It is not like oral pain relievers with near immediate results. Patience is needed. If you're having trouble with it adhering to the skin, make sure the area is free from oils, either naturally or lotions or soap residue. I have no problems at all with them. My RA flared up in addition to my cocyx broken off, literally. The pain was so severe that oral meds weren't effective. It took several days to feel the beginning of relief, and I've improved steadily. If you've used these short term and are the impatient type, chill out and give them a chance. They do work.",

I'm now 80% better and changing the patch every 12 hours as prescribed to me. The first day (for whatever reason), I got a surge of energy when I first put on the patch. The pain subsided to about a level 3 from a level 6 after wearing it for just a few short hours.  Do not stop wearing the patch as the pain will come back quickly. I did have to supplement the pain with additional meds after I did some light home repairs (despite the the warnings) and this kept the pain level down.",
                    "Finally, my back pain is gone and with no side effects. I tried everything including OTC, PT, Yoga, etc. This worked and I only take 1 pill as needed every 3 weeks or so at most.",

I also have knees that ache and pop and shoulder and elbow issues as well as pain and spasms in my back. My doctor put me on diclofenac and my elbow shoulder and especially my hand issues respond greatly to this medication. The back and my knees not so much and use other medications to help with them.

I have taken more ibuprofen over the years, than I could ever count. A year ago I started taking Celebrex because I'd heard that for some people it's a miracle. In that year I have had total knee replacement (left knee), then two more \"revisions\" on the same knee to get rid of an infection. Just weeks ago, I came to the conclusion that Celebrex just wasn't getting the job done for my pain, and of course I did not want to take narcotics. I did a lot of research (the reviews on this site were immensely helpful) and decided to give Diclofenac a try. It has been fantastic, and I feel better than I have in years.",

Now have 3 bulging disks in neck also. 6 discs removed from back (spinal stenosis, herniated discs, scoliosis)- have 6 metal plates, two steel rods and 14 screws~in back. The surgeries did help- but still have pain, burning, & pins and needles sensation in neck, shoulders & arms. Burning pain in hips, and muscular soreness through out my back. I've been on pain meds for years and wasn't getting a lot of relief. I discussed with my MD and he ordered Voltaren Gel. I can't say enough how much relief I receive from this medicine.

I have fibromyalgia as well and never thought to use it on my joints, I'll for sure give it a go! The only downside to this product is it smells really bad.",

First sign was extreme itching and severe sweating with dizziness. If this happens go to hospital quickly and stop taking the drug. When this started Doctors can't always determine it quickly enough as in my case. Second time wasn't as severe but by the third time when my reactions started I knew. So please don't take again if you get these reactions. But I do highly recommend this drug for those able to use it.",

My pain is considerably better, but I am guessing/hoping from the procedure, not from the Zipsor. I am having terrible stomach problems, that are outweighing what I am guessing the pain relief to be. Going to discontinue as a result. If lower back pain level rises, I may go back to it and bear the stomach discomfort.",

Also, I work at a computer and drive for work a lot, it really works miracles on tight/sore shoulder and neck areas, as another poster has mentioned.. you do feel more \"loose\" after you use it.

I had a MRI and went to see a spine Dr no one could tell me why I had the pain Upon walking into a physical therapy office the receptionist told me about Voltaren gel.

This medication is for inflammation so it takes a little while for swelling to subside enough for pain relief. I use along with oxycodone and muscle relaxers and honestly think I get more relief from the patches. They are just so expensive I can only fill my prescription once my deductible is met for the year and even then I have to download a coupon. My cost for a full month is about $70. Much better than almost $600!",

I have been suffering a from a sharp, stabbing pain in my chest that shoots down my back (costochondritis) & finally decided to go in after 3 sleepless nights. I took one as soon as I got them, & let me tell you..it seriously helps! The pain hasn't fully subsided, but now it's more of a tightness than a unbearable pain.

Relief comes within 10 to 15 minutes. Maybe even less on an empty stomach. Pain, throbbing, sensitivity, all of it. Best part- I can take it at work (elementary special needs teacher) with no impairment, drowsiness, or pesky side effects whatsoever. That's a BIG deal when working with kids. I keep two packets in my wallet at all times. PS: The taste, mint and black jellybeans, was hard for me to swallow at first.

I've tried most approved treatments, including \"off label\" medications, with ranging levels of relief.  I've yet to find a preventative aka \"miracle drug\", although, botox has effectively reduced the number of my \"headache\" days.

However, my liver enzymes have spiked, my urine output is in large volumes, and my upper back has a irritable rash cascading on it. I failed the trial due to my body trying to tell me something about this and medication.",

                    "My back pain was caused by continuously lifting heavy furniture the wrong way. There was no immediate pain from doing it. But I noticed weeks later, severe back pain that affected my ability to stand for a long period of time without feeling light headed from the pain. No over the counter pain killers helped. When my doctor prescribed me this, it immediately went away. The only side effect I've experienced is feeling fatigued. Like most medications, though, my tolerance for it has built up quickly. And when I don't take it, the pain catches up on me quickly. It's difficult for me to get out of bed if I go more than a day without it. So I'd recommend doing exercises/stretches and don't just depend on it forever.",

I swear it's like not taking anything at all. At first I thought it had taken the edge off the cramps, but at 12 hours almost to the dot it wore off, so I took a second, which isn't doing anything. Will try this again next month when I can start taking it in advance of the pain, but as of right now this has been a completely useless medication.",

After having a large mass removed from my leg, the knee got worse and was swollen until I couldn't walk without a cane or walker. I went to the doctor to see if I could get a shot to help me walk and he gave me a tube of Voltaran Gel to use. I came home, put it on the knee and propped my leg up for an hour. When I was ready to get up, I dreaded it because I just knew I was going to be in horrible pain again. But, the pain was almost all gone. I couldn't believe that a simple gel could have that effect so fast but, it did! This product is worth its weight in gold! No cane for two days now!",

I used this gel for about 2 months twice daily on the lip. I must mention that there absolutely no effect of this medication on my lip. A total waste of money if you don't have insurance as it can be quite expensive without it.  Then I was prescribed all sort of other creams which was nothing but a waste of money on moisturizers. Don't feel bad to question the dermatologist as to what the cream does and whether it will cure you. The most essential treatment for single or isolated AKs is cryotherapy - liquid nitrogen spray.",

I have only had intermittent pain and it was extremely mild in comparison to before this combination.",
                    "I have suffered severe pain for 20 years following a motorcycle accident. During this time I have tried every sort of pain relief available to me, mainly narcotic drugs which I found as bad as the pain itself. Earlier this year I was prescribed Lyrica as far as pain relief goes...fantastic. After a few months (1x 75mg cap per day) I experienced total confusion and was unable to perform my daily tasks at work or at home. I was becoming agitated and experienced suicidal thoughts. Things returned to normal after a week or so of not taking Lyrica. Because it worked so well I am tempted to give it another go. It was just so good to not feel the pain anymore.",

Nothing really helped unless I was a zombie. I am allergic to a lot of medications including Tegretol and Neurontin. So when my neurologist suggested I try this medication I was VERY skeptical. I have been on this medicaton for a week now. I started on 25mg twice a day and felt some relief. I thought it was in my head. Now I am on 50mg twice a day and I can't believe the difference. I am relieved I can finally get my life back. I am a mother of 2. I did not realize how much the pain had taken over my life until now.",

I got up to 150 mgs twice a day with no positive effect. I am now down to 100 mgs twice a day. I have had no weight gain. I am on a few other meds but I still suffer daily with this awful anxiety. I am trying transcranial magnetic simulation right now and have about 3 weeks of treatments left, it hasn't helped me yet. The only thing that works for me is benzodiazepines and I become tolerant very quickly.",

After being on different narcotics that didn't work, I gave up and just lived with the aching in my arm that never stopped. My Doctor put me on Lyrica, and I swear, I started crying because I had NO pain in my arm for the first time since my accident: 5 years. Lyrica has been a God send for me. It helps both my back and my arm. When my Doctor increases the dose, the side effects go away after 2 weeks. I recommend this medicine to anybody with nerve damage.",

Underwent a laminotomy for spinal compression due to synovial cyst and facet joint disease. Have a couple herniated discs, but left alone in surgery...felt I would recover from this on its own as I have very mild degenerative disc disease.. Since taking Lyrica for only 3 days at a low dose my pain has subsided enough so I could actually leave my home to go out to dinner. Pain went from about \"10\" at its worst down to about a m \"2-3\".  I would say try it as it may work for you. Side effects are less than gabapention.",
                    "I have had fibromyalgia for as long as I can remember. The pain was so bad 6 months ago from too much stress that I wasn't sleeping which made it worse. I had to quit my job and I would just lay in bed and cry moving my heating pad all around my body. It was a nightmare. I wanted my life back. I found a doctor to do all the tests and diagnose me. I tried gabapentin first and did nothing for me and I was a zombie so we switched to Lyrica. I take 300mg a day. It's not perfect ALL the time. Some days I am back in pain. And three days before my period I'm in a lot of pain. It has also helped my anxiety and insomnia. For me, the dizziness went away after a month. And the other side effects are minimal.",
                    "I was prescribed Lyrica (pregabalin) about 6 months ago. I was so shocked by the feelings of unreality it initially caused that I quickly stopped taking it. My fibromyalgia got so bad at the end of the year, that I decided to try it again.  I take low doses, 25 mg 2x a day, sometimes a 50 mg. The effect sets in within hours. My fibromyalgia pain is almost completely gone. A late evening dose allows me to sleep longer. I do feel strange when I take it and my intellectual capacity is quite affected, but the lack of distraction by the pain and a better social interaction with increased confidence levels makes up for that. I have to make sure that authorities and decision-making bodies are aware of my reduced competence, and close friends should know of these side effects, so that they can make allowances for any out-of-character behaviour on my part i.e. my inability to repair their car stereo.",

I know the Doctors say meds arent the answer for GAD but they are for me, I have had CBT, counselling, hypnotherapy, and nothing worked. But with pre gablin I have been on holiday with no probs, was actually able to relax for the first time in 8 years. I can go into any social scene and be really calm and enjoy it. All I hope is that it lasts and I dont get used to it. All my friends and family have said how well i am and relaxed and happy I appear. And I really am.",

Everything about this drug was far worse than the problems it was supposed to address.  Do not take this toxic garbage. My Dr insisted I had to give it time to work... Any more time and I'd likely be dead or blind! Avoid like the plague and/or carefully read of myriad side effects and hope you can stop in time to avoid permanent problems from side effects. IMO this med s/b taken off the market!",

I've been on it for approximately 8 years before the side effects really started kicking in. Began as morning anxiety attacks, severe GI upset, mood swings and low to mid level depression. Tried changing the schedule from twice a day to three times a day. It helped at first but about two months later my body began anticipating new schedule and the side effects would start kicking in about an hour before next dose. Its taken me 8 months to get dosage down from 225 mg a day to 75mg a day and every step down has been sheer hell. Every step down leads to a period of depression, and it gets worse the closer you get to zero.",

I developed a problem with my kidneys, not from Lyrica, and had to decrease the dose to 300 mg twice a day. I have to say that I get little pain relief from this med but do get a feeling of well-being, or contentment. So, I call it my little happy pill. When I miss a dose, I notice I'm a bit depressed. It's not an antidepressant but it works that way for me. Thank you",

I suffer quite badly from anxiety and agitation and I can't tell you just how much this medication has helped. Even if I could just about get through the daytime without it, when I am asleep and my mind can follow any path it wishes to, it chooses to go down really bad avenues and I wake up feeling absolutely dreadful and this reached a terrible climax 8 years ago and resulted in me not eating at all and therefore losing a frightening amount of weight. However on my last pharmacy visit, I was a generic version of the drug which has not worked at all and so I am hoping my GP will put me back on Lyrica. If not, I am very fearful for the future.",
                    "I started taking Lyrica about 8 months ago. In about 3 days I had felt a significant change. It was working great for my Fibro, but I also have spinal arthritis. It did nothing for that or my sciatica. Finally I was bumped up to high dose, but do to other things in life I had to stop because of financial difficulties. I couldn't even afford copays. So I'm on gabapentin and it barely works. If I could, I would get back on Lyrica!                Thank you all for sharing your experiences!",

It relieved the aches and body spasms almost instantly. I could sleep at night, and woke up pain free and was able to live a somewhat normal life. I did however gain 40 lbs. I am now experiencing severe depression, and I feel it is the Lyrica. I ran out once and experienced the worst withdrawal symptoms. I felt like I was dying and the pain was severe. This medicine is wonderful, but getting off of it is very hard. ",

I'm constantly hungry, sleepy, dizzy and I feel like I'm drunk. I worked VERY hard to lose the weight that I gained when I was pregnant and since I've been on this medication, I've put it all back on and then some (40 lbs). It's hard to say if the pain is better or if I'm so caught up with the side effects that I don't care. I'm being weened off of it right now and being put on a different medicine. I'd rather go back to the opiates and itch like crazy.",

It has taken care of the larger muscle pains but does NOTHING for the life-sucking body ache that I have suffered with since 1978. Nor does it stop my back pain. I take hydrocodone to deal with the body ache/back pain. I have good days and bad days still, but when the day is good, very little muscle pain. Downside: I have gained a great deal of weight. Also there seems to be a great deal of fluid retention with Lyrica, a diuretic helps. ",

I still have good and bad days, but I can bear the bad days because of Lyrica. It gave me my life back. When I first took it, I did have the \"high\" feeling the side effects mention, but it was only my first two doses. Also, I HAVE to take it with food, otherwise I get extremely nauseous and dizzy. I have gained a lot of weight (about 40 lbs), but I also have CFS which has caused me to have a very sedentary lifestyle. overall, Lyrica saved my life.",

I had to start taking a water pills because of the water retention, my memory& cognitive thinking were really effected. On three separate occasions, I was sent home from work because I was so drowsy I kept falling asleep. I was staggering, slurring my speech. My supervisor thought I had been drinking. It was very embarassing. If I did not have all these side effects, I would've stayed on these meds but it was getting out of control-my weight has sky rocketed also. I'm weening off.Pain is back.",

Because when I take a pill on the night and next day get up heavy makes my anxiety mad. But started on 50. Now am on 100s 3 times a day. Can talk to people can go for hair cut can sit in the same room as people look at there face when talking to me. With out almost passing out. If I was to say if you wanted to get anxiety under control these are well worth ago. Plus I also recommend propranolol beta blockers 40mg 4 times a day They are great as well",

I did experience a huge emotional roller coaster at first and even had suicidal thoughts for the first time ever. I figured it was just the adjustment period and gave it more time. It has been about 2 months now and I just wish I could figure out if it is the Lyrica causing the fatigue. I ache too much without it to test the theory.",

My prescription medications are covered by Medicare & other insurance, but I do not believe in indiscriminately spending Medicare money. So, again, only because of the cost, I stopped. My feet went wild, burning pain, could not even have the bed covers on them at night. I got my Rx for Lyrica renewed and when it came I first took 2 caps in order to see if it would get started again. It did! I'm going to be doing a bit of research on the internet for a lower cost alternative. Gabapentin looks good at the moment, maybe on my next doc appt. I'll try it. I gave it only a 9 because of the cost, but for effectiveness I'd give it as high a number as allowed.",

After a year of being on the Lyrica it might have gone to a 7 or 8 but it caused me to put on about 40 lbs, my skin changed, and caused a lot of other side effects.

I started taking Lyrica when diagnosed, and within just a day or two I felt incredible! I didn't hurt when I woke up in the morning. I could move and do regular activities around the house without the horrible pain I had before. I did have some of the loopy/confusion/unable to focus for a short time, but that went away.

                    "I was diagnosed with Degenerative disc disease in 1999, and then in 2009 I was diagnosed with Spinal Stenosis, Neuropathy & Sciatica. I was practically crippled and couldn't walk by 2011. My Doctor decided to try me on Lyrica and I can say with 100% truth and honesty that 4 days after I started it, on just 75mgs a day, I can walk again. I am still walking now in 2013 but just in short jaunts. I'm glad this pill exists.",
                    "I was on Lyrica for a total of four days. It got rid of my pain (almost completely!) but the side effects were terrible. I got anxious, depressed, confused, blurred vision, and a general \"high\" (not a good high) feeling. I felt very dumb and had a lot of trouble articulating my thoughts. Overall a terrible drug for me. The side effects out weighed the benefits of this medication. ",
                    "I was having terrible pain with sciatica. At times I was in so much pain just walking in a shopping centre I just had to stop.  Also driving the car my leg was in so much pain I had to lift it up with my hand to ease the pain. No medication I had taken stopped the pain which was unbearable and I couldn't sleep at night, My Doctor prescribed Lyrica and at first I did not like it because it made my feet puffy however I went back on it with the prescribed dose of 150mg twice a day. Now I have to try to recall the pain because I have no sciatic pain at all with this drug.  It also had the side effect of making me a bit \"dreamy\" which I rather like but I do forget names and things I am saying which I do not like. Can't have it all though!",
                    "Had fibromyalgia for 17 years was just diagnosed, been bed bound, house bound, chronic pain. Started this 5 days ago, by 4th day feel energetic, happy, pain reduced, fatigue reduced and I'm at last sleeping! Miracles do happen. First hour after taking little dizzy, nauseous but after that... Good to go!",

                    "I had pain shooting throughout my body for a week. One day it would be in my legs, then my torso, then my arm, my throat, my ear and then shingles surfaced on my torso-right side. I took an antiviral for the shingles, and Neurontin for pain. The blisters were painful and they went away in a couple weeks but the pain remained and I took Neurontin in high doses, with Tylenol so I could sleep but my right leg hurt all the time. I couldn't walk up/down stairs on that leg, or sleep on either of side without pain and I am a side sleeper so I was miserable. A neurologist was skeptical that the cause was shingles but prescribed Lyrica and it was magic! 75 mg once a day and the pain is 95% gone, 6 months later still works.",

                    "My mother takes Lyrica for bulging disc pain - 450mg a day (150mg 3 times a day). Roughly she takes it every 6 hours. The pain relief is great, but sometimes struggles to get through those 6 hours before the next does. It has helped a lot.",
                    "Not only do I have diabetic neuropathy, I also have nerve damage on both sides from total loss of L5S1 disc. I could not live without Lyrica. Just don't miss a dose, it's not pleasant. Lyrica doesn't stop it all, but I know how much it does stop and won't ever be without it",
                    "50 mg twice a day was tolerable but didn't do much for central cord syndrome pain. 75 mg three times a day isn't helping with pain so far, makes me dizzy and puts me to sleep most of the day. I got leg spasms at night after not taking it. Walking around a little stopped the spasms. I'd like to give it a better try, but the side effects prevent me from functioning.",
                    "I started on Lyrica 6 weeks ago started on 25mg for one week, then to 50mg for one week, and then 75 mg twice a day but, but that high didn't suit me so I took a 75mg in the morning and 50mg in the evening. Currently I'm feeling spaced all the time, gaining weight each day, and kind of depressed, but my psychiatrist said that could be anxiety coming through. I have been taking Xanax also for about 6 years, before that I was tried on Lexapro and went crazy on it. Also the Xanax was a disaster long term, as they become very addictive. Well the moral of the story is I'm praying for the Lyrica to work.",
                    "I have had chronic back pain for around 5 years and didn't start receiving treatment until 2 years ago when the pain was already out of control. I got a new Auto CPAP last week as well as started taking Lyrics 75mg twice a day and I already notice a difference. So far my appetite has decreased. The first 3 days I was only taking one a day and incredibly tired having to take naps on my lunch hour. The extra sleepiness has subsided substantially even while increasing the dose. It has not been a week yet but I can feel a difference. The numbness, tingling and muscle spasms that keep me awake or start by the time I get out of bed have decreased as well as the pain. I'm looking forward and hoping it works out.",
                    "Got shingles on my scalp and face, was treated with Valtrex, Neurontin,and pain medicine. I have repeatedly had bouts of shingles for the last 15 months, resulting in PHN. I now take Lyrica, 1 at 8 am, 1 at 3pm and 3 at bedtime. This dose was gradually increased over time. Although very fatigued I am 50% better and am able to function better. The initial drowsiness subsided after a couple of months. Do still have a bit of brain fog, not sure if it's the Lyrica or lack of sleep.",
                    "The side effects were too hard to tolerate, for me to continue to take it for more than a couple of months.  Nausea, dizziness, headache, upset stomach, and a terrible skin reaction that left many scars on my entire body are in addition to the mental slowness, confusion and increased depression suffered while taking Lyrica.

                    "I had a cervical laminectomy to remove a cyst that had grown and was encroaching in on a nerve. I also had a 4mm subluxation of C7 over T1. The surgeon removed the cyst, realigned my vertebrae and used instrumentation to hold the vertebrae in place. Unfortunately, after the surgery, the most painful part was the pain in my arms. I had taken Lyrica in the past for a very short time and it caused weight gain. I kept the medication on hand because it was expensive. After 2 trips back into the ER, the surgeon wanted me to take the Lyrica. His RN said that I will know if it will work in 1 1/2 - 2 days. She was right, thank God! The pain decreased dramatically. I'll deal with the weight gain later.",
                    "I have been on Lyrica for a little over a year now. My doctor started me on it as soon as it was approved. At first, with the smaller dosage it did nothing. Now I take 225mg in the morning and another 225mg at bedtime. It has helped me sleep at night a little better but other than that, I haven't had the relief as some have described here. It's frustrating to say the least. Considering the fact that I am also on Xanax, Clonazepam, Hydrocodone, Tramadol, Trazadone and Savella. Some I only take 1 x per day, others 3 x per day and a couple 2x per day. Lyrica was added after Tramadol. I had no side effects from it and it did not interfere with the other medicines that I am on. I was losing weight easily before, but now it is a bit harder. I'm staying on it.",
                    "Didn't help with blocking pain, I did react by swelling feet and ankles! Was on lyrica for 6 days and had to go back to emergency because of swelling.",

                    "I was on Lyrica for 3 months and became suicidal for the first time in my life. I quit taking it right away and after two weeks I was happy and back to normal. It also made me skin burn all over like a sunburn. It hurt to even have my clothes touch my skin. ",
                    "I am on Lyrica in conjunction with Ultram and Cymbalta, with a little Flexeril thrown in occasionally. I take 150 mg of Lyrica in the morning and 225 mg at night. Since I have been on the higher dosages, it has definitely made a difference. I still have some really bad days of fibromyalgia pain, but those usually precede getting my period.",
                    "It took a couple of days but it did stop my restless legs.  The downside is that in the few weeks I was taking it, I put on about a stone in weight.  It's good for making you sleepy.  I now use tramadol and am trialling trazodone.",
                    "Lyrica is a great medicine. It is very expensive but highly effective for Anxiety and works totally differently to other medicines. Unlike SSRI's it gives me no sexual side effects and no feelings of apathy.  It's highly effective for anxiety. I take 300mg daily. At this dose I still have some anxiety but it is greatly reduced.  I have no serious side effects other than an increase in appetite which may lead to weight gain. Dizziness and feelings of being 'high' pass in a week. I highly recommend giving Lyrica a go. Having your life back is worth the cost.",
                    "I've suffered with widespread pain my whole life along with extreme difficulty sleeping. Took Lyrica (300mg/day) for 3 years & it worked initially to calm the aching but became less effective after a few months. It helped me get restful sleep & calmed my anxiety but I couldn't think, had very poor memory & felt very depressed (got worse overtime). When I stopped taking it I had the worst withdrawal symptoms imaginable (way worse than benzos). I literally felt worse than dying & all I could think of was when the hellish experience would stop . Took about a month to start feeling better & several months to really feel better. Doctors say that Lyrica doesn't have withdrawal (or it should be minor) but that's rubbish. Withdrawal eventually passes",

                    "I've been on 75 mg twice a day for three months which took the edge off my sciatica but did little for lower back pain. A week ago my dosage increased to 150mg twice a day and my back pain is good and sciatica is gone. Additionally my general anxiety is eased. There's no worsening of my depression symptoms (I manage depression/anxiety with efexor). Aside from mild sedation I've had a great result from lyrica so far. Hope it continues working this well! :)",
                    "Although for some reason Lyrica seemed to make my pain medications oxycontin last longer or work better, Lyrica made my legs swell up. The pain was unbearable from the swelling and in the end I had a lot of broken veins. If you're swelling up and your doctor says \"oh, you just ate too much salt this week\" get another opinion to get off Lyrica and see if the swelling doesn't stop. I wish I could take it, it really did help. Good luck to all with Fibromyalgia, it's an awful and painful disease.",
                    "I was prescribed 400mg/day of lyrica for severe peripheral neuropathy of my feet. Prior to Lyrica I was taking 60mg/day of methadone with significant relief but with plenty of room for improvement. With the addition of Lyrica to my Methadone regimen, my relief now stands at approx. 80% analgesia which is a God send considering the severity of my pain. As a welcome side benefit, significant anxiety, hot flushes and insomnia were relieved as well. For me, Lyrica has been something of a miracle drug.",
                    "Seems to help. I take 100 mg, twice a day in a combination with Lortab 10. Have not had any of the listed side effects other than, I tend to anger quicker, nothing that can't be controlled.",

Those medicines worked great, however, they do not hold up as they claim. My doctor put me on Lyrica at 300mg a day and what a difference it has made! My mobility is much better as well as my mental outlook on life. This medicine seems to do the job. I like it and recommend it.",
                    "I was diagnosed with FM 3 years ago. Tried gabapentin, Cymbalta, muscle relaxers and opiates. Doc finally had me gave me lyrica (after I had to try everything else first) ams at first, it worked. I did feel \"high\" but that slowly went away. After approx. 2 weeks of 75mg a day, I had horrible side effects..feeling depressed, like people were talking about me or didnt like me, had no memory or wasn't able to concentrate but what finally got me to stop was I had thoughts of driving my car off of a hill that i drive down daily. I may suffer from pain so intensely that I cry all the time, can't leave my home at times or feel blue because of it, but I had never thought of taking my own life. I stopped immediately despite my docs orders.",

                    "I have suffered with sciatica for years. I have done physical therapy out the wazzoo. I have had injections. Nothing helped till Lyrica. It took a little trial and error to find exactly the right dose for me, but my pain is managable without narcotics for the first time in many years.",
                    "I take 75mg 3x daily along with 20mg citalopram works wonders for my GAD finally found something that makes me feel sort of normal..no weight gain although the withdrawal from this drug is hell but if you suffer with anxiety like me its a small price to pay for happiness",
                    "I got shingles on my scalp left side forehead and eye. I was in hospital for 5 days on an IV for both antivirus and antibiotics. The doctor had said that it was the worse shingles he had seen. After the scabs had gone I was Prescribed lyrica.  I take 300mg at night and 25mg in the morning. It has been 5 weeks since I developed shingles and my face and scalp are still numb. I have intermittent pain shocks. I believe the lyrica is effective as I can't imagine what it would be like if I didn't take it. I'm not sure how long I am suppose to take this but I imagine by other feedbacks that it could be months.",
                    "I had shingles for two and a half weeks, then experienced severe nerve pain after the sores began to heal. My doctor originally prescribed Vicodin, then switched me to Lyrica in anticipation of my return to work. Lyrica was very effective at reducing the severity of the pain, but it caused me to be very drowsy. I slept for 14 hours a night, and had difficulty concentrating during the day. I would also have trouble remembering things I had done while taking Lyrica. I had to discontinue using it.",
                    "I have nerve damage in my arms,'can't use them without fatigue. I have tried everything for the pain, nothing works well. Except for lyrica. I take 150mg twice a day and now the pain is so manageable that I get my life back. If you have really bad nerve pain that makes you feel depressed and debilitated give the medication a go! I have had a few side effects like memory fog but the pain relief is worth it!",
                    "I just started Lyrica four days ago 50 mg twice a day. The first time I took it it helped me within an hour. I have suffered on and off for years and a few months ago I was bed/couch ridden and found it impossible to even leave my house. My family has told me I am a completely different person since starting it. I feel alive again. I also used to take Xanax for years for social and general anxiety and I have found that it is helping with that also. Only side effect was feeling high the first two doses but now I just feel like a normal person, which is what I have always wished for. I hope it continues to work and gets better as I up my dose. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who suffers from fibromyalgia. Good luck to all.",

One day I pushed myself too hard at work, and I got to what I call \"final stage\". Half hour after getting a shot of Dilodid in the ER I was still crying and writhing. Doctor came in and sat down looking worried. \"There's probably nothing more you can do for me.\" I said \"No, there's not.\" She sent me home with maximum doses of every painkiller on the planet-nothing got rid of the deep burning aching pain. It hurt to stand, sit, walk, lie down. I laid in bed for days not knowing what to do. I tried Lyrica. That pain has been gone ever since. I got my life back.",

Over my near on 20 years of suffering and it really has impacted on my life and those I love. After years of being a long term sufferer I know there are triggers but I've never been able to control the symptoms that over took me even though I've tried to fight it and fight hard. I'm pleased to say that pregablin has really helped me, not with depression but definitely with anxiety! I had a bad experience which left me unable to breathe stand for 3 days until I went to hospital I was prescribed these meds and I was functioning again!",

I also take Neurontin with Lyrica and this combination does a pretty decent job of helping with my pain. I have tried Cymbalta and had a horrible 3 days of dizziness that almost caused me to hit a parked car. I was trying to suck it up and go to work but ended up on the couch the entire time because every time I sat up the world spun and I felt so disoriented and off balance like I had been drinking.

In the hospital they started giving me Lyrical 75mg 3 times per day that just took the edge off. Then I went to the pain Dr it was increased to 150mg 3 times a day and I had such relief to the point I could touch my skin, it has worked so great that when it is time for my next dose I begin to feel the pins and needles severe and the fire on my shoulders and hands. Amazingly it takes away that feeling as long as I take it every 6 hers. The problem I have had is weight gain",

I also notice that if I'm stressed the medication seems to not work as well so I don't know if I need the dosage increased, but there is a major difference in how much pain I feel. I do not like the side effects, but which would I rather have - sharp pains or side effects? For me they're headaches, drowsiness, dizziness, fatigue, odd stomach upsets initially after taking the medication, unfocused attention, euphoria, and that \"high\" feeling.

I couldn't wear my shoe and I was very depressed by the pain - I couldn't walk barely without pain. My surgeon put me on Lyrica and within a week, almost all of the burning disappeared. I get a random \"shock\" in my toes, a spasm in my arch and part of my foot is still numb, but I can function again. The pain is manageable and minor. I'm told it will heal but will take months.

Now I'm back to work full time which i'd never thought i'd be able to do again. Doing more than simple tasks is a joy, and being able to play with my grand kids is more enjoyable than I can say. I do have to say I have to take pain medicines and muscle relaxers and had a pain pump placed inside my stomach, but with everything I'm almost back to normal.

I thought something was wrong bc I've never felt this way! It's been 4 months and I take 100mg 3x day. I may have had side effects in the beginning but they've gone away. I have however gained 30 pounds in 4 months. That is NOT normal. So it's come to the point that I'm gaining weight too rapidly to control and I must stop the meds. I'm very sad about this, except I'm not bc the lyrica will not allow me to be sad. So yeah. EXTREME WEIGHT GAIN. But amazing drug.",

I am very sensitive to medications and the side effects from anti-depressants cause more depression than relief. So, to try another drug was scary for me. I saw a Rheumatologist, and he dx my Arthritis called DISH in my spine. He recommended Lyrica. I finally saw my PCP MD and said let's try this drug. From the 1st pill I had almost total nerve pain relief. I am so amazed! After all these years I feel wonderful. The side effect of being \"Happy\" has been a new feeling",

But then I hit on, the idea of taking it, three times, a day, exactly every eight hours (8am, 4pm, 12am) and this completely eliminated my GAD, making me functional, but I have to be very careful to stick to the correct times to take the dose, out by an hour and my GAD returns with vengeance.",

                    "Lyrica has been incredible for my anxiety! Within just a couple days I was running errands without needing to have someone with me due to anxiety, I was doing chores which I without a second thought often delayed and I was enjoying my life and time with my children. I was prescribed pregablin for Fibromyalgia pain and I can't say I've noticed a difference with pain but its done EVERYTHING for my anxiety! I am way less irritable and moody and feel like I can actually enjoy living a happy and complete life for once without worry, fear or nervousness. I went from being a procrastinating home body to a normal feeling, confident person! My side effects have been blurred vision, sometimes a little sleepy and dizziness. Its 100% worth trying!!",
                    "I hate this medication because it hasn't helped any of my joints or nerve pain. The only positive side is it helped my IBS and I don't get stomach attacks anymore. I still have so bad joint and muscle pain all the time, I take 75 mg twice a day and nothing seems to do the trick. I hate the side effects I get a real bad headache too.",
                    "Was put on Lyrica for recurring hip pain (& lower back pain). By one month I was on 2x75mg morning & night. Greatly reduced the pain, but I felt like I was constantly forgetful & would have brain fogs constantly. Have gained just a little weight, but can't do much with my hip anyway. The one thing that has made my Dr decrease the dose back to one a night very quickly, was I became depressive. Unfortunately, would prefer to deal with the pain & find something else, than feel that way. It is effective for pain relief (I found), but unfortunately I suffered some of the bad side effects.",

Since about the third day of taking the low dose of this medication I suddenly began to be extremely tired. I was not feeling like myself at all. I had to leave work early one day and was off for the rest of the week. I also slept for about one whole day. My doctor is aware and wants me to stick with the low dose for now since I am still feeling pretty lethargic during the 3rd week. I hope that it will get better soon. ",

While an active AA member over these years I've found that I still suffered from extreme shyness and anxiety around others. Doctor gave me some samples of Lyrica for Restless Leg Syndrome and I found that it made me quite sociable, talkative and able to let go some of my inhibitions, but without the sloppiness and horrible side effects as something like alcohol. I've tried Benzos and found they just made me feel dulled out and depressed. Lyrica, used periodically (a few times a month) never fails to brighten my mood and make me feel a bit closer to people. On the downside it also makes me feel closer to food. It's very helpful for me.",

Numbing/tingling/foot drop /balance issues all standard with MS. 75 Mg per day and already noticed difference...I can move my toes! Pain is reduced. Gabapentin did not help, baclofen or flexeril same. So far lyrica is doing the trick for me. Dr increasing Lyrica slowly each week to find the right dosage.",
                    "This used in conjunction with Cymbalta is about as good as it gets for nerve pain. In the past I was given Neurontin, Gabapentin, and many others but none were as effective. On the down side I found that the Lyrica in higher doses (150MG - 600MG) left me tired and unable to enjoy my days. I found that I received no greater pain relief taking the larger doses, just more / worse side effects. Even with Lyrica and the Cymbalta some people with extreme pain may still need to use some other type of pain relief in addition to this drug. I take 300MG of Lyrica spread over 4 doses per day and the Cymbalta, and 120MG of OxyContin and up to 40MG Oxycodone for breakthrough pain. In severe cases, a second anti-depressant may be needed in addition to The Cymbalta to help fight the depression that comes with chronic pain. The big down side to both of these name brand medicines is the cost. A months supply of Lyrica with no insurance is over $330 and the Cymbalta will set you back just over $300 each month. Even with insurance these both will end up on the top tier (My co-pay is $50.00 each) and neither of them has a generic equivalent.",

For years after surgery I have had acupuncture, chiropractic care, physical therapy and medications. I have taken methadone, morphine and oxycodone for 4 years. Now I have been taking Lyrica for a year. For the first 6-7 months it was like a wonder drug. It worked as well as anything else aside from dry mouth, weight gain and blurred vision. Now it's not working so well. An MRI showed I have many broad based disc bulges, spondyliosis, stenosis and arthritis. Now looking at a fusion surgery.

It's my 3rd day on it and I am taking 100 mg's now and in two more days will be on 150mg. So far this is amazing. I went golfing today and I had no pain in my swing. I can finally get back out in the course and have no pain in my back swing. I'm glad I have not read any negative comments about this drug. It really is a miracle.",

Have been on Lyrica for 2 years now 150g twice daily. It is the only drug so far to work for me. Only side effects are increased appetite. It gives me more energy and helps me sleep. I have lost weight on Lyrica, by been more positive and active. I ignore the increase in appetite and just drink water and it works. Pain is still there but not as bad. It is truly a miracle.",

Neurontin was effective, but only at 1800 mg./day, which left me drowsy (fell asleep anytime I wasn't moving). My MD switched me to Lyrica (75 mg), but when I got to 3 per day, I rapidly gained weight - 10 lbs. in 2 wks!  As a med student, I knew the two meds worked in a similar way and were metabolized similarly. I decreased the Lyrica to 1/ day, which stopped the weight gain, but didn't control the nerve pain, so I added back in one 300 mg. Neurontin per day (both at bedtime, to minimize drowsiness) - still not enough pain control. I added another Neurontin, and that was optimal for me. I take it all at bedtime.",

But then the skin on my finger ends split constantly and then the inside of my mouth began to peel constantly as well.  Ugh!   I had to go off of it as it simply was not helping my situation of Face Pain, however, I can see where it MAY work for diabetic or MS pain of toes and fingers.",

I spoke to my Dr., and he said he was decreasing my dose. After about 3 days, the itching got worse, so I took my self off, against my doctors wishes. I started noticing red spots and my head, arms and back wouldn't stop itching. I got Benadryl and after 20 days, the itching is still here, but not as much as when I was taking lyrica.

I experienced the typical symptoms: rash, burning pain, itching etc. After the scabs had dried I was put on Lyrica to ease the nerve pain. Have to say that it worked for me. I am a healthy 46 year old male. The side effects were some fuzziness and weight gain. This may have been due to lack of movement and also the Christmas eating but I put on 3 kilos in two weeks which is a lot for me. I am feeling that I would like to come off it so will reduce dosage and see what happens. At first I was nervous about taking this but it has notably reduced the pain to practically nothing.",

Much lower doses prescribed in Europe to limit side effects listed in some cases here. Seems to help getting to sleep and sleeping through night, wake early though with less of that anxious feeling in stomach. Take 10mg escitalopram (should be on 20 but want to limit the cocktail). Focus here is to be less dependent on benzos which seem less defective. Feeling quite spaced out and not quite myself being used to high energy and nervous (positively and negatively so) though there is a more general sense of calm which may just be such a distant feeling from the norm I had gotten used to. threads on withdrawal not that encouraging..",

Three hours after the first dose, I was dizzy, nauseous, shaky, and started having trouble with my balance. I decided to try and stick it out since I had heard such great things about the medication. By the 4th day and 4th dose, I couldn't function. I couldn't walk without holding on to something (like the couch or a wall), I was so nauseous I couldn't hold down food, my head wouldn't stop spinning, and I was suicidal!

I had a hard time getting off of the first dose. I would experience shakiness and feeling unwell. I. Am finally getting off the second dose and it is Nov, 2013.

I was in denial about fibromyagia at that time. I was lucky to remain on the study even after 90 % of the patients had to get off of it because someone got a catarac. There were people begging to get back on it. I was on it for four years and by the time the clinical trial ended, and i went through a divorce, I had weaned myself off and didnt need it again until several years later when the fibromyagia became increadably painful. it took YEARS to go through the crappy drugs the insurance co. made me go thru with adverse reactions to get back to Lyrica !",

Then I read about Lyrica, talked to my Doctor got some and stopped my flair-ups. It saved me. Lyrica cut my pain by about 40% and stopped my flair-ups by about 80%. It kind of acts like an anti-depressant for me and makes me a bit hyper-(Good thing) But kills my sex drive and I stopped it for a week, it was hard on me and pain and flair-ups came back. I built a fast resistance to Lyrica fast, I went from 100mg to now 600 mg. Gave me back my hunger and I'm gaining weight-(good thing) You have to realize nothing but hard work and Meds will cut your pain down, nothing will cut your pain 100% I know its depressing, we all just want our Doctor to put their hand on our injury and be healed.

Combined with a good sleep-initiating medicine (i.e. trazodone), pregabalin is an even better lifesaver than alone. Next, pregabalin works quite well for benzodiazepine withdrawals. Lastly, it does work well for depression and anxiety. The downside is that it will dull cognition greatly and can also greatly increase depression at certain doses. For me, the best dose for sleep isn't great for those reasons however lowering the dosage (after a break) has provided better results. Takes experimenting with dosages.",

I have PTSD, insomnia and a history of drug abuse as I was always using drugs to try and help me feel better not to get high. My problem with pregabalin started about 4 days after starting them, I done tons of research and took two 300mg the first time, too much, yeah I felt great but like I said don't want to be high just well.

I cannot say this is solely because the drug- I think I can safely say that this is because my pain has improved so drastically that I have appetite again. I can keep the weight off if I really want to, but I am not overweight and I am content with my appetite finally being back after years of struggles that I don't think it's a problem. Regardless, I have been on lyrica for almost a year now. It has drastically improved my nerve pain, joint stiffness and swelling (along with a gallon of water a day), appetite, energy, and sleep. I am not pain free but no fibromyalgia patient truly ever is pain free but my pain has gone from an average of 8-9 down to a 4-5 on my good days. My flare ups are far less frequent and I only experience them once every two or so months which is a huge improvement over every other week. The length of the flare ups is also shortened from 3-5 days down to 2 days maximum. At the beginning of taking the medicine I was slightly drowsy but nothing dangerous. I only take it once a day and I am trying to keep it that way to avoid moving up to 2 doses a day. Lyrica is my miracle drug and has definitely given me my life back. My biggest complaint is the cost and insurance but it could be worse. It costs me $2 a day to feel normal again.",

Lyrica packed on the pounds, blurred vision, constantly tired , my body aches more when I take lyrica. I use cannibis oil CBD form it helps with inflammation , it sure helps considerably better with no side effects! The cbd form does NOT get you 'stoned, high, or buzzed' it removes the pain. I am extremely grateful for my Cannibis oil, the effects last longer then lyrica tooo! I can enjoy my grandkids again!",

                    "So far Lyrica is the only medication that relieves my neuropathic and fibromyalgia pain. I have to take large dosage to be effective but it is well worth it for me. I can only take it at night because it makes me dizzy and sleepy sometimes.",

(last year) put me on Lyrica and it saved my life! I had been put on every type of pain killer and I needed a lot of them. Now I have lower doses of my pain medicines and I feel tons better! Anyone who is looking into this medication PLEASE at least try it, take it as you told to by your DR. and give it four weeks to fully work it's magic, I almost asked my DR. to take me off it, three weeks into taking it, but my wife told me to give it one more week and BOOM! she was right. It's not like anything you have ever tried! My only problem with it is it needs time to work. It's worth the wait!",
                    "I injured my back in 1991 which lead to 2 major spinal fusions . After the fusions i became depressed. Subsequently , I was put on Cymbalta 60 mg and a various array of pain medication . One year later , I was diagnosed with bowel cancer at 40 and a year after that , prostate cancer . After 11 operations I was depressed and very very sore. both in the abdomen and of course the spine . I drank and drank . It seemed like the only thing that would ameliorate the pain. Three months ago my GP started me on Lyrica . After 3 days , pain was gone, also my anxiety seemed to just hop up and walk away . Im only drinking a few beers on a saturday now. Lyrica saved my life . I dont say that flippantly .",
                    "Started on 75mg twice daily, noticed some effect, just a tease or a promise. Upped it to 150mg twice daily and yes, it definitely works to eliminate \"one level of pain\", while leaving some \"levels of pain\" still there. I do feel side effects of feeling calm while having more motivation for projects, some slight feeling of alcohol-like impairment (not so much after less than a week of 300mg/day). I also occasionally use oral cannabis and the Lyrica potentiates it quite a bit. I'm feeling very positive about this medicine, even though it doesn't get at all levels of my pain, I like what it does do for me.",

In 2012, I was involved in a serious accident, sustaining an incomplete spinal cord injury, as well as severe injuries to my lower limbs. The pain is not as bad as it was in the beginning, but I am in constant pain and, according to my pain management and spinal and lower limb reconstruction consultants, this will probably always be the case. Initially I thought if I found the right combination of medications I could stop it and so I tried all of the other drugs prescribed for neuropathy, as well as some more experimental ones. Without Lyric I spent a lot of time crying and ended up in hospital a few times because the pain was so bad.",

When I got in the shower that night to thaw my feet out they started hurting and black blisters developed. Neurontin did not help much, but the Lyrica took all pain out with no side effects other than feeling a little tired. It saved me from total misery. It is the best medicine I have ever taken.",

Extreme anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts. The worst episode ever. Dr. prescribed 150mg Lyrica. I began taking it on June 11. By noon on June 13 I felt incredibly good, invincible ,euphoric. Weird in that I just felt SO GOOD, almost too good, Then side effects hit. Bad dizziness, but still felt good mentally. Cut the dose to 100mg. Over the next 2 weeks side effects resolved themselves. No weight gain. The artificial high dissipated. What I'm left with is this...NORMAL LIFE. Lyrica gave me my life back. Pray it works for others as well as it's worked for me.",

Ultimately after being on most horrific psychotic drugs i found Valium and mirtazapine ( currently on Valium 35mg and mirtazipine 45mg) which calm me down. Anyway i was recently prescribed Pregabalin at 150mg per day running along with the above drugs, I cannot stress how much this has changed my life for the better although still in the early days for the first time in 25 years I am a different person,calmer kinder and finally in control.",

It worked wonders and first few weeks I felt great - for the first time I could speak in front of a group, I had strength to do daily chores and my anxiety pains disappeared. However, after some time I grew tolerant to it and my pains and anxiety started coming back slowly, so my dose got upped to 150mg twice a day. It works for my anxiety and pains but it makes me really sleepy now. Side effects were only at first weeks, some stomach troubles which disappeared. PS! This is a temporary solution, since you get tolerant to it. Antidepressant is still needed for anxiety.",

Finally the doctor sent me to a specialist after wearing braces from 1 1/2 years. Fibromyalgia is what the diagnosis was, I was not shocked, until she said NO CARPAL TUNNEL AT ALL. She gave me some 50 mg, Lyrica, worked wonderfully. I did not have to lay in bed for an hour or more before getting the children up for school. I got right out of bed and felt pretty good all day.

I am still tired but that will come with conditioning my body again. I have intensive physio therapy twice a year and have founf improvements after each session.

Also, coming off Lyrica gave me horrible withdrawals for almost 2 weeks. I have been off of it for about 17 days and have lost 8lbs. Lyrica is a great medicine if you don't mind gaining weight.",

I thought it will get better soon if I do not take it again. My husband took me to work where I slept the whole time.

For the last 8-9 years I have been taking 900 mg of Lyrica and 600 mg of Tegretol. Before the Lyrica I was disabled, I couldn't talk, eat. open and close my eyes, touch my face, shave, have a haircut, or have my teeth cleaned, the list is too long. Basically noting could touch or move on the right side of my face. When I tried to eat, tears will stream down my face. I am taking Lyrica since February 2002, it saved my life.",

I have all forms of Neuropathy, very painful and Lyrica has been the best so far at eliminating pain, allowing me to overcome the insomnia from the Neuropathy and opiate medication. Even at very small doses. I take 50mg once daily before bed and it works. The problem is the side effects, the worst being that after three days my eyesight is so degraded that I can not drive, I cannot read anything on the television 6 feet away, there is some eye pain and my eyes seem dry and burning. Eye problems can be serious. Wandering eye, crossed eyes and most commonly blurred vision. It also causes peripheral edema in my legs and feet.",

This drug is not side-effect free - but compared to the others out there (Including anti-depressants) it's Definitely the best option. After the initial euphoria wains it stabilizes however, so don't give up after the first effects go.",

I got a sandwich and it slipped off of my plate to the floor and I picked up and continued to eat, at least a couple of times. Every thing I ate that night tasted so good. I was so sleepy. When I got up in the morning there were things in places that should never of been. (ie: TV remote in the bathroom, food on the floor near my bed and other things misplaced. I felt like I had a hangover. NEVER AGAIN. I had the same experience with Gabapentin. Just say no!",

Now, though painful, I take long daily walks. I can only tolerate the lowest dose three times daily, maybe four times if the doctor allowed it. An increased dose made me too drowsy. I find it helpful for fibromyalgia too, but I could only choose one category. I still have too much pain.",

My narcotic usage is lowered along with lower muscle relaxants. At this point, I wouldn't do without my Lyrica.",

Doc then changed prescription to 50mg twice daily. As a painkiller it is fantastic. I've never known a painkiller like it, however one bad side effect is my swollen feet. I fear that I will have to change to something else if it continues to make my feet swell, because it is extremely uncomfortable. Another side effect is the feeling of being drunk. It does however help me to sleep. I haven't slept this well in years, though I wake up feeling groggy. I could live with all these side effects, if I could overcome the swollen feet.",

I have been able to keep the weight off by being very mindful of my hunger, or mindless eating. I am 5'10\" 185lbs. Without Lyrica I don't really get hungry. Mind is bigger than the belly when I order food. With Lyrica I find I could eat a horse, and a cow and maybe a squirl as an after dinner snack ..LOL. It makes me lose what ever normal appetite suppresent that I may have. It does wonders for my nerve pain that started 6 months ago and seems to get worse without Lyrica.",

My fibromyalgia pain is almost completely gone. A late evening dose allows me to sleep longer. I do feel strange when I take it and my intellectual capacity is quite affected, but the lack of distraction by the pain and a better social interaction with increased confidence levels makes up for that.

Needless to say, I discontinued it, and was given Lyrica....but that made me nervous as well. With my pain over a 10, and the inability to sleep, I decided to try it. I slept well, my pain is decreased some, but isn't gone. I'm only at day 3, and I'm pretty dizzy, sick to my stomach, and sleepy, but that's all so far.

In fact, she hardly recognized that shingles pain was significant. My PHN kicked in when the rash disappeared. I've still got it. I monitored the internet for PHN meds and when Lyrica came out I notified my new doc immediately. He started me out at 100 mg three times a day and when that was only modestly effective he kicked it up to 150 mg X 3. It works very nicely. However there are side effects.

I wasn't myself and my pain returned. It was a no brainer, so I informed my doctor that I wanted off of this medication.  I've been off Lyrica now for two months and my brain is back to normal. It was very scary to even think how little I was taking and what an impact it made on me.   I am taking apple cider vinegar with honey every morning, exercising a little day, even if I don't want to, and resting when my body needs it.",
                    "Lyrica was the first medication that helped with the nerve pains. It calmed down some of the burning in my toes, especially. It also gave me some hope in addition to pain relief.",
                    "I was prescribed Lyrica nine months ago and ever since I've been on this drug my quality of life has greatly increased because not only does it greatly relieve me of muscle tension and pain it greatly improves my mood and makes me feel like doing things that I normally wouldn't have the energy for.",
                    "My husband was perscribed Lyrica for neuropathic pain. He has been in pain with low back issues since 2005. He has had shots, surgeries, a stim unit inplant. The pain continues to get increase. The lyrica within three days made him completely crazy. Couldn't sleep, very emotional. Started weaning right away. He had side effects all the way to cold and flu like symtoms. This Lyica is horrible, worst medicine he has ever taken and now we're stuck for $100.00",
                    "Made my feet swell",
                    "I have been dealing with Fibromyalgia for many years and my doctor was so excited when Lyrica came out, like it was going to be the cure or something; but it did not help my FMS at all. Not to mention, I had horrific fluid retention! I couldn't wear normal shoes, my hands so swollen I couldn't get my wedding ring on. The swelling lasted for a while even after I discontinued the medication.",
                    "I've tried sertraline, amitriptyline and trazodone for depression and anxiety in the past, but none helped my anxiety as much as this. I was told I couldn't use other anxiety meds because I have low blood pressure, but I can use pregablin. It has helped tremendously. I still have panic attacks but instead of many times daily, it's the odd one here and there when something has particularly stressed me out. It doesn't take away the anxiety completely, it's still there and I have really bad days still and it doesn't help depression, but it's much more manageable than before, likewise my OCD isn't as bad either. The only side effect I experience is weird dreams, insomnia and poor memory/memory loss. I recommend!!!",
                    "Works pretty well for nerve pain and numbness. I have degenerative disc disease along with several other cervical and spinal issues. I started at higher dose that had too many side effects but when my dosage was lowered I had a lot of relief.",
                    "I had been quite a bit of pain for a little over four months. We couldn't figure out what was causing the pain in my face. My doctor figured out that I had Trigeminal Euralgea Facial Nerve Pain. So he started my on Lyrica. We started at 75mg x 2 times a day, and then had to move up to 150mg x 2 times a day. Lyrica really helps to keep the pain away. My chiropractor has said that since taking Lyrica that my back and neck can be manipulated easier than before. I love being able to feel better!",
                    "Helped TREMENDOUSLY with my pain, which is not cured of course, but at LEAST cut my daily pain in half. My old boyfriend is also on this and feels the same way as I do.",
                    "I started taking pregabalin yesterday - start at a low dose 75mg in morning, then 75mg in the evening. The effect was pretty much instant I swear.  I went from being hypersensitive, worrying, stressing and having all these horrible physical symptoms ( from the anxiety disorder I have been diagnosed with ) to being calm, having a subtle feeling of well being... my acid reflux stopped, my muscles have started to lose their tension, the tension headaches are lifting too. Side effects ? a little sleepy, but nothing too severe. I haven't listened to music for months and been able to enjoy it, but today I AM ! ... amazing ! I feel like a normal person, its like the volume has been turned down on life to a level I can manage :)",
                    "I recently stopped taking lyrica after 6 months. I was taking lyrica for nerve pain following a terrible car accident. I wish I had never started taking lyrica. It not only did not help with the pain but only made my condition worse, not to mention the 30 pounds of weight I put on. Also the horrible withdrawal's was worse than I ever could of imagined. I absolutely do not recommend ever starting lyrica",
                    "It didn't work.",
                    "I was on this drug for many years and while in the beginning I felt it helped with both the frequency of headaches and fibromyalgia associated with ME, over time it stopped working. On the flip side, it definitely had a negative effect on my memory. I VERY slowly weaned myself off of it and most of my memory has returned. My insurance only paid a small part of the cost and it is very expensive. I would not use it again. No upside and plenty of downside.",
                    "This drug changed my life with unexpected benefits. I started taking for herniated disc and a lot of nerve damage. I started feeling pain relief immediately. It made me feel very high the first week and I had to be careful how and when I would take it / 150MGs 3xs a day. The high feeling eventually, gradually dissipated  After a week, I noticed my wife smiling a lot with great caution I asked her why and she said she likes how calm and relaxed I am. I'm naturally a very high strung, intense person. I thought about what she said and noticed I actually was very relaxed and things that typically set me off they just didn't anymore. I then read about how the drug helps with anxiety. My insurance doesn't really cover it...I pay 50 for a months",
                    "For 18 months have had severe lumbar, butt and leg pain. Got spinal injections that helped some, but leg pain still was especially bad. Finally had back surgery, which helped the lower back, but not the pain in my hips and legs, which was intense. As usual, had physical therapy, massage, and finally acupuncture. Nothing worked. My doctor finally started me on Lyrica at 50 mg before bed, then 100, and finally at 200 mg before bedtime. It has reduced the pain about 70 percent. It also helps me sleep like a log, and the only side effects are some dizziness in the morning, but by around 10 AM that goes away. Great stuff!",
                    "I too progressed from Gabapentin to Lyrica, 100mg 3x a day. I have chemically-induced neuropathy from 6 months of chemo. My hands and feet are numb, tingling, like they are asleep. Lyrica is supposed to be an advanced form of the Gabapentin, though I have seen little difference. I have increased appetite and some swelling in my hands and ankles. I continue using Lyrica because I need something for the hot shooting pain. This was the last med prescribed for my neuropathy.",
                    "This is poison, destroyed my life, horrible side effects and made my pain so much worse. Detoxing is a living hell and makes coming off narcotics a walk in the park. It's horrible and should be taken off the market.",
                    "On narcotics, muscle relaxers for neuropathic pain from inoperable herniated discs, arthritis in back. Narcotics cut in half by doctor and prescribed Lyrica, 75mg once at night, then 75mg am and pm and on til taking 150mg am, pm. Nothing. Today an additional 75 mg to be added midday.  Decided to check here before taking more. Wow. I have had left hand/arm jerks where my arm just flies up, once throwing iPad mini across the room, another time scatting nuts everywhere while chopping them. I now realize this condition started with Lyric and gets worse with increased dosage. I am going to slowly stop this drug because a) it does nothing for pain, and b) what has it done to my brain?",
                    "It helps with my seizures as well as my fibromyalgia so I've always been really happy with my Lyrica. I've been on it for years now.",
                    "Had a slipped disc with sciatic pain diagnosed before new year.  Had been having heart palpitations, anxiousness, blurry vision and having suicidal thoughts. Felt could be due to the drugs I'm taking and turns out... it's all from lyrica. ",
                    "I've used Lyrica for a while now and it seems that my body is getting so used to the drug that it's not working like it first did. I take 75mg in the morning and 75mg at bedtime. I either need to increase my dose or find something else that will work. It's hard to function during my days because of the pain.",
                    "I suffer from severe peripheral neuropathy. It is unusual in the sense that it is not diabetes caused, but is apparently idiopathic and hereditary. I have excellent relief from Lyrica with few side effects. I find myself nodding out occasionally at my computer or watching TV. I exercise more, drink more coffee, and allow more time for sleep. The more I take, the greater the relief. I take 400mg per day. ",
                    "Instant joint pain gone....anxiety gone....only been 1 week...hopeful it lasts...so far it's a miracle for me..I'm also on cymbalta and klonipin",
                    "I was given this medicine from my Dr. I told her I would research it but I paid $25 and picked it up. What a waste of money, I should've researched first. After reading this I'm deathly afraid to take this drug so I won't be. Thank you for all the reviews.",
                    "I have only been diagnosed for about a year now. I have completely lost my life due to fibromyalgia pain. My doctor started me on Cymbalta, which worked for awhile but then stopped, then put me on Lyrica without weaning me off Cymbalta....WITHDRAWALS hello. Had to start again and wean off while also taking Lyrica. The Lyrica seemed to help at first too, then wham just like everything else, stopped working....EXCEPT on weight gain and brain fog. I was a zombie. So now I'm worsening day by day even though I try to stay active have cut all caffeine, etc. because my doctors just don't believe pain medicines help and say there isn't much else they can do for me. Glad for the people it has helped.",
                    "I have Fibromyalgia and developed horrific back/sciatic pain last year. I started taking lyrica about 3 months ago and within a week,I could walk properly. I could sleep, I could exercise and I thought it had fixed everything.  Then my elbow started hurting. I just thought I'd strained it at the gym. The pain became excruciating. Then it hit the other arm until 3 days ago when it got so bad, I couldn't move my arms properly. It felt like my arms were inflamed from my shoulders to my finger tips. I stopped taking it 2 days ago and the arm pain is starting to go. But the back pain is starting to come back. I also have had no idea what day it is for the last 3 weeks which I thought was stress but suspect is the lyrica.",
                    "When I first started Lyrica, my pain almost totally disappeared. After about 3 weeks, my pain started returning. My tongue started to tingle and was sore.",
                    "I was prescribed Pregabalin by my GP for anxiety disorder. I am 27 and have had anxiety since a teenager. I have never tried meds before. I have just gone up to 600mg. I have definitely experienced side effects (blurred vision/dizziness/drowsiness). The side effects do wear off but it does take some perseverance in the beginning to get to grips with it. I felt 'out of it' for a few days. I definitely feel less anxious. It's hard to tell how well it is working but I definitely have the ability to look at 'stressful' and 'anxious' situations with far more clarity. I am a designer and I always worried if taking meds would suppress my creativity but in fact - I think it helps me to have more confidence in my ideas.",
                    "I was diagnosed with adult onset Diabetes last Dec. I started on Metformin 750 and almost immediately my fasting glucose dropped to 94. That is what it has been since but I have been bothered with neuropathy for months. I tried Lyrica for 3 months and it did absolutely nothing for the pain. I am presently taking gabapentin 300 mg at bedtime and it helps slightly. The cost for the Lyrica was money out the window.",
                    "I am glad that Lyrica has helped many, just did nothing for my nerve pain and tons of side effects.",
                    "Just started Lyrica 75mg twice a day yesterday. My first dose, I felt extremely drunk, and could not function. I took my second dose at bedtime, and slept through the night, and woke up refreshed! I had no aches or pain. My 3rd dose, this morning, again feeling a little drunk, and off balance... but again, I feel good. I can actually sit still at work, without having to move around and try to be comfortable. I am going to stick with this medication, and hope that the side effects go away in a couple of days.",
                    "I had been experiencing major depressive disorder and I have an anxiety disorder. I have tried every antidepressant on earth and had suicidal ideation with each one, even after one pill! I have some nerve pain so I tried gabapentin but didn't really get any relief from it so I asked my doctor for some lyrica. The NEXT DAY I felt the depression lift and the anxiety came to a manageable level where I felt I could function well and go out in public. I recently started vaping nicotine and the anxiety is back. I am going to quit and continue to take the lyrica. When I feel really anxious I take 10 mg of valium with it and I am in heavenly bliss. No pain, no worries, just normal albeit a bit sedated but still very functional.",
                    "I had an accident in April 2016. Riding lawnmower fell on top of me in a deep ditch. It knocked me out and caused severe lumbar spinal stenosis , pinched nerves . Up until this year I was in a lot of pain due to the nerves being pinched by my spine. All this time I have seen 3 doctors, really 4, one neurologist, 2 neurosurgeons, internist. No one even suggested Lyrica for my pain...except the neurologist who did the nerve conduction study. He said it worked for restless leg syndrome which I also have. I go some Lyrica and tried it. It has brought me from 10 pain level to a 2 or 3. I get up early now like I used to, I have the will to do things on my property etc. I had lost the desire to even get out of bed, I wish I had tried Lyrica a lot sooner, it gave me my life back.",
                    "I have had FM for about 10 years. For the past 2 years I have been on Duragesic patch for pain. It intensified the fatigue. I started on Lyrica a couple of months ago and am now off of the Duragesic patch. I am getting as good or better pain control with the Lyrica alone as I was with the Duragesic patch and without the added fatigue.",
                    "I couldn't make it without my Lyrica! This medicine has absolutely changed my life. I was hurting all the time and used all my energy just to work. There was no joy in my life until I was prescribed this medicine. Now I work and feel like doing the things I enjoy, like working in my flower garden. I thank God everyday for this medication!",
                    "I have suffered from crippling anxiety GAD and depression from childhood, I also have a personality disorder..My psychiatrist prescribed pregabalin for me 75mg twice a day, they sat in my cupboard for ages before I finally built up the nerve to take them.. After many years of being tried on just about every drug out there FINALLY a drug that actually helped me!..I now drive again and sometimes leave the house alone and even on occasion brave the supermarket ALONE..After 3 years on the same dose and with its effect starting to wane I am now on 150mg twice a day..And yes I am very tired, vague and spaced out, but this will wear of with time as my body adjusts..And regarding the weight gain, I have lost 5 stone, and have regained some control.",
                    "I was prescribe Lyrica for a pinched nerve in my elbow after a dislocation. The pain made physical therapy intolerable. With just one dose of 75mg of Lyrica, I could bend my elbow without wincing. Absolutely marvelous. Unfortunately there were 2 side effects that make me stop taking it. First one was that I fell asleep almost immediately after taking it for about 2 hours and my brain felt very foggy after I woke up. Second issue was a slight tightness in the chest and feeling a little out of breath. Not severe, but enough to let me know that I couldn't take it again. Made me sad because it really worked.",
                    "Going to have to decrease dosage (50mg 2x daily) or quit Lyrica due to loss of memory & confusion & jerking. Once could top out any IQ tests but my husband says I can't even find my \"behind\" anymore. Taking it for neuropathy & came home from complete knee surgery with foot drop in leg operated on. Now the other foot has dropped half way so I am all but an invalid. No more going outside for me to enjoy our horses on our farm. The dry mouth I got with Lyrica also frightens me as afraid I will lose my teeth as others have. Lyrica also causes severe sleepiness. I guess it MIGHT have stopped the shooting pains in my feet at night?",

                    "My doctor prescribed it for me and gave me samples. I have been taking the samples while fighting with the insurance company because they want me to try Neurontin first. I think the Lyrica is really working. I am still tired, but I feel it is a normal tired from having two kids and running around with them. The way I felt before, I couldn't move. I really don't want to use the Neurontin, I don't want to lose the benefits that I have gained.",
                    "Lyrica works well on my chronic neck pain which I have had for 4 years. But I have gained about 30 pounds so am considering trying Neurontin to see if effects are the same but without the weight gain!",
                    "Lyrica the wonder medicine. After having a nerve crushed in Afghanistan, I had RSD/CRPS in my left leg. Doctors put me on Neurontin which just made me neurotic...and did not help the pain. A month after switching to Lyrica, I was able to lose the crutches, and a few weeks later the prosthetic supporting my leg. After four months, yes I still have a crushed nerve, but pain and hypersensitivity dropped to bearable levels and after six months off all medication but Motrin. Four years later... I have a resurgence of RSD due to a back injury. Lyrica had me back walking in two weeks and has continued to reduce the pain levels.",
                    "I take Lyrica for seizures and Fibromyalgia. The side effects are tremendous and I have had a hard time adjusting. True enough I have had no more seizures however, frequently, I am unable to consentrate or think with any lever of clarity.",
                    "I was on Lyrica for 2 years. At first it was fabulous! But over time I needed to keep increasing the dosage to get the same result. The side effects were bad for me. In the two years I was on it I gained 60 lbs and my hair started falling out. I have since switched to Neurontin with no side effects and my hair is slowly coming back. Lyrica was a miracle for me for about 18 months but as they say all good things must come to an end.",
                    "I would give it a 10, then a 1. At first the medicine worked GREAT but then 30 days later it just quit. After a few months I gave up on it, I occasionally retry the medicine but no luck.",
                    "Taking Lyrica hasn't helped my Fibrmyalgia symptoms at all, and even though I'm on a starter dose of 75 mg once per day the side effects are terrible! I tremble so badly it appears as if I have Parkinson's disease. I can't hand write at all and let alone many other daily functions. It has affected my thinking terribly and makes my mind race and my thoughts are very jumbled which makes me feel extremely anxious, plus when talking my speech is very shaky sounding and very fast and slurry. I also have a lot of trouble urinating. I find it extremely difficult to empty my bladder and at times very painful. I was already taking sleeping tablets ( Temazipan), but Lyrica has made getting to sleep even worse. My chest and nose both feel congested.",

I suffer from back, buttock, leg & feet pain from a 360 degree double spinal fusion of L4-L5 & L5 & S1 done 20 years ago. Nerve pain is now ruining my life. However since being on this medicine my pain is now around a 2-3 out of 10 from being anywhere between 5-9. The only real side effect I am having is feeling \"High\" 24 hrs a day. Supposedly this will go away in time. I also feel uplifted and it has helped with my depression. I do feel a bit aggressive at times too. I have been keeping a close check on my weight too but nothing has changed. My normal weight is 75 kgs and I'm fit & strong as I workout in the gym regularly which helps control back pain.",

I had previously taken Cymbalta 60mg for 7/8 years and was feeling that it was no longer as effective so my doctor prescribed Lyrica. I noticed a large amount of weight gain (which I would not have minded if helped the pain!) about 50 pounds over 6 months before it stabilized. After some time of taking the medication (9 months or a year I forget) I was always complaining to my doctor about pain and fatigue being bad so he switched me to Savella. I noticed a huge difference and I lost the weight!",
                    "Lyrica was great as a pain reliever. It is not a pain killer. The side effects were brutal - weight gain, swelling, water retention yikes. I only stayed on Lyrica a few months. I am now trying Robaxasil.",

I've been on lorazepam, alprazolam, and clonazepam and all 3 became ineffective after 6 months to 1 year and were extremely difficult to get off of. I don't notice any tolerance issues with pregabalin either. I've been on the same dose for about 2 years. Better than any of the benzodiazepines and other medications I've tried for anxiety. Only side effects I've noticed are calmness, sedation, and increased appetite but exercise and healthy eating take care of any weight gain.",

I have to do every thing from chores to running errands before I take it. Once I take I become unbalanced, forget words and become extremely tired. I sleep a lot and very heavy and usually can't remember the previous day. I definitely cannot function after I take it. I don't care for the side effects but so far has been the only thing that has worked for me. I tried cymbalta, neurton, zanaflex, flexeral lots of things. To me its worth taking the lryica as those terrible rib and back spasms keep at bay..and after two years of dealing with those I don't ever want to again. btw does kill my appetite.",

I lost those yrs of my life sleeping 17 hours a day and the pain was horrible even taking 90mg a day and 30mg of Valium. I went to Wilmington Treatment Center to stop the medicines & so they started me on the Lyrica 450mg per day. It saved my life. Without the Lyrica I was awake for 3 days crying in pain, could not lay in a bed due to the sheets touching me, my core temperature would not come up, I was freezing but everything burned my skin if it touched me. The Lyrica within 2 hours gave me hope and I started turning around for the better. My life is so much better now. My family is glad to have me back!",

Tried hydrocortisone shots in my back and the pain went away for 3-4 days. I've been on vicodin and skelaxin as well as Aleve twice a day. I've had to take my vicodin every 4 hours instead of every 6 hours because the pain has been so bad. Just in the last 48 hours, I've noticed such a difference with Lyrica. I keep waiting for the pain to be there, but it is NOT. I'm still titrating my way up on the dosage, but in another day or two, my maximum dose will be 50 mg 3 times a day. Currently, I'm taking 50 mg 2 times a day. It really works.",

The things that bothered me before no longer bother me. I am a smoker and since starting Lyrica I no longer crave cigarettes. I have had severe back pain due to arthritis and I no longer have back pain! It does however make me hyper. I can live with that, and it makes me hungry, but this stuff works really well for me.",
                    "Worked wonders at the start. Was up to 600mg a day. I don't eat the best but I do think this did make me gain weight. I live in the great white north but I struggled with balance, fell often, and also had trouble putting my thoughts into words. These side effects are now gone now that I'm off this. Balance and communication much better now that I'm off.",
                    "I recently started taking Lyrica for two herniated discs. The doctor said I have massive nerve damage that will result in surgery but suggested taking this medication temporarily until surgery because my pain was unbearable! At first I was a little off balance but within a week I wasn't constantly in pain....within a month my pain was almost gone and I refuse to do surgery now! Thanks Lyrica for making this happen!",
                    "75mg x2 daily - no noticeable effect. 150mg x2 daily - slight effect of calm, not really therapeutic. 300mg x2 daily - feeling calm, a little sleepy, but I quite like that... it is still early days, but I don't feel the need to take any valium anymore. I stopped it weeks ago. I like being in this calm fluffy state, rather than sweating and thinking 100 miles an hour and stressing out. I am taking this medication for an anxiety disorder, panic attacks and lower limbs pain and walking problems...supposedly they are all linked.",
                    "I have been on Lyrica for the past 8 months, I have fibromyalgia and pain was unbearable. It was amazing at first as I could finally sleep. Over the few months however I have had increased swelling in my joints and gained 15 lbs with no change in eating habits. I started feeling confused with memory loss, then two weeks ago I started feeling suicidal. I did not ever suffer from depression but could not get the thought of just taking a bottle of pills. Due to my experience of working with mental health I knew something was not right so I am now working at reducing Lyrica and going off of it . I think it was amazing for the pain but not worth the risk with the change in my mental state.",

I tried nuerotin years ago but after the second day I could not function, so any one with nerve pain should give this a try. .it sure has helped me",
                    "I have had long-term treatment-resistant depression with various treatment regimens resulting in partial, but never complete regression. I started taking Lyrica for some unresolved jaw pain thought to have arisen from my wisdom tooth extraction. It was like a switch had been flipped, the next morning I woke up completely refreshed; a feeling I hadn't experienced in years. I experimented on-and-off to determine whether Lyrica was indeed the reason for this change in energy and mood. Indeed, nights that I took Lyrica (75mg) I was completely refreshed and motivated the next day. This contrasted my normal routine greatly, where I would typically take high doses of vyvanse (75mg-max dose) at 5 am just to wake up. Game changer for depression.",

                    "I was prescribed this drug following back surgery. It worked very well initially for pain also providing a calming effect. Over the next 5 months it pretty much stopped working for the pain and the side effects became very worrying. I could not think straight and was dangerously clumbsy. I was is a malaise and did not wish to do anything so I decided to quit. I followed the instructions to taper over at least a week, then the real problems began. This is a horrendous drug to come off, I had to reinstate as I went out of my mind. I am now tapering at 10% as and when I can. I feel so unwell, anxiety has spiralled, depression, suicidal thoughts, insomnia, lack of appetite, sweats, the list could go on it has been a hellish period.",

I was diagnosed with bipolar II, GAD and mixed anxiety and depressive disorder, all I can say week 2 on this medication has saved my life! I'm on 75mg twice a day and can increase if I wish too, but with the way I am feeling at the moment I feel I don't need too. I can leave the house, I'm going back to work next week, and my girls have their mummy back, also suffer from damaged nerves in my lower back, it's helped so much with the pain. It's a miracle",
                    "The first night I took Lyrica I slept 9 hours. Got out of bed without any pain. This has been a lifesaver for me. I am so happy with the results. I am only on 50mg at night. Not seeing a reason to increase the dose yet.",
                    "I started taking lyrica about 4 years ago for fibromyalgia and found it lowered my daily pain by about 60%. While I do not suffer from GAD, I have always had feelings of anxiousness and physical feeling of restless uneasiness, and also restless leg syndrome. It was an unexpected side benefit that the lyrica helped control these feelings. After about a year and a half of taking 150 mg twice a day, I began to worry about addiction, and decided to cut back in an effort to possibly quit altogether. I soon found that my anxiousness and restlessness seemed worse than before, so I went back to my full 300mg per day dose, and have remained at that dosage. While on lyrica, I intentionally lost 35 lbs, and have not gained any weight back for 3 years",

After surgery I was also experiencing new pain of stabbing, electrical sensations in addition to the pain I previously had. I was prescribed Neurontin and the doctor kept raising the dose with no difference in my pain. I heard of similar experiences and being switched to Lyrica and it made a huge difference. I was in so much pain day after day. I switched to Lyrica and I have had nearly full relief of the pain I was having. I can't even describe how much this medication has helped me. If you find yourself in the same experience there is hope. Keep communicating with your surgeon and try Lyrica.",

I don't have the side effects from it that most have, and it works to control the pain, although I do have neuropathy flare ups from time to time. I'm taking it as a result of neuropathy from spinal chord injury. and my insurance pays for it so no out of pocket costs. I recommend this to people who have nerve pain.",
                    "Like many others, my pain doctor had me on gabapentin first, then after several months without relief, switched me to Lyrica. Without a generic version available, it can cost a small fortune depending on your insurance. Without any insurance, 100mg capsules 3X daily, 90 pills will cost upward of $600! With my Part D, and not qualifying for \"Extra Help\" through the state, I'm now paying $140 for a 2 week supply, $280 monthly. That's a car payment! I have no idea what to do once the free samples run out, it's a very good medication but unaffordable. If your doctor tells you gabapentin (Neurontin) works the same, chemically there's no difference, that just isn't true. It may be similar, but Lyrica works much better with significantly less mg's",

It did nothing for me except give me insomnia, make me forgetful, and increase my neuropathy pain and burning.  I already have difficulty sleeping because of neuropathy and L5 compression agony. This pill made it worse. I took 50 mg at bedtime for about a week. The doctor said it takes a while to get into the system. I'm not waiting that long.

I am awaiting more testing as still figuring out what is wrong but put on lyrica about 3 weeks ago, some relief within a few days, dose increased, more relief. The dose increased again with good effect. I do notice if I am late on a dose or miss a dose, sure pay for it, takes some time for pain to come back under control. I say as I write this at 5 am having not slept a wink. I'm currently on 150 mg twice daily. I'm gaining a belly but have not gotten on the scales, initially giddy and absent minded but that has subsided even with dosage increases. I think its a good drug choice for me. here hoping.",

This is very effective, as all other migraine prevention medication has been unsuccessful.",
                    "I was on Lyrica for 8 years at 75mg twice a day. I thought it was doing little for my pain and I didn't want to start increasing it. I had no side effects when taking it. So last year I stopped taking it as I still had a lot of nerve pain. But since I have been off it I realized just how much it actually did for me. I started suffering from crippling anxiety, my pain has gotten progressively worse and my hand tremors have returned. So after 9 months off it I am back on it again as I need a quality of life and Lyrica gives me that. It may not work for everyone but it does for me. I have fibromyalgia and General Anxiety.",

I just feel normal. My anxiety got so bad it was causing severe stomach problems, I almost had my gallbladder removed. Not only did it cure my anxiety, my stomach issues are gone, as well as my IBS that was a seperate issue, my restless legs are gone!!! GONE, RLS was torture, it stopped me from going to movies or on planes.. but that's not even the best part! My chronic leg pain which I saw many specialists about when I was young and had since given up on IS GONE! I thought I had to live in pain forever. My life is drastically improved. No words can explain",

The only side effect that MAY have been due to Lyrica is vision loss, but I have worn glasses for 30 years, so no big deal for my eyesight to slightly worsen over 2 yrs on the drug. Some of the side effects that people mention could be due to menopause rather than Lyrica. I gladly spend $60 for a monthly supply. Other meds I took previously left me like a zombie. With lyrica I actually feel good.",

For 6 years, everyday I would have to lay in the tub and the shower hit my back or lay on a heating pad and even at night just to fall asleep I use sleep aids and constant showers or heating pads to get the muscles to stop hurting and spasms and then I couldn't take it anymore. The muscle relaxers wouldn't work and my back and neck were burning and stiff and spasms all day and night and I couldn't sleep and went desperately to a my new doctor that I was seeing and got his associate.

The nerve damage got so bad, I spoke to my doctor about it and he prescribed Lyrica which took care of all the nerve damage. At first probably the first 2 months only side effect I had was a little swelling of my hands. Lyrica was a wonder miracle for me. The doctor had me on it for over 3 years with no problems, then my insurance refuses to pay for it now, because a 30 day supply is $900.00. They wanted to give me Neurontin, which I am allergic too. Now all the nerve pain is back and worse. I want the Lyrica back and would recommend it to any one.",
                    "I've had problems with my feet burning for several years. Every year it was worse than the year before. It got to the point that I couldn't stand anything on my feet. Lyrica helped a lot, with much less frequency and severity of burning. Finally some relief. Unfortunately, I had to discontinue because of side effects. I had almost all side effects listed in the info sheet. Most I could have tolerated, but the ones I couldn't was weight gain, confusion, and fast progressing blurred vision. Also, I had severe clinical depression over 18 years ago until I received the correct antidepressant. I've had no depression since. However, the Lyrica caused it to return, although not as severe. It also caused anger flareups, very unlike me.",

Discontinued after 60 days and nearly 20lbs. Depression lightened, however the weight has been hard to lose having so much pain from the Fibro. Baclofen has been one medicine that has \"helped\" with minimal side effects. Please come up with something without the side effects!",

Day 2, Pain was gone but I was very sleepy not able to concentrate. Day 3, slept all day could not keep my balance and my dreams was almost real. Day 4, very sleepy and unresponsive, it was so bad that I could not feel my low blood sugar until all my body was shaking and I needed help to take sugar. Day 5, STOP taking the dame thing. Day 6, Pick up the phone, called my doctor and used every word I have learned in English on him and those scientist, who came up with this IDEA.

I am 25 and took Lyrica for at least 6 years. I experienced severe brain fog, difficulty breathing, cognitive difficulties n others while on this medication. I thought they were all due to my conditions, but after truly reflecting on my journey Lyrica surely hurt me more than it helped me. I have been off of the medication for about 3 weeks now. I did some research and learned that my detox period would be both difficult and long because 1, I took the medication for several years, I took a high dosage andi stopped the medicatiod cold turkey. It's getting easier for sure. The creator on my side!",

I'm really surprised that the Drs didn't tell my about \"Excedrin abuse\" since I told all that I was taking that much. However, when prescribed Lyrica for fibro pain, my headaches were gone to maybe 3 a week. So I highly recommend this for serious headache problems. Does help with Fibro pain. But, weight gain and dry mouth are my biggest side effect and is to the extent that I almost want to go back to 8 Excedrin a day. Hope this helps someone!",

The medicine is astoundingly good for me at combating depression, anxiety, overall body pain & morning stiffness. It takes higher doses of Lyrica to feel pain relief for most people with Fibromyalgia- those who say it doesn't work have often only tried it at <300mg a day. I take 300mg twice a day. The only bad side effect is weight gain- 100lbs. (And I'm naturally overweight to begin with, so this was terrible). It did eventually stop making me gain, but I have to eat less and work out more than everyone else I know, just to maintain my weight, let alone lose.",

I also take 37mg Tramadol IR whenever I have breakthrough pain. This is the minimum I need to function, but it does allow me to work and improves my overall mood.

I also managed to severely rupture a few discs in my neck while stretching of all things. Was misdiagnosed by the surgeon who only fixed one of the ruptures with a fusion of C7. Off course this still left me with pain and numbness from my neck down both arms. About a month or so ago I switched to a spine and pain management doctor and he put me on the Lyrica (75mg 3x daily) and a Duragesic patch. These two drugs have worked wonders for my pain and Quality of life. The only side effect is that my short term memory is a little sketchy and my mind doesn't want to shut down.",

Suddenly I realized, I forgot my walker. I completely forgot it. I wake in the morning, pain free. I am walking now without the walker, it has also improved my mood.

At this dose my anxiety has been pretty much eliminated, I am happy and now an active person. However a word of warning to anybody taking this medicine for a long time: DO NOT allow yourself to suddenly withdraw from it. I recently had to go a week without it and it was a living hell for me. Withdrawal symptoms for me were as follows: severe anxiety and depression, suicidal ideation, inability to sleep, nausea and vomiting",

I read that I am in the minority with this. I can say for the most part Lyrica helped, but I had to take Advil with it. Overall, it helped.",

I was put on Pregabalin for generalized anxiety disorder and seasonal affective disorder by my Doctor. At first I was put on a very low dose of 75mg, which did next to nothing. I immediately requested to have the dose increased until finally I reached a dose that was effective enough for me (600mg). For a while the medicine did its job and I actually felt like my anxiety had been reversed. I suffer bad social anxiety, and 300mg of this made me quite extroverted and confident. I would say it was 'pro social' for sure. Alas tolerance set in and now even 800mg doesn't do much of anything apart from prevent withdrawals.",

A clinical research was recently done in Australia on lyrica (for Acute and Chronic Sciatica) and the findings stated it had the same effect as the research subjects getting placebos or sugar pills. The makers have racked in 3 billion dollars on it. I told my doc it isn't working but he still prescribes it to me, finding another doc this week.

So the next time I was at the doctors I asked him about taking Lyrica and he thought that it was a good idea. It took awhile but each day that went by more of my pain left me, and now I am pain free from Fibromyalgia. My side effects was gaining weight and that was about it.

I was on a higher dose over 300mg a few years ago and my hands and feet swelled up and I gained 30 pounds I can't get rid of now even with water pills, so I had to stop med. I've had shingles right when I turned 50 before I could get the Shingles vaccine which I recommend to everyone as shingles is painful! I took only Lyrica 25mg two or three times a day to stop the shingles pain, A low dose due to side effects from a larger dose.",
                    "Lived with a severe generalized anxiety disorder for the last 10 years, last 5 years particularly full of anguish and \"crippling\" discomfort. Always misdiagnosed as a depression: been on SSRIs for 4 years with no success; also resistant to benzodiazepines. I was starting to believe I'd have to live like this forever until today! I got my very first dose of Lyrica (just a tiny 25mg) and after it kicked in (4 hours) I've been feeling myself, like I didn't since I was a boy! Layers of heavy bricks lifted away from my chest, and I finally feel like any human is supposed to feel. Today is undoubtedly the happiest day of my last 5 years. I feel lighthearted and motivated, serene and willing to restart my life like I was born again.",
                    "After very successful spinal surgery in Thailand, I went without pain for almost 3 years. I was all but in a wheel chair prior to surgery. I then took a bad fall and pain came back. Fully expecting surgery I returned to Thailand and doctor suggested Neurontin. Although I got some relief, the side effects were intolerable. He then put me on Lyrica. It stopped the pain within 24 hours. He said it would take a few days. I was on it about 45 days and then weaned myself off. I think anyone with spinal stenosis should ask your doctor about this. I think they have just approved it for back pain here in the States. My surgery was in 2005, and went back in 2008. It was a miracle for me.",
                    "Lyrica stops the pain in the ball of my feet. It's wonderful to be able to walk without the pain. I am diabetic and take insulin. I too have had a weight gain of 35 lbs over the past 6 months. I seem to suffer from a bit more memory loss than before and I fatigue easily. I have caught myself dozing off in front of the computer at work, so I force myself to get up and walk around a bit. All in all a small price to pay for the relief of the pain in my feet.",
                    "This is very good for my generalized anxiety disorder along with olanzapine. I take 100mg at night, it helps me sleep too.",
                    "After suffering from horrible post herpatic neuralgia in the trigeminal nerves on the left side of my face, I went to a neurologist who put me on Lyrica. A small dose of 50 mg each night keeps my symptoms under control. I tried adding a morning dose, but it made me giggle at inappropriate times, so I went back to only taking it at night. For over two years my pain has been controlled well. One night I forgot to take my medicine and the next day I had a painful attack. I'll never forget it again! I'm so thankful for this medicine. There are so many other medicines that I tried and could not take, but this one works great for me.",
                    "Good for generalized anxiety disorder but side effects were bad.",
                    "Works pretty well for the pain, but having severe side effects (involuntary musclular movement involving jerking of legs and difficulty speaking, urinary retention and inability to urinate, dramatic weight gain of 30 pounds so far)",
                    "Had neuropathic pain in right upper jaw after dental work. Tried many different medicines including tricyclic's eventually put onto Lyrica went up to 900mg as well as Endep 40mg. Couldn't tolerate Endep, worked my way back down to 600mg Lyrica and after 6 months the nerve pain is tolerable. What I didn't' realize was all the side effects that I now believe stems from Lyrica, severe bloating, sore eyes, memory loss, word problems, hand and feet pains, plus more. I have now found that it makes little difference between 75 or 300mg for pain relief. I have difficulty sleeping without any, 75 will eventually help but 300 gets me to sleep faster. After reading so many people complaining about the same side effects, I will be seeing my Dr.",
                    "I just started with this medication. I took one 75 mg pill in the late evening before going to sleep. When I took it I said to myself yea right this little tiny pill will somehow give my life back to me...the next morning when I awoke to my surprise, I felt like I did years ago. I could walk and stand without the aching and hurting. I was not as tired nor as sore in my muscles. What a wonderful little miracle this little pill is!!!",

An episode of severe pain and nerve issues recently meant I was signed off for 4 weeks to rest, however during this time my whole nervous and neurological pain got worse as well as physical collapse and spread to my face hands, arms and body functionality. The lowest point in five years thus far. I was put on Pregablin 75mg /2x day and although the first week was strange with hyper elation, a foggy mind and some humorous speech issues but when it kicked in the transformation was amazing. 3 months later I'm far more stable and working fulltime. Some back pain has returned with occasional sciatica.",

I may be reporting on this drug too soon but I am finding my pain receding greatly. I am feeling almost \"normal\", my spirits are definitely raising and hope that I can avoid nerve cutting surgery that would be my last choice for relief. I am an optimist by nature and am so hoping that 100mg a day will keep me pain free and away from the scalpel.",
                    "Lyrica has its pros and cons like any other medicine in the market. Lyrica has helped me in many ways including neuropathic pain and depression together with other antidepressants. The only side effect that bothers me a little is the fact that I feel tired most of the time but I can still function with a lot of calmness. On the other hand I have tried every single medicine for insomnia during the last 12 years with not so great results until I found this medicine. Now I sleep like a baby at 150mg twice a day.",
                    "I had minor back surgery and one result was nerve damage to the nerves from my right leg socket to my hip. Severe burning several times per year. Lyrica stops the severe pain slowly and reduces it to tolerable pain. I use 75mg on a nine day regimen - 3x for 3 days, 2x for 3 days and 1x for 3 days. It works good. The pain slowly resides and is gone by 6th day. No serious side effects. Slight vision blurring and minor lack of mental focus. Very minor. Overall, I think it works for me. Has not affected appetite, weight, mental attitude or sleeping habits.",
                    "My own experience was awful. I did not gain weight but I had been suffering with depression because of all the pain I was in. My doctor prescribed these which in my option she should have never done specially when I was very down at the time. I've never experienced such thoughts in my life the only time I got a break from my own thoughts was when I was sleeping. If you are feeling down at all while taking these my advice go see your doctor ASAP do not continue with these not advisable to anyone with depression",

It helped a little, but still had substantial back pain requiring Ultracet 3x per day and Lortabs when pain peaked. Have been on Lyrica 75mg 3x per day for past 11 days. Really reduced the pain the first few days, but pain came back a bit. Still, the Lyrica is helping and I've not had to take the Lortabs since starting Lyrica. I'm going to stick with Lyrica for a few more weeks before deciding to try more injections or other medicines.",
                    "I have been taking Lyrica for about 1 year and I went from hurting all the time to just my occasional spells. I don't know what I would do without it.",
                    "The real problem I had and still do is dosing. I started out on 150mg twice a day and found it too much at first. GP reduced dose to 75mg three times a day and 1 x 75mg when needed. That is my current dose and the side effects are worth it based on the fact that I've had painful neuropathy in both my feet and lower legs. The breakthrough pain was the main issue I was having trouble with and DID NOT want any more narcotics than I currently take...60mg. MS Contin x 24hours and 2 Statex when required per 24 hours. It can mess with your head a little like feeling like you are a bit spaced out. Works wonderfully and I hope I don't build a tolerance. ",
                    "I am an 81 year old male with back pain. The epidurals gave relief for only 3 weeks. I took Lyrica 50mg two times a day for only ten days. I stopped due to adverse reactions. I'm now in the process of gradually reducing the dose over a period of 8 days. My main reaction was a feeling of being drunk. I refused to drive during this time. On a scale of 1-10 I rate the pain relief a 5 or 6.",
                    "This medication has made a tremendous difference in my life. My pain was due to arthritis and none of the drugs prescribed for this condition worked. After two weeks on Lyrica I feel like a different person and my back is back to normal.",

                    "I have had fibromyalgia now for more than 20 years and my back pain was getting out of control. I had been taking a low dose of Lyrica (25mg) for some years, along with a cocktail of about 15 other drugs. I did some research, and came up with the fact that Lyrica was licensed for fibromyalgia, and took this to my doctor, who thought it would be an idea to try increasing the dose. After 3 months I am now up to 100mg night and morning, and am getting reasonable pain relief. However, I have severe side effects,the worst one being disturbed sleep every night through foot and leg cramps. I only have to stretch my legs slightly and it starts. Am getting disrupted sleep every night because of it. ",
                    "I really didn't notice much difference after 6 months on Lyrica - still had minor headaches, but apparently swelling went down (MRI). I DID notice the sleepiness at first, followed by insomnia and 30 lbs weight gain in that 6 months and swollen fingers and belly area.",
                    "I didn't even know Lyrica was prescribed as an off lable treatment for anxiety. I was mainly taking it for my fibromyalgia and phantom pain from an amputation. And I didn't realize until now I had full blown GAD and have probably had it since my teens.  I thought it was mostly depression. I journal and I can see that when I have been on Lyrica I didn't reach the extreme kind of depression I've been in. I recently tried to quit again because it causes me to be lethargic and to not be able to lose weight. It may have been some withdrawal symptoms, but within a week I was in grueling depression-anxiety. The DAY I started back on my 75mg/day Lyrica I started feeling better!",
                    "This didn't really change the pain levels but what it did do was make me gain weight substantially. This lead to me getting depressed which made the fibro flare up again. I stopped taking it.",
                    "I was prescribed Lyrica for fibromyalgia. The first hour after I took Lyrica I felt better and at night, I slept like a dream. I was on for a total of two weeks in which time I started feeling bloated and put on weight. I am a heart patient and I started getting angina. My blood pressure started to raise. I started getting headaches. My only wish was that I could have continued taking Lyrica as the fibromyalgia pain was gone. But I'll just have to keep looking. ",
                    "I started taking Lyrica 4 months ago. I am always anxious when taking a new medicine as I am also on Paxil, which is horrible if I do not have a dose within 24 hours. Within an hour I felt 'weird' like I do if i miss a dose of Paxil. That feeling subsided throughout the day. Over the next days I did feel quite vague and forgetful (like I couldn't remember my bank account number, which I use daily). Again I persisted, taking 75mg twice a day, on waking and then at 2pm. I noticed an increase in energy and a decrease in pain. ",

I also get pain \"breakthrough\" where pain attacks can reach up to 10 on a pain scale. I started Lyrica last year, and now am on 225Mg twice a day and have the same amount of pain control as the Gabapentin, but at a much lower dose. My wife says that I am much more \"aware\" and \"responsive\" on Lyrica and my short term memory issues are not quite as severe, however still there. My weight gain has ceased, however I am having a tough time trying to lose all the weight I have gained.",
                    "I began reporting my symptoms of peripheral neuropathy to my doctor in the 90's. My stroke in 2002 finally got my doctor's attention that my nerve pain was real. She dropped me as her patient and subsequent doctors ignored my pain complaints. In 2004 I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia but my Neurologist said not to take Lyrica. Fortunately, I recently got a new Primary Care Physician and new Neurologist. Two weeks ago, my new PCP gave my samples of Lyrica. I am amazed at my improved ability to function already. I think of the years of being bedridden at age 36-41. I can't believe that I wasn't prescribed Lyrica, a decade ago. No side effects so far. I still have pain 24/7, but the relief due to Lyrica, is a miracle.",
                    "I was given Lyrica for my fibromyalgia in 2007. No relief, but gained 30 pounds in 3 months and continued gaining until it reached 55 pounds! I've lost less than 10 pounds, hard weight to lose so be aware.",

The anti depressants had effects but not desirable ones.At times they replaced some anxieties with others and bad side effects. Sleep, sex drive, confusion. From someone who has experimented with recreational drugs including ecstasy the feeling I had from anti depressants was sometimes similar to a moderate come down from recreational drugs. I pretty much gave up on drugs Then along came pregablin which I hadn't spotted before. It is by far the best thing I've taken I started on 150mg a day now on 225mg won't go higher I don't feel as scared anymore I can do things. Try it.",

I also have to take Cymblata and tramadol with morphine but like I said I have full body RSD. Only side effect is my vision and I feel like I'm high but the benefits outweigh the side affects",
                    "I am 36, have a bad case of herniated disc that hits me in the back. Lyrica has helped a lot with pain and overcoming my hernia's crisis twice, at 150-300 mg daily. This is not an example of chronic use, although I might be such one case in the future if the problem persists.  In lower doses it seems to take more time (days) to take effect, in higher doses the side-effects are more pronounced.  My side-effects were: slight sedation, euphoria, strange body coordination, all in all: the psychoactivity. One can have an accident on these, so caution should be exercised and doctors instructions followed strictly. Using cars or other potential dangerous machines should probably be avoided too.  ",

                    "I started having intermittent pain about two months ago all over my body. My hands, shoulders, legs, knees, feet... it all hurt. My doctorr tested for inflammatory diseases and autoimmune diseases and nothing showed up. He decided to treat me as if I have fibromyalgia and gave me Lyrica (not sure what dose but supposed to take 2x a day) this little capsule is great. I can move and actually sleep comfortably at night. Only issue is it does make me sleepy so I can only take at night but that's good for me right now.",
                    "I took lyrica for long standing neuropathic pain. I took it before bed and woke up the next day completely in a haze, dizzy , uncoordinated and could not function.

                    "I was prescribed this capsule when my pain in left thigh muscle became unbearable and I was not able to stand or walk. Either this, or combined first 3 days muscle relaxant made my pain vanish. I was prescribed for 15 days and after 8 days, I forgot to take one night. I felt much better next day (after not taking).

I still can't believe it. I was sure I had Alzheimers. I now know I don't. I'm 65 and can't believe I may be able to be a normal person after being so mentally ill for more than 20 years. Fibromyalgia is much better. Anxiety almost gone. OCD obsessive thoughts gone.  Haven't been able to drive in 5 years. Hubby takes me everywhere. Hoping to drive again soon. ",

                    "Lyrica works. Unfortunately, I am on the verge of discontinuing use because of significant side effects. The most troubling for me are the eye disorders (conjunctivitis and blurred vision), and the dementia. I am 53 years old and I have trouble remembering elementary words! It's very embarrassing. I also have a significant taste disorder... many things taste like \"burnt garlic\" to me... that's the best way I can describe it. Finally, I have facial bloating, weight gain, and dizziness. I have been on the maximum dose of Lyrica for chronic pain due to degenerative disc disease in my neck. I was willing to endure the weight and dizziness, but the eye, memory and taste problems are intolerable. Too bad, because Lyrica really helps pain.",

Tried everything, but Lyrica has been the one that worked. Not completely, but they may bump up the dosage, I'm told. Trying for 2 more months til I see my GP again. Lucky my insurance pays- otherwise I'd never be able to afford it.",
                    "The best way to describe how well Lyrica works for me is to say, \"I'm young again! I'm a 50 yr old who has suffered with fibromyalgia for many years. Every morning on waking I would just lay in bed dreading the pain and discomfort of something as simple as getting up and out of bed. I was prescribed Cymbalta, Celebrex and Tramadol which help; but nothing works as well as Lyrica. I am able to get more done now without slowing down. Like I said before, I feel years younger. I have read that Lyrica poses an abuse warning, but what I experience isn't really euphoria (High) as one might experience with opiates. I experience relief of pain and maybe \"light on my feet\" and actually stronger muscles %u2014 but not the euphoria of opiates.",
                    "It helped with the pain but every few months the doctor would have to increase the dose for me to have relief. Bad side it caused weight gain.",
                    "This is a miracle medicine. My pain prior to taking this medicine was so bad. I was having a hard time waking up in the mornings cause the pain was just wearing me down. It was harder to function at work too. My imagination started running wild as I started wondering if I was going to end up on social security disability. I've had 2 back surgeries C4-C7, and started to have new pain in the T spine below the 3 level fusion. I started taking Neuronton a few months ago for my pain and it did help some, but after a few months it wasn't helping anymore. My pain was strong and deep. I just didn't have much hope in this medicine but it is AMAZING! I have my life back. It helped with my anxiety also.",
                    "Like most others, I've tried everything possible for fibromyalgia over the past several years. I also have 3 herniated discs and chronic back pain. I tried Lyrica in the past and it did not help. Two years later I tried it again and in fact am still on 300 mg/day in combination with Flexeril 10 mg at night. It helped to take the edge off for about a month then suddenly stopped working. As I am going on a vacation soon, I am not beginning to wean off yet as I will wait until we return. Perhaps increasing the dosage would help? We will see. So far all I had was a month with a little less pain and am having a hard time maintaining my weight. My memory loss and grasping for words has also noticeably increased (and I am young). ",
                    "I was taking only 75mg per day of Lyrica for Fibromyalgia pain. I found it to be very helpful to me and helped me to get much needed rest at night. I took my dosage at night 2 - 3 hours before bed. My only issue with it was there were occasions where I felt a little \"spacy\" but overall, the pain left and I was able to carry out most of my day without significant pain. It was a very low dosage, so a lot of the side effects that some people experience could be from taking a much larger dosage. I am no longer taking it because I lost my insurance and can't afford the cost. However, I was told about Neurontin, will be starting it tomorrow and hoping to get some similar relief.",
                    "I was formally diagnosed with fibromyalgia August 2009. After 8 months of trying other medicines and physical therapy I finally gave in to my Doctor and tried Lyrica. I was nervous because I had used Neurontin in the past with bad side effects and thought Lyrica would be the same. I was wrong. Lyrica does make me sleepy but I take 75 mg at night about 2 hours before bed. My Doctor started me out on the lowest dosage and it has worked miracles for me. I have less pain and my muscles don't seem to spasm or twitch as much, I am able to increase my activity levels which helps with the stiff muscles. It also has helped to calm the nerves in my foot that were irritated in an unrelated injury. This medicine has been a miracle for me.",
                    "When I took Lyrica, I gained 40 lbs myself and my eyes were blurry. Once I got off of the medicine it has been still hard to lose the weight. It did work for my leg pain but the side effects were to much!",
                    "I have found I have an increased urge to eat sweet foods. I have tried to control this by eating fruit. However, this does not stop the craving for sweets. Also I have noticed an increased thirst and less urination. Further I have been able to stop using morphine patches and taking Mersyndol Forte since starting Lyrica. The lessening of pain has enabled me to sleep better",
                    "The nerve pain became so unbearable that it forced me to take lyrica despite the bad reviews and long list of negative side effects. I was told by many that it worked a lot better that neurontin with less drastic negative effects. Well, it has eased my pain some, but the side effects have taken my life from me. I'm dizzy at times, my head is always foggy and not clear thinking, I have depression, anger outbursts I've never had before, daily nausea, and am so tired that I can sleep all day and night long and can barely function. Unfortunately the alternative medications have even worse negative side effects, so what are we supposed to do in order to have some normalcy?",
                    "I call it a miracle drug like most others who have shared their comments. I have been taking it now for 7 months, currently 450mg a day (for treatment of fibromyalgia). I gained about 20 pounds within 2 months which I desperately needed to do. Overall, I have a better life now thanks to Lyrica. Nothing that I have been prescribed in the last 14 years has even came close to treating my condition.",
                    "I've suffered from Fibromyalgia since I was 16 years old (I'm now 24). My doctor put me on pain killers/ muscle relaxers, anti-inflammatories, Cymbalta and the list goes on. I've been told to change my diet. Nothing truly worked. Then I saw the Lyrica commercial. Asked my Doctor about it and he told me he had heard great things about it. I was given a free week trial. The FIRST pill- I could tell a slight difference. It's day 7 for me and I LOVE this pill thus far. ",
                    "It works for the muscle aches and it actually makes me a lot calmer. I don't know if that's just because I feel better so I can relax or if it's the medicine. I was so happy and blessed to find a doctor who listened to what was wrong with me and actually followed through with treatment. Hope that it can help more people and that there are no long term side effects but I am happy with the results and how quickly I felt a difference.",
                    "If you are debating on whether to take this, please don't hesitate. I was in car accident Dec 2012 and have whiplash/cervical strain. Injured my neck and shoulder. I was in pain for the past 9 months and no doctor would prescribe me narcotics due to Ohio law. I was miserable, crying, irritable and nothing I took (IB, Tylenol) wouldn't touch the pain. I got a prescription for Gabapentin, which I am allergic to BAD side effects. Finally the doc gave me Lyrica, within 15 min of taking pain GONE. I feel like I'm back to normal again (like the day before accident). Lyrica is a miracle although pricey. There is a program you can get through Lyrica website to qualify for free prescription. Try it.",
                    "Initially, this medicine was a godsend. Burning pain finally fizzled away. Muscle pains, didn't help as much. Still got numb and weak as well. The real problem came months later when I realized I was having memory problems. Had to wean off it. Memory loss was permanent. Chunks of time just gone. I still think because of the state of pain I was in I would do it over. Maybe the pain made me block out the time. I wish I would have just risked stopping it sooner to see if the nerve had healed. I still take them when I am desparate for relief. But just one maybe two until the zingers stop. Oh ya, nerves were damaged from electricity. Hand to my neck and face.",
                    "Hi. I have been on methotrexate 10 pills once a week and embrel injection 50mg once a week and now added Lyrica 50 mg 2 x a day. Told I have RA, and fibromyalgia. But even with these great meds I feel bad. From my waist to botton of my feet I hurt so. I do see my legs are swelling so very large and skin gets tight it hurts to walk. I dont know what else to do. I work and am on my feet all day. I go up and down the stairs at home I try to get extra walks in going around the blocks. But it hurts too bad. Im very tolerant to pain but this is to the point of no return. I feel bad for my family that maybe I'm a burden. And if I feel this way now how will I feel if I'd ever need some one to help me with everyday chores and hygiene. They may not see",
                    "After a head/neck/spine injury I found the drug to be very helpful with the neuropathic pain in my arm, face and various body parts. Weight gain is a minor issue. I don't suffer night terrors but feel as though I've been dragged through a hedge backwards upon awakening. I do NOT feel rested upon awakening. Cognitive issues due to the injury have been exaggerated after taking Lyrica.",
                    "This medicine was my neuropathic calming wonder medicine until my body over the course of several years had progressed to full body pain. I recommend anyone who has new or has out grown their pain medication to talk to your doctor about this.",
                    "The first time I used Lyrica I experienced an amazingly profound reaction; layers of depression and anxiety that had built up over several years melted away within minutes. That was years ago and I have since both weaned myself off the drug and restarted taking it again. One thing I rarely see mentioned is the terrifyingly bad withdrawal effect- missing more than one dose for me throws me into the absolute darkest pits of despair. Has anyone else experienced this? When I went off the drug the first time I felt like I had performed a miracle; so strong was the feeling that it took a long time for me to convince myself that things were bad enough to warrant going back on. It still helps, but nothing as miraculous as the first time.",
                    "Lyrica is the best medication for generalized anxiety disorder. I am on 75mg twice a day and been able to slowly get off my clonazepam without the benzodiazepine withdrawal. Brain fog will go away after being on it for about a month. Only other side effect is the cost.",
                    "Lyrica 25mg has been my beginning dose and I have been sleeping well, waking up feeling no pain, have no pain during the day, have a good mood and best of all no side effects! My doctor says that if I am comfortable on this dose I can stay at this amount and I don't have to go up if I don't need to!",

                    "I have suffered from panic disorder and GAD for well over 10 years, starting in my early 20s. I finally sought treatment 3 years ago, but nothing helped. CBT, 40mg Citalopram, nothing. I then discovered pregabalin on this website. It was a struggle to get it prescribed on the NHS in the UK, but I'm so glad I persevered. This medicine is nothing short of a miracle. Within 24 hours I was a new person. I've only been taking it a week, but now I feel light and happy, and the anxiety has just faded away. I don't need alcohol any more. In fact, the thought of drinking now makes me feel ill.  If you have GAD - please try this. I'm only on 75mg twice a day as well.",
                    "This gave me incredibly bad nightmares not read other reviews with this problem but main reason I'm coming off it... does help slightly with anxiety but feel a bit too relaxed not good for daytime and work... does 150mg taken at night also causes dizziness and my eyes can't focus extremely groggy in the morning not great for me",

Lyrica 75mg 2-3 x day has made the biggest difference in my life and pain in over 12 years. I can walk without a cane and I feel like doing things. There was some initial weight gain, but that seems to have leveled off. I've been amazed and very pleased.",
                    "I used Hydrocodone and Tramadol for persistent joint and neck/back pain. Didn't appreciate the foggy out of body living experience but it did help the pain. Although with narcotics, I became easily resistant and constant increasing of dosage doesn't seem like the most practical idea for long term pain. Lyrica took about one month to actually show it's benefits, luckily I had gotten free samples for that trial period. After the 1st month I noticed significant relief from my persistent joint pain. I am able to function normally for most of the day without any issues. So happy to have found Lyrica, just wish it wasn't so expensive!",
                    "I have been on lyrica for 1 month, starting at one 75mg twice daily for two weeks, then stayed on 150mg twice daily for two weeks. I had horrible side effect so my doctor told me to split the morning dose that was 150mg in to taking 75mg in the morning and 75mg afternoon, then 150 at nite. So the side effects got better. I suffered from extreme dizziness, increased anxiety, had a feeling my legs couldn't carry me, burning sensation throughout the whole body. After one month of medication, when side effect had gone away a little bit, I talked to my doctor and he told me than since I still suffer from anxiety we should increase the dose to 150/75/150. Side effects are back, I take oxazepam 30 mg to get through the worst side effect and waiting for a better effect on anxiety. However I am better than before.",
                    "My doctor just put me on Lyrica 25 mg tablet twice a day. The first day I took one dose around lunch the other before bedtime and got sleepy in the day. Anyway I emailed doctor he said only take the one at nite but I decided to take both at nite and feel great! I have suffered for years with fibromyalgia and cymbalta was not working for the fibromyalgia but I also take cymbalta for depression so still on that added the Lyrica and feel that the great pain is so much less, my knees and ankle pain, burning sensation all down, and finally get a good sleep without all the leg pain. I am thankful for this drug and finally can get my life back on track and finally see light at the end of my long tunnel of dealing with this horrible condition.",

Also my fingers and face are very puffy to the point of being uncomfortable.And the worst part is the chronic dry mouth.I have to keep a water bottle on hand to sip on constantly!(Having a chronic dry mouth puts you at a higher risk of cavities.)And weight gain",

I honestly didn't think pregabalin would be effective but I noticed immediately it helping with the pain in my foot where I'm sure there is nerve damage as well as in my arm where I broke it. Later on in the day I set about doing a chore and realized my anxiety was gone. I mean I still had worry but it was managable? Hard to explain. Started off at 300 mg a day and went up to 450 a day then after a few weeks it was like my anxiety worsened.(I have GAD and take Clonazepam) I was going to go off the Pregbalin but I'm down to 100mg in the morning 50mg at dinner and 50 mg at night. Ok so far",

My life was pretty limited as to what I could do, which was pretty much sitting in a chair at the computer or watching tv. My love for the outdoors was pretty much squashed since it requires bending over, which I can't do, due to the rods and screws in my back. I have only taken this medicine for two days, and I have already have noticed a huge difference. I am actually able to move around more. I also have osteoarthritis, and my joints were hurting. Not anymore. This stuff is amazing. The only drawback is the cost. I have to take it three times a day, and it's really expensive.",

I was prescribed Lyrica 50mg about 2 months ago and felt a little relief. Doctor raised the dosage and now I take 150mg 3 times a day and the results are amazing. I'm alert, energetic, and pain free. Have a little dizziness now and then, but this medicine is great.",

I am on 300mg per day and have experienced no side effects and absolutely no weight gain. I am so much calmer and happier, my mood doesn't plummet suddenly, I am not anxious at all anymore and I am sleeping like a log! 10/10 don't let fear of sudden weight gain effect your decision to take this drug, remember that when they test drugs they don't take into consideration the lifestyles of the test subjects, that 1 in 10 person could just eat to much day to day which would result in weight gain and have nothing to do with the drug. Don't worry too much about it!",

I explained to the dr that I didn't feel depressed but I worried constantly through the night about things, and would also wake suddenly with chest pain. The dr sent me for ECG but I knew the pain was linked to anxiety. Anyway, after the ECG came back clear, he prescribed Pregabalin (a much lower dose than most people on here) and I only take one at night. I now sleep better, I have not woken with a panic attack since taking them, and my anxiety is no longer controlling me. I've been on them 6 months.",

My feet still sting and burn on and off everyday. One time, I decided to slowly stop taking Pregabalin and take the generic drug, Gabapentin and my feet flared up by a 1000 percent. I asked my doctor if he could prescribe Pregabalin again. I have had zero/none side effects taking Pregabalin but recently I came across reading peoples \"hellish/nightmare\" experiences trying to wean and stop taking this drug. That scares me and I do not want to be dependent on this drug or any drug. I am going to slowly wean myself off and find other ways to deal with my nerve pain. Prayers needed!",

My relationship with my husband and my baby (with whom I have had terrible difficulties bonding/guilt/PND.

Lyrica has been the miracle drug for me and I have been taking it for about 3 years. It takes time for any drug to work properly and I couldn't function with out it. 150mg a day is my dosage.

My head was spacey and I couldn't register what people were saying, and once I realised I couldn't come up with a reply. Today, I woke up and I felt drunk and stoned at the same time but not as severe. I found it hard walk straight, my balance was off. I feel happier but not less anxious?

I am trying it for GAD (general anxiety disorder) after trying antidepressants; I tried SSRI's like Paxil and Lexapro and these were horrible failures. The SSRI's made me suicidal BUT Lyrica seems to really be doing the trick! The weight of anxiety is totally gone, and I feel somehow stronger and more self confident, although the feeling is a little manic at times and irregular, like feeling quite drowsy, then quite manic, in a short period of time. But I am assuming that this might stabilize after a few more days. So far I feel like a new person!",

Sleeping better, emotions have come back and I am not an anxious wreck! very helpful and no side effects.

It helped with some of the fibro pain and I felt tired and a little dizzy along with having dry mouth which I expected as common side effects. What surprised me was I got new pains in new places--my big toe felt like it was on fire and my lower back hurt badly. I started weaning off of Lyrica and the new pains went away. I also had insomnia from weaning process. I think it does work to dull the fibro pain but not sure if it's worth it if there are new pains.",

Lyric does not make me sleepy. I have had no problems with Lyrica and been on it several months . Have gone off it also for several weeks with no problems at all. Maybe it helps some people and others not. For me, it really relieved my nerve pain in my legs.",

The thing I didn't like about it though was that it always made me feel like I was in a cloud. My thinking wasn't clear. I would get dizzy. I didn't notice too much of a weight gain, but there was some. In the end, I chose to try a different med (Savella) after my daughter was born and have been happier with that. Still works and fewer side effects.",

I have only been taking it for 3 days and I can already tell a significant difference. My hands and feet have no burning pain and I seem to have less numbness. I have also noticed that it helps tremendously with my anxiety. I was taking Xanax 1mg 3x a day and now I only take it once a day if that. I seem to feel more relaxed and less anxious so maybe this will actually help me stop taking the Xanax which I've tried so many times in the past. So far I am super impressed with this medication.",

I know it sure worked for me & life is so worth living now.",

My doctor and I ran tests, and by process of elimination we feel that I have chronic fatigue, which can contribute to a lot of the allergy/asthma symptoms, the pains and exhaustion.

But now I have developed severe muscle weakness, headache, abdominal cramping, blurry vision, bad judgement which causes accidents to my fingers and toes I have recently had difficulty thinking clearly. I can barely hold myself up and I can't lift anything over a few pounds. I have asked my doctor if I can safely stop taking it.

Still hurting, however, my dosage was increased to 300 mgs twice daily which has successfully reduced the pain so that I am able to function at a higher level than I have experienced in years with minor side effects, the most annoying of which is sleepiness. I am grateful and relieved to have been introduced to Lyrica and to have insurance that will cover it as it is obscenely expensive.",

I have very bad social anxiety but on that day I was not afraid of anything, I felt any goal that I had always wanted to pursue I suddenly could, and even if I failed, I would deal with it. My only fear that day was that this would be temporary, and sadly, it was. The next day I took it, and I got only the slightest hint of what I had the day before, the tiny effect maybe lasted for the next couple days, then nothing, I kept taking it, thinking it might somehow kick in after time, but then I started to notice I was gaining lots of weight I stopped.",

My main issue has been a lack of deep restorative healing sleep as it exacerbates the fibromyalgia pain and inability to exercise. My Rhematologist has given me Lyrica to try and I have to say so far so good. I have only taken 3 doses and already I am getting a better quality sleep. So much so that my husband has noticed my improved overall state of mind. I am a little cloudy the next day but I am hoping this will ease over time. Worth the cost of a cup of coffee a day if it helps!",
                    "I was prescribed this for fibromyalgia, I've tried it several times at low doses and have had a horrible experience. I can not explain this but within an hour of taking lyrica I get the most severe tooth pain, like every tooth suddenly has a hole in it ? I went to my dentist the first time NO HOLES?? My doctor thought it was amusing ? Bizarre. My real problem is the next morning after taking lyrica I have horrendous stomach pain for days, hurts to urinate, poop or fart. Feels like I really have to push to urinate, my doctor said sounds like stomach/intestine inflammation which is on the common side, so I've been taken off it. I will say I sleep like a baby after taking it!",

Must say have arthritis at the base of both wrists with pain in wrists!Put on pregabalin! Took it for first time last night woke up at 4 am with pounding headache dry mouth! Took paracetamol!

Gabapentin 800 3x a day. Has done Nothing for me. I am miserable. If you need help paying for it go to there website and they will actually pay for the medication for you. For a year then you just reapply. I will be getting mine back finally this week. And I can't wait to get back on it so I can actually be a mom and a wife again.

My stupid doctor , who knew nothing about fibro, put me on some opiates and the one that worked was morphine. it was great, I loved it and then 2 months ago my doctor took me off morphine-paranoid I think about people overdosing.. I was furious with her and plan on changing doctors soon. I called Pfizer and qualified for no charge Lyrica . I received it 4 days ago, 150 mg . I sleep great with it and I also take xanex, trazadone, amitriptyline for sleep, I take it in the morning with my antidepressents and feel ok then I take it around noon and sometimes I feel really flaky. I need to gain about 10 pounds so I am not worried about weight gain.So far it is ok, still have pain but its not horrible..",

The meds do come with some side affects, short term memory loss and sometimes blurred vision being the worse. I've thankfully not had issue with weight gain. You have take the good with the bad sometimes. Without the prescribed meds life would be hell.",
                    "Thus is intended as a warning about sudden cessation of long term Lyrica use. I've been taking 75mg twice daily Lyrica for severe pain resulting from crush fractures in my spine. I started to feel a slight benefit from the drug a few weeks after beginning to take it but it wasn't until I started swimming that my long standing pain completely disappeared. I never missed a dose until a few days ago: just ran out, had to wait til the next day, effectively missing two doses. I went through an incredibly harrowing experience in that time without the drug...it wasn't psychological: I could almost physically feel the chemistry in my brain and body going totally haywire. It was extremely alarming, nothing can describe how nasty it was.",

                    "I have been in pain for years and started Lyrica. I cannot believe the difference. It is shocking. My pain is so much better. My bladder spasms are gone. I sleep so well. Wake up in the morning without hurting my back and ribs to breath. My chronic diarrhea is gone too. The only thing I have noticed on the negative side is I am super hungry, which doesn't surprise me. Overall, loving it and praying it continues to work. No side affects other than being hungry:)",
                    "I was diagnosed with Lupus 3 yrs. ago.Several months ago,during one of my doctor's visits, I discussed feeling more pain. He prescribed Lyrica.

                    "I've had Fibromyalgia for ten years now, along with other health problems and up until a week ago I was using Flexerel and Cataflam to help with the pain and discomfort. Until last week, I was under a lot of stress at work, mind you I teach infants and toddlers up to age 3, and I woke up one morning in pain. Pain over my entire body. Pain I have never felt before. I felt like I had a supped up version of the Flu. I went to work in tears and left in tears and headed straight to my doctor. I began Lyrica that day and I was pretty out of it the first night and especially the next day when I took the next dose. I slept most of the first day and the second day I was a little dizzy headed and off balance. So far Lyrica is working well",
                    "I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia about 18 years ago. I stopped working a few years after due to the pain. I tried many medications so I could have some quality of life with my husband and 2 children. I spent most of my time in bed or on the couch because the pain was so debilitating. I was taking Ultram and Zanex but these just didn't take away the pain and then my doctor started me on Lyrica. I started feeling like a new person because slowly the pain started to decrease. The only side effect which could also be part of Fibromyalgia is with speech. I have trouble sometimes finding the words I want to say. I now take 75 mg 3 times per day and have been taking it for over 10 years. I'm so grateful to have my life back.",
                    "I had shingles in January 2014. I have had terrible PHN ever since. 2.5 years of pain. It has been awful!! Shingles is the worst pain I have ever experienced and it isn't going away. I tried everything out there from Gabapentin to acupuncture, to percocet, to injections in my back and nothing helped, or it would help for a few weeks, but the pain always managed to come back strong. I was wary of Lyrica because of the side effects, but I finally decided to try it. It has definitely helped me and I can do things like ride my bike again with little pain. However, I have put on 8 lbs in 6 months and I am an extremely active person, so this is tough for me. I also have pain in my joints and sometimes my hands go numb, but less pain.",

It took the edge off my fibromyalgia pain during the day but at night I would wake up due to muscle pain when laying on one side too long. My doctor increased me to 150mg twice a day and for the first time in months, I was able to sleep through the night. I feel like a new person. It's a wonder drug. For once I am not walking around like a zombie due to pain and lack of sleep. I have gained a couple of pounds but I can live with that.",
                    "The pain from Fibromyalgia comes as MUSCLE cramping, tingling, twitching, spasms, etc. It is not a \"nerve\" illness per se, yet doctors think people are stupid and prescribe this anyway. It does nothing for the pain or fatigue from Fibromyalgia or Chronic Fatigue/M.E. Until people realize that legitimate users of meds such as Hydrocodone, morphine ER, etc are rarely abused by people in genuine chronic pain, doctors will continue to jeopardize patients lives by giving them meds like this as a placebo with nasty side effects. One doctor also put me on Paxil which gave me Serotonin Syndrome and I was in Intensive care for a week! This was when SSRI's first came out and I went into med journals. Avoid this for chronic MUSCLE pain.",

I am 5'6\" 125 and went up to 150lbs. 125 pounds is a high weight for me so 150 is too much for my frame. ",

Neurontin was like whiskey hit hard and had \"hangover\", Lyrica is like a fine wine, subtle and mellow and doesn't have the zombie effect. DON'T DRINK ALCOHOL WITH IT this was only a reference.

Nothing worked, opioids almost led to death. 2 months ago begam Lyrica (100mg, 3x/day). At beginning: brain felt \"foggy\"; walking unstable; total urinary incontinence (some bowel incontinence). To say I was shocked at how the Lyrica relieved my spine pain is an undersatement! I read all the horror stories, but decided to give it time. This is the first time since the early eighties I have had NO pain! The side effects are gone.",
                    "I take 75 mg at bedtime. I started Lyrica in 2015 when I had shingles. I noticed that I wasn't having crippling anxiety. I was able to stop Klonopin. I went back on Klonopin when we moved out of state. I also started Ambien 5mg. For sleep issues. I thought I could stop Lyrica. That was a big mistake. Last night I didn't take the Lyrica and I am so anxiety ridden and feel physically sick. I will definitely take the Lyrica tonight.",

Lyrica  amitriptyline did help me sleep better. I quit taking Lyrica and started taking gabapentin 300mg 3Xper day and the pain lessened a lot, and sleep is better and some of the brain fog is gone.

I see it as my salvation when compared to some of the medications I have taken over the years. YES, withdrawal from any form of medication is horrific and with uncertainty and discomfort. I personally am prepared to go through this horrible time to give Lyrica it's chance to work and improve my life, as I have seen an improvement already.

Fentanyl for fms is like a heavy bat for the wrong ball but was the only bat available.  I have been taking Lyrica for 1 1/2 yrs now. Had 1st pain free days in years when 1st started. Unfortantely, still on fentanyl in addition because I cannot take more then 50mg a day of lyrica w/o it knocking me out. Tried to build tolerance over 3 wks w/o success. Have had wild vision changes also.",
                    "My Anxiety had crippled me to a state which my life could no longer function. The first few days on Lyrica I noted a sense of euphoria and confusion but by the 4th day I found myself able to think about trigger points for my anxiety and was almost in awe of how it didn't raise its head. It seemed like anxiety had left my body, to the point where I had to look in a mirror and say \"why did you care about all that so much?\" Almost in disbelief of my previous behaviour, not being able to connect with those feelings or attitudes became freeing. lyrica gave me my life back it seems. Importantly, I'm still me. Friends and family all commented how much better I am without losing personality which i believe is one of the best qualities of the drug.",
                    "On my first day taking Lyrica, it was incredible - I was patient, calm, and chilled out. I could deal with stress better than I have been able to in my entire life. However, I quickly grew a tolerance, and I spent weeks chasing that feeling by upping my dose. When I finally reached 250mg, I was an absolute zombie. I was taking much longer to finish my sentences and I felt like I was constantly in a fog. My depression has reached an all-time high and my anxiety is still present - I'm just not having panic attacks any more. The past few months have been particularly bad and I just don't think it's worth being on any more. I think I'm especially disappointed now because it started out so well and I'm significantly worse off now.",
                    "It makes the pain go away and I can finally sleep at night. I'm so glad they have this medicine. The only side effect that I have had is the weight gain, which is 25 pounds so far and I have only been on it a month. At first I had some dizziness and minor hand and face swelling but that has gone away. If they could only improve so it wouldn't make you gain weight it would be a perfect medicine.",

Severe joint pain and urinary retention developed within 24 hours and I found it incredibly difficult to remain conscious. Hospital staff did not recognise the symptoms as an adverse effect of the medication, even though I handed them the advisory notes from the medication, and treated me as though I was just having an anxiety attack or attention seeking. It wasn't until I was discharged and read up on the medication that I was able to confirm that all the symptoms I had were listed as side effects. needless to say I did not take any more.",

I still have difficulty moving around in the morning, but within an hour of taking my morning dosage the majority of my pain, etc is gone.",

I am going to go back to Gabapentin which helped me get off morphine. My eyes are dry and blurry. I fart all the time and I am fat! I was off of it the beginning of the year and I was hurting but side affects are too much.",

What I didn't realise was it also helps with anxiety and depression, after 3 weeks I noticed a calmness I thought I could never achieve, did some googling on the benefits of Lyrica last night and was amazed at everyone's experience on Lyrica. This is great stuff, would recommend it highly, thank you Lyrica, back to fun time with the kids again.",

My memory got fuzzy, I stumbled and fell in injurying my back, it keeps new synapsis from forming in your brain (I.e. brain damage long term), I have rashes, etc. Most importantly, I started having thoughts of death. All of this on 50mg at bed time.  In a few years I'm sure TV lawyers will be soliciting patients for lawsuits. This is a strong chemical to introduce into a already weak person's system.",

My mother also suffers as well as my daughter who is showing many of the symptoms that I had at her age. I have been on Lyrica for ten days now and can not believe the difference it has made. I hope that this med can improve other's lives as well as it has mine, because FM is a horrible thing to have to live with. No side effects so far. Here is hoping it is for you..",

When I tried to stop this drug I experienced severe anxiety and feelings of gloom. Went back on see and say the pain clinic who advised tapering 25mgs every 2 weeks. I am down to 50mgs am and pm. The withdrawal is one of the hardest things I have been through and cannot wait until this drug is totally out of my system. Lesson learnt to research prescribed drugs, their side effects and withdrawal before blindly accepting them.",
                    "I rated Lyrica as \"one\" because IF your prescription plan does not pay for it, it is worth nothing to you UNLESS you are prepared to pay about $350.00 a month out of your own pocket. It's effectiveness for a few of my problems was very good, but since I cannot afford it, it's effectiveness is actually ZERO to me now.  Don't take the free sample that will be offered to you (unless you can afford it later). Stopping Lyrica will be the one of the most miserable things you have ever tried in your life! It is a horrible withdrawal. the company is just like a street dealer of drugs. BOTH give you \"free samples\" to get you dependent on the drug and they charge big money for you to continue taking it.",
                    "Initial euphoric effects wore off so dosage was increased. Was told would treat nerve pain and later told good for anxiety. My anxiety got worse on med as when it was due or late I was ill, it has addictive qualities I do not like. My health took a nose dive on this and I had to come off due to blurred vision, weight gain, blocked bowel. My Doctor advised decreasing of 75mg a week. My first drop was hell completely threw me into panic as I felt so ill, no one explained withdrawal when I saw medics in a state no one comforted me saying it could be the reduction too high/quick for me, after all in hindsight if I felt unwell late taking one dose then dropping 75mg wouldn't be helpful quickly, lower doses not easy to get as more costly to NHS etc",

I had been in pain every minute of every day, with some days being completely overwhelmed by the pain. Now I feel like I can live again. I just noticed that increased suicide risk was a potential side effect of Lyrica, which might concern me as I've suffered from major depressive disorder for >25 years. But being on this medicine has raised my mood a great deal because I don't have chronic pain to deal with on top of my baseline mood disorder. It is so wonderful. I'm waiting to hear that it causes something dreadful - because isn't that usually the case when something works so well.",

Heating pads aren't therapeutic, I sleep on 4 ice packs (I know, eeww, but whatever works). They help with inflammation, try them. Lyrica gave me agonizing, shooting pains from deep within shoulder and hip joints down humerus and femur. And unwelcome 35 lb weight gain. And blurry vision that meant I couldn't drive. Lyrica was useless for me, so glad you all have something to fight this fibromyalgia.",

I had a dry mouth and throat constantly, and my vision was hard to focus, jumpy. I had stopped and restarted after 4 months, still the same. Breathing is harder, so I've noticed this time.   I have stopped for good!",

The side effects have been extreme dizziness, edema in the feet, weight gain (about 15lbs). At my last appointment the Doctor adjusted the dose to 50mg x 4 times a day. The dizziness comes and goes. This is a great medicine for me. I can handle dizziness at this level.",

Due to a severe auto accident fifteen years ago, I am now 40 yrs old, and having suffered a closed head injury, fractured pelvis, 4 fractured ribs and tailbone fracture. I have suffered with chronic pain mostly my adult like. I have undergone nearly every pain management regime one can think of: Epid nerve blocks, rhizotomy, physical therapies and of course every narcotic medicine that was available. Yet within just a few months, and after all these years, Doctor and I have finally found a medication regimen that truly works! Lyrica 75 2x a day and MS 60mg 2x daily. And since starting Lyrica, my acute pain episodes are less frequent.",

                    "I was already overweight and went on Lyrica because of the tingling in my hands and feet being intolerable. Three weeks later, its like I woke up one morning and none of my clothes fit. I got on the scale and from the time my doctor gave me this pill to current and have gained over 25 lbs. It's a shame I have to decide between being obese or able to sleep and be pain free.",

                    "I suffered severe sciatica for two years before my doctor prescribed Lyrica. After a few days of building up in my system, the medication completely killed all of the pain, numbness, and tingling in my right leg. It was so effective, I thought I was suddenly cured! I stopped taking the Lyrica and the symptoms returned after a couple of days. I have now been taking Lyrica for two years and swear it is the best solution available for my bulging disk problem.",
                    "VERY MIXED RESULTS. Had a severe attack of shingles on the face and scalp (3 weeks in most of the hair on one side of my head was literally gone). I refused morphine (in hindsight, I should have taken it) but I did take Percocet which helped the internal pain but not the nerve pain in the skin. For that they gave me Neurontin, but I could not tolerate it due to extreme drowsiness, loss of appetite, loss of concentration and dry mouth (before I could chew food it was too dry to swallow it). Tried Lyrica 75mg 3 times daily. First dose seemed to really work but effect declined significantly so that the fifth dose had no effect. During the fourth week he increased to 100mg 3 times daily. Second dose helped then effects declined.",
                    "I have had chronic pain from Spinal Stenosis for over 25 years. Neck shoulders and lower back. I was on Lyrica 150 mg twice a day a couple years ago & truthfully can not remember why I stopped taking it. Since the \"war on pain meds\" My Dr. ask me to try it again. I took for 2 weeks then I started getting blurred vision, confusion, memory loss, & I would be standing in a store and twice the husband had to catch me because I was just falling over. I felt sick inside, instead of my quality of life improving it went down hill. I will never take this so called med again. I will live with the 10 to 15 pain level somehow if I have to spend the rest of my life just sitting still or in the bed. I also got to the point I was severely depressed. Do NOT take this drug.",

                    "Started using LYRICA about 6 months ago. It seems to have minimized the toe/foot pain I have when I go to bed. This was keeping me awake with pain and restless legs. Now I can get to sleep easier. Did notice some weight gain... but am working on it. No other side effects noted at this time. Sure has helped me at night!",
                    "Lyrica has saved my life, just wish I'd have started taking it sooner and it would have saved my marriage. My pain is completely controlled and I am no longer taking anti-depressants. I didn't realize it helped with GAD, but it does. I actually feel human again and interact with others. It does have some side effects, can't concentrate and a drunk feeling but compared to the pain I was enduring, these side effects are worth it to me.",
                    "600 mg of lyrica works wonders for me. Its a very good drug and completely takes away the pain. Without this drug I would go insane I've gone days with so much pain that I thought of committing suicide. Really awful feeling because I have always enjoyed life and I'm only 38. Nerve pain is by far the most painful pain I have ever had. To all of you who suffer out there, there will always be a medicine that can help you. Don't give up there is a way this horrible condition. I hope everyone find relief",
                    "Started taking Lyrica yesterday for severe diabetic neuropathy in both feet and lower legs. I am currently on Suboxone for a 15 year addiction to opiates and was concerned that Lyrica wouldn't work because my body is so screwed up from all the years of opiate use and most medications do not work well for me. Thirty minutes after the first dose I noticed a significant improvement in the neuropathic pain. My bedtime dose was another 75 milligram capsule and I slept better than I have slept in months! This medicine has been a God send for me so far. Hoping that it continues to work well for me! Thanks Pfizer!",

I've been taking Lyrica started with 75mg twice a day which didn't much of anything. I'm now taking 150mg twice a day, it's somewhat effective but not quite there yet not sure if dosage will have to be increased or I'll have to try something else? I haven't had a lot of the side effects others have mentioned except for memory loss. I've noticed that my short term memory hasn't been the best of late but other than that not really many side effects for me.",
                    "I was just diagnosed with fibromyalgia earlier this year. My old doctor prescribed me Cymbalta and it didn't work. I was off from work for 2 months because of the pain. All I did was layed in bed suffering. Seemed like I would never have my normal life back. I went to another doctor and he prescribed me Lyrica it lessened the pain within a day or two. Now I have some of my life back. I still have a little pain but Lyrica has helped me and changed my life.",
                    "I am 37 with multiple illnesses, fibromyalgia, diabetes, arthritis, and schizophrenia being the tip 4. My Doctor put me on 300 mg of Lyrica 3 times a day. Initially, it stopped my severe symptoms of fibromyalgia, initially. I began to have sleeplessness, which became 3 hrs of sleep every other night. My legs from knee down began to tingle, then it felt like worms crawling in them. I had fuzzy vision, and then 60 voices came out in my head, very loud and clear. My Doctor refused to stop lyrica, I stopped taking it and within a month the side effects disappeared.",
                    "Side effects are worse than Fibromyalgia pain. I've been taking Lyrica for two months. It was a miracle drug for the first few weeks. I've been living with Fibromyalgia for over 35 years and have tried eveything. Anti depressants, excersise, bio-feedback, acupuncture, narcotics, you name it. So I was excited about the dramatic pain reduction from Lyrica.But now I have developed severe muscle weakness, headache, abdominal cramping, acne and difficulty thinking clearly. I can barely hold myself up and I can't lift anything over a few pounds. I have asked my doctor if I can safely stop taking it. I'm just waiting g for him to return my call. I would rather just live with my horrible pain than take any more of these toxic drugs.",
                    "I started with 75 mg of Pregabalin which was raised to 100 mg at bedtime. While it helped me in reducing neck pain and I had substantial reduction in anxiety, it started giving me huge side effects. I started having throat pain, sinusitis, vivid dream early morning and some feeling of dizziness. I also added 5 kg of weight in 2 months. I am now tapering it off gradually. While I would say it worked for my main symptoms, unfortunately it gave me too much side effects.",

After reading reviews I decided to try these tabs I have only taken them for 2 nights ( 1 x 75mg cap) supposed to take 2 daily but I feel I cant wake up in mornings and have to force myself to get out of bed, for a couple hours after i still feel groggy and light headed throughout the day. I dont know whether to perservere with them, I have to say slight improvement with being able to walk with a little less pain. I live in Scotland so my prescription is free for this drug.",

                    "I couldn't remember the last time I had a \"good\" day since diagnosed having Fibromyalgia until 2010, when I was first told about Lyrica by an emergency doctor. The symptoms & pain had got so bad that I drove myself to a Baylor emergency room. Physically and mentally I just felt defeated. I was so stressed out that I developed an ulcer and my potassium/magnesium levels were so low they admitted me several times for as long as a week on time. Bags of blood had to be given and IV fluids. Ugh..I was a hot mess. I don't recall the doctor that introduced me to Lyrica, cause I was in and out a few times, but all I can say is a BIG thank-you. I've been on Lyrica 300mg a day since 2010. I can get what I need done and function like a normal woman.",

Pain Medications (e.g. 10mg Percocet 3-4 times daily) did nothing for my leg pain though helped my back. Lyrica at 150mg twice daily did the trick for my leg nerve pain. The sciatica makes your leg kill while you know nothings wrong with it, so with Lyrica I was amazed to have the leg pain just disappear. No side effects. Sciatica went away by itself after 3 months so no need for Lyrica anymore.",

                    "I had put off taking Lyrica because I was afraid of the side effects. Eventually my nerve pain got to the point where I had no choice. It was completely debilitating. Searing burning pain with no relief. Pain meds didn't touch it. I couldn't sleep because the pain was that bad. My clothes hurt. Soft feather light brushes against my skin stung and BURNED for minutes after contact (more intensely than the consistent present burning). After about three weeks on Lyrica I finally found relief from the worst of it. What I am left with as far as the burning goes is completely tolerable (of course it does nothing for my other symptoms). I'm grateful I caved but am concerned about weight gain & significant cravings for sweets.",

I had to quit my job and have barely been able to keep up with school. I took Lyrica for the first time last night. It caused some upset stomach and a weird buzz, but this morning I woke up feeling like a different person. I am still sore from my muscles being weak and tight all the time, but today is the first day I could feel that I was still sick from a headcold. The pain and discomfort had drowned out any other discomfort. I am hopeful for the first time in months.",

Doctor added Lyrica 75mg 2x day three months ago and the day after I felt euphoric. I felt no pain! After one week some pain came back but no peaks as before. Some weight gain. Want to get off of Oxy and try Lyrica or other non-narcotic drugs.",
                    "I have just started lyrica but so far it works great for my anxiety and my back pain.

Many days could just not make myself move or interact. I had great tired feeling and feeling of pain running thru all parts of my body. Oct 2014 I was lucky. Went to another neuro, prescribed 25mg bid lyrica. In 2 weeks I was myself and have not looked back. Befote this I was an avid runner, pilates, overall exerciser. This came fromnowhere. My lyrica is very low but I just needed it evidently.",

I take Pristiq for maintenance depression medicine and I have to say that after only 3 weeks I have had a 8/10 improvement in trigger point pain, no headaches at all. I do have to say that I will probably come off it though because I have probably gained 5-8 lbs and had a lot of edema of hands and feet.",

I'm going to talk to my doctor about trying something else. Anyone else having problems with weight gain like me? I still need to take an OTC pain medicine with my Lyrica.

Started Lyrica 7 months ago, now at 75mg x 2, twice daily.  Reduced oxycodone from 80mg daily to 40mg daily, tramadol for breakthrough. Hope to increase Lyrica and further reduce oxy. Still do PT for flares. PT is needling with electricity, like acupuncture with electricity running thru needles. It is amazing. No side effects, no weight gain but possibly weight moved to stomach area, no problem. 5ft 3in, 125 lbs Lyrica is no miracle but finally found combo of therapy, meds (Lyrica inc) for some quality of life.",

After taking 50 mg a day, I had no difference, then up to 75mg a day, I still had pain in my wrists (most likely because I work on a computer). But MIRACULOUSLY!, I noticed that along with 'Some' pain, my social anxiety is all but GONE! It's not even the reason I started taking it! As for my wrist pain, we've bumped up the mg to 175 per day and it's only been two days, I'm very groggy in the morning. I didn't get that on the 75mg, but I am confident it will subside. I feel like a new person because the easing of the social anxiety was a total surprise! I would recommend this medicine to ANYONE with pain/social anxiety.",
                    "The first time I used Lyrica I experienced an amazingly profound reaction; layers of depression and anxiety that had built up over several years melted away within minutes. That was years ago and I have since both weaned myself off the drug and restarted taking it again. One thing I rarely see mentioned is the terrifyingly bad withdrawal effect- missing more than one dose for me throws me into the absolute darkest pits of despair. Has anyone else experienced this? When I went off the drug the first time I felt like I had performed a miracle; so strong was the feeling that it took a long time for me to convince myself that things were bad enough to warrant going back on. It still helps, but nothing as miraculous as the first time.",
                    "I have taken 3 x 75mg, and amazed at how well Lyrica worked for me after only taking 1 pill. I feel like I can get comfortable for the first time in years. I have high hopes that this doesn't wear off and I can continue to feel so good. I feel like a miracle, really has helped my all over body pain that I live with for years.",

Because of drug issues in my state, I tapered off of Fentanyl in Feb. I don't think that Lyrica was around before I started the patch. Since the burning pain came back, I was put on Lyrica. It certainly helped and I can live somewhat pain free. Now the doctor has refused to give me a script for Lyrica because he is afraid of repercussions from authorities. I will have to find another doctor. I am dependent on anything that will take this pain away and I hope I can find a doctor who will give me Lyrica again. It is not giving me a good reputation to be constantly changing doctors.",
                    "I have had Fibromyalgia for 4 years now and recently my doctor put me on Lyrica and Cymbalta. The Lyrica is a true lifesaver, it really helps with the pain. But has a lot of side effects. Cons-Feeling like a zombie, shakes, sick at my stomach, itching and blurry eyes, drowsiness. Pros-My pain is almost all gone, happy mood, and can move free with barely any pain. And I feel like I'm on cloud nine and can't wait to go to sleep. Overall, the Lyrica has really helped me a lot. I have tried the generic gabapentin and Savella. They do not work! I'm so happy that I found this website, for all the people whom have aches and pains as well as I. Thank you.",

I put on over 10 lbs in weight when I first started taking it, but with correct food choices , I lost what I had put on and more. I did at first have an increased balance problem. I now take 200mgs of Lyrica 3 times a day because I have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, I take metformin 500mg twice a day and I've got neuropathy pain. I have no side effects with Lyrica now.The other pain meds I am on is a 500mg Fentanyl patch and Arcoxia and Quinine for leg cramps. I live in the UK and get my pain medication free .",

I am very active in trying to keep the fibromyalgia pain as controlled as possible and just not been able to get to a plateau of any type. After a rough adjustment period of about 5 wks I noticed a drastic change in fibro pain. I have gained a significant amount of weight but over the last three months have been able to maintain. Now I am able to start losing the weight but have to be very careful to not take in complex carbohydrates or sugars in afternoon or evening. I have gone to an almost vegetarian style diet and have noticed that the weight just starts to come off with ease but slowly. My balance and vision are the only consistent side effects that I have.",

I also have had to raise the dose to 150mg 3 x daily. It really helped with the insomnia that I had suffered with for 10 years.

I researched ways to counteract the negative effects, and started taking a B6 supplement (for weight gain) and an herbal diuretic (for the bloat). I no longer feel bloated, and the headaches are gone. I'm on my 4th (or 5th?) week of lyrica, and am feeling much better. I don't think I'm still gaining weight, but it's too soon to tell. I wasn't eating any more or less than usual, so if the B6 helps, that would be nice.",

I had been taking 2mg valium everyday for 4 years and was able to taper VERY quickly because of lyrica. Pregabalin helps as a precursor to anxiety; it stops it before it can start, hence the 'PRE'-gabalin. It works on the gaba receptors which are responsible for anxiety. I take 150mg every 8 hours like another reviewer talked about, as I discovered that this was the golden ticket for keeping anxiety away. In Europe, the suggested dose for anxiety is between 400mg-MAX 600mg.",

It began each morning with a small 'knot' in my stomach and then spread during the day causing tightness if chest, throat and often tension down my arms. It was stupid because there seemed to be no trigger, I just felt tension and worry all day. I was placed on a number of drugs, nothing worked. Busiprone helped but I remained anxious for no valid reason. About 18 months ago my doctor gave me Lyrica to try. Within a couple of days everything returned to normal I was even a bit euphoric but that subsided in a week or so. I started out taking Lyrica 50mg twice a day along with 20mg Busiprone twice a day.

Now we are working our way up to doing the same thing for the second dose in the morning. I must admit I am glad she is doing it this way. The first weekend after I started taking it was the first weekend I actually wanted to do something, like move when I did not have to. I've adjusted slowly to the drowsiness and confusion to where it is not nearly as bad as when I first started taking it.

I weened down and stopped taking it a week ago and have already lost 10 lbs and the edema in my legs is gone. If I could take the Lyrica without the weight gain and water retention I would in a heart beat. Hopefully something else will work well for me.",
                    "I have been using Pregabalin for about 6 weeks and I have found it highly effective with my anxiety. I have had very little side effects. I have found that as my anxiety is worry,overthinking and my mind constantly racing. It has slowed down my rate of thinking and worrying, whilst I am aware they are there I find I am able to process them easier and thoughts become less irrational. Coupled with some CBT therapy I find this medication highly effective. The only thing to be wary of is on higher doses (I'm on 75mg) they can have a drunk feeling effect and so I asked my Dr to prescribe me with a lower dosage for daytime (incase of driving or working etc) so I take 25mg in the day and the 75mg at night and find this works for me.",
                    "I was on Lyrica for 5 months. It seemed to help with the pain somewhat for a while, but didn't stop it. Also, I GAINED 40 POUNDS. The doctor told me if I was careful about my eating habits that I wouldn't gain too much weight, but this was not true. After I went off it, I lost 22 pounds in 2 weeks - just from water weight. I have yet to be able to lose the rest of the weight.",
                    "This medication gave me relief but then the major effects came. In my 7th year severe headache every day, retina tore from blood vessels bursting, rash started on ankle spread all the way up my right leg. Finally I decided to find some other way to handle this terrible pain.",
                    "It's like a miracle. I've had almost no side effects and significant pain relief and much better sleep already. I felt a bit lightheaded at first but that is decreasing, and a bit sleepy, also decreasing. It's the first time I've actually felt nearly normal in years.",

Search with google of you dont believe me. I took it for about a year, yes it worked for my problems the first couple but you arent aware yet what it is doing to you. It does permanent brain aging , you will be confused and have terrible memory the rest of your life and this problem becomes very clear to you when you quit. I did for 5 years now and still can't function  That is when you can quit because this drug is highly addictive and the withdrawal when you decide to quit is stuff out of nightmares.

                    "Lyrica is effective against anxiety but I have recently chosen to go off it due to side effects. The side effects are okay (not as bad as the SSRI's) but the main side effects I was concerned about were: Brain Fog (I became much dumber), forgetfulness, loss of physical sensations including less feeling during sex. All in all I would rate it better than any SSRI. ",

I've been taking it at night and experienced involuntary tremors, muscle spasms, twitching of my fingers, arms and legs.The twitching is scary! It's involuntary, I have no control of my body when this happens. My leg started twitching and it stuck straight up, waking me from a deep sleep! The twitching and tremors linger all day. Lyrica caused severe swelling in my feet,ankles and legs. It's very uncomfortable. I also experienced loss of balance, dizziness, blurred vision and ulcer sores on my tongue and in my mouth. I felt far better before taking this medicine. Needless to say I'm no longer taking it.",

He got overruled by a doctor with a brain, but doctor Weisman seems to think Lyrica does't work for the treatment of peripheral neuropathy his reasoning was because the doctor didn't put diabetic in front of peripheral neuropathy. Lyrica won't work the thing this doctors doesn't understand is that the Lyrica is treating only the peripheral neuropathy the diabetic part mean nothing except that the peripheral neuropathy is being cause by the diabetes. If this Doctor had taken just say five minutes and read a little bit more of the notes!",

I HIGHLY recommend this.",

I am now using it on my neck (cream) my PCP told me it is one of those medications that the more you use it the more benefit you will get....and the less the burn.

                    "I recommend this product if you have pain. I would like to say that this is the best of two evils, because it burns at the start when you first start to use it. It is really important to read the instructions to use it properly. But nice to relocate the pain a little. For my part, the product works very well. However, if you do not have major pain, the product will be worse for you. Anyway, a great product to measure your pain level ",
                    "Capsaicin cream works amazingly well for my sciatica. I apply on the side of my leg, foot, lower back, or wherever I have pain. So, the version 0.1% is too strong. You should buy the .025% version at  Look for Rugby Capsaicin 0.025%. There is also a product called Zostrix which you can find with .025% Also: use plastic gloves to apply. You are applying essence of hot peppers to your skin and if you transfer it to your eyes it will really burn. It stays on your skin, so after 8-12 hours I scrub the area down with a soapy washcloth. It reheats if you sweat or take a bath.  Without scrubbing it will reactivate if your skin gets wet.",

My toes and bottoms of my feet near the toes were (and still are) completely numb and I have frequent pain and burning in those areas. I bought the Capsaicin cream without a prescription at Walmart, for $10. I applied it liberally to both feet and massaged the areas well. I then put on white ankle socks so I could walk on my wood floors without leaving residue. I did not experience any bad side effects--no burning, etc. The relief from my nerve pain subsided very quickly. After about 15 minutes, I removed the socks and elevated my legs. The medication definitely provided great relief. DO wash your hands thoroughly with soap.",

Severe burning, stinging pain. Even showering to wash the medication off was painful. I had to use calamine lotion to counter the effects. Perhaps my skin is more sensitive than others out there, but I would use caution with this medication.",
                    "If I could post a picture of what this cream did to me! Picture the worst burning EVER! It took several wipes and a shower to get it off my back and it still had bad pain from middle to the tailbone area which was red. I was in SO much pain from this medicine it felt like my skin was on fire. I tried putting lidocaine spray on it and the the spray just melted onto my skin",

My physician prescribed 3 kinds of tablets (tramadol, carbamazepine and paracetamol) which gave relief to some extent. Thereupon I searched \"PHN\" on internet and found capsaicin and, on this website. I asked for an additional prescription of capsaicin (0.075 %) which I now apply 4 times a day. I feel 90% back to normal and I too can say: Got my life back!",

                    "I'm 61, female, and have had arthritis in my hands, knees and feet over the past ten years. Since using capsaicin over the last two years I've found tremendous relief. It burned when I first started using it, but the burning \"wore off\" after a week, and I find it totally painless to use. I apply it in the morning as well as in the evening. I learned to NOT use my fingers to apply it. Instead, I use the topside of my thumbs, between the first and second joints from the tip of the thumb. That way, I don't accidentally get capsaicin in my eyes (especially when applying my contact lenses an hour later!). I highly recommend capsaicin and suggest sticking with it, even if at first it burns. It's well worth trying.",

If you like hot showers in the morning it may warm up a bit while in the hot shower. I wont live without it. I only use it at bed time and when the pain is to great to fall asleep.",

                    "This works for nerve pain, but is waaay stronger than Bengay, Tiger Balm & the sort. Honestly, this should have a more serious alert on the bottle. My dr had me start nerve de-senitizing-i think its called. I have two types of nerve pain & the pain can get real ugly. I used a brush on my hamstrings and adductors to \"densitize\". I was still just going crazy in pain, meditated-well tried. Prayed & am now suffering the consequences of putting Capzasin HP on my Scrubbed legs...maybe 30 min past the scrubbing. Honestly, this pain rivals my nerve pain-awful close anyway. Good product, but BE careful, w/kids, pets, older folks & especially people in crazy pain undertreated by a propaganda driven war on pain medicine & the Pain Drs.",
                    "I began using Capsaicin-HP for severe pain from by neck to top of my buttocks caused by fibromyalgia. I found it to decrease my pain as much or better than non-narcotic oral medications. Then I had an injury to my back which required a lumbar spinal fusion at L5-S1. Capsaicin again helped my pain incredibly. I applied everyday 2 to 4 times a day before surgery and then limited used to areas of neck and back away from incision until site healed, then resumed use over entire back. It does get very \"hot\" at times, but I learned not to focus on that and realized that was the time it seemed to be removing pain the best. I am a nurse and eventually learned to allow it to \"heat\" which typically lasts about 30 min and I got the best results.",

A bottle of Absorbine (not Jr.), produced in 2000 was in the medicine cabinet and contains capsaicin, along with herbals and other ingredients. After application, the pain almost immediately was reduced from 10 to about 7 (still taking Advil).  But about the 4th application of the Absorbine described above, noticed pain subsided for a longer period. Now we are unable to locate Absorbine with like ingredients. Found a creme called Capzicin and it seems to being working satisfactorily (2 times a day), along with the 400 mg Advil (taken every 8 hrs.).",

I used gloves and put the Trixaicin directly on the pain. That caused the Trixaicin to heat up so much it burned. Not unbearably but it did cause me to wonder if it heated up worse on the pain because that was the most painful spot.",
                    "I just found out about Capzasin today and tried it for the first time for my fibromyalgia. I have OTC .025% and while I have only been using it a few hours I am so excited to have found it. The burning sensation is mild compared to my pain and doesn't bother me in the least. I tried it on one thigh to start and make sure it didn't bother me too much. I had so much relief in the one leg I couldn't wait to use it on the other.  My only complaint is the smell. It has a strong scent of menthol. I am in most pain at night when trying to sleep so I think I will use it then. I did read that showering can be uncomfortable but also that a milk compress helps.",
                    "It does produce a burning sensation the first two weeks. After that it is a gentle warming sensation and really eases the pain in my back injury. It is absolutely worth putting up with the initial burning sensation.",
                    "I applied two doses the first day I got it, to my thumbs, about eight hours apart. Yes, it's true that it's easy to get in your eyes, nose or mouth, and it burns. Even after a shower, I could still feel it on my skin. I expected to have to reapply it each day. But here's the funny part: The pain in my hands is nowhere near as intense as it was, even two days after that initial application. Why? It's welcomed, but kinda weird.",
                    "Works best after a few doses.",
                    "I prefer the initial pain of application than the pain in my spine, hip, and legs. Be careful going out in the sun, even the day after application some residual effects will be felt. Wear latex or plastic gloves when applying and wash your hands after applying. If you touch a part of your body that has capzasin on it, be sure to rewash your hands and DO NOT touch your eyes without washing your hands!",
                    "I have had PHN for 2 years and have been in extreme pain. My Internist told me about Zostrix HP along with the warning to be careful applying it and to wash it off my hands. I started using latex gloves to administer it on my body and after 2 weeks my pain began to subside. I am now at a very manageable pain level. On a 1-10 with 10 being the highest pain I am now finally at 0.5 (point five) after 2 years of being at a pain level of 10 day and night. I use it sparingly (pea sized amount) 3-4 x a day. I highly recommend it if you had shingles and then PHN.",
                    "I have been suffering from sciatica for about 10 years now. It has gradually gotten worse. Ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and naproxin no longer help to relieve the pain in my left thigh. I have found that a generic capsaicin patch placed on my lower back relives the pain. It doesn't fully disappear but it becomes a lot more bearable (0.025%)",
                    "Used it last night for knee pain and it started burning so bad it felt like my skin was melting off! I would rather deal with the knee pain than ever use this stuff again!",
                    "Althought it does not last long, it does help with the pain. I use it on my lower back & my neck for arthritis. My lower back has developed a rash after several uses. I have left it off for several days to see if the rash goes away.",
                    "If you are anyone that loves to hit the gym hard like I do, you gotta know what muscle pain feels like. No one can really tell or know when you have went too far because you are suppose to hurt and be in pain. If you are in pain, it means that your body muscles are stretching and you are making room for more muscles to fit. Many people don't understand that when you go home then that's when the adrenaline wears off and you start to think \"I went a little too far that time\".  Since most of what I do is shoulder press, I have to say that this back patch for pain has saved me from several night where I wouldn't have been able to sleep. Absorbine Jr pain patches for back work quickly, absorb fast, and give me pain relief fast no matter what."

                    "Side effects are a bit annoying sometimes, but it's working for me so I'll put up with it. A side note- I'm taking this in addition to Wellbutrin and Cymbalta. All for my RSD... I have only had intermittent pain and it was extremely mild in comparison to before this combination.",
                    "I have suffered severe pain for 20 years following a motorcycle accident. During this time I have tried every sort of pain relief available to me, mainly narcotic drugs which I found as bad as the pain itself. Earlier this year I was prescribed Lyrica as far as pain relief goes...fantastic. After a few months (1x 75mg cap per day) I experienced total confusion and was unable to perform my daily tasks at work or at home. I was becoming agitated and experienced suicidal thoughts. Things returned to normal after a week or so of not taking Lyrica. Because it worked so well I am tempted to give it another go. It was just so good to not feel the pain anymore.",
                    "For those of you having trouble paying for lyrica, my doctor recommended I use the prescription card they offer on their website. . Hope this helps!",
                    "For the past 3 years I have been dealing with nerve pain left from shingles in my neck. I have tried EVERYTHING for this pain including injections and narcotics. Nothing really helped unless I was a zombie. I am allergic to a lot of medications including Tegretol and Neurontin. So when my neurologist suggested I try this medication I was VERY skeptical. I have been on this medicaton for a week now. I started on 25mg twice a day and felt some relief. I thought it was in my head. Now I am on 50mg twice a day and I can't believe the difference. I am relieved I can finally get my life back. I am a mother of 2. I did not realize how much the pain had taken over my life until now.",
                    "This works within 30 mins. After the first pill my legs stopped burning and tingling one of the only medicines I ever found that worked so fast.",
                    "Hi I have been on pregabalin for over a year. Started at 75 mgs and thought it was going to work but it only lasted 1  day. I got up to 150 mgs twice a day with no positive effect. I am now down to 100 mgs twice a day. I have had no weight gain. I am on a few other meds but I still suffer daily with this awful anxiety. I am trying transcranial magnetic simulation right now and have about 3 weeks of treatments left, it hasn't helped me yet. The only thing that works for me is benzodiazepines and I become tolerant very quickly.",
                    "I have a pinched sciatic nerve in my lower back due to a compression fracture, and also severe nerve damage in my left arm. After being on different narcotics that didn't work, I gave up and just lived with the aching in my arm that never stopped. My Doctor put me on Lyrica, and I swear, I started crying because I had NO pain in my arm for the first time since my accident: 5 years. Lyrica has been a God send for me. It helps both my back and my arm. When my Doctor increases the dose, the side effects go away after 2 weeks. I recommend this medicine to anybody with nerve damage.",
                    "Been suffering with low back pain worse in the buttocks and sometimes hips. Numbness, tingling in both legs. Underwent a laminotomy for spinal compression due to synovial cyst and facet joint disease. Have a couple herniated discs, but left alone in surgery...felt I would recover from this on its own as I have very mild degenerative disc disease.. Since taking Lyrica for only 3 days at a low dose my pain has subsided enough so I could actually leave my home to go out to dinner. Pain went from about \"10\" at its worst down to about a m \"2-3\".  I would say try it as it may work for you. Side effects are less than gabapention.",
                    "I have had fibromyalgia for as long as I can remember. The pain was so bad 6 months ago from too much stress that I wasn't sleeping which made it worse. I had to quit my job and I would just lay in bed and cry moving my heating pad all around my body. It was a nightmare. I wanted my life back. I found a doctor to do all the tests and diagnose me. I tried gabapentin first and did nothing for me and I was a zombie so we switched to Lyrica. I take 300mg a day. It's not perfect ALL the time. Some days I am back in pain. And three days before my period I'm in a lot of pain. It has also helped my anxiety and insomnia. For me, the dizziness went away after a month. And the other side effects are minimal.",
                    "I was prescribed Lyrica (pregabalin) about 6 months ago. I was so shocked by the feelings of unreality it initially caused that I quickly stopped taking it. My fibromyalgia got so bad at the end of the year, that I decided to try it again.  I take low doses, 25 mg 2x a day, sometimes a 50 mg. The effect sets in within hours. My fibromyalgia pain is almost completely gone. A late evening dose allows me to sleep longer. I do feel strange when I take it and my intellectual capacity is quite affected, but the lack of distraction by the pain and a better social interaction with increased confidence levels makes up for that. I have to make sure that authorities and decision-making bodies are aware of my reduced competence, and close friends should know of these side effects, so that they can make allowances for any out-of-character behaviour on my part i.e. my inability to repair their car stereo.",
                    "Works very well, the only draw back is weight gain.",
                    "This medicine helped my problem - 2 herniated discs and a pinched nerve, but it gave me really bad stomach ache had to stop it right away.",
                    "I have had GAD for 8 years, I have tried lots of medication for this with some helping a little, and some not at all. I was started on Pre Gabling two months ago and for me, it was a miracle, I have my life back! I know the Doctors say meds arent the answer for GAD but they are for me, I have had CBT, counselling, hypnotherapy, and nothing worked. But with pre gablin I have been on holiday with no probs, was actually able to relax for the first time in 8 years. I can go into any social scene and be really calm and enjoy it. All I hope is that it lasts and I dont get used to it. All my friends and family have said how well i am and relaxed and happy I appear. And I really am.",
                    "I have type 1 diabetes for 25 yrs. Neuropathy diagnosis for 16 yrs. Was on gabapentin for 16 yrs and it quit working for me. 2 months ago my doctor put me on Lyrica and what a difference my pain in feet and legs is all but gone! Thank you Pfizer for Lyrica it has made such a difference in my quality of life!",
                    "Terrible Med! Years after taking for a few weeks I still have seriously blurry vision. Seems to be permanent. Everything about this drug was far worse than the problems it was supposed to address.  Do not take this toxic garbage. My Dr insisted I had to give it time to work... Any more time and I'd likely be dead or blind! Avoid like the plague and/or carefully read of myriad side effects and hope you can stop in time to avoid permanent problems from side effects. IMO this med s/b taken off the market!",
                    "I have suffered with severe pain from neurofibromatosis. After the first day of taking Lyrica I felt wonderful. A bit sleepy and forgetful. I have not noticed an increase in appetite but I have noticed food tastes better. I am also sleeping harder and it is hard to wake up. After 4 days I am so happy to have found this.",
                    "Makes me swell up, eat too much, bump into things, forget words and does nothing for my pain. Stupid, expensive drug. I've been taking 150mg. 2X per day for almost three months. It doesn't work.",
                    "I feel the need to warn everybody about the side effects and how difficult it can be to get off this drug. I've been on it for approximately 8 years before the side effects really started kicking in. Began as morning anxiety attacks, severe GI upset, mood swings and low to mid level depression. Tried changing the schedule from twice a day to three times a day. It helped at first but about two months later my body began anticipating new schedule and the side effects would start kicking in about an hour before next dose. Its taken me 8 months to get dosage down from 225 mg a day to 75mg a day and every step down has been sheer hell. Every step down leads to a period of depression, and it gets worse the closer you get to zero.",
                    "Living with polyneuropathy, Fibromyalgia, spinal stenosis and lots of arthritis is difficult. I started on 200 mg twice a day then increased to 300 mg three times a day. I developed a problem with my kidneys, not from Lyrica, and had to decrease the dose to 300 mg twice a day. I have to say that I get little pain relief from this med but do get a feeling of well-being, or contentment. So, I call it my little happy pill. When I miss a dose, I notice I'm a bit depressed. It's not an antidepressant but it works that way for me. Thank you",
                    "Hi, I was prescribed Pregabalin about 8 years ago and have been taking it ever since. I suffer quite badly from anxiety and agitation and I can't tell you just how much this medication has helped. Even if I could just about get through the daytime without it, when I am asleep and my mind can follow any path it wishes to, it chooses to go down really bad avenues and I wake up feeling absolutely dreadful and this reached a terrible climax 8 years ago and resulted in me not eating at all and therefore losing a frightening amount of weight. However on my last pharmacy visit, I was a generic version of the drug which has not worked at all and so I am hoping my GP will put me back on Lyrica. If not, I am very fearful for the future.",
                    "I started taking Lyrica about 8 months ago. In about 3 days I had felt a significant change. It was working great for my Fibro, but I also have spinal arthritis. It did nothing for that or my sciatica. Finally I was bumped up to high dose, but do to other things in life I had to stop because of financial difficulties. I couldn't even afford copays. So I'm on gabapentin and it barely works. If I could, I would get back on Lyrica!                Thank you all for sharing your experiences!",
                    "I hate to write this comment, but it has to be done. I have been on Lyrica for 5 years. I now take 150mg 3x day. At first this was a dream medicine f or me. It relieved the aches and body spasms almost instantly. I could sleep at night, and woke up pain free and was able to live a somewhat normal life. I did however gain 40 lbs. I am now experiencing severe depression, and I feel it is the Lyrica. I ran out once and experienced the worst withdrawal symptoms. I felt like I was dying and the pain was severe. This medicine is wonderful, but getting off of it is very hard. ",
                    "I have been taking Lyrica for about 4 months now. While it does help with the pain, I feel like I'm walking on pillows. I'm constantly hungry, sleepy, dizzy and I feel like I'm drunk. I worked VERY hard to lose the weight that I gained when I was pregnant and since I've been on this medication, I've put it all back on and then some (40 lbs). It's hard to say if the pain is better or if I'm so caught up with the side effects that I don't care. I'm being weened off of it right now and being put on a different medicine. I'd rather go back to the opiates and itch like crazy.",
                    "Taking it with ssri . best to take it at a low dose. find the right balance as you don't need it to overpower the ssri.",
                    "Lyrica has been a big life changer for me!! Thank goodness I found a Dr who prescribed me this. I was in terrible pain and had bad fatigue to where I couldn't live life-- I have 3 kids who I couldn't keep up with. I can't say that everything is perfect now but it's pretty darn close! I hardly have any pain and my fatigue has decreased. I take 75 mg twice a day. I pray for everyone with Fibro to keep working at it until you find something that works.",
                    "I have L5/S1 disk herniation and this medication had saved my life, I can walk and stand for long periods of time again thanks to this medication.  This had been a life saver. I use the Co pay card from the Lyrica Web site.",
                    "Lyrica 300mg 2 per day for peripheral neuropathy. Neuropathy pain is bad but this does help, better than gabapentin and others I have taken, and the list is mighty long! ",
                    "I just started using Lyrica but I still sometimes have to take a Aleve with it some nights because I cannot sleep due to fibromyalgia pain.",
                    "Pregabalin is great. Got it for damaged nerve pain but was blown away by its other effects. Suffered from depression and anxiety for all my life. I am 41 within 3 days of taking this medicine it lifted all those years of misery away. It was like it melted away layers and layers of dark misery. Honestly pregabalin at a dose of 200mg 3 times a day is great.",
                    "I have been using Lyrica for 1 year or so for FMS. It has taken care of the larger muscle pains but does NOTHING for the life-sucking body ache that I have suffered with since 1978. Nor does it stop my back pain. I take hydrocodone to deal with the body ache/back pain. I have good days and bad days still, but when the day is good, very little muscle pain. Downside: I have gained a great deal of weight. Also there seems to be a great deal of fluid retention with Lyrica, a diuretic helps. ",
                    "I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia three years ago. when it started to get worse (about two years ago) my life came to a halt. I almost never left my bed and I moved as little as possible because the pain was so severe. My doctor prescribed Lyrica for me and it changed my life. I still have good and bad days, but I can bear the bad days because of Lyrica. It gave me my life back. When I first took it, I did have the \"high\" feeling the side effects mention, but it was only my first two doses. Also, I HAVE to take it with food, otherwise I get extremely nauseous and dizzy. I have gained a lot of weight (about 40 lbs), but I also have CFS which has caused me to have a very sedentary lifestyle. overall, Lyrica saved my life.",
                    "I found Pregabalin help the pain from my spinal stenosis, but the anxiety and depression that it caused meant I had to reduce the amount I took. I think it works for some people, but anyone suffering from depression it makes it 100 times worse.",
                    "I have had FMS for 4 years but was not officially diagnosed until 1 year ago. Since that time I have taken several medications. My Doctor and I are trying to find which drug or combination of drugs will help. I took Lyrica for 5 months and had some serious side effects, 40lbs weight gain, swelling in my hands, feet and ankles, blurred vision. I was not pain free and the cost per month was half of my rent.",
                    "Lyrica made me unbearably tired and nauseous - and that's just on 25 mg twice a day. Had to stop taking it. Will never take it again.",
                    "I love Lyrica, it works well.",
                    "I have nerve damage in my L4 / L5 disc and down my leg. Out of all my medicines the one that helps me the most is Lyrica. I can tell if I miss a pill because my pain goes up. The pain medicines just hide the pain and not that well on cold and rainy days. Lyrica helps the pain - it is the best nerve medicine I have ever had. I gained 40 lbs. I have been on Neurontin with lots of side effects. As much as I hate the 40 lbs I'm glad to have the medicine.",
                    "Eased diabetic nerve pain somewhat but caused \"jerking motion\" so severe that I could not feed myself. This was with only one month's use. Discontinued use and jerking getting much better.",
                    "I have just started started on Lyrica 75 mg. Taking it once in the night. It seems to be working. My pain is down a bit and am able to do a lot more work than before. Also don't get as tired as before. Just got back from visiting turkey and the week I spent there was hectic. Lots and lots of walking. Don't think I would have been able to do it without this medication. I have fibromyalgia since the last 2 and half years and had shyed away from this medication because of the side effects. However I was in so much pain a month ago that I finally decided to give it a try. I don't regret it and am hoping that the effect of the medicine will last. And I'll have a normal life again. ",
                    "Used Lyricia for treatment of shingles. Have had shingles for almost four months. Symptoms began with terrible burning in both breast's and in back directly behind each breast. I started taking Lyrica twice a day (every 12 hours) for about a week and get much relief for about 10 hours. Then the burning sensations return. Started a couple of new drugs today in addition to the Lyrica. Hope to get serious relief and complete recovery.",
                    "I started taken lyrica for trigger spots (burning painful hot spots through out my back) plus lower back pain. I began taking 150mg 2x a day. It was wonderful, no more daily nagging pain. However, the side affects started to out weigh the pain relief. I had to start taking a water pills because of the water retention, my memory& cognitive thinking were really effected. On three separate occasions, I was sent home from work because I was so drowsy I kept falling asleep. I was staggering, slurring my speech. My supervisor thought I had been drinking. It was very embarassing. If I did not have all these side effects, I would've stayed on these meds but it was getting out of control-my weight has sky rocketed also. I'm weening off.Pain is back.",
                    "Helps decrease the amount of nerve pain but does not eliminate it completely. Decreases about 50%. Side effects noticed: blurred vision and constipation.",
                    "All I can say is I love it. I am scared to take meds doctors give me but my anxiety is that bad I thought I can not go on like this I have to do something about it. I started of on 50 at night just to see how I would cope it chilled me out and when I woke I didn't feel heavy so that was good. Because when I take a pill on the night and next day get up heavy makes my anxiety mad. But started on 50. Now am on 100s 3 times a day. Can talk to people can go for hair cut can sit in the same room as people look at there face when talking to me. With out almost passing out. If I was to say if you wanted to get anxiety under control these are well worth ago. Plus I also recommend propranolol beta blockers 40mg 4 times a day They are great as well",
                    "I started taking Lyrica for pain from Hashimoto's disease. At first I had a lot of energy. Then, I leveled off and the fatigue is back. The pain is about 85% gone! I did experience a huge emotional roller coaster at first and even had suicidal thoughts for the first time ever. I figured it was just the adjustment period and gave it more time. It has been about 2 months now and I just wish I could figure out if it is the Lyrica causing the fatigue. I ache too much without it to test the theory.",
                    "I was taking Lyrica for several years. I stopped taking it because of the price. My prescription medications are covered by Medicare & other insurance, but I do not believe in indiscriminately spending Medicare money. So, again, only because of the cost, I stopped. My feet went wild, burning pain, could not even have the bed covers on them at night. I got my Rx for Lyrica renewed and when it came I first took 2 caps in order to see if it would get started again. It did! I'm going to be doing a bit of research on the internet for a lower cost alternative. Gabapentin looks good at the moment, maybe on my next doc appt. I'll try it. I gave it only a 9 because of the cost, but for effectiveness I'd give it as high a number as allowed.",
                    "Lyrica has been a life saver for me. Prior to being prescribed Lyrica, I was living with terrible burning pain because of vulvodynia. Lyrica provided me with the relief I did not get from any other drugs. I can now enjoy life with little to no pain. I am so thankful that I was prescribed Lyrica.",
                    "I have severe neuropathy, and I take a cocktail of pain medicines. This medicine is a very important link to fight pain so I can still go to work. It is addictive and hard to kick, but I don't plan on kicking it anytime soon as I need too badly.",
                    "This medication has helped my back pain a great deal",
                    "I have had severe Fibromyalgia for years. Was so excited when they finally came out with Lyrica because it was \"supposed\" to help with the nerve pain involved. When I first started the pain I was in was about a 9 out of 10 in intensity. After a year of being on the Lyrica it might have gone to a 7 or 8 but it caused me to put on about 40 lbs, my skin changed, and caused a lot of other side effects. I finally told my doctor it wasn't worth all the side effects if it wasn't going to help the pain.",
                    "Lyrica put me into a more restful sleep. Waking up at 5:30am for work is very difficult on this medication and I feel fatigued still throughout the day. I still ache from my fibromyaliga on this medication. I can't remember how long I was on this medication. I went off it and started taking Savella. Savella took care of the pain from the condition but now I'm having side effects from the medicine. Now I don't know what I'm going to take.",
                    "I am 51 yrs old and I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia about a month ago. My doctor prescribed Lyrica. My Mother also had fibromyalgia and was taking Lyrica. She suffered a lot of the sleepy/out of it side effect and didn't like that at all. It did ease some of her pain, but she was not willing to increase the dosage. I started taking Lyrica when diagnosed, and within just a day or two I felt incredible! I didn't hurt when I woke up in the morning. I could move and do regular activities around the house without the horrible pain I had before. I did have some of the loopy/confusion/unable to focus for a short time, but that went away. I'm so thankful for Lyrica. I can live and not just exist.",
                    "I started taking Lyrica about 5 months ago. It has worked great for relieving my pain from fibro, however I have experienced bladder retention at times and since I also suffer from anxiety, depression, and PTSD, over the last couple months, I have been having really scary thoughts of suicide. (I would never, ever do that. I know myself well enough to know that I would never do anything. I lost my husband that way.) I feel like it has increased my symptoms of depression and PTSD. I stopped taking it 2 days ago and while I am in a lot of pain, it's better than the side effects of this medicine. I'm going to my Dr in a couple days and I'm going to talk to her about another option.",
                    "I have suffered extreme damage to my trigeminal nerve on the left side of my face due to dental implants. I since had three teeth pulled and one implant taken out. My life was full of unbearable pain and suffering. After 17 doctors/dentists, I finally went to an neurologist who put me on Lyrica. After fighting with my insurance company for two weeks I was approved. Within one week I have minimal pain! It is a miracle for me. I take 25mg three times a day. Love it! Thank you!",
                    "I was diagnosed with Degenerative disc disease in 1999, and then in 2009 I was diagnosed with Spinal Stenosis, Neuropathy & Sciatica. I was practically crippled and couldn't walk by 2011. My Doctor decided to try me on Lyrica and I can say with 100% truth and honesty that 4 days after I started it, on just 75mgs a day, I can walk again. I am still walking now in 2013 but just in short jaunts. I'm glad this pill exists.",
                    "I was on Lyrica for a total of four days. It got rid of my pain (almost completely!) but the side effects were terrible. I got anxious, depressed, confused, blurred vision, and a general \"high\" (not a good high) feeling. I felt very dumb and had a lot of trouble articulating my thoughts. Overall a terrible drug for me. The side effects out weighed the benefits of this medication. ",
                    "I was having terrible pain with sciatica. At times I was in so much pain just walking in a shopping centre I just had to stop.  Also driving the car my leg was in so much pain I had to lift it up with my hand to ease the pain. No medication I had taken stopped the pain which was unbearable and I couldn't sleep at night, My Doctor prescribed Lyrica and at first I did not like it because it made my feet puffy however I went back on it with the prescribed dose of 150mg twice a day. Now I have to try to recall the pain because I have no sciatic pain at all with this drug.  It also had the side effect of making me a bit \"dreamy\" which I rather like but I do forget names and things I am saying which I do not like. Can't have it all though!",

                    "I had pain shooting throughout my body for a week. One day it would be in my legs, then my torso, then my arm, my throat, my ear and then shingles surfaced on my torso-right side. I took an antiviral for the shingles, and Neurontin for pain. The blisters were painful and they went away in a couple weeks but the pain remained and I took Neurontin in high doses, with Tylenol so I could sleep but my right leg hurt all the time. I couldn't walk up/down stairs on that leg, or sleep on either of side without pain and I am a side sleeper so I was miserable. A neurologist was skeptical that the cause was shingles but prescribed Lyrica and it was magic! 75 mg once a day and the pain is 95% gone, 6 months later still works.",

                    "Not only do I have diabetic neuropathy, I also have nerve damage on both sides from total loss of L5S1 disc. I could not live without Lyrica. Just don't miss a dose, it's not pleasant. Lyrica doesn't stop it all, but I know how much it does stop and won't ever be without it",
                    "50 mg twice a day was tolerable but didn't do much for central cord syndrome pain. 75 mg three times a day isn't helping with pain so far, makes me dizzy and puts me to sleep most of the day. I got leg spasms at night after not taking it. Walking around a little stopped the spasms. I'd like to give it a better try, but the side effects prevent me from functioning.",
                    "I started on Lyrica 6 weeks ago started on 25mg for one week, then to 50mg for one week, and then 75 mg twice a day but, but that high didn't suit me so I took a 75mg in the morning and 50mg in the evening. Currently I'm feeling spaced all the time, gaining weight each day, and kind of depressed, but my psychiatrist said that could be anxiety coming through. I have been taking Xanax also for about 6 years, before that I was tried on Lexapro and went crazy on it. Also the Xanax was a disaster long term, as they become very addictive. Well the moral of the story is I'm praying for the Lyrica to work.",
                    "I have had chronic back pain for around 5 years and didn't start receiving treatment until 2 years ago when the pain was already out of control. I got a new Auto CPAP last week as well as started taking Lyrics 75mg twice a day and I already notice a difference. So far my appetite has decreased. The first 3 days I was only taking one a day and incredibly tired having to take naps on my lunch hour. The extra sleepiness has subsided substantially even while increasing the dose. It has not been a week yet but I can feel a difference. The numbness, tingling and muscle spasms that keep me awake or start by the time I get out of bed have decreased as well as the pain. I'm looking forward and hoping it works out.",

I now take Lyrica, 1 at 8 am, 1 at 3pm and 3 at bedtime. This dose was gradually increased over time. Although very fatigued I am 50% better and am able to function better. The initial drowsiness subsided after a couple of months. Do still have a bit of brain fog, not sure if it's the Lyrica or lack of sleep.",
                    "The side effects were too hard to tolerate, for me to continue to take it for more than a couple of months.  Nausea, dizziness, headache, upset stomach, and a terrible skin reaction that left many scars on my entire body are in addition to the mental slowness, confusion and increased depression suffered while taking Lyrica.

The surgeon removed the cyst, realigned my vertebrae and used instrumentation to hold the vertebrae in place. Unfortunately, after the surgery, the most painful part was the pain in my arms. I had taken Lyrica in the past for a very short time and it caused weight gain. I kept the medication on hand because it was expensive. After 2 trips back into the ER, the surgeon wanted me to take the Lyrica. His RN said that I will know if it will work in 1 1/2 - 2 days. She was right, thank God! The pain decreased dramatically. I'll deal with the weight gain later.",
                    "I have been on Lyrica for a little over a year now. My doctor started me on it as soon as it was approved. At first, with the smaller dosage it did nothing. Now I take 225mg in the morning and another 225mg at bedtime. It has helped me sleep at night a little better but other than that, I haven't had the relief as some have described here. It's frustrating to say the least. Considering the fact that I am also on Xanax, Clonazepam, Hydrocodone, Tramadol, Trazadone and Savella. Some I only take 1 x per day, others 3 x per day and a couple 2x per day. Lyrica was added after Tramadol. I had no side effects from it and it did not interfere with the other medicines that I am on. I was losing weight easily before, but now it is a bit harder. I'm staying on it.",

Since I have been on the higher dosages, it has definitely made a difference. I still have some really bad days of fibromyalgia pain, but those usually precede getting my period.",
                    "It took a couple of days but it did stop my restless legs.  The downside is that in the few weeks I was taking it, I put on about a stone in weight.  It's good for making you sleepy.  I now use tramadol and am trialling trazodone.",
                    "Lyrica is a great medicine. It is very expensive but highly effective for Anxiety and works totally differently to other medicines. Unlike SSRI's it gives me no sexual side effects and no feelings of apathy.  It's highly effective for anxiety. I take 300mg daily. At this dose I still have some anxiety but it is greatly reduced.  I have no serious side effects other than an increase in appetite which may lead to weight gain. Dizziness and feelings of being 'high' pass in a week. I highly recommend giving Lyrica a go. Having your life back is worth the cost.",
                    "I've suffered with widespread pain my whole life along with extreme difficulty sleeping. Took Lyrica (300mg/day) for 3 years & it worked initially to calm the aching but became less effective after a few months. It helped me get restful sleep & calmed my anxiety but I couldn't think, had very poor memory & felt very depressed (got worse overtime). When I stopped taking it I had the worst withdrawal symptoms imaginable (way worse than benzos). I literally felt worse than dying & all I could think of was when the hellish experience would stop . Took about a month to start feeling better & several months to really feel better. Doctors say that Lyrica doesn't have withdrawal (or it should be minor) but that's rubbish. Withdrawal eventually passes",

A week ago my dosage increased to 150mg twice a day and my back pain is good and sciatica is gone. Additionally my general anxiety is eased. There's no worsening of my depression symptoms (I manage depression/anxiety with efexor). Aside from mild sedation I've had a great result from lyrica so far. Hope it continues working this well! :)",
                    "Although for some reason Lyrica seemed to make my pain medications oxycontin last longer or work better, Lyrica made my legs swell up. The pain was unbearable from the swelling and in the end I had a lot of broken veins. If you're swelling up and your doctor says \"oh, you just ate too much salt this week\" get another opinion to get off Lyrica and see if the swelling doesn't stop. I wish I could take it, it really did help. Good luck to all with Fibromyalgia, it's an awful and painful disease.",

Prior to Lyrica I was taking 60mg/day of methadone with significant relief but with plenty of room for improvement. With the addition of Lyrica to my Methadone regimen, my relief now stands at approx. 80% analgesia which is a God send considering the severity of my pain. As a welcome side benefit, significant anxiety, hot flushes and insomnia were relieved as well. For me, Lyrica has been something of a miracle drug.",
                    "Seems to help. I take 100 mg, twice a day in a combination with Lortab 10. Have not had any of the listed side effects other than, I tend to anger quicker, nothing that can't be controlled.",

Those medicines worked great, however, they do not hold up as they claim. My doctor put me on Lyrica at 300mg a day and what a difference it has made! My mobility is much better as well as my mental outlook on life. This medicine seems to do the job. I like it and recommend it.",

Doc finally had me gave me lyrica (after I had to try everything else first) ams at first, it worked. I did feel \"high\" but that slowly went away. After approx. 2 weeks of 75mg a day, I had horrible side effects..feeling depressed, like people were talking about me or didnt like me, had no memory or wasn't able to concentrate but what finally got me to stop was I had thoughts of driving my car off of a hill that i drive down daily. I may suffer from pain so intensely that I cry all the time, can't leave my home at times or feel blue because of it, but I had never thought of taking my own life. I stopped immediately despite my docs orders.",

The doctor had said that it was the worse shingles he had seen. After the scabs had gone I was Prescribed lyrica.  I take 300mg at night and 25mg in the morning. It has been 5 weeks since I developed shingles and my face and scalp are still numb. I have intermittent pain shocks. I believe the lyrica is effective as I can't imagine what it would be like if I didn't take it. I'm not sure how long I am suppose to take this but I imagine by other feedbacks that it could be months.",
                    "I had shingles for two and a half weeks, then experienced severe nerve pain after the sores began to heal. My doctor originally prescribed Vicodin, then switched me to Lyrica in anticipation of my return to work. Lyrica was very effective at reducing the severity of the pain, but it caused me to be very drowsy. I slept for 14 hours a night, and had difficulty concentrating during the day. I would also have trouble remembering things I had done while taking Lyrica. I had to discontinue using it.",

I take 150mg twice a day and now the pain is so manageable that I get my life back. If you have really bad nerve pain that makes you feel depressed and debilitated give the medication a go! I have had a few side effects like memory fog but the pain relief is worth it!",

I have suffered on and off for years and a few months ago I was bed/couch ridden and found it impossible to even leave my house. My family has told me I am a completely different person since starting it. I feel alive again. I also used to take Xanax for years for social and general anxiety and I have found that it is helping with that also. Only side effect was feeling high the first two doses but now I just feel like a normal person, which is what I have always wished for. I hope it continues to work and gets better as I up my dose. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who suffers from fibromyalgia. Good luck to all.",

One day I pushed myself too hard at work, and I got to what I call \"final stage\". Half hour after getting a shot of Dilodid in the ER I was still crying and writhing. Doctor came in and sat down looking worried. \"There's probably nothing more you can do for me.\" I said \"No, there's not.\" She sent me home with maximum doses of every painkiller on the planet-nothing got rid of the deep burning aching pain. It hurt to stand, sit, walk, lie down. I laid in bed for days not knowing what to do. I tried Lyrica. That pain has been gone ever since. I got my life back.",

After years of being a long term sufferer I know there are triggers but I've never been able to control the symptoms that over took me even though I've tried to fight it and fight hard.

I have tried Cymbalta and had a horrible 3 days of dizziness that almost caused me to hit a parked car. I was trying to suck it up and go to work but ended up on the couch the entire time because every time I sat up the world spun and I felt so disoriented and off balance like I had been drinking.

In the hospital they started giving me Lyrical 75mg 3 times per day that just took the edge off. Then I went to the pain Dr it was increased to 150mg 3 times a day and I had such relief to the point I could touch my skin, it has worked so great that when it is time for my next dose I begin to feel the pins and needles severe and the fire on my shoulders and hands.

I also notice that if I'm stressed the medication seems to not work as well so I don't know if I need the dosage increased, but there is a major difference in how much pain I feel. I do not like the side effects, but which would I rather have - sharp pains or side effects? For me they're headaches, drowsiness, dizziness, fatigue, odd stomach upsets initially after taking the medication, unfocused attention, euphoria, and that \"high\" feeling.

I couldn't wear my shoe and I was very depressed by the pain - I couldn't walk barely without pain. My surgeon put me on Lyrica and within a week, almost all of the burning disappeared. I get a random \"shock\" in my toes, a spasm in my arch and part of my foot is still numb, but I can function again. The pain is manageable and minor. I'm told it will heal but will take months.

Now I'm back to work full time which i'd never thought i'd be able to do again. Doing more than simple tasks is a joy, and being able to play with my grand kids is more enjoyable than I can say. I do have to say I have to take pain medicines and muscle relaxers and had a pain pump placed inside my stomach, but with everything I'm almost back to normal.

I have however gained 30 pounds in 4 months. That is NOT normal. So it's come to the point that I'm gaining weight too rapidly to control and I must stop the meds.

I am very sensitive to medications and the side effects from anti-depressants cause more depression than relief. So, to try another drug was scary for me. I saw a Rheumatologist, and he dx my Arthritis called DISH in my spine. He recommended Lyrica. I finally saw my PCP MD and said let's try this drug.

I then tried 150mg twice a day with limited success and then 300mg twice a day (this had no different). But then I hit on, the idea of taking it, three times, a day, exactly every eight hours (8am, 4pm, 12am) and this completely eliminated my GAD, making me functional, but I have to be very careful to stick to the correct times to take the dose, out by an hour and my GAD returns with vengeance.",

I am way less irritable and moody and feel like I can actually enjoy living a happy and complete life for once without worry, fear or nervousness.

The one thing that has made my Dr decrease the dose back to one a night very quickly, was I became depressive. Unfortunately, would prefer to deal with the pain & find something else, than feel that way. It is effective for pain relief (I found), but unfortunately I suffered some of the bad side effects.",

Doctor gave me some samples of Lyrica for Restless Leg Syndrome and I found that it made me quite sociable, talkative and able to let go some of my inhibitions, but without the sloppiness and horrible side effects as something like alcohol. I've tried Benzos and found they just made me feel dulled out and depressed. Lyrica, used periodically (a few times a month) never fails to brighten my mood and make me feel a bit closer to people.

Numbing/tingling/foot drop /balance issues all standard with MS. 75 Mg per day and already noticed difference...I can move my toes! Pain is reduced. Gabapentin did not help, baclofen or flexeril same. So far lyrica is doing the trick for me. Dr increasing Lyrica slowly each week to find the right dosage.",
                    "This used in conjunction with Cymbalta is about as good as it gets for nerve pain. In the past I was given Neurontin, Gabapentin, and many others but none were as effective. On the down side I found that the Lyrica in higher doses (150MG - 600MG) left me tired and unable to enjoy my days. I found that I received no greater pain relief taking the larger doses, just more / worse side effects. Even with Lyrica and the Cymbalta some people with extreme pain may still need to use some other type of pain relief in addition to this drug. I take 300MG of Lyrica spread over 4 doses per day and the Cymbalta, and 120MG of OxyContin and up to 40MG Oxycodone for breakthrough pain. In severe cases, a second anti-depressant may be needed in addition to The Cymbalta to help fight the depression that comes with chronic pain. The big down side to both of these name brand medicines is the cost. A months supply of Lyrica with no insurance is over $330 and the Cymbalta will set you back just over $300 each month. Even with insurance these both will end up on the top tier (My co-pay is $50.00 each) and neither of them has a generic equivalent.",

For years after surgery I have had acupuncture, chiropractic care, physical therapy and medications. I have taken methadone, morphine and oxycodone for 4 years. Now I have been taking Lyrica for a year. For the first 6-7 months it was like a wonder drug. It worked as well as anything else aside from dry mouth, weight gain and blurred vision. Now it's not working so well. An MRI showed I have many broad based disc bulges, spondyliosis, stenosis and arthritis. Now looking at a fusion surgery.

It's my 3rd day on it and I am taking 100 mg's now and in two more days will be on 150mg. So far this is amazing. I went golfing today and I had no pain in my swing.

Neurontin was effective, but only at 1800 mg./day, which left me drowsy (fell asleep anytime I wasn't moving). My MD switched me to Lyrica (75 mg), but when I got to 3 per day, I rapidly gained weight - 10 lbs. in 2 wks!  As a med student, I knew the two meds worked in a similar way and were metabolized similarly. I decreased the Lyrica to 1/ day, which stopped the weight gain, but didn't control the nerve pain, so I added back in one 300 mg. Neurontin per day (both at bedtime, to minimize drowsiness) - still not enough pain control. I added another Neurontin, and that was optimal for me. I take it all at bedtime.",

I started noticing red spots and my head, arms and back wouldn't stop itching. I got Benadryl and after 20 days, the itching is still here, but not as much as when I was taking lyrica.

I am a healthy 46 year old male. The side effects were some fuzziness and weight gain. This may have been due to lack of movement and also the Christmas eating but I put on 3 kilos in two weeks which is a lot for me. I am feeling that I would like to come off it so will reduce dosage and see what happens. At first I was nervous about taking this but it has notably reduced the pain to practically nothing.",

Much lower doses prescribed in Europe to limit side effects listed in some cases here. Seems to help getting to sleep and sleeping through night, wake early though with less of that anxious feeling in stomach. Take 10mg escitalopram (should be on 20 but want to limit the cocktail). Focus here is to be less dependent on benzos which seem less defective.

By the 4th day and 4th dose, I couldn't function. I couldn't walk without holding on to something (like the couch or a wall), I was so nauseous I couldn't hold down food, my head wouldn't stop spinning, and I was suicidal!

I was in denial about fibromyagia at that time. I was lucky to remain on the study even after 90 % of the patients had to get off of it because someone got a catarac. There were people begging to get back on it. I was on it for four years and by the time the clinical trial ended, and i went through a divorce, I had weaned myself off and didnt need it again until several years later when the fibromyagia became increadably painful. it took YEARS to go through the crappy drugs the insurance co. made me go thru with adverse reactions to get back to Lyrica !",

Then I read about Lyrica, talked to my Doctor got some and stopped my flair-ups. It saved me. Lyrica cut my pain by about 40% and stopped my flair-ups by about 80%. It kind of acts like an anti-depressant for me and makes me a bit hyper-(Good thing) But kills my sex drive and I stopped it for a week, it was hard on me and pain and flair-ups came back. I built a fast resistance to Lyrica fast, I went from 100mg to now 600 mg.

Combined with a good sleep-initiating medicine (i.e. trazodone), pregabalin is an even better lifesaver than alone. Next, pregabalin works quite well for benzodiazepine withdrawals. Lastly, it does work well for depression and anxiety. The downside is that it will dull cognition greatly and can also greatly increase depression at certain doses. For me, the best dose for sleep isn't great for those reasons however lowering the dosage (after a break) has provided better results. Takes experimenting with dosages.",

I have PTSD, insomnia and a history of drug abuse as I was always using drugs to try and help me feel better not to get high. My problem with pregabalin started about 4 days after starting them, I done tons of research and took two 300mg the first time, too much, yeah I felt great but like I said don't want to be high just well.

The length of the flare ups is also shortened from 3-5 days down to 2 days maximum. At the beginning of taking the medicine I was slightly drowsy but nothing dangerous. I only take it once a day and I am trying to keep it that way to avoid moving up to 2 doses a day. Lyrica is my miracle drug and has definitely given me my life back.

Three months ago my GP started me on Lyrica . After 3 days , pain was gone, also my anxiety seemed to just hop up and walk away . Im only drinking a few beers on a saturday now. Lyrica saved my life . I dont say that flippantly .",
                    "Started on 75mg twice daily, noticed some effect, just a tease or a promise. Upped it to 150mg twice daily and yes, it definitely works to eliminate \"one level of pain\", while leaving some \"levels of pain\" still there. I do feel side effects of feeling calm while having more motivation for projects, some slight feeling of alcohol-like impairment (not so much after less than a week of 300mg/day). I also occasionally use oral cannabis and the Lyrica potentiates it quite a bit. I'm feeling very positive about this medicine, even though it doesn't get at all levels of my pain, I like what it does do for me.",
                    "I have been taking Lyrica for the last three years and I don't know how I would live without it. In 2012, I was involved in a serious accident, sustaining an incomplete spinal cord injury, as well as severe injuries to my lower limbs. The pain is not as bad as it was in the beginning, but I am in constant pain and, according to my pain management and spinal and lower limb reconstruction consultants, this will probably always be the case. Initially I thought if I found the right combination of medications I could stop it and so I tried all of the other drugs prescribed for neuropathy, as well as some more experimental ones. Without Lyric I spent a lot of time crying and ended up in hospital a few times because the pain was so bad.",
                    "Side effects were debilitating, headaches, nausea. Did not experience much in the way of pain relief.",

                    "I was working at a plant nursery and watered the plants everyday. I stood in water with converse all stars on for about 3 hours. My feet went numb, which was normal for me. When I got in the shower that night to thaw my feet out they started hurting and black blisters developed. Neurontin did not help much, but the Lyrica took all pain out with no side effects other than feeling a little tired. It saved me from total misery. It is the best medicine I have ever taken.",
                    "I'm 63 and have struggled with depression and anxiety, starting at age 30. In late March 2015 a significant life event occurred that sent me spiraling downhill. Extreme anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts. The worst episode ever. Dr. prescribed 150mg Lyrica. I began taking it on June 11. By noon on June 13 I felt incredibly good, invincible ,euphoric. Weird in that I just felt SO GOOD, almost too good, Then side effects hit. Bad dizziness, but still felt good mentally. Cut the dose to 100mg. Over the next 2 weeks side effects resolved themselves. No weight gain. The artificial high dissipated. What I'm left with is this...NORMAL LIFE. Lyrica gave me my life back. Pray it works for others as well as it's worked for me.",

Ultimately after being on most horrific psychotic drugs i found Valium and mirtazapine ( currently on Valium 35mg and mirtazipine 45mg) which calm me down. Anyway i was recently prescribed Pregabalin at 150mg per day running along with the above drugs, I cannot stress how much this has changed my life for the better although still in the early days for the first time in 25 years I am a different person,calmer kinder and finally in control.",

It is the most recent medication added to the mix. I am bipolar 1 with significant clinical depression and agitated depression when hyper. My collection of meds works well with Pregabalin an important element.",

So....asked doc for Lyrica, in high hopes of relief bit it isn't touching it. Fully believe I have damaged nerves/FM from long term opioid intake.....but this drug is not helping at all Can't bear the thought of needing to stay on Tramadol. 60 yrs old now, it's not on.. Don't know which way to turn now",

                    "I've had huge troubles with anxiety and couldn't find an antidepressant that worked, so I got prescribed this. I started off with 75mg in the morning and before bedtime. It worked wonders and first few weeks I felt great - for the first time I could speak in front of a group, I had strength to do daily chores and my anxiety pains disappeared. However, after some time I grew tolerant to it and my pains and anxiety started coming back slowly, so my dose got upped to 150mg twice a day. It works for my anxiety and pains but it makes me really sleepy now. Side effects were only at first weeks, some stomach troubles which disappeared. PS! This is a temporary solution, since you get tolerant to it. Antidepressant is still needed for anxiety.",
                    "After suffering from painful burning feet for ten years ,and due to the pain getting only a few hours sleep per night (if lucky) I started taking Lyrica 75mg twice per day . The very first day my feet started to feel better, but I thought it might be wishful thinking however after taking the second capsule before bed I slept for nine hours straight and woke up to manageable foot pain. My life is back to normal",

I have tremors and heart racing. No weight gain or other side effects yet. I feel the medicien helps my brain to be more constructive and ordered. I stopped taking the Lexapro a year ago, but my doctor doesn't know. Tried missing the Lyrica for two days and felt very low, not easy to get off this.",

I have tried everything. I was put on lyrica for nerve damage originally but found it soooo helpful for crippling anxiety. But this does not last long tolerance builds so fast its unreal and it almost feels as if the anxiety gets worst over time. I have tried to stop this cold turkey but found my self in a state of BENZO and OPIATE withdrawal feeling and it was a nightmare. Now I'm weaning! Bye lyrica..OH ya klonopin works wonders ;).",

Finally the doctor sent me to a specialist after wearing braces from 1 1/2 years. Fibromyalgia is what the diagnosis was, I was not shocked, until she said NO CARPAL TUNNEL AT ALL. She gave me some 50 mg, Lyrica, worked wonderfully. I did not have to lay in bed for an hour or more before getting the children up for school. I got right out of bed and felt pretty good all day. It did make me a bit tired, but the doctor said you have to build your way up on it, but now, the insurance does not pay for it.",

I am still tired but that will come with conditioning my body again. I have intensive physio therapy twice a year and have founf improvements after each session. I have gained about 30lbs but part of that is due to inactivity. Only downside is that if I miss a dose I feel dreadful.",

After a few months of taking it I would wake up in the morning feeling as if a train had hit me. I also gained 40lbs on Lyrica. I recently switched to Neurontin and it works great. Also, coming off Lyrica gave me horrible withdrawals for almost 2 weeks. I have been off of it for about 17 days and have lost 8lbs. Lyrica is a great medicine if you don't mind gaining weight.",
                    "I was prescribed Lyrica for nerve pain in my leg and foot and found the \"side effect\" to be a lightening of my depression without the fogginess of other, more conventional medications prescribed for depression. I'm glad to see that it can be used for anxiety. It certainly makes a positive impact on my mood.",

I took the capsules 1 day (2days ago) and after I woke up the next morning, I was completely disorientated, neuasious and vomiting, sleepy, drowsy, forgetful, having uncontrallable shakes in hands and fingers. I thought it will get better soon if I do not take it again. My husband took me to work where I slept the whole time. I had dry nose and mouth, couldnt eat or drink, muscle stiffness drunk feeling, and walking abnormal. I stopped taking it and feeling today better. Could have a shake for breakfast.",

Help came when I was given high dosage of Lyrica in combination with Carbatrol. With time I was able to reduce it to half of the quantity of both medications. For the last 8-9 years I have been taking 900 mg of Lyrica and 600 mg of Tegretol. Before the Lyrica I was disabled, I couldn't talk, eat. open and close my eyes, touch my face, shave, have a haircut, or have my teeth cleaned, the list is too long. Basically noting could touch or move on the right side of my face. When I tried to eat, tears will stream down my face. I am taking Lyrica since February 2002, it saved my life.",
                    "It is difficult to rate this medication. I have all forms of Neuropathy, very painful and Lyrica has been the best so far at eliminating pain, allowing me to overcome the insomnia from the Neuropathy and opiate medication. Even at very small doses. I take 50mg once daily before bed and it works. The problem is the side effects, the worst being that after three days my eyesight is so degraded that I can not drive, I cannot read anything on the television 6 feet away, there is some eye pain and my eyes seem dry and burning. Eye problems can be serious. Wandering eye, crossed eyes and most commonly blurred vision. It also causes peripheral edema in my legs and feet.",

This drug is not side-effect free - but compared to the others out there (Including anti-depressants) it's Definitely the best option. After the initial euphoria wains it stabilizes however, so don't give up after the first effects go.",
                    "I have found Lyrica very helpful. I have fibromyalgia and I also suffer from depression. (I am also a diabetic). I used Lyrica with no expectations of any kind. I was so surprised when for the first time in I don't know how long I could move my head easily and what a reduction in pain. I am so happy I was not afraid to try it.",
                    "I was just diagnosed with fibromyalgia. After taking the first dose my hands and feet swelled up and I couldn't bend my figures. If I tried the pain was intense. Then I stated to stagger. I wobbled when I tried to stand still. My mind fogged up. I felt drunk and hungry. I got a sandwich and it slipped off of my plate to the floor and I picked up and continued to eat, at least a couple of times. Every thing I ate that night tasted so good. I was so sleepy. When I got up in the morning there were things in places that should never of been. (ie: TV remote in the bathroom, food on the floor near my bed and other things misplaced. I felt like I had a hangover. NEVER AGAIN. I had the same experience with Gabapentin. Just say no!",

Now, though painful, I take long daily walks. I can only tolerate the lowest dose three times daily, maybe four times if the doctor allowed it. An increased dose made me too drowsy. I find it helpful for fibromyalgia too, but I could only choose one category. I still have too much pain.",
                    "I agree with almost everyone here. I have been on all the narcotics for pain, for arthritis, since 2001. Finally, a wonderful doctor recognised the fibromyalgia aspect of my pain and prescribed Lyrica. What a difference! I sleep all night and can move in the morning. My narcotic usage is lowered along with lower muscle relaxants. At this point, I wouldn't do without my Lyrica.",
                    "I love this medication. I feel calm and rid of anxiety, I currently take 600mg daily and it lasts throughout the day. I would highly recommend this medication, its both calming and stimulating. I have the confidence to go out and hang out with people, I finally feel like I can socialize and relax like a 'normal' person. It's approved for generalized anxiety disorder in Europe. ",

Your body feels active and you can't relax, I find my teeth are clenched or my hand, or my foot. So had enough three weeks ago took to my bed for three days crying, depressed, I take tramadol everyday, venlafaxine for anxiety, none of which take it away. So went to doctors she said give this ...all I can say is at present I have been on it for three weeks I now remember what a good nights sleep is , I can switch the engine off and actually properly relax its wonderful.",

Doc then changed prescription to 50mg twice daily. As a painkiller it is fantastic. I've never known a painkiller like it, however one bad side effect is my swollen feet. I fear that I will have to change to something else if it continues to make my feet swell, because it is extremely uncomfortable. Another side effect is the feeling of being drunk. It does however help me to sleep. I haven't slept this well in years, though I wake up feeling groggy. I could live with all these side effects, if I could overcome the swollen feet.",

With this new trend, by an insensitive Congress, to take away opioids I couldn't imagine being without Lyrica. The only side effect is memory loss, only short term memory. I don't mind. If you suffered my pain you wouldn't either. I've never felt high and taken it for 5 yrs. 75mg x 3 daily. I'm grateful for it. I would suffer so bad w/o it.",

Could not stand the pain in my feet, outer thighs and now along my belt line. I noticed that the weight gain seemed to be from an increased appetite. I have been able to keep the weight off by being very mindful of my hunger, or mindless eating. I am 5'10\" 185lbs. Without Lyrica I don't really get hungry. Mind is bigger than the belly when I order food. With Lyrica I find I could eat a horse, and a cow and maybe a squirl as an after dinner snack ..LOL. It makes me lose what ever normal appetite suppresent that I may have. It does wonders for my nerve pain that started 6 months ago and seems to get worse without Lyrica.",

My fibromyalgia got so bad at the end of the year, that I decided to try it again.  I take low doses, 25 mg 2x a day, sometimes a 50 mg. The effect sets in within hours. My fibromyalgia pain is almost completely gone. A late evening dose allows me to sleep longer. I do feel strange when I take it and my intellectual capacity is quite affected, but the lack of distraction by the pain and a better social interaction with increased confidence levels makes up for that. I have to make sure that authorities and decision-making bodies are aware of my reduced competence.",

Needless to say, I discontinued it, and was given Lyrica....but that made me nervous as well. With my pain over a 10, and the inability to sleep, I decided to try it. I slept well, my pain is decreased some, but isn't gone. I'm only at day 3, and I'm pretty dizzy, sick to my stomach, and sleepy, but that's all so far. I do hope it helps my pain a little more, it's about an 8 now, so we shall see! I'm glad to hear some good stories.",

In fact, she hardly recognized that shingles pain was significant. My PHN kicked in when the rash disappeared. I've still got it. I monitored the internet for PHN meds and when Lyrica came out I notified my new doc immediately. He started me out at 100 mg three times a day and when that was only modestly effective he kicked it up to 150 mg X 3. It works very nicely. However there are side effects. My weight gain has been significant. Brain fog happens. I get double vision on an irregular basis. I feel tired. Now my liver values are increasing.",

                    "My doctor prescribed Lyrica for fibromyalgia. As I am very sensitive to medication, I was prescribed 75 mg at bedtime each night.  The first month, I did feel better taking Lyrica. However, after about 4 months I began experiencing strange symptoms.  I could not remember things. My brain was foggy. I wasn't myself and my pain returned. It was a no brainer, so I informed my doctor that I wanted off of this medication.  I've been off Lyrica now for two months and my brain is back to normal. It was very scary to even think how little I was taking and what an impact it made on me.   I am taking apple cider vinegar with honey every morning, exercising a little day, even if I don't want to, and resting when my body needs it.",

The pain continues to get increase. The lyrica within three days made him completely crazy. Couldn't sleep, very emotional. Started weaning right away.

I was told I couldn't use other anxiety meds because I have low blood pressure, but I can use pregablin. It has helped tremendously. I still have panic attacks but instead of many times daily, it's the odd one here and there when something has particularly stressed me out. It doesn't take away the anxiety completely, it's still there and I have really bad days still and it doesn't help depression, but it's much more manageable than before, likewise my OCD isn't as bad either. The only side effect I experience is weird dreams, insomnia and poor memory/memory loss. I recommend!!!",

Lyrica really helps to keep the pain away. My chiropractor has said that since taking Lyrica that my back and neck can be manipulated easier than before. I love being able to feel better!",

I went from being hypersensitive, worrying, stressing and having all these horrible physical symptoms ( from the anxiety disorder I have been diagnosed with ) to being calm, having a subtle feeling of well being... my acid reflux stopped, my muscles have started to lose their tension, the tension headaches are lifting too. Side effects ? a little sleepy, but nothing too severe. I haven't listened to music for months and been able to enjoy it, but today I AM ! ... amazing ! I feel like a normal person, its like the volume has been turned down on life to a level I can manage :)",
                    "I recently stopped taking lyrica after 6 months. I was taking lyrica for nerve pain following a terrible car accident. I wish I had never started taking lyrica. It not only did not help with the pain but only made my condition worse, not to mention the 30 pounds of weight I put on. Also the horrible withdrawal's was worse than I ever could of imagined. I absolutely do not recommend ever starting lyrica",
                    "It didn't work.",
                    "I was on this drug for many years and while in the beginning I felt it helped with both the frequency of headaches and fibromyalgia associated with ME, over time it stopped working. On the flip side, it definitely had a negative effect on my memory. I VERY slowly weaned myself off of it and most of my memory has returned. My insurance only paid a small part of the cost and it is very expensive. I would not use it again. No upside and plenty of downside.",
                    "This drug changed my life with unexpected benefits. I started taking for herniated disc and a lot of nerve damage. I started feeling pain relief immediately. It made me feel very high the first week and I had to be careful how and when I would take it / 150MGs 3xs a day. The high feeling eventually, gradually dissipated  After a week, I noticed my wife smiling a lot with great caution I asked her why and she said she likes how calm and relaxed I am. I'm naturally a very high strung, intense person. I thought about what she said and noticed I actually was very relaxed and things that typically set me off they just didn't anymore. I then read about how the drug helps with anxiety. My insurance doesn't really cover it...I pay 50 for a months",
                    "For 18 months have had severe lumbar, butt and leg pain. Got spinal injections that helped some, but leg pain still was especially bad. Finally had back surgery, which helped the lower back, but not the pain in my hips and legs, which was intense. As usual, had physical therapy, massage, and finally acupuncture. Nothing worked. My doctor finally started me on Lyrica at 50 mg before bed, then 100, and finally at 200 mg before bedtime. It has reduced the pain about 70 percent. It also helps me sleep like a log, and the only side effects are some dizziness in the morning, but by around 10 AM that goes away. Great stuff!",
                    "I too progressed from Gabapentin to Lyrica, 100mg 3x a day. I have chemically-induced neuropathy from 6 months of chemo. My hands and feet are numb, tingling, like they are asleep. Lyrica is supposed to be an advanced form of the Gabapentin, though I have seen little difference. I have increased appetite and some swelling in my hands and ankles. I continue using Lyrica because I need something for the hot shooting pain. This was the last med prescribed for my neuropathy.",
                    "This is poison, destroyed my life, horrible side effects and made my pain so much worse. Detoxing is a living hell and makes coming off narcotics a walk in the park. It's horrible and should be taken off the market.",
                    "On narcotics, muscle relaxers for neuropathic pain from inoperable herniated discs, arthritis in back. Narcotics cut in half by doctor and prescribed Lyrica, 75mg once at night, then 75mg am and pm and on til taking 150mg am, pm. Nothing. Today an additional 75 mg to be added midday.  Decided to check here before taking more. Wow. I have had left hand/arm jerks where my arm just flies up, once throwing iPad mini across the room, another time scatting nuts everywhere while chopping them. I now realize this condition started with Lyric and gets worse with increased dosage. I am going to slowly stop this drug because a) it does nothing for pain, and b) what has it done to my brain?",
                    "It helps with my seizures as well as my fibromyalgia so I've always been really happy with my Lyrica. I've been on it for years now.",
                    "Had a slipped disc with sciatic pain diagnosed before new year.  Had been having heart palpitations, anxiousness, blurry vision and having suicidal thoughts. Felt could be due to the drugs I'm taking and turns out... it's all from lyrica. ",
                    "I've used Lyrica for a while now and it seems that my body is getting so used to the drug that it's not working like it first did. I take 75mg in the morning and 75mg at bedtime. I either need to increase my dose or find something else that will work. It's hard to function during my days because of the pain.",
                    "I suffer from severe peripheral neuropathy. It is unusual in the sense that it is not diabetes caused, but is apparently idiopathic and hereditary. I have excellent relief from Lyrica with few side effects. I find myself nodding out occasionally at my computer or watching TV. I exercise more, drink more coffee, and allow more time for sleep. The more I take, the greater the relief. I take 400mg per day. ",
                    "Instant joint pain gone....anxiety gone....only been 1 week...hopeful it lasts...so far it's a miracle for me..I'm also on cymbalta and klonipin",
                    "I was given this medicine from my Dr. I told her I would research it but I paid $25 and picked it up. What a waste of money, I should've researched first. After reading this I'm deathly afraid to take this drug so I won't be. Thank you for all the reviews.",
                    "I have only been diagnosed for about a year now. I have completely lost my life due to fibromyalgia pain. My doctor started me on Cymbalta, which worked for awhile but then stopped, then put me on Lyrica without weaning me off Cymbalta....WITHDRAWALS hello. Had to start again and wean off while also taking Lyrica. The Lyrica seemed to help at first too, then wham just like everything else, stopped working....EXCEPT on weight gain and brain fog. I was a zombie. So now I'm worsening day by day even though I try to stay active have cut all caffeine, etc. because my doctors just don't believe pain medicines help and say there isn't much else they can do for me. Glad for the people it has helped.",
                    "I have Fibromyalgia and developed horrific back/sciatic pain last year. I started taking lyrica about 3 months ago and within a week,I could walk properly. I could sleep, I could exercise and I thought it had fixed everything.  Then my elbow started hurting. I just thought I'd strained it at the gym. The pain became excruciating. Then it hit the other arm until 3 days ago when it got so bad, I couldn't move my arms properly. It felt like my arms were inflamed from my shoulders to my finger tips. I stopped taking it 2 days ago and the arm pain is starting to go. But the back pain is starting to come back. I also have had no idea what day it is for the last 3 weeks which I thought was stress but suspect is the lyrica.",
                    "When I first started Lyrica, my pain almost totally disappeared. After about 3 weeks, my pain started returning. My tongue started to tingle and was sore.",
                    "I was prescribed Pregabalin by my GP for anxiety disorder. I am 27 and have had anxiety since a teenager. I have never tried meds before. I have just gone up to 600mg. I have definitely experienced side effects (blurred vision/dizziness/drowsiness). The side effects do wear off but it does take some perseverance in the beginning to get to grips with it. I felt 'out of it' for a few days. I definitely feel less anxious. It's hard to tell how well it is working but I definitely have the ability to look at 'stressful' and 'anxious' situations with far more clarity. I am a designer and I always worried if taking meds would suppress my creativity but in fact - I think it helps me to have more confidence in my ideas.",
                    "I was diagnosed with adult onset Diabetes last Dec. I started on Metformin 750 and almost immediately my fasting glucose dropped to 94. That is what it has been since but I have been bothered with neuropathy for months. I tried Lyrica for 3 months and it did absolutely nothing for the pain. I am presently taking gabapentin 300 mg at bedtime and it helps slightly. The cost for the Lyrica was money out the window.",
                    "I am glad that Lyrica has helped many, just did nothing for my nerve pain and tons of side effects.",
                    "Just started Lyrica 75mg twice a day yesterday. My first dose, I felt extremely drunk, and could not function. I took my second dose at bedtime, and slept through the night, and woke up refreshed! I had no aches or pain. My 3rd dose, this morning, again feeling a little drunk, and off balance... but again, I feel good. I can actually sit still at work, without having to move around and try to be comfortable. I am going to stick with this medication, and hope that the side effects go away in a couple of days.",
                    "I had been experiencing major depressive disorder and I have an anxiety disorder. I have tried every antidepressant on earth and had suicidal ideation with each one, even after one pill! I have some nerve pain so I tried gabapentin but didn't really get any relief from it so I asked my doctor for some lyrica. The NEXT DAY I felt the depression lift and the anxiety came to a manageable level where I felt I could function well and go out in public. I recently started vaping nicotine and the anxiety is back. I am going to quit and continue to take the lyrica. When I feel really anxious I take 10 mg of valium with it and I am in heavenly bliss. No pain, no worries, just normal albeit a bit sedated but still very functional.",
                    "I had an accident in April 2016. Riding lawnmower fell on top of me in a deep ditch. It knocked me out and caused severe lumbar spinal stenosis , pinched nerves . Up until this year I was in a lot of pain due to the nerves being pinched by my spine. All this time I have seen 3 doctors, really 4, one neurologist, 2 neurosurgeons, internist. No one even suggested Lyrica for my pain...except the neurologist who did the nerve conduction study. He said it worked for restless leg syndrome which I also have. I go some Lyrica and tried it. It has brought me from 10 pain level to a 2 or 3. I get up early now like I used to, I have the will to do things on my property etc. I had lost the desire to even get out of bed, I wish I had tried Lyrica a lot sooner, it gave me my life back.",
                    "I have had FM for about 10 years. For the past 2 years I have been on Duragesic patch for pain. It intensified the fatigue. I started on Lyrica a couple of months ago and am now off of the Duragesic patch. I am getting as good or better pain control with the Lyrica alone as I was with the Duragesic patch and without the added fatigue.",
                    "I couldn't make it without my Lyrica! This medicine has absolutely changed my life. I was hurting all the time and used all my energy just to work. There was no joy in my life until I was prescribed this medicine. Now I work and feel like doing the things I enjoy, like working in my flower garden. I thank God everyday for this medication!",

After many years of being tried on just about every drug out there FINALLY a drug that actually helped me!..I now drive again and sometimes leave the house alone and even on occasion brave the supermarket ALONE..After 3 years on the same dose and with its effect starting to wane I am now on 150mg twice a day..And yes I am very tired, vague and spaced out, but this will wear of with time as my body adjusts..And regarding the weight gain, I have lost 5 stone, and have regained some control.",
                    "I was prescribe Lyrica for a pinched nerve in my elbow after a dislocation. The pain made physical therapy intolerable. With just one dose of 75mg of Lyrica, I could bend my elbow without wincing. Absolutely marvelous. Unfortunately there were 2 side effects that make me stop taking it. First one was that I fell asleep almost immediately after taking it for about 2 hours and my brain felt very foggy after I woke up. Second issue was a slight tightness in the chest and feeling a little out of breath. Not severe, but enough to let me know that I couldn't take it again. Made me sad because it really worked.",
                    "Going to have to decrease dosage (50mg 2x daily) or quit Lyrica due to loss of memory & confusion & jerking. Once could top out any IQ tests but my husband says I can't even find my \"behind\" anymore. Taking it for neuropathy & came home from complete knee surgery with foot drop in leg operated on. Now the other foot has dropped half way so I am all but an invalid. No more going outside for me to enjoy our horses on our farm. The dry mouth I got with Lyrica also frightens me as afraid I will lose my teeth as others have. Lyrica also causes severe sleepiness. I guess it MIGHT have stopped the shooting pains in my feet at night?",

                    "My doctor prescribed it for me and gave me samples. I have been taking the samples while fighting with the insurance company because they want me to try Neurontin first. I think the Lyrica is really working. I am still tired, but I feel it is a normal tired from having two kids and running around with them. The way I felt before, I couldn't move. I really don't want to use the Neurontin, I don't want to lose the benefits that I have gained.",
                    "Lyrica works well on my chronic neck pain which I have had for 4 years. But I have gained about 30 pounds so am considering trying Neurontin to see if effects are the same but without the weight gain!",
                    "Lyrica the wonder medicine. After having a nerve crushed in Afghanistan, I had RSD/CRPS in my left leg. Doctors put me on Neurontin which just made me neurotic...and did not help the pain. A month after switching to Lyrica, I was able to lose the crutches, and a few weeks later the prosthetic supporting my leg. After four months, yes I still have a crushed nerve, but pain and hypersensitivity dropped to bearable levels and after six months off all medication but Motrin. Four years later... I have a resurgence of RSD due to a back injury. Lyrica had me back walking in two weeks and has continued to reduce the pain levels.",
                    "I take Lyrica for seizures and Fibromyalgia. The side effects are tremendous and I have had a hard time adjusting. True enough I have had no more seizures however, frequently, I am unable to consentrate or think with any lever of clarity.",
                    "I was on Lyrica for 2 years. At first it was fabulous! But over time I needed to keep increasing the dosage to get the same result. The side effects were bad for me. In the two years I was on it I gained 60 lbs and my hair started falling out. I have since switched to Neurontin with no side effects and my hair is slowly coming back. Lyrica was a miracle for me for about 18 months but as they say all good things must come to an end.",
                    "I would give it a 10, then a 1. At first the medicine worked GREAT but then 30 days later it just quit. After a few months I gave up on it, I occasionally retry the medicine but no luck.",
                    "Taking Lyrica hasn't helped my Fibrmyalgia symptoms at all, and even though I'm on a starter dose of 75 mg once per day the side effects are terrible! I tremble so badly it appears as if I have Parkinson's disease. I can't hand write at all and let alone many other daily functions. It has affected my thinking terribly and makes my mind race and my thoughts are very jumbled which makes me feel extremely anxious, plus when talking my speech is very shaky sounding and very fast and slurry. I also have a lot of trouble urinating. I find it extremely difficult to empty my bladder and at times very painful. I was already taking sleeping tablets ( Temazipan), but Lyrica has made getting to sleep even worse. My chest and nose both feel congested.",

I suffer from back, buttock, leg & feet pain from a 360 degree double spinal fusion of L4-L5 & L5 & S1 done 20 years ago. Nerve pain is now ruining my life. However since being on this medicine my pain is now around a 2-3 out of 10 from being anywhere between 5-9. The only real side effect I am having is feeling \"High\" 24 hrs a day. Supposedly this will go away in time. I also feel uplifted and it has helped with my depression. I do feel a bit aggressive at times too. I have been keeping a close check on my weight too but nothing has changed. My normal weight is 75 kgs and I'm fit & strong as I workout in the gym regularly which helps control back pain.",
                    "I usually have bad migraines that knock me out for a day or two every week. Today I had the aura, the nausea and all my senses started feeling fuzzy like they do when it's coming on. This time, the troubles went away in an hour and I was left with a minimal headache.

I had previously taken Cymbalta 60mg for 7/8 years and was feeling that it was no longer as effective so my doctor prescribed Lyrica. I noticed a large amount of weight gain (which I would not have minded if helped the pain!) about 50 pounds over 6 months before it stabilized. After some time of taking the medication (9 months or a year I forget) I was always complaining to my doctor about pain and fatigue being bad so he switched me to Savella. I noticed a huge difference and I lost the weight!",
                    "Lyrica was great as a pain reliever. It is not a pain killer. The side effects were brutal - weight gain, swelling, water retention yikes. I only stayed on Lyrica a few months. I am now trying Robaxasil.",
                    "My psychiatrist put me on 200 mg capsules 3 x a day (600 mg daily) and it's effective for treating anxiety. I've been on lorazepam, alprazolam, and clonazepam and all 3 became ineffective after 6 months to 1 year and were extremely difficult to get off of. I don't notice any tolerance issues with pregabalin either. I've been on the same dose for about 2 years. Better than any of the benzodiazepines and other medications I've tried for anxiety. Only side effects I've noticed are calmness, sedation, and increased appetite but exercise and healthy eating take care of any weight gain.",

Since I have been taking it (about 6 months now) these symptoms are all but gone. The only side effects I have are short term memory loss and concentration issues but I am able to work around these in most cases. Lyrica has been amazing for me.",

                    "I've been on lryica for a month now. 150 mg 2x a day. It works wonders for the awful muscle spasms and fibromyalgia pain but I do have side effects. I have to do every thing from chores to running errands before I take it. Once I take I become unbalanced, forget words and become extremely tired. I sleep a lot and very heavy and usually can't remember the previous day. I definitely cannot function after I take it. I don't care for the side effects but so far has been the only thing that has worked for me. I tried cymbalta, neurton, zanaflex, flexeral lots of things. To me its worth taking the lryica as those terrible rib and back spasms keep at bay..and after two years of dealing with those I don't ever want to again. btw does kill my appetite.",

I lost those yrs of my life sleeping 17 hours a day and the pain was horrible even taking 90mg a day and 30mg of Valium. I went to Wilmington Treatment Center to stop the medicines & so they started me on the Lyrica 450mg per day. It saved my life. Without the Lyrica I was awake for 3 days crying in pain, could not lay in a bed due to the sheets touching me, my core temperature would not come up, I was freezing but everything burned my skin if it touched me. The Lyrica within 2 hours gave me hope and I started turning around for the better. My life is so much better now. My family is glad to have me back!",

Tried hydrocortisone shots in my back and the pain went away for 3-4 days. I've been on vicodin and skelaxin as well as Aleve twice a day. I've had to take my vicodin every 4 hours instead of every 6 hours because the pain has been so bad. Just in the last 48 hours, I've noticed such a difference with Lyrica. I keep waiting for the pain to be there, but it is NOT. I'm still titrating my way up on the dosage, but in another day or two, my maximum dose will be 50 mg 3 times a day. Currently, I'm taking 50 mg 2 times a day. It really works.",

The things that bothered me before no longer bother me. I am a smoker and since starting Lyrica I no longer crave cigarettes. I have had severe back pain due to arthritis and I no longer have back pain! It does however make me hyper. I can live with that, and it makes me hungry, but this stuff works really well for me.",

I live in the great white north but I struggled with balance, fell often, and also had trouble putting my thoughts into words. These side effects are now gone now that I'm off this. Balance and communication much better now that I'm off.",

I stopped it weeks ago. I like being in this calm fluffy state, rather than sweating and thinking 100 miles an hour and stressing out.

Over the few months however I have had increased swelling in my joints and gained 15 lbs with no change in eating habits. I started feeling confused with memory loss, then two weeks ago I started feeling suicidal. I did not ever suffer from depression but could not get the thought of just taking a bottle of pills. Due to my experience of working with mental health I knew something was not right so I am now working at reducing Lyrica and going off of it . I think it was amazing for the pain but not worth the risk with the change in my mental state.",

I tried nuerotin years ago but after the second day I could not function, so any one with nerve pain should give this a try. .it sure has helped me",

I started taking Lyrica for some unresolved jaw pain thought to have arisen from my wisdom tooth extraction. It was like a switch had been flipped, the next morning I woke up completely refreshed; a feeling I hadn't experienced in years. I experimented on-and-off to determine whether Lyrica was indeed the reason for this change in energy and mood. Indeed, nights that I took Lyrica (75mg) I was completely refreshed and motivated the next day. This contrasted my normal routine greatly, where I would typically take high doses of vyvanse (75mg-max dose) at 5 am just to wake up. Game changer for depression.",

Over the next 5 months it pretty much stopped working for the pain and the side effects became very worrying. I could not think straight and was dangerously clumbsy. I was is a malaise and did not wish to do anything so I decided to quit. I followed the instructions to taper over at least a week, then the real problems began. This is a horrendous drug to come off, I had to reinstate as I went out of my mind. I am now tapering at 10% as and when I can. I feel so unwell, anxiety has spiralled, depression, suicidal thoughts, insomnia, lack of appetite, sweats, the list could go on it has been a hellish period.",
                    "After having my 2nd child I got really poorly and was diagnosed with bipolar II disorder, for 3 years now I've been living in hell and up and down like a yoyo, just recently I paid private to see a psychiatrist because the NHS is useless as it's understaffed for mental health. I was diagnosed with bipolar II, GAD and mixed anxiety and depressive disorder, all I can say week 2 on this medication has saved my life! I'm on 75mg twice a day and can increase if I wish too, but with the way I am feeling at the moment I feel I don't need too. I can leave the house, I'm going back to work next week, and my girls have their mummy back, also suffer from damaged nerves in my lower back, it's helped so much with the pain. It's a miracle",
                    "The first night I took Lyrica I slept 9 hours. Got out of bed without any pain. This has been a lifesaver for me. I am so happy with the results. I am only on 50mg at night. Not seeing a reason to increase the dose yet.",
                    "I started taking lyrica about 4 years ago for fibromyalgia and found it lowered my daily pain by about 60%. While I do not suffer from GAD, I have always had feelings of anxiousness and physical feeling of restless uneasiness, and also restless leg syndrome. It was an unexpected side benefit that the lyrica helped control these feelings. After about a year and a half of taking 150 mg twice a day, I began to worry about addiction, and decided to cut back in an effort to possibly quit altogether. I soon found that my anxiousness and restlessness seemed worse than before, so I went back to my full 300mg per day dose, and have remained at that dosage. While on lyrica, I intentionally lost 35 lbs, and have not gained any weight back for 3 years",
                    "I recently had back surgery for spinal stenosis. I was having leg pain and the pain in my leg was worse than before surgery. After surgery I was also experiencing new pain of stabbing, electrical sensations in addition to the pain I previously had. I was prescribed Neurontin and the doctor kept raising the dose with no difference in my pain. I heard of similar experiences and being switched to Lyrica and it made a huge difference. I was in so much pain day after day. I switched to Lyrica and I have had nearly full relief of the pain I was having. I can't even describe how much this medication has helped me. If you find yourself in the same experience there is hope. Keep communicating with your surgeon and try Lyrica.",

                    "I've been taking lyrica for almost 2 years, I was prescribed gabapentin to begin with, and they kept increasing the dosage, until I was almost on the max dose of 3200mg, and my pain management dr prescribed me lyrica 100mg x 3 daily and it works for the most part. I don't have the side effects from it that most have, and it works to control the pain, although I do have neuropathy flare ups from time to time. I'm taking it as a result of neuropathy from spinal chord injury. and my insurance pays for it so no out of pocket costs. I recommend this to people who have nerve pain.",
                    "Like many others, my pain doctor had me on gabapentin first, then after several months without relief, switched me to Lyrica. Without a generic version available, it can cost a small fortune depending on your insurance. Without any insurance, 100mg capsules 3X daily, 90 pills will cost upward of $600! With my Part D, and not qualifying for \"Extra Help\" through the state, I'm now paying $140 for a 2 week supply, $280 monthly. That's a car payment! I have no idea what to do once the free samples run out, it's a very good medication but unaffordable. If your doctor tells you gabapentin (Neurontin) works the same, chemically there's no difference, that just isn't true. It may be similar, but Lyrica works much better with significantly less mg's",

It did nothing for me except give me insomnia, make me forgetful, and increase my neuropathy pain and burning.  I already have difficulty sleeping because of neuropathy and L5 compression agony. This pill made it worse. I took 50 mg at bedtime for about a week. The doctor said it takes a while to get into the system. I'm not waiting that long. It's not working, I don't like it, and I don't trust it.",

Drugs.com has a page on Lyrica's Side Effects yet it doesn't mention is that it can cause a stroke. My mum has had three mini strokes. It has given her dementia, incontinence, she can't walk properly etc. She has many of the side effects mentioned. The doctor is slowly taking her off Lyrica and she almost back to herself.",

I am awaiting more testing as still figuring out what is wrong but put on lyrica about 3 weeks ago, some relief within a few days, dose increased, more relief. The dose increased again with good effect. I do notice if I am late on a dose or miss a dose, sure pay for it, takes some time for pain to come back under control. I say as I write this at 5 am having not slept a wink. I'm currently on 150 mg twice daily. I'm gaining a belly but have not gotten on the scales, initially giddy and absent minded but that has subsided even with dosage increases. I think its a good drug choice for me. here hoping.",

After trialling other prevention medication which had bad side effects. Trialed Lyrica 25mg twice a day and after the first week was migraine free for months. after running out, migraines returned. This is very effective, as all other migraine prevention medication has been unsuccessful.",
                    "I was on Lyrica for 8 years at 75mg twice a day. I thought it was doing little for my pain and I didn't want to start increasing it. I had no side effects when taking it. So last year I stopped taking it as I still had a lot of nerve pain. But since I have been off it I realized just how much it actually did for me. I started suffering from crippling anxiety, my pain has gotten progressively worse and my hand tremors have returned. So after 9 months off it I am back on it again as I need a quality of life and Lyrica gives me that. It may not work for everyone but it does for me. I have fibromyalgia and General Anxiety.",

I just feel normal. My anxiety got so bad it was causing severe stomach problems, I almost had my gallbladder removed. Not only did it cure my anxiety, my stomach issues are gone, as well as my IBS that was a seperate issue, my restless legs are gone!!! GONE, RLS was torture, it stopped me from going to movies or on planes.. but that's not even the best part! My chronic leg pain which I saw many specialists about when I was young and had since given up on IS GONE! I thought I had to live in pain forever. My life is drastically improved. No words can explain",
                    "I was on Lyrica 50- 75 mg 2- 3x/ day for fibromyalgia for over a year. Incidentally I didn't have any migraines while on it. I stopped Lyrica 7 months ago and have had migraines monthly since!",
                    "Lyrica gave me my life back! The only side effect that MAY have been due to Lyrica is vision loss, but I have worn glasses for 30 years, so no big deal for my eyesight to slightly worsen over 2 yrs on the drug. Some of the side effects that people mention could be due to menopause rather than Lyrica. I gladly spend $60 for a monthly supply. Other meds I took previously left me like a zombie. With lyrica I actually feel good.",

For 6 years, everyday I would have to lay in the tub and the shower hit my back or lay on a heating pad and even at night just to fall asleep I use sleep aids and constant showers or heating pads to get the muscles to stop hurting and spasms and then I couldn't take it anymore. The muscle relaxers wouldn't work and my back and neck were burning and stiff and spasms all day and night and I couldn't sleep and went desperately to a my new doctor that I was seeing and got his associate. He saw me and recognized the fibromyalgia and placed me on Lyrica. I'm a true 26 year old again.",

The nerve damage got so bad, I spoke to my doctor about it and he prescribed Lyrica which took care of all the nerve damage. At first probably the first 2 months only side effect I had was a little swelling of my hands. Lyrica was a wonder miracle for me. The doctor had me on it for over 3 years with no problems, then my insurance refuses to pay for it now, because a 30 day supply is $900.00. They wanted to give me Neurontin, which I am allergic too. Now all the nerve pain is back and worse. I want the Lyrica back and would recommend it to any one.",
                    "I've had problems with my feet burning for several years. Every year it was worse than the year before. It got to the point that I couldn't stand anything on my feet. Lyrica helped a lot, with much less frequency and severity of burning. Finally some relief. Unfortunately, I had to discontinue because of side effects. I had almost all side effects listed in the info sheet. Most I could have tolerated, but the ones I couldn't was weight gain, confusion, and fast progressing blurred vision. Also, I had severe clinical depression over 18 years ago until I received the correct antidepressant. I've had no depression since. However, the Lyrica caused it to return, although not as severe. It also caused anger flareups, very unlike me.",

Discontinued after 60 days and nearly 20lbs. Depression lightened, however the weight has been hard to lose having so much pain from the Fibro. Baclofen has been one medicine that has \"helped\" with minimal side effects. Please come up with something without the side effects!",

Day 2, Pain was gone but I was very sleepy not able to concentrate. Day 3, slept all day could not keep my balance and my dreams was almost real. Day 4, very sleepy and unresponsive, it was so bad that I could not feel my low blood sugar until all my body was shaking and I needed help to take sugar. Day 5, STOP taking the dame thing. Day 6, Pick up the phone, called my doctor and used every word I have learned in English on him and those scientist, who came up with this IDEA. Instead of spending their time and knowledge to fin cure for diabetes, they just look for accommodating, Just to make MONEY.",
                    "About four hours after taking the first dose, I felt years of anxiety just fade away like mist in the morning. The next day I was free of pathological anxiety, and have been the same ever since. So, full marks from me. Yes, there are side effects, but they're nothing compared with anxiety that attaches itself to all aspects of your life.",

                    "Lyrica is great at taking away my pain due to fibromyalgia. However, the side effects from the medication and from detoxing are not worth it! I am 25 and took Lyrica for at least 6 years. I experienced severe brain fog, difficulty breathing, cognitive difficulties n others while on this medication. I thought they were all due to my conditions, but after truly reflecting on my journey Lyrica surely hurt me more than it helped me. I have been off of the medication for about 3 weeks now. I did some research and learned that my detox period would be both difficult and long because 1, I took the medication for several years, I took a high dosage andi stopped the medicatiod cold turkey. It's getting easier for sure. The creator on my side!",

I'm really surprised that the Drs didn't tell my about \"Excedrin abuse\" since I told all that I was taking that much. However, when prescribed Lyrica for fibro pain, my headaches were gone to maybe 3 a week. So I highly recommend this for serious headache problems. Does help with Fibro pain. But, weight gain and dry mouth are my biggest side effect and is to the extent that I almost want to go back to 8 Excedrin a day. Hope this helps someone!",

I was put on Lyrica at age 31 to help with the severe pain that I have (and I also have nerve damage in my toes due to an unknown cause- I'm not diabetic). The medicine is astoundingly good for me at combating depression, anxiety, overall body pain & morning stiffness. It takes higher doses of Lyrica to feel pain relief for most people with Fibromyalgia- those who say it doesn't work have often only tried it at <300mg a day. I take 300mg twice a day. The only bad side effect is weight gain- 100lbs. (And I'm naturally overweight to begin with, so this was terrible). It did eventually stop making me gain, but I have to eat less and work out more than everyone else I know, just to maintain my weight, let alone lose.",

I also take 37mg Tramadol IR whenever I have breakthrough pain. This is the minimum I need to function, but it does allow me to work and improves my overall mood.

As the pain decreased I had a better appetite, however my exercise would never be enough to consume those calories. You have to exercise carefully. So now after 4 years I have decided to take control and reduce calories to equal my physical activity. I have a dietician and I AM loosing the weight.

I also managed to severely rupture a few discs in my neck while stretching of all things. Was misdiagnosed by the surgeon who only fixed one of the ruptures with a fusion of C7. Off course this still left me with pain and numbness from my neck down both arms. About a month or so ago I switched to a spine and pain management doctor and he put me on the Lyrica (75mg 3x daily) and a Duragesic patch. These two drugs have worked wonders for my pain and Quality of life. The only side effect is that my short term memory is a little sketchy and my mind doesn't want to shut down.",

Yesterday I went across the street, came back to my house to get the garden hose, back across the street to water my neighbors plants, and lugged the hose back home. Suddenly I realized, I forgot my walker. I completely forgot it. I wake in the morning, pain free. I am walking now without the walker, it has also improved my mood.

Eventually I was put on Pregabalin by a Psychiatrist and it was very helpful almost from day one. We increased my dose until I take the maximum of 300mg twice a day. At this dose my anxiety has been pretty much eliminated, I am happy and now an active person. However a word of warning to anybody taking this medicine for a long time: DO NOT allow yourself to suddenly withdraw from it. I recently had to go a week without it and it was a living hell for me. Withdrawal symptoms for me were as follows: severe anxiety and depression, suicidal ideation, inability to sleep, nausea and vomiting",

However, I did not gain weight. Maybe that is because I had read that you could gain weight and I changed my diet so that I would not. In fact, I lost 25 lbs. while on it. I read that I am in the minority with this. I can say for the most part Lyrica helped, but I had to take Advil with it. Overall, it helped.",

I was put on Pregabalin for generalized anxiety disorder and seasonal affective disorder by my Doctor. At first I was put on a very low dose of 75mg, which did next to nothing. I immediately requested to have the dose increased until finally I reached a dose that was effective enough for me (600mg). For a while the medicine did its job and I actually felt like my anxiety had been reversed. I suffer bad social anxiety, and 300mg of this made me quite extroverted and confident. I would say it was 'pro social' for sure. Alas tolerance set in and now even 800mg doesn't do much of anything apart from prevent withdrawals.",

It has not stopped the pain at all, makes me so dizzy I am afraid to drive my car, legs swell like balloons, and have gained over 30 pounds in 3 months. A clinical research was recently done in Australia on lyrica (for Acute and Chronic Sciatica) and the findings stated it had the same effect as the research subjects getting placebos or sugar pills. The makers have racked in 3 billion dollars on it. I told my doc it isn't working but he still prescribes it to me, finding another doc this week.

So the next time I was at the doctors I asked him about taking Lyrica and he thought that it was a good idea. It took awhile but each day that went by more of my pain left me, and now I am pain free from Fibromyalgia. My side effects was gaining weight and that was about it.

I was on a higher dose over 300mg a few years ago and my hands and feet swelled up and I gained 30 pounds I can't get rid of now even with water pills, so I had to stop med. I've had shingles right when I turned 50 before I could get the Shingles vaccine which I recommend to everyone as shingles is painful!

I then took a bad fall and pain came back. Fully expecting surgery I returned to Thailand and doctor suggested Neurontin. Although I got some relief, the side effects were intolerable. He then put me on Lyrica. It stopped the pain within 24 hours. He said it would take a few days. I was on it about 45 days and then weaned myself off. I think anyone with spinal stenosis should ask your doctor about this. I think they have just approved it for back pain here in the States. My surgery was in 2005, and went back in 2008. It was a miracle for me.",

For over two years my pain has been controlled well. One night I forgot to take my medicine and the next day I had a painful attack. I'll never forget it again! I'm so thankful for this medicine.

I have now found that it makes little difference between 75 or 300mg for pain relief. I have difficulty sleeping without any, 75 will eventually help but 300 gets me to sleep faster. After reading so many people complaining about the same side effects, I will be seeing my Dr.",
                    "I just started with this medication. I took one 75 mg pill in the late evening before going to sleep. When I took it I said to myself yea right this little tiny pill will somehow give my life back to me...the next morning when I awoke to my surprise, I felt like I did years ago. I could walk and stand without the aching and hurting. I was not as tired nor as sore in my muscles. What a wonderful little miracle this little pill is!!!",
                    "Ii have no more pain. It helps so much. I would tell everyone to use it.",
                    "Suffering from complex pain syndrome and resultant fibromyalgia, and to find something that reduces the burning pain of my skin and along with other drugs to help with sleep has made me feel like \"myself\" for the first time in over 7 years. I have shed many tears in pain and dejection, but not so many lately. Thanks Lyrica.",
                    "I'm forty and have degenerative disc disease in the spine for 7 lowest discs and the usual joys of debilitating chronic pain and sciatica and physical disability. An episode of severe pain and nerve issues recently meant I was signed off for 4 weeks to rest, however during this time my whole nervous and neurological pain got worse as well as physical collapse and spread to my face hands, arms and body functionality. The lowest point in five years thus far. I was put on Pregablin 75mg /2x day and although the first week was strange with hyper elation, a foggy mind and some humorous speech issues but when it kicked in the transformation was amazing. 3 months later I'm far more stable and working fulltime. Some back pain has returned with occasional sciatica.",
                    "Week one of increase of dose from 100-200mg a day, feel very strange, hyperactive, difficulty concentrating and feel like sh#t really! I take it for crippling anxiety, manic depression and agoraphobia, along with 150mg of sertraline, 15mg of mirtazepine, hope I get used to the dosage increase",
                    "I just weaned myself off of Cymbalta/Neurontin and started taking 50mg Lyrica capsules twice a day. I have been taking Lyrica for only TWO DAYS and have had amazing results. I may be reporting on this drug too soon but I am finding my pain receding greatly. I am feeling almost \"normal\", my spirits are definitely raising and hope that I can avoid nerve cutting surgery that would be my last choice for relief. I am an optimist by nature and am so hoping that 100mg a day will keep me pain free and away from the scalpel.",
                    "Lyrica has its pros and cons like any other medicine in the market. Lyrica has helped me in many ways including neuropathic pain and depression together with other antidepressants. The only side effect that bothers me a little is the fact that I feel tired most of the time but I can still function with a lot of calmness. On the other hand I have tried every single medicine for insomnia during the last 12 years with not so great results until I found this medicine. Now I sleep like a baby at 150mg twice a day.",
                    "I had minor back surgery and one result was nerve damage to the nerves from my right leg socket to my hip. Severe burning several times per year. Lyrica stops the severe pain slowly and reduces it to tolerable pain. I use 75mg on a nine day regimen - 3x for 3 days, 2x for 3 days and 1x for 3 days. It works good. The pain slowly resides and is gone by 6th day. No serious side effects. Slight vision blurring and minor lack of mental focus. Very minor. Overall, I think it works for me. Has not affected appetite, weight, mental attitude or sleeping habits.",
                    "My own experience was awful. I did not gain weight but I had been suffering with depression because of all the pain I was in. My doctor prescribed these which in my option she should have never done specially when I was very down at the time. I've never experienced such thoughts in my life the only time I got a break from my own thoughts was when I was sleeping. If you are feeling down at all while taking these my advice go see your doctor ASAP do not continue with these not advisable to anyone with depression",
                    "I've had back pain from degenerative discs since 1998. After all the usual treatments such as chiro, physical therapy, injections, etc., I had a L4/L5 fusion on 02/09. It helped a little, but still had substantial back pain requiring Ultracet 3x per day and Lortabs when pain peaked. Have been on Lyrica 75mg 3x per day for past 11 days. Really reduced the pain the first few days, but pain came back a bit. Still, the Lyrica is helping and I've not had to take the Lortabs since starting Lyrica. I'm going to stick with Lyrica for a few more weeks before deciding to try more injections or other medicines.",
                    "I have been taking Lyrica for about 1 year and I went from hurting all the time to just my occasional spells. I don't know what I would do without it.",
                    "The real problem I had and still do is dosing. I started out on 150mg twice a day and found it too much at first. GP reduced dose to 75mg three times a day and 1 x 75mg when needed. That is my current dose and the side effects are worth it based on the fact that I've had painful neuropathy in both my feet and lower legs. The breakthrough pain was the main issue I was having trouble with and DID NOT want any more narcotics than I currently take...60mg. MS Contin x 24hours and 2 Statex when required per 24 hours. It can mess with your head a little like feeling like you are a bit spaced out. Works wonderfully and I hope I don't build a tolerance. ",
                    "I am an 81 year old male with back pain. The epidurals gave relief for only 3 weeks. I took Lyrica 50mg two times a day for only ten days. I stopped due to adverse reactions. I'm now in the process of gradually reducing the dose over a period of 8 days. My main reaction was a feeling of being drunk. I refused to drive during this time. On a scale of 1-10 I rate the pain relief a 5 or 6.",
                    "This medication has made a tremendous difference in my life. My pain was due to arthritis and none of the drugs prescribed for this condition worked. After two weeks on Lyrica I feel like a different person and my back is back to normal.",
                    "For pained Multiple Sclerosis sufferers who get no pain relief from the common Carbamazamine treatments, I have found it works perfectly but at high doses. I take 300mg. morning & night to get complete relief. Completely free under Spanish National Health System as it is classified for \"critical\" use in patients.",
                    "I have had fibromyalgia now for more than 20 years and my back pain was getting out of control. I had been taking a low dose of Lyrica (25mg) for some years, along with a cocktail of about 15 other drugs. I did some research, and came up with the fact that Lyrica was licensed for fibromyalgia, and took this to my doctor, who thought it would be an idea to try increasing the dose. After 3 months I am now up to 100mg night and morning, and am getting reasonable pain relief. However, I have severe side effects,the worst one being disturbed sleep every night through foot and leg cramps. I only have to stretch my legs slightly and it starts. Am getting disrupted sleep every night because of it. ",
                    "I really didn't notice much difference after 6 months on Lyrica - still had minor headaches, but apparently swelling went down (MRI). I DID notice the sleepiness at first, followed by insomnia and 30 lbs weight gain in that 6 months and swollen fingers and belly area.",
                    "I didn't even know Lyrica was prescribed as an off lable treatment for anxiety. I was mainly taking it for my fibromyalgia and phantom pain from an amputation. And I didn't realize until now I had full blown GAD and have probably had it since my teens.  I thought it was mostly depression. I journal and I can see that when I have been on Lyrica I didn't reach the extreme kind of depression I've been in. I recently tried to quit again because it causes me to be lethargic and to not be able to lose weight. It may have been some withdrawal symptoms, but within a week I was in grueling depression-anxiety. The DAY I started back on my 75mg/day Lyrica I started feeling better!",
                    "This didn't really change the pain levels but what it did do was make me gain weight substantially. This lead to me getting depressed which made the fibro flare up again. I stopped taking it.",
                    "I was prescribed Lyrica for fibromyalgia. The first hour after I took Lyrica I felt better and at night, I slept like a dream. I was on for a total of two weeks in which time I started feeling bloated and put on weight. I am a heart patient and I started getting angina. My blood pressure started to raise. I started getting headaches. My only wish was that I could have continued taking Lyrica as the fibromyalgia pain was gone. But I'll just have to keep looking. ",
                    "I started taking Lyrica 4 months ago. I am always anxious when taking a new medicine as I am also on Paxil, which is horrible if I do not have a dose within 24 hours. Within an hour I felt 'weird' like I do if i miss a dose of Paxil. That feeling subsided throughout the day. Over the next days I did feel quite vague and forgetful (like I couldn't remember my bank account number, which I use daily). Again I persisted, taking 75mg twice a day, on waking and then at 2pm. I noticed an increase in energy and a decrease in pain. ",
                    "I am diagnosed with a type of \"Meralgia Peresthetica\", a Neuropathic pain in my right leg. I also get pain \"breakthrough\" where pain attacks can reach up to 10 on a pain scale. I started Lyrica last year, and now am on 225Mg twice a day and have the same amount of pain control as the Gabapentin, but at a much lower dose. My wife says that I am much more \"aware\" and \"responsive\" on Lyrica and my short term memory issues are not quite as severe, however still there. My weight gain has ceased, however I am having a tough time trying to lose all the weight I have gained.",
                    "I began reporting my symptoms of peripheral neuropathy to my doctor in the 90's. My stroke in 2002 finally got my doctor's attention that my nerve pain was real. She dropped me as her patient and subsequent doctors ignored my pain complaints. In 2004 I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia but my Neurologist said not to take Lyrica. Fortunately, I recently got a new Primary Care Physician and new Neurologist. Two weeks ago, my new PCP gave my samples of Lyrica. I am amazed at my improved ability to function already. I think of the years of being bedridden at age 36-41. I can't believe that I wasn't prescribed Lyrica, a decade ago. No side effects so far. I still have pain 24/7, but the relief due to Lyrica, is a miracle.",
                    "I was given Lyrica for my fibromyalgia in 2007. No relief, but gained 30 pounds in 3 months and continued gaining until it reached 55 pounds! I've lost less than 10 pounds, hard weight to lose so be aware.",
                    "Tried every ssri and srni out there over the last 10 years together with 3 separate lots of CBT minimum 20 sessions per course. And had very little success. The anti depressants had effects but not desirable ones.At times they replaced some anxieties with others and bad side effects. Sleep, sex drive, confusion. From someone who has experimented with recreational drugs including ecstasy the feeling I had from anti depressants was sometimes similar to a moderate come down from recreational drugs. I pretty much gave up on drugs Then along came pregablin which I hadn't spotted before. It is by far the best thing I've taken I started on 150mg a day now on 225mg won't go higher I don't feel as scared anymore I can do things. Try it.",
                    "I've been taking 600mg for about 2 years due to a spinal cord injury. It is one of the few medicines that seem to help tolerate the daily pain.",
                    "I have full body RSD. Lyrica brings down the burning and helps with the pain especially in my face and upper body. I also have to take Cymblata and tramadol with morphine but like I said I have full body RSD. Only side effect is my vision and I feel like I'm high but the benefits outweigh the side affects",
                    "I am 36, have a bad case of herniated disc that hits me in the back. Lyrica has helped a lot with pain and overcoming my hernia's crisis twice, at 150-300 mg daily. This is not an example of chronic use, although I might be such one case in the future if the problem persists.  In lower doses it seems to take more time (days) to take effect, in higher doses the side-effects are more pronounced.  My side-effects were: slight sedation, euphoria, strange body coordination, all in all: the psychoactivity. One can have an accident on these, so caution should be exercised and doctors instructions followed strictly. Using cars or other potential dangerous machines should probably be avoided too.  ",
                    "This (Lyrica) has been the best option I have tried. It did not make me drowsy and made long days of standing and walking on my bad foot almost unnoticeable.",

                    "Had spinal fusion in Jan 2015. I had severe nerve damage due to spinal stenosis. I had terrible burning pain in my entire right leg. Opiates did nothing for it. I have only been on lyrica for a week and I definitely feel somewhat of an improvement . I am hoping it gets even better in the coming weeks.",
                    "I started having intermittent pain about two months ago all over my body. My hands, shoulders, legs, knees, feet... it all hurt. My doctorr tested for inflammatory diseases and autoimmune diseases and nothing showed up. He decided to treat me as if I have fibromyalgia and gave me Lyrica (not sure what dose but supposed to take 2x a day) this little capsule is great. I can move and actually sleep comfortably at night. Only issue is it does make me sleepy so I can only take at night but that's good for me right now.",
                    "I took lyrica for long standing neuropathic pain. I took it before bed and woke up the next day completely in a haze, dizzy , uncoordinated and could not function. It made my symptoms worse. The dose was 150 mg. I am just sharing my experience. Unfortunately it is not helpful for me.",
                    "I was prescribed this capsule when my pain in left thigh muscle became unbearable and I was not able to stand or walk. Either this, or combined first 3 days muscle relaxant made my pain vanish. I was prescribed for 15 days and after 8 days, I forgot to take one night. I felt much better next day (after not taking). As I am getting pain in knee joints, which I did not have earlier, I think, I will gradually stop it.",
                    "I have BiPolar disorder with the main symptom being never ending depression and anger. GAD, PTSD, OCD, severe memory loss and Fibromyalgia. I have been taking 25mg 4x a day for a week and am a new person. What a miracle after taking medicines for 20 years that didn't work. I have my life back. I can remember, think and function again. I still can't believe it. I was sure I had Alzheimers. I now know I don't. I'm 65 and can't believe I may be able to be a normal person after being so mentally ill for more than 20 years. Fibromyalgia is much better. Anxiety almost gone. OCD obsessive thoughts gone.  Haven't been able to drive in 5 years. Hubby takes me everywhere. Hoping to drive again soon. ",

                    "Lyrica works. Unfortunately, I am on the verge of discontinuing use because of significant side effects. The most troubling for me are the eye disorders (conjunctivitis and blurred vision), and the dementia. I am 53 years old and I have trouble remembering elementary words! It's very embarrassing. I also have a significant taste disorder... many things taste like \"burnt garlic\" to me... that's the best way I can describe it. Finally, I have facial bloating, weight gain, and dizziness. I have been on the maximum dose of Lyrica for chronic pain due to degenerative disc disease in my neck. I was willing to endure the weight and dizziness, but the eye, memory and taste problems are intolerable. Too bad, because Lyrica really helps pain.",
                    "I've been on 75mg, 2x/day for 2 months. Difference is night and day! I have RA, nerve damage form a pretty bad accident, herniated discs and vein's are dying. I'm a mess. Tried everything, but Lyrica has been the one that worked. Not completely, but they may bump up the dosage, I'm told. Trying for 2 more months til I see my GP again. Lucky my insurance pays- otherwise I'd never be able to afford it.",
                    "The best way to describe how well Lyrica works for me is to say, \"I'm young again! I'm a 50 yr old who has suffered with fibromyalgia for many years. Every morning on waking I would just lay in bed dreading the pain and discomfort of something as simple as getting up and out of bed. I was prescribed Cymbalta, Celebrex and Tramadol which help; but nothing works as well as Lyrica. I am able to get more done now without slowing down. Like I said before, I feel years younger. I have read that Lyrica poses an abuse warning, but what I experience isn't really euphoria (High) as one might experience with opiates. I experience relief of pain and maybe \"light on my feet\" and actually stronger muscles %u2014 but not the euphoria of opiates.",
                    "It helped with the pain but every few months the doctor would have to increase the dose for me to have relief. Bad side it caused weight gain.",
                    "This is a miracle medicine. My pain prior to taking this medicine was so bad. I was having a hard time waking up in the mornings cause the pain was just wearing me down. It was harder to function at work too. My imagination started running wild as I started wondering if I was going to end up on social security disability. I've had 2 back surgeries C4-C7, and started to have new pain in the T spine below the 3 level fusion. I started taking Neuronton a few months ago for my pain and it did help some, but after a few months it wasn't helping anymore. My pain was strong and deep. I just didn't have much hope in this medicine but it is AMAZING! I have my life back. It helped with my anxiety also.",
                    "Like most others, I've tried everything possible for fibromyalgia over the past several years. I also have 3 herniated discs and chronic back pain. I tried Lyrica in the past and it did not help. Two years later I tried it again and in fact am still on 300 mg/day in combination with Flexeril 10 mg at night. It helped to take the edge off for about a month then suddenly stopped working. As I am going on a vacation soon, I am not beginning to wean off yet as I will wait until we return. Perhaps increasing the dosage would help? We will see. So far all I had was a month with a little less pain and am having a hard time maintaining my weight. My memory loss and grasping for words has also noticeably increased (and I am young). ",
                    "I was taking only 75mg per day of Lyrica for Fibromyalgia pain. I found it to be very helpful to me and helped me to get much needed rest at night. I took my dosage at night 2 - 3 hours before bed. My only issue with it was there were occasions where I felt a little \"spacy\" but overall, the pain left and I was able to carry out most of my day without significant pain. It was a very low dosage, so a lot of the side effects that some people experience could be from taking a much larger dosage. I am no longer taking it because I lost my insurance and can't afford the cost. However, I was told about Neurontin, will be starting it tomorrow and hoping to get some similar relief.",
                    "I was formally diagnosed with fibromyalgia August 2009. After 8 months of trying other medicines and physical therapy I finally gave in to my Doctor and tried Lyrica. I was nervous because I had used Neurontin in the past with bad side effects and thought Lyrica would be the same. I was wrong. Lyrica does make me sleepy but I take 75 mg at night about 2 hours before bed. My Doctor started me out on the lowest dosage and it has worked miracles for me. I have less pain and my muscles don't seem to spasm or twitch as much, I am able to increase my activity levels which helps with the stiff muscles. It also has helped to calm the nerves in my foot that were irritated in an unrelated injury. This medicine has been a miracle for me.",
                    "When I took Lyrica, I gained 40 lbs myself and my eyes were blurry. Once I got off of the medicine it has been still hard to lose the weight. It did work for my leg pain but the side effects were to much!",
                    "I have found I have an increased urge to eat sweet foods. I have tried to control this by eating fruit. However, this does not stop the craving for sweets. Also I have noticed an increased thirst and less urination. Further I have been able to stop using morphine patches and taking Mersyndol Forte since starting Lyrica. The lessening of pain has enabled me to sleep better",
                    "The nerve pain became so unbearable that it forced me to take lyrica despite the bad reviews and long list of negative side effects. I was told by many that it worked a lot better that neurontin with less drastic negative effects. Well, it has eased my pain some, but the side effects have taken my life from me. I'm dizzy at times, my head is always foggy and not clear thinking, I have depression, anger outbursts I've never had before, daily nausea, and am so tired that I can sleep all day and night long and can barely function. Unfortunately the alternative medications have even worse negative side effects, so what are we supposed to do in order to have some normalcy?",
                    "I call it a miracle drug like most others who have shared their comments. I have been taking it now for 7 months, currently 450mg a day (for treatment of fibromyalgia). I gained about 20 pounds within 2 months which I desperately needed to do. Overall, I have a better life now thanks to Lyrica. Nothing that I have been prescribed in the last 14 years has even came close to treating my condition.",
                    "I've suffered from Fibromyalgia since I was 16 years old (I'm now 24). My doctor put me on pain killers/ muscle relaxers, anti-inflammatories, Cymbalta and the list goes on. I've been told to change my diet. Nothing truly worked. Then I saw the Lyrica commercial. Asked my Doctor about it and he told me he had heard great things about it. I was given a free week trial. The FIRST pill- I could tell a slight difference. It's day 7 for me and I LOVE this pill thus far. ",
                    "It works for the muscle aches and it actually makes me a lot calmer. I don't know if that's just because I feel better so I can relax or if it's the medicine. I was so happy and blessed to find a doctor who listened to what was wrong with me and actually followed through with treatment. Hope that it can help more people and that there are no long term side effects but I am happy with the results and how quickly I felt a difference.",
                    "If you are debating on whether to take this, please don't hesitate. I was in car accident Dec 2012 and have whiplash/cervical strain. Injured my neck and shoulder. I was in pain for the past 9 months and no doctor would prescribe me narcotics due to Ohio law. I was miserable, crying, irritable and nothing I took (IB, Tylenol) wouldn't touch the pain. I got a prescription for Gabapentin, which I am allergic to BAD side effects. Finally the doc gave me Lyrica, within 15 min of taking pain GONE. I feel like I'm back to normal again (like the day before accident). Lyrica is a miracle although pricey. There is a program you can get through Lyrica website to qualify for free prescription. Try it.",
                    "Initially, this medicine was a godsend. Burning pain finally fizzled away. Muscle pains, didn't help as much. Still got numb and weak as well. The real problem came months later when I realized I was having memory problems. Had to wean off it. Memory loss was permanent. Chunks of time just gone. I still think because of the state of pain I was in I would do it over. Maybe the pain made me block out the time. I wish I would have just risked stopping it sooner to see if the nerve had healed. I still take them when I am desparate for relief. But just one maybe two until the zingers stop. Oh ya, nerves were damaged from electricity. Hand to my neck and face.",

But even with these great meds I feel bad. From my waist to botton of my feet I hurt so. I do see my legs are swelling so very large and skin gets tight it hurts to walk. I dont know what else to do. I work and am on my feet all day. I go up and down the stairs at home I try to get extra walks in going around the blocks. But it hurts too bad. Im very tolerant to pain but this is to the point of no return. I feel bad for my family that maybe I'm a burden. And if I feel this way now how will I feel if I'd ever need some one to help me with everyday chores and hygiene. They may not see",

I don't suffer night terrors but feel as though I've been dragged through a hedge backwards upon awakening. I do NOT feel rested upon awakening. Cognitive issues due to the injury have been exaggerated after taking Lyrica.",
                    "This medicine was my neuropathic calming wonder medicine until my body over the course of several years had progressed to full body pain. I recommend anyone who has new or has out grown their pain medication to talk to your doctor about this.",
                    "The first time I used Lyrica I experienced an amazingly profound reaction; layers of depression and anxiety that had built up over several years melted away within minutes. That was years ago and I have since both weaned myself off the drug and restarted taking it again. One thing I rarely see mentioned is the terrifyingly bad withdrawal effect- missing more than one dose for me throws me into the absolute darkest pits of despair. Has anyone else experienced this? When I went off the drug the first time I felt like I had performed a miracle; so strong was the feeling that it took a long time for me to convince myself that things were bad enough to warrant going back on. It still helps, but nothing as miraculous as the first time.",

CBT, 40mg Citalopram, nothing. I then discovered pregabalin on this website. It was a struggle to get it prescribed on the NHS in the UK, but I'm so glad I persevered. This medicine is nothing short of a miracle. Within 24 hours I was a new person. I've only been taking it a week, but now I feel light and happy, and the anxiety has just faded away. I don't need alcohol any more. In fact, the thought of drinking now makes me feel ill.  If you have GAD - please try this. I'm only on 75mg twice a day as well.",
                    "This gave me incredibly bad nightmares not read other reviews with this problem but main reason I'm coming off it... does help slightly with anxiety but feel a bit too relaxed not good for daytime and work... does 150mg taken at night also causes dizziness and my eyes can't focus extremely groggy in the morning not great for me",
                    "I have been suffering from severe pudendal nerve damage pain and fibromyalgia for over 12 years. Vicodin, Percocet, Duragesic, Oxycontin, injections, you name it. Lyrica 75mg 2-3 x day has made the biggest difference in my life and pain in over 12 years. I can walk without a cane and I feel like doing things. There was some initial weight gain, but that seems to have leveled off. I've been amazed and very pleased.",
                    "I used Hydrocodone and Tramadol for persistent joint and neck/back pain. Didn't appreciate the foggy out of body living experience but it did help the pain. Although with narcotics, I became easily resistant and constant increasing of dosage doesn't seem like the most practical idea for long term pain. Lyrica took about one month to actually show it's benefits, luckily I had gotten free samples for that trial period. After the 1st month I noticed significant relief from my persistent joint pain. I am able to function normally for most of the day without any issues. So happy to have found Lyrica, just wish it wasn't so expensive!",
                    "I have been on lyrica for 1 month, starting at one 75mg twice daily for two weeks, then stayed on 150mg twice daily for two weeks. I had horrible side effect so my doctor told me to split the morning dose that was 150mg in to taking 75mg in the morning and 75mg afternoon, then 150 at nite. So the side effects got better. I suffered from extreme dizziness, increased anxiety, had a feeling my legs couldn't carry me, burning sensation throughout the whole body. After one month of medication, when side effect had gone away a little bit, I talked to my doctor and he told me than since I still suffer from anxiety we should increase the dose to 150/75/150. Side effects are back, I take oxazepam 30 mg to get through the worst side effect and waiting for a better effect on anxiety. However I am better than before.",
                    "My doctor just put me on Lyrica 25 mg tablet twice a day. The first day I took one dose around lunch the other before bedtime and got sleepy in the day. Anyway I emailed doctor he said only take the one at nite but I decided to take both at nite and feel great! I have suffered for years with fibromyalgia and cymbalta was not working for the fibromyalgia but I also take cymbalta for depression so still on that added the Lyrica and feel that the great pain is so much less, my knees and ankle pain, burning sensation all down, and finally get a good sleep without all the leg pain. I am thankful for this drug and finally can get my life back on track and finally see light at the end of my long tunnel of dealing with this horrible condition.",

Also my fingers and face are very puffy to the point of being uncomfortable.And the worst part is the chronic dry mouth.I have to keep a water bottle on hand to sip on constantly!(Having a chronic dry mouth puts you at a higher risk of cavities.)And weight gain",

I honestly didn't think pregabalin would be effective but I noticed immediately it helping with the pain in my foot where I'm sure there is nerve damage as well as in my arm where I broke it. Later on in the day I set about doing a chore and realized my anxiety was gone. I mean I still had worry but it was managable? Hard to explain. Started off at 300 mg a day and went up to 450 a day then after a few weeks it was like my anxiety worsened.(I have GAD and take Clonazepam) I was going to go off the Pregbalin but I'm down to 100mg in the morning 50mg at dinner and 50 mg at night. Ok so far",

My life was pretty limited as to what I could do, which was pretty much sitting in a chair at the computer or watching tv. My love for the outdoors was pretty much squashed since it requires bending over, which I can't do, due to the rods and screws in my back. I have only taken this medicine for two days, and I have already have noticed a huge difference. I am actually able to move around more. I also have osteoarthritis, and my joints were hurting. Not anymore. This stuff is amazing. The only drawback is the cost. I have to take it three times a day, and it's really expensive.",

Yet nobody knows the source of these symptoms. Due for a muscle biopsy soon. While taking tramadol and hydrocodone had great results for energy and pain, I became dependent. I was prescribed Lyrica 50mg about 2 months ago and felt a little relief. Doctor raised the dosage and now I take 150mg 3 times a day and the results are amazing. I'm alert, energetic, and pain free. Have a little dizziness now and then, but this medicine is great.",
                    "I would just like to say that I know everyone worries about weight gain on this drug so I thought it important to share a positive experience with this drug. I am on 300mg per day and have experienced no side effects and absolutely no weight gain. I am so much calmer and happier, my mood doesn't plummet suddenly, I am not anxious at all anymore and I am sleeping like a log! 10/10 don't let fear of sudden weight gain effect your decision to take this drug, remember that when they test drugs they don't take into consideration the lifestyles of the test subjects, that 1 in 10 person could just eat to much day to day which would result in weight gain and have nothing to do with the drug. Don't worry too much about it!",

Couldn't sleep due to pain took hydrocodone daily which upset my stomach and I became dependant on it every night and morning due to severe pain.

I explained to the dr that I didn't feel depressed but I worried constantly through the night about things, and would also wake suddenly with chest pain. The dr sent me for ECG but I knew the pain was linked to anxiety. Anyway, after the ECG came back clear, he prescribed Pregabalin (a much lower dose than most people on here) and I only take one at night. I now sleep better, I have not woken with a panic attack since taking them, and my anxiety is no longer controlling me. I've been on them 6 months.",

I have found the side effects to be minimal, the most noticeable is mid afternoon drowsiness and a bit of vertigo. This medicine has also helped calm the need for frequent urination. Who knew?",

My feet still sting and burn on and off everyday. One time, I decided to slowly stop taking Pregabalin and take the generic drug, Gabapentin and my feet flared up by a 1000 percent. I asked my doctor if he could prescribe Pregabalin again. I have had zero/none side effects taking Pregabalin but recently I came across reading peoples \"hellish/nightmare\" experiences trying to wean and stop taking this drug. That scares me and I do not want to be dependent on this drug or any drug. I am going to slowly wean myself off and find other ways to deal with my nerve pain. Prayers needed!",

Even though I still had pain in problematic joints I felt alive and relaxed and hopeful for the first time in what felt like years! My relationship with my husband and my baby (with whom I have had terrible difficulties bonding/guilt/PND. I've started having fun with her, I have finally somehow managed to stop fretting about what I think went wrong/I could've done better and started to enjoy now. The only problem I have with this, and the reason my Rheumatologist won't give more is WEIGHT GAIN.",

Lyrica has been the miracle drug for me and I have been taking it for about 3 years. It takes time for any drug to work properly and I couldn't function with out it. 150mg a day is my dosage.

Although I still worry and feel anxious, I feel a little calmer. The thing is, on the first night, I felt extremely weird. My head was spacey and I couldn't register what people were saying, and once I realised I couldn't come up with a reply. Today, I woke up and I felt drunk and stoned at the same time but not as severe. I found it hard walk straight, my balance was off. I feel happier but not less anxious? I kind of felt calmer and giddy.",

I have found that this low dose of Lyrica works well with 10mg of Vicodin. My feet are tolerable and I can function without kicking my feet every millisecond and always thinking of the pain in my feet. This combination works very well and I recommend it to all diabetic/dialysis neuropathic pain patients.",

I am trying it for GAD (general anxiety disorder) after trying antidepressants; I tried SSRI's like Paxil and Lexapro and these were horrible failures. The SSRI's made me suicidal BUT Lyrica seems to really be doing the trick! The weight of anxiety is totally gone, and I feel somehow stronger and more self confident, although the feeling is a little manic at times and irregular, like feeling quite drowsy, then quite manic, in a short period of time. But I am assuming that this might stabilize after a few more days. So far I feel like a new person!",

Decided this year I want to come off them for good. I've tried many times in the past unsuccessfully. I take 150 - 200mg a day - different times depending on how I feel that day. Sleeping better, emotions have come back and I am not an anxious wreck! very helpful and no side effects.  Today I am having a little bit of a rough day with anxiety but I am safe in the knowledge that Pregablin will prevent it from escalating and that I can safely ride the wave until it passes, thanks to this amazing drug",
                    "I took Lyrica for a couple of months. It helped with some of the fibro pain and I felt tired and a little dizzy along with having dry mouth which I expected as common side effects. What surprised me was I got new pains in new places--my big toe felt like it was on fire and my lower back hurt badly. I started weaning off of Lyrica and the new pains went away. I also had insomnia from weaning process. I think it does work to dull the fibro pain but not sure if it's worth it if there are new pains.",

It definitely relieved my leg pain. I was also taking Tramadol which I decreased because Lyrica does the job as well and I don't like the tramadol as it makes me sleepy. Lyric does not make me sleepy. I have had no problems with Lyrica and been on it several months . Have gone off it also for several weeks with no problems at all. Maybe it helps some people and others not. For me, it really relieved my nerve pain in my legs.",
                    "This medicine worked pretty well for me. I didn't realize how well it worked until I went off of it before getting pregnant. The thing I didn't like about it though was that it always made me feel like I was in a cloud. My thinking wasn't clear. I would get dizzy. I didn't notice too much of a weight gain, but there was some. In the end, I chose to try a different med (Savella) after my daughter was born and have been happier with that. Still works and fewer side effects.",

I have only been taking it for 3 days and I can already tell a significant difference. My hands and feet have no burning pain and I seem to have less numbness. I have also noticed that it helps tremendously with my anxiety. I was taking Xanax 1mg 3x a day and now I only take it once a day if that. I seem to feel more relaxed and less anxious so maybe this will actually help me stop taking the Xanax which I've tried so many times in the past. So far I am super impressed with this medication.",
                    "I was taking Xanax to calm the muscle spasms and Tylenol 3 for severe pain. This combination worked but I was terrified of addiction. Now taking 75mg Lyrica 3x a day.

AND I've needed a cane to walk for the last 2-3 yrs. FMS & depression compete for the title of \"most debilitating.\" I've tried almst everything, (Cymbalta was useless.) The last 2 months I've been taking slowly increased doses of Lyrica. Currently on 150mg a day, (2x 75mg,) with a view to 300-400mg. I've had zero relief from pain, BUT nasty side fx. Almost no sleep. Worsened depression & anxiety. Terrible FMS type 'fog.' Flatulance! Cannot see this contiuing or improving. (Available on PBS in Australia.)",
                    "I find it sad reading some of these reviews as many of the side-effects people are listing can be helped or eliminated by using Lyrica in combination with other medications. Have your Doctor consult with a psychiatrist - because they know effective drugs to layer with this anticonvulsant - and you can continue to reap the benefits of Lyrica. I know it sure worked for me & life is so worth living now.",

Lately, I was having more pain in those areas, and my hips have started really hurting me. My doctor and I ran tests, and by process of elimination we feel that I have chronic fatigue, which can contribute to a lot of the allergy/asthma symptoms, the pains and exhaustion. I started taking Lyrica and am up to 100mg 3 x daily. I feel great. Everything but my hip is better.",

But now I have developed severe muscle weakness, headache, abdominal cramping, blurry vision, bad judgement which causes accidents to my fingers and toes I have recently had difficulty thinking clearly. I can barely hold myself up and I can't lift anything over a few pounds. I have asked my doctor if I can safely stop taking it.

Tried stopping lycria for 1 day as I gained confidence. Went back on it within 1 day leg and lower back pain unbearable. Sleep much better on it . Would advise anyone to try for chronic pain- side effects much less than Gabapentin by far. Had to stop work lost cognitive ability and brain fog worsened",

I now have a doctor who has prescribed Lyrica for me for the last 4 months. At a starting dose of 75mgs twice daily there was noticeable relief. Still hurting, however, my dosage was increased to 300 mgs twice daily which has successfully reduced the pain so that I am able to function at a higher level than I have experienced in years with minor side effects, the most annoying of which is sleepiness. I am grateful and relieved to have been introduced to Lyrica and to have insurance that will cover it as it is obscenely expensive.",

I have very bad social anxiety but on that day I was not afraid of anything, I felt any goal that I had always wanted to pursue I suddenly could, and even if I failed, I would deal with it. My only fear that day was that this would be temporary, and sadly, it was. The next day I took it, and I got only the slightest hint of what I had the day before, the tiny effect maybe lasted for the next couple days, then nothing, I kept taking it, thinking it might somehow kick in after time, but then I started to notice I was gaining lots of weight I stopped.",

With hesitation I took the first pill last night and woke up feeling like I did 10 years ago! I'm still shocked. I haven't noticed any side effects, but this is definitely worth every penny!",

My Rhematologist has given me Lyrica to try and I have to say so far so good. I have only taken 3 doses and already I am getting a better quality sleep. So much so that my husband has noticed my improved overall state of mind. I am a little cloudy the next day but I am hoping this will ease over time.

I can not explain this but within an hour of taking lyrica I get the most severe tooth pain, like every tooth suddenly has a hole in it ? I went to my dentist the first time NO HOLES?? My doctor thought it was amusing ? Bizarre. My real problem is the next morning after taking lyrica I have horrendous stomach pain for days, hurts to urinate, poop or fart. Feels like I really have to push to urinate, my doctor said sounds like stomach/intestine inflammation which is on the common side, so I've been taken off it.

I started to feel a slight benefit from the drug a few weeks after beginning to take it but it wasn't until I started swimming that my long standing pain completely disappeared. I never missed a dose until a few days ago: just ran out, had to wait til the next day, effectively missing two doses. I went through an incredibly harrowing experience in that time without the drug...it wasn't psychological: I could almost physically feel the chemistry in my brain and body going totally haywire. It was extremely alarming, nothing can describe how nasty it was.",
                    "I have had fibromylgia now for 20 yrs plus lupus and had 7 tumors removed from my body, heart attack at the age of 40 and about died. I was put on Lyrica 5 years ago and I have my life back. I take 100mg twice a day and now I can enjoy my life again.",
                    "Lyrica works very well with pins, needles, tingling and numbness. The negative side effects were \"loopiness\", and inability to feel full after eating. I gained 40 lbs very quickly.",
                    "The needle standing pain was bad, but then I developed this feeling like I dipped my lower legs and feet in frying oil. It all is getting worse. It has really been tough especially at night trying to sleep.",
                    "I have been in pain for years and started Lyrica. I cannot believe the difference. It is shocking. My pain is so much better. My bladder spasms are gone. I sleep so well. Wake up in the morning without hurting my back and ribs to breath. My chronic diarrhea is gone too. The only thing I have noticed on the negative side is I am super hungry, which doesn't surprise me. Overall, loving it and praying it continues to work. No side affects other than being hungry:)",
                    "I was diagnosed with Lupus 3 yrs. ago.Several months ago,during one of my doctor's visits, I discussed feeling more pain. He prescribed Lyrica. I was taking 3x daily, changed to twice daily. (I was experiencing \"foggy\" thinking with 3x daily). I have been VERY pleased with the results I feel.",
                    "I've had Fibromyalgia for ten years now, along with other health problems and up until a week ago I was using Flexerel and Cataflam to help with the pain and discomfort. Until last week, I was under a lot of stress at work, mind you I teach infants and toddlers up to age 3, and I woke up one morning in pain. Pain over my entire body. Pain I have never felt before. I felt like I had a supped up version of the Flu. I went to work in tears and left in tears and headed straight to my doctor. I began Lyrica that day and I was pretty out of it the first night and especially the next day when I took the next dose. I slept most of the first day and the second day I was a little dizzy headed and off balance. So far Lyrica is working well",
                    "I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia about 18 years ago. I stopped working a few years after due to the pain. I tried many medications so I could have some quality of life with my husband and 2 children. I spent most of my time in bed or on the couch because the pain was so debilitating. I was taking Ultram and Zanex but these just didn't take away the pain and then my doctor started me on Lyrica. I started feeling like a new person because slowly the pain started to decrease. The only side effect which could also be part of Fibromyalgia is with speech. I have trouble sometimes finding the words I want to say. I now take 75 mg 3 times per day and have been taking it for over 10 years. I'm so grateful to have my life back.",
                    "I had shingles in January 2014. I have had terrible PHN ever since. 2.5 years of pain. It has been awful!! Shingles is the worst pain I have ever experienced and it isn't going away. I tried everything out there from Gabapentin to acupuncture, to percocet, to injections in my back and nothing helped, or it would help for a few weeks, but the pain always managed to come back strong. I was wary of Lyrica because of the side effects, but I finally decided to try it. It has definitely helped me and I can do things like ride my bike again with little pain. However, I have put on 8 lbs in 6 months and I am an extremely active person, so this is tough for me. I also have pain in my joints and sometimes my hands go numb, but less pain.",
                    "Have had fibromyalgia for about 20 years. Have been on Lyrica 600mg for 2 years. To date this has offered me the best pain relief. I was also taking Zytram, up until 2 months ago. ",
                    "I have been taking Lyrica for three months. I started out with 75mg twice a day. It took the edge off my fibromyalgia pain during the day but at night I would wake up due to muscle pain when laying on one side too long. My doctor increased me to 150mg twice a day and for the first time in months, I was able to sleep through the night. I feel like a new person. It's a wonder drug. For once I am not walking around like a zombie due to pain and lack of sleep. I have gained a couple of pounds but I can live with that.",
                    "The pain from Fibromyalgia comes as MUSCLE cramping, tingling, twitching, spasms, etc. It is not a \"nerve\" illness per se, yet doctors think people are stupid and prescribe this anyway. It does nothing for the pain or fatigue from Fibromyalgia or Chronic Fatigue/M.E. Until people realize that legitimate users of meds such as Hydrocodone, morphine ER, etc are rarely abused by people in genuine chronic pain, doctors will continue to jeopardize patients lives by giving them meds like this as a placebo with nasty side effects. One doctor also put me on Paxil which gave me Serotonin Syndrome and I was in Intensive care for a week! This was when SSRI's first came out and I went into med journals. Avoid this for chronic MUSCLE pain.",

I was prescribed Lyrica for fibromyalgia pain, and chronic fatigue. I was on almost the highest dose for 2 months and did NOTHING for me but make me gain 25 pounds! I am 5'6\" 125 and went up to 150lbs. 125 pounds is a high weight for me so 150 is too much for my frame. ",
                    "I was prescribed Neurontin for anxiety and panic, but it made me a zombie. I am now taking Lyrica and it is amazing! No more anxiety or panic and my mood is greatly improved. Neurontin was like whiskey hit hard and had \"hangover\", Lyrica is like a fine wine, subtle and mellow and doesn't have the zombie effect. DON'T DRINK ALCOHOL WITH IT this was only a reference. I am taking 75mg at night and 50 in the morning. I also don't need the antidepressants anymore.",

Still tired because I move so much",

Nothing worked, opioids almost led to death. 2 months ago begam Lyrica (100mg, 3x/day). At beginning: brain felt \"foggy\"; walking unstable; total urinary incontinence (some bowel incontinence). To say I was shocked at how the Lyrica relieved my spine pain is an undersatement! I read all the horror stories, but decided to give it time. This is the first time since the early eighties I have had NO pain! The side effects are gone.",
                    "I take 75 mg at bedtime. I started Lyrica in 2015 when I had shingles. I noticed that I wasn't having crippling anxiety. I was able to stop Klonopin. I went back on Klonopin when we moved out of state. I also started Ambien 5mg. For sleep issues. I thought I could stop Lyrica. That was a big mistake. Last night I didn't take the Lyrica and I am so anxiety ridden and feel physically sick. I will definitely take the Lyrica tonight.",
                    "I was taking 50mg Lyrica every 2 hrs or sooner each day; while it did seem like I had more energy and could work a little longer before resting, the pain never stopped or lightened up. Lyrica  amitriptyline did help me sleep better. I quit taking Lyrica and started taking gabapentin 300mg 3Xper day and the pain lessened a lot, and sleep is better and some of the brain fog is gone.

                    "I found this to be very effective in treating the after effects of double fusion of cervical vertebrae. Then I found I was having less difficulty with fibromyalgia. I was on 3 a day and only side effect was weight gain.",

I see it as my salvation when compared to some of the medications I have taken over the years. YES, withdrawal from any form of medication is horrific and with uncertainty and discomfort. I personally am prepared to go through this horrible time to give Lyrica it's chance to work and improve my life, as I have seen an improvement already. Thanks to those who worked so hard to make this medicine for those of us who need it, know that your work is appreciated.",

Fentanyl for fms is like a heavy bat for the wrong ball but was the only bat available.  I have been taking Lyrica for 1 1/2 yrs now. Had 1st pain free days in years when 1st started. Unfortantely, still on fentanyl in addition because I cannot take more then 50mg a day of lyrica w/o it knocking me out. Tried to build tolerance over 3 wks w/o success. Have had wild vision changes also.",
                    "My Anxiety had crippled me to a state which my life could no longer function. The first few days on Lyrica I noted a sense of euphoria and confusion but by the 4th day I found myself able to think about trigger points for my anxiety and was almost in awe of how it didn't raise its head. It seemed like anxiety had left my body, to the point where I had to look in a mirror and say \"why did you care about all that so much?\" Almost in disbelief of my previous behaviour, not being able to connect with those feelings or attitudes became freeing. lyrica gave me my life back it seems. Importantly, I'm still me. Friends and family all commented how much better I am without losing personality which i believe is one of the best qualities of the drug.",
                    "On my first day taking Lyrica, it was incredible - I was patient, calm, and chilled out. I could deal with stress better than I have been able to in my entire life. However, I quickly grew a tolerance, and I spent weeks chasing that feeling by upping my dose. When I finally reached 250mg, I was an absolute zombie. I was taking much longer to finish my sentences and I felt like I was constantly in a fog. My depression has reached an all-time high and my anxiety is still present - I'm just not having panic attacks any more. The past few months have been particularly bad and I just don't think it's worth being on any more. I think I'm especially disappointed now because it started out so well and I'm significantly worse off now.",
                    "It makes the pain go away and I can finally sleep at night. I'm so glad they have this medicine. The only side effect that I have had is the weight gain, which is 25 pounds so far and I have only been on it a month. At first I had some dizziness and minor hand and face swelling but that has gone away. If they could only improve so it wouldn't make you gain weight it would be a perfect medicine.",

                    "Only took one prescribed dose with real bad reaction. Ended up in hospital with dangerously slow heart rate. Unable to talk, walk or stand, it felt like I had a stroke. Severe joint pain and urinary retention developed within 24 hours and I found it incredibly difficult to remain conscious. Hospital staff did not recognise the symptoms as an adverse effect of the medication, even though I handed them the advisory notes from the medication, and treated me as though I was just having an anxiety attack or attention seeking. It wasn't until I was discharged and read up on the medication that I was able to confirm that all the symptoms I had were listed as side effects. needless to say I did not take any more.",

I take 150 mg of Lyrica in the morning and 300mg at bedtime. My sleep is better. I still have difficulty moving around in the morning, but within an hour of taking my morning dosage the majority of my pain, etc is gone.",
                    "I have been on Lyrica almost 2 1/2 years. When I first started it I was really skinny so weight gain didn't bother me but now I have gained over 25 lbs which is not good at all. I am going to go back to Gabapentin which helped me get off morphine. My eyes are dry and blurry. I fart all the time and I am fat! I was off of it the beginning of the year and I was hurting but side affects are too much.",

What I didn't realise was it also helps with anxiety and depression, after 3 weeks I noticed a calmness I thought I could never achieve, did some googling on the benefits of Lyrica last night and was amazed at everyone's experience on Lyrica. This is great stuff, would recommend it highly, thank you Lyrica, back to fun time with the kids again.",

                    "With the recent changes to pain medication guidelines I was reduced from opiates and given Lyrica to try. RUN, don't walk away from this medicine. My memory got fuzzy, I stumbled and fell in injurying my back, it keeps new synapsis from forming in your brain (I.e. brain damage long term), I have rashes, etc. Most importantly, I started having thoughts of death. All of this on 50mg at bed time.  In a few years I'm sure TV lawyers will be soliciting patients for lawsuits. This is a strong chemical to introduce into a already weak person's system.",
                    "I have suffered a very long time to the point where my bones ached so bad that it brought me to a complete halt in life. My mother also suffers as well as my daughter who is showing many of the symptoms that I had at her age. I have been on Lyrica for ten days now and can not believe the difference it has made. I hope that this med can improve other's lives as well as it has mine, because FM is a horrible thing to have to live with. No side effects so far. Here is hoping it is for you..",
                    "My doctor prescribed this for me when I was dealing with pain from a fractured sternum. After dealing with the pain for over a year we tried this. Fantastic results. Required only 3 weeks of treatment and the pain resolved.",
                    "I was prescibed pregabalin for leg pain associated with Spinal Stenosis. The first prescribed was 225 mg daily. Side effects extreme tiredness and swollen ankles. When I tried to stop this drug I experienced severe anxiety and feelings of gloom. Went back on see and say the pain clinic who advised tapering 25mgs every 2 weeks. I am down to 50mgs am and pm. The withdrawal is one of the hardest things I have been through and cannot wait until this drug is totally out of my system. Lesson learnt to research prescribed drugs, their side effects and withdrawal before blindly accepting them.",
                    "I rated Lyrica as \"one\" because IF your prescription plan does not pay for it, it is worth nothing to you UNLESS you are prepared to pay about $350.00 a month out of your own pocket. It's effectiveness for a few of my problems was very good, but since I cannot afford it, it's effectiveness is actually ZERO to me now.  Don't take the free sample that will be offered to you (unless you can afford it later). Stopping Lyrica will be the one of the most miserable things you have ever tried in your life! It is a horrible withdrawal. the company is just like a street dealer of drugs. BOTH give you \"free samples\" to get you dependent on the drug and they charge big money for you to continue taking it.",
                    "Initial euphoric effects wore off so dosage was increased. Was told would treat nerve pain and later told good for anxiety. My anxiety got worse on med as when it was due or late I was ill, it has addictive qualities I do not like. My health took a nose dive on this and I had to come off due to blurred vision, weight gain, blocked bowel. My Doctor advised decreasing of 75mg a week. My first drop was hell completely threw me into panic as I felt so ill, no one explained withdrawal when I saw medics in a state no one comforted me saying it could be the reduction too high/quick for me, after all in hindsight if I felt unwell late taking one dose then dropping 75mg wouldn't be helpful quickly, lower doses not easy to get as more costly to NHS etc",
                    "I'm really waiting for the other shoe to drop with this medicine, because for me it has thus far been thoroughly life saving. I had been in pain every minute of every day, with some days being completely overwhelmed by the pain. Now I feel like I can live again. I just noticed that increased suicide risk was a potential side effect of Lyrica, which might concern me as I've suffered from major depressive disorder for >25 years. But being on this medicine has raised my mood a great deal because I don't have chronic pain to deal with on top of my baseline mood disorder. It is so wonderful. I'm waiting to hear that it causes something dreadful - because isn't that usually the case when something works so well.",

Heating pads aren't therapeutic, I sleep on 4 ice packs (I know, eeww, but whatever works). They help with inflammation, try them. Lyrica gave me agonizing, shooting pains from deep within shoulder and hip joints down humerus and femur. And unwelcome 35 lb weight gain. And blurry vision that meant I couldn't drive. Lyrica was useless for me, so glad you all have something to fight this fibromyalgia.",

I had a dry mouth and throat constantly, and my vision was hard to focus, jumpy. I had stopped and restarted after 4 months, still the same. Breathing is harder, so I've noticed this time.   I have stopped for good!",
                    "I have been taking Lyrica for 3 months. I started at 50mg x 3. Increased to 150 x 3 times a day a month later. I have had almost no pain since starting. The side effects have been extreme dizziness, edema in the feet, weight gain (about 15lbs). At my last appointment the Doctor adjusted the dose to 50mg x 4 times a day. The dizziness comes and goes. This is a great medicine for me. I can handle dizziness at this level.",
                    "My doctor prescribed Lyrica for my anxiety, and it has been a God-send. Dump Trazodone. I feel like normal people are supposed to feel - with basically no side effects. In addition, I have Herpes, and since taking Lyrica have had no Herpes break-outs. This drug is incredible.",

Due to a severe auto accident fifteen years ago, I am now 40 yrs old, and having suffered a closed head injury, fractured pelvis, 4 fractured ribs and tailbone fracture. I have suffered with chronic pain mostly my adult like. I have undergone nearly every pain management regime one can think of: Epid nerve blocks, rhizotomy, physical therapies and of course every narcotic medicine that was available. Yet within just a few months, and after all these years, Doctor and I have finally found a medication regimen that truly works! Lyrica 75 2x a day and MS 60mg 2x daily. And since starting Lyrica, my acute pain episodes are less frequent.",
                    "I was given this medication for pain after suffering from two herniated disks. The medication worked great, but I did not know how good until my doctor took me off of it and my pain returned to its debilitated state.",
                    "I find it helpful for sleep 150 mg with seroquel and Xanax. Sometimes it makes me dreamy or spacey not unpleasant but maybe for its reputation as a street drug in larger doses I have never tried. I don't have much anxiety so have nothing to add.",
                    "I was already overweight and went on Lyrica because of the tingling in my hands and feet being intolerable. Three weeks later, its like I woke up one morning and none of my clothes fit. I got on the scale and from the time my doctor gave me this pill to current and have gained over 25 lbs. It's a shame I have to decide between being obese or able to sleep and be pain free.",

                    "I suffered severe sciatica for two years before my doctor prescribed Lyrica. After a few days of building up in my system, the medication completely killed all of the pain, numbness, and tingling in my right leg. It was so effective, I thought I was suddenly cured! I stopped taking the Lyrica and the symptoms returned after a couple of days. I have now been taking Lyrica for two years and swear it is the best solution available for my bulging disk problem.",
                    "VERY MIXED RESULTS. Had a severe attack of shingles on the face and scalp (3 weeks in most of the hair on one side of my head was literally gone). I refused morphine (in hindsight, I should have taken it) but I did take Percocet which helped the internal pain but not the nerve pain in the skin. For that they gave me Neurontin, but I could not tolerate it due to extreme drowsiness, loss of appetite, loss of concentration and dry mouth (before I could chew food it was too dry to swallow it). Tried Lyrica 75mg 3 times daily. First dose seemed to really work but effect declined significantly so that the fifth dose had no effect. During the fourth week he increased to 100mg 3 times daily. Second dose helped then effects declined.",

I was on Lyrica 150 mg twice a day a couple years ago & truthfully can not remember why I stopped taking it. Since the \"war on pain meds\" My Dr. ask me to try it again. I took for 2 weeks then I started getting blurred vision, confusion, memory loss, & I would be standing in a store and twice the husband had to catch me because I was just falling over. I felt sick inside, instead of my quality of life improving it went down hill. I will never take this so called med again. I will live with the 10 to 15 pain level somehow if I have to spend the rest of my life just sitting still or in the bed. I also got to the point I was severely depressed. Do NOT take this drug.",

Now I can get to sleep easier. Did notice some weight gain... but am working on it. No other side effects noted at this time. Sure has helped me at night!",
                    "Lyrica has saved my life, just wish I'd have started taking it sooner and it would have saved my marriage. My pain is completely controlled and I am no longer taking anti-depressants. I didn't realize it helped with GAD, but it does. I actually feel human again and interact with others. It does have some side effects, can't concentrate and a drunk feeling but compared to the pain I was enduring, these side effects are worth it to me.",
                    "600 mg of lyrica works wonders for me. Its a very good drug and completely takes away the pain. Without this drug I would go insane I've gone days with so much pain that I thought of committing suicide. Really awful feeling because I have always enjoyed life and I'm only 38. Nerve pain is by far the most painful pain I have ever had. To all of you who suffer out there, there will always be a medicine that can help you. Don't give up there is a way this horrible condition. I hope everyone find relief",

I am currently on Suboxone for a 15 year addiction to opiates and was concerned that Lyrica wouldn't work because my body is so screwed up from all the years of opiate use and most medications do not work well for me. Thirty minutes after the first dose I noticed a significant improvement in the neuropathic pain. My bedtime dose was another 75 milligram capsule and I slept better than I have slept in months! This medicine has been a God send for me so far. Hoping that it continues to work well for me! Thanks Pfizer!",
                    "I'm a 41 year old male and I suffer from diabetic Neuropathy in my feet. It's steadily gotten worse over the last 2 years and wasn't even diagnosed properly until 3 months ago. I've been taking Lyrica started with 75mg twice a day which didn't much of anything. I'm now taking 150mg twice a day, it's somewhat effective but not quite there yet not sure if dosage will have to be increased or I'll have to try something else? I haven't had a lot of the side effects others have mentioned except for memory loss. I've noticed that my short term memory hasn't been the best of late but other than that not really many side effects for me.",
                    "I was just diagnosed with fibromyalgia earlier this year. My old doctor prescribed me Cymbalta and it didn't work. I was off from work for 2 months because of the pain. All I did was layed in bed suffering. Seemed like I would never have my normal life back. I went to another doctor and he prescribed me Lyrica it lessened the pain within a day or two. Now I have some of my life back. I still have a little pain but Lyrica has helped me and changed my life.",
                    "I am 37 with multiple illnesses, fibromyalgia, diabetes, arthritis, and schizophrenia being the tip 4. My Doctor put me on 300 mg of Lyrica 3 times a day. Initially, it stopped my severe symptoms of fibromyalgia, initially. I began to have sleeplessness, which became 3 hrs of sleep every other night. My legs from knee down began to tingle, then it felt like worms crawling in them. I had fuzzy vision, and then 60 voices came out in my head, very loud and clear. My Doctor refused to stop lyrica, I stopped taking it and within a month the side effects disappeared.",
                    "Side effects are worse than Fibromyalgia pain. I've been taking Lyrica for two months. It was a miracle drug for the first few weeks. I've been living with Fibromyalgia for over 35 years and have tried eveything. Anti depressants, excersise, bio-feedback, acupuncture, narcotics, you name it. So I was excited about the dramatic pain reduction from Lyrica.But now I have developed severe muscle weakness, headache, abdominal cramping, acne and difficulty thinking clearly. I can barely hold myself up and I can't lift anything over a few pounds. I have asked my doctor if I can safely stop taking it. I'm just waiting g for him to return my call. I would rather just live with my horrible pain than take any more of these toxic drugs.",
                    "I started with 75 mg of Pregabalin which was raised to 100 mg at bedtime. While it helped me in reducing neck pain and I had substantial reduction in anxiety, it started giving me huge side effects. I started having throat pain, sinusitis, vivid dream early morning and some feeling of dizziness. I also added 5 kg of weight in 2 months. I am now tapering it off gradually. While I would say it worked for my main symptoms, unfortunately it gave me too much side effects.",
                    "For the past year I have suffered pain in calf of leg which travels up theough thigh hips and back on walking it becomes extreme and I have to sit down, awaiting MRI scan on spine... physio say stenosis of spine and that I have a slight curve in spine... After reading reviews I decided to try these tabs I have only taken them for 2 nights ( 1 x 75mg cap) supposed to take 2 daily but I feel I cant wake up in mornings and have to force myself to get out of bed, for a couple hours after i still feel groggy and light headed throughout the day. I dont know whether to perservere with them, I have to say slight improvement with being able to walk with a little less pain. I live in Scotland so my prescription is free for this drug.",

                    "Have been rock bottom down by the river, then re-started Pregabalin. IT IS AMAZING. It only took about 24 hours to notice the difference, and wow. A week later and I am nearly 100%. I knew I was anxious not depressed! It should be prescribed as a first-line choice. Previously on it for 3 yrs. I am a 59yr old housewife.",

The first thing I felt was calm all my worries went away second week upped to 100mg 3 times a day feel like a lotto winner walking and talking like a new man. No prob with sex its all still working!

                    "I couldn't remember the last time I had a \"good\" day since diagnosed having Fibromyalgia until 2010, when I was first told about Lyrica by an emergency doctor. The symptoms & pain had got so bad that I drove myself to a Baylor emergency room. Physically and mentally I just felt defeated. I was so stressed out that I developed an ulcer and my potassium/magnesium levels were so low they admitted me several times for as long as a week on time. Bags of blood had to be given and IV fluids. Ugh..I was a hot mess. I don't recall the doctor that introduced me to Lyrica, cause I was in and out a few times, but all I can say is a BIG thank-you. I've been on Lyrica 300mg a day since 2010. I can get what I need done and function like a normal woman.",
                    "I used this for my last herniated disk issue. I had a sequestered herniated L5 L4 issue and suffered from nerve pain down my left leg and drop foot. Pain Medications (e.g. 10mg Percocet 3-4 times daily) did nothing for my leg pain though helped my back. Lyrica at 150mg twice daily did the trick for my leg nerve pain. The sciatica makes your leg kill while you know nothings wrong with it, so with Lyrica I was amazed to have the leg pain just disappear. No side effects. Sciatica went away by itself after 3 months so no need for Lyrica anymore.",
                    "It's simply a miracle.",
                    "This medicine reduced the pain but immediately caused severe swelling of the legs and feet.I also had constant dizziness.I could not tolerate the swelling and weight gain.",
                    "I had put off taking Lyrica because I was afraid of the side effects. Eventually my nerve pain got to the point where I had no choice. It was completely debilitating. Searing burning pain with no relief. Pain meds didn't touch it. I couldn't sleep because the pain was that bad. My clothes hurt. Soft feather light brushes against my skin stung and BURNED for minutes after contact (more intensely than the consistent present burning). After about three weeks on Lyrica I finally found relief from the worst of it. What I am left with as far as the burning goes is completely tolerable (of course it does nothing for my other symptoms). I'm grateful I caved but am concerned about weight gain & significant cravings for sweets.",
                    "I am a 22 year old female who was in a car accident over a year ago, and 6 months ago started having tension headaches, migraines, and overall muscular pain. I had to quit my job and have barely been able to keep up with school. I took Lyrica for the first time last night. It caused some upset stomach and a weird buzz, but this morning I woke up feeling like a different person. I am still sore from my muscles being weak and tight all the time, but today is the first day I could feel that I was still sick from a headcold. The pain and discomfort had drowned out any other discomfort. I am hopeful for the first time in months.",

I have been on Oxy ER 80mg 2x day and was still not getting full relief (4 out of 10) and having difficulty remembering. Doctor added Lyrica 75mg 2x day three months ago and the day after I felt euphoric. I felt no pain! After one week some pain came back but no peaks as before. Some weight gain. Want to get off of Oxy and try Lyrica or other non-narcotic drugs.",
                    "I have just started lyrica but so far it works great for my anxiety and my back pain. Don't give up when you first start with the side effects they pass and this medication works a lot better than any SSRI or lorazapam which is horribly addictive I think I finally found something that can help and I hope that whoever reads this feels the same",
                    "I use Lyrica 75mg (4 X day), Fentanyl Patch and Percocet up to 8 times a day and I have little times that my feet aren't throbbing. My A1C is 6 and I am not on insulin. There has to be something out there that can help. I have been on Cymbalta, Neurontin,and many others.",

Many days could just not make myself move or interact. I had great tired feeling and feeling of pain running thru all parts of my body. Oct 2014 I was lucky. Went to another neuro, prescribed 25mg bid lyrica. In 2 weeks I was myself and have not looked back. Befote this I was an avid runner, pilates, overall exerciser. This came fromnowhere. My lyrica is very low but I just needed it evidently.",

I take Pristiq for maintenance depression medicine and I have to say that after only 3 weeks I have had a 8/10 improvement in trigger point pain, no headaches at all. I do have to say that I will probably come off it though because I have probably gained 5-8 lbs and had a lot of edema of hands and feet.",
                    "I take 75 mg. X 2 per day. It seemed to help the first couple of days, now nothing. I have gained 12+ lbs, too. My appetite is getting out of control. I'm going to talk to my doctor about trying something else. Anyone else having problems with weight gain like me? I still need to take an OTC pain medicine with my Lyrica. Anybody ever try muscle relaxers?",

Started Lyrica 7 months ago, now at 75mg x 2, twice daily.  Reduced oxycodone from 80mg daily to 40mg daily, tramadol for breakthrough. Hope to increase Lyrica and further reduce oxy. Still do PT for flares. PT is needling with electricity, like acupuncture with electricity running thru needles. It is amazing. No side effects, no weight gain but possibly weight moved to stomach area, no problem. 5ft 3in, 125 lbs Lyrica is no miracle but finally found combo of therapy, meds (Lyrica inc) for some quality of life.",

Pain clinics are horrors. Lyrica seems to work with the amount of pain medicine that I take and seems to have even reduced the \"break through\" pain. No unpleasant symptoms yet.",

                    "I started taking Lyrica after seeing an orthopedic surgeon, for widespread pain and tendinitis. After taking 50 mg a day, I had no difference, then up to 75mg a day, I still had pain in my wrists (most likely because I work on a computer). But MIRACULOUSLY!, I noticed that along with 'Some' pain, my social anxiety is all but GONE! It's not even the reason I started taking it! As for my wrist pain, we've bumped up the mg to 175 per day and it's only been two days, I'm very groggy in the morning. I didn't get that on the 75mg, but I am confident it will subside. I feel like a new person because the easing of the social anxiety was a total surprise! I would recommend this medicine to ANYONE with pain/social anxiety.",
                    "The first time I used Lyrica I experienced an amazingly profound reaction; layers of depression and anxiety that had built up over several years melted away within minutes. That was years ago and I have since both weaned myself off the drug and restarted taking it again. One thing I rarely see mentioned is the terrifyingly bad withdrawal effect- missing more than one dose for me throws me into the absolute darkest pits of despair. Has anyone else experienced this? When I went off the drug the first time I felt like I had performed a miracle; so strong was the feeling that it took a long time for me to convince myself that things were bad enough to warrant going back on. It still helps, but nothing as miraculous as the first time.",
                    "I have taken 3 x 75mg, and amazed at how well Lyrica worked for me after only taking 1 pill. I feel like I can get comfortable for the first time in years. I have high hopes that this doesn't wear off and I can continue to feel so good. I feel like a miracle, really has helped my all over body pain that I live with for years.",
                    "I am suffering from burning pain in my body. I was on the Fentanyl patch for 15 years. That gave me complete relief. Because of drug issues in my state, I tapered off of Fentanyl in Feb. I don't think that Lyrica was around before I started the patch. Since the burning pain came back, I was put on Lyrica. It certainly helped and I can live somewhat pain free. Now the doctor has refused to give me a script for Lyrica because he is afraid of repercussions from authorities. I will have to find another doctor. I am dependent on anything that will take this pain away and I hope I can find a doctor who will give me Lyrica again. It is not giving me a good reputation to be constantly changing doctors.",
                    "I have had Fibromyalgia for 4 years now and recently my doctor put me on Lyrica and Cymbalta. The Lyrica is a true lifesaver, it really helps with the pain. But has a lot of side effects. Cons-Feeling like a zombie, shakes, sick at my stomach, itching and blurry eyes, drowsiness. Pros-My pain is almost all gone, happy mood, and can move free with barely any pain. And I feel like I'm on cloud nine and can't wait to go to sleep. Overall, the Lyrica has really helped me a lot. I have tried the generic gabapentin and Savella. They do not work! I'm so happy that I found this website, for all the people whom have aches and pains as well as I. Thank you.",

I put on over 10 lbs in weight when I first started taking it, but with correct food choices , I lost what I had put on and more. I did at first have an increased balance problem. I now take 200mgs of Lyrica 3 times a day because I have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, I take metformin 500mg twice a day and I've got neuropathy pain. I have no side effects with Lyrica now.The other pain meds I am on is a 500mg Fentanyl patch and Arcoxia and Quinine for leg cramps. I live in the UK and get my pain medication free .",

I am very active in trying to keep the fibromyalgia pain as controlled as possible and just not been able to get to a plateau of any type. After a rough adjustment period of about 5 wks I noticed a drastic change in fibro pain. I have gained a significant amount of weight but over the last three months have been able to maintain. Now I am able to start losing the weight but have to be very careful to not take in complex carbohydrates or sugars in afternoon or evening. I have gone to an almost vegetarian style diet and have noticed that the weight just starts to come off with ease but slowly. My balance and vision are the only consistent side effects that I have.",

I just want to thank all doctors that prescribe this medication because it is a life saver.",

I also have had to raise the dose to 150mg 3 x daily. It really helped with the insomnia that I had suffered with for 10 years. If Lyrica did not have the side effect of weight gain, I would stay on it. Would I recommend this drug, yes I would.",

I researched ways to counteract the negative effects, and started taking a B6 supplement (for weight gain) and an herbal diuretic (for the bloat). I no longer feel bloated, and the headaches are gone. I'm on my 4th (or 5th?) week of lyrica, and am feeling much better. I don't think I'm still gaining weight, but it's too soon to tell. I wasn't eating any more or less than usual, so if the B6 helps, that would be nice.",

                    "I started Lyrica for chronic pain, but realized it was SO great for anxiety - worries disappeared, ruminating thoughts just didn't matter anymore, it was like my troubles were over because none of them mattered anymore (things I should have cared about tho, too). I had been taking 2mg valium everyday for 4 years and was able to taper VERY quickly because of lyrica. Pregabalin helps as a precursor to anxiety; it stops it before it can start, hence the 'PRE'-gabalin. It works on the gaba receptors which are responsible for anxiety. I take 150mg every 8 hours like another reviewer talked about, as I discovered that this was the golden ticket for keeping anxiety away. In Europe, the suggested dose for anxiety is between 400mg-MAX 600mg.",

It began each morning with a small 'knot' in my stomach and then spread during the day causing tightness if chest, throat and often tension down my arms. It was stupid because there seemed to be no trigger, I just felt tension and worry all day. I was placed on a number of drugs, nothing worked. Busiprone helped but I remained anxious for no valid reason. About 18 months ago my doctor gave me Lyrica to try. Within a couple of days everything returned to normal I was even a bit euphoric but that subsided in a week or so. I started out taking Lyrica 50mg twice a day along with 20mg Busiprone twice a day.

Now we are working our way up to doing the same thing for the second dose in the morning. I must admit I am glad she is doing it this way. The first weekend after I started taking it was the first weekend I actually wanted to do something, like move when I did not have to. I've adjusted slowly to the drowsiness and confusion to where it is not nearly as bad as when I first started taking it. There has been weight gain but I am slowly getting to the point of wanting to get back into that gym. Thank you Lyrica.",

I weened down and stopped taking it a week ago and have already lost 10 lbs and the edema in my legs is gone.

I have found that as my anxiety is worry,overthinking and my mind constantly racing. It has slowed down my rate of thinking and worrying, whilst I am aware they are there I find I am able to process them easier and thoughts become less irrational. Coupled with some CBT therapy I find this medication highly effective. The only thing to be wary of is on higher doses (I'm on 75mg) they can have a drunk feeling effect and so I asked my Dr to prescribe me with a lower dosage for daytime (incase of driving or working etc) so I take 25mg in the day and the 75mg at night and find this works for me.",

Lyrica caused severe swelling in my feet,ankles and legs. It's very uncomfortable. I also experienced loss of balance, dizziness, blurred vision and ulcer sores on my tongue and in my mouth. I felt far better before taking this medicine. Needless to say I'm no longer taking it.",
                    "I've been using Lyrica now for almost 3 years with great success and until this week I was able to get it with no problem using my insurance, Some POS doctor working for Express Script denied coverage. He got overruled by a doctor with a brain, but doctor Weisman seems to think Lyrica does't work for the treatment of peripheral neuropathy his reasoning was because the doctor didn't put diabetic in front of peripheral neuropathy. Lyrica won't work the thing this doctors doesn't understand is that the Lyrica is treating only the peripheral neuropathy the diabetic part mean nothing except that the peripheral neuropathy is being cause by the diabetes. If this Doctor had taken just say five minutes and read a little bit more of the notes!",
                    "I just started .75 mg. Lyrica two nights ago. Helped me sleep and not annoyed by RLS or diabetic nerve annoyance (not pain). Also, have had issues with back pain and it seems to be helping after such a short time.",
                    "Lyrica really helps but the cost is almost getting to be too much. ",
                    "Works great but goes out for me quickly. Always feel like dose should be raised but can't due to swelling and weight gain.",
                    "It was a nightmare.I had the worse side effects that medicine had to offer. Its been a month and I am still swollen and been to the worthless ER in Grants Pass, Oregon which is Asante Three Rivers Hospital where they after 5 1/2 hours diagnoised me with shortness of breath.No treatment for the convulsion the swelling from head to toe, confusion,and the list went on.I was first turned away from Asante Urgent Care saying they do not treat patients with side effects from Medications.",
                    "I LOVE this medicine, I was having real bad anxiety and panic attacks,I didn't want a \"benzo\" so my doc prescribed me Pregabalin & it is great. I also have epilepsy so it helps with that. Give it time to work, about a week and work your way up if needed, hopefully it'll be your godsend like it is mine.",
                    "Can't live without this! Lyrica is amazing. Had one doctor add in gabapentin to my cocktail and it helped some, so he put me solely on gabapentin and off the lyrica. It didn't take long before my pain levels started to spike. Now I am back on Lyrica 100mg 2xday and I am so much better!",

I have also had my 3rd steroid injection and if anything- my pain is worse. I am so tired and desperate for relief. I feel like I have no quality of life.",
                    "I have been on Lyrica for GAD for almost two years. It works! Maybe not 100% of the time but it is by far the most effective drug I have taken. I began with 50mg twice a day and had to increase to 100mg twice a day and have been on that regimen for 9 months. Occasionally I need to up my dosage for a day or two. Usually I take an extra 100mg at night. I am have been fearful that I would need to keep upping the dosage but that hasn't been the case.",
                    "I've only taken this for three days and already I feel so much calmer. I have struggled with anxiety for a long time and am on many antidepressants. What a relief! I would recommend this to anyone with anxiety.",

                    "I have been on pregabalin for 5 months. It has been amazing with regard to eliminating the crippling anxiety, but I still have problems at night. Cannot get to sleep because of crowded thoughts, keep waking during the night in nightmare scenarios, and wake very early with mind in a turmoil again. Does anyone else suffer this way? Am wondering whether to increase from 75mgx2 a day.",
                    "Taking Lyrica for spinal cord injury. Started with 75 mg daily. Seem to stop the severe burning in my feet but I have memory problems with blurred vision. Dr. has upped the meds to 150 mg 2X daily not sure how I'm going to react to that.  I'll report back in a week or two if I have a brain left",
                    "I've been taking Lyrica for about 4 years now and because of the cost, I end up in the \"donut hole\" lately and the cost is almost $200 and that's with my insurance! While it works pretty well I have been forced to cut down to 2, 150mg pills a day to save up enough for at least one month. I'm a senior and $200 the last 3 months of the year is a budget breaker!",

                    "I've been taking Biotin off and on for a few years and have noticed that certain brands seem to cause more headaches ...and for someone who never really gets headaches the ones I got after taking it were just unbearable... stopped taking it and no more headaches so my suggestion is to stick with a well respected brand and if you can, just buy a small bottle first to see if you have a reaction... on the plus side I did see an improvement in my skin.. oh, and maybe it's just me but I also noticed if I took it at night I had the most bizarre dreams ",
                    "I am 54 years old and have not had acne since I was a teenager. After only 2 days of taking 5000mg, my nose broke out in large red rosacea type pimples. I stopped the vitamin and did not get any more pimples.",
                    "I take this for my Chronic Fatigue Syndrome / Myalgic Encephalomyelitis .I heard that people with MS are in a study using 300-600 MG(!) not mcg, of Biotin. I tried taking 5MG which is the highest available in a pill. I got a nasty headache, but it seems like it was a one-off because I haven't had it repeated. I know it was the biotin though, because I didn't read enough. Apparently it can dehydrate you, so you have to drink a lot more water than you normally would.  However, the very next day, I was \"sick\" in the flulike way that people with CFS/ME do. And the day after that I had tons more energy than before. I think it may have helped my immune system to wake up and fight the (much denied) virus that causes this disease. But I wouldn't have to guess if the CDC, NIH & FDA would fund ME/CFS research.",
                    "I have been taking biotin for about three years to improve my nails and hair. I can tell a great difference in the strengh of my nails. They no longer peel like onion skin but are very strong and healthy. There isn't much of a change in my hair.",
                    "PEOPLE YOU HAVE TO DRINK TONS OF WATER WITH THIS VITAMIN OR ELSE. Biotin will give you acne. It will cause severe headaches. It will make you nauseous, and you will complain it doesn't work and give up. THIS IS WHY PEOPLE DON'T GET RESULTS. In reality your doing it wrong if your not getting enough water! It has worked wonders for me. I have lost hair due to medications and stress. I started noticing results in two weeks (eyelashes). Two months (scalp). And you will get hair growth everywhere. My hair has never looked more healthier.",
                    "I have taken lecithin for over 20 yrs. For me it has reduced excess body fat. I have dieted with and without it. With it I lost more inches, weigh 100lbs. and size 2. It does take excess body fat away if you are really trying to loose weight.",
                    "I was skeptical of all I had read about the benefits of Lecithin for male health. I am a believer now after about 4 months of taking with little changes to diet and exercise other than a bit more water intake. I have noticed a significant change in my metabolism and seem to actually be losing belly fat! I am not overweight or fat but have certainly lost the tone I had in my younger days. I had also read that this supplement can increase the stimulation of male climax and increase the amount of fluid during ejaculation. Let me just say that my orgasms are incredible. The orgasm lasts longer and is much more intense. ",
                    "My triglycerides have been very high, had the number down to 257 and someone mentioned lecithin. After two months 1200mg capsule twice a day the number is 163, lowest it's been in 20 years. I'm sure it will be lower next blood test. Will know in about 2 weeks.",

It takes a few weeks to months to work but it made all my other skills from touch to twitch insanely better, I play the piano better then Beethoven and Mozart.

I had to use estrogen medicine also because my uterine lining was too thin. Then my doctor had me use HCG shot to stimulate ovulation since Clomid can apparently mess up if/when ovulation occurs. I took the HCG shot over 2 weeks ago. I noticed some weird symptoms a few days ago and I just took multiple pregnancy tests. And I'm pregnant! So Clomid worked great for me so far. Yay!",

We have a 8 and 5 yr old already all done the natural way.. So we were stuck to why we couldn't this time round so off we go to the docs and they give me clomid to try. Before we started I got pregnant Dec 2013 which was amazing feeling. In may 2014 my baby girl came into the world at 26wks and passed away two days later.. My periods have been all over the place since so have been given tablets again. I think I'm ready and my brain is saying it's now or never...by reading all ur stories it works.... If anything were to happen I couldn't cope again... We so want a baby.",

I had no side effects with Clomid. All 3 are perfectly healthy. Did I mention the twins are 28 now? Yes. For everyone who is taking or thinking of taking the medicine knowing that there are 28 year old perfectly healthy Clomid babies might make you feel more at ease! I know it would have been a relief for me to have heard some positive news 28 years ago while pregnant!",

Even though she warned me it could make me mean, I wasn't. I didn't know if it was working for that fact alone. Did the deed many times during the ovulation period. Came up pregnant on my first dose. Everyone is different, but this was the push I needed to make a mini.",

Well Harrison and Harmony were born January 1st of this year and I found out 2 months ago I'm pregnant again, WITH FRATERNAL TWINS AGAIN, and this pregnancy was all a OOPS! But I believe that Clomid is a miracle. It worked for me and I hope that all the ladies who are/will be taking Clomid that it works just as good for them as well. I had no side effects from it at all. I felt just like I always have, nothing changed.",

Last year I was rushed into emergency surgery because I had cancerous cysts on my right ovary and cysts that had burst. After the procedure was done my doctor told me that my left ovary didn't work. It wasn't producing anything. So, he told me that that cancerous cysts were probably the cause of why we hadn't gotten pregnant yet and if in a year we still weren't pregnant to come back in. Well, one year went by and nothing. So, he prescribed me clomid and told me to take it day 1 of my period for 5 days. I am currently on day 4/5 and have had no serious side affects besides a minor headache that goes away with tylenol. I am so excited to see if this works!",

I have Polycystic ovarian syndrome and it was determined that I was having anovulatory cycles. 50mg for 5 days. Paired with Estradiol and Progesterone suppositories. The only side effects I noticed were hot flashes, but Estradiol is known to cause those so I am not sure that it was the Clomid. Any side effects would have been tolerable to conceive our child. This drug is seriously a miracle worker.",

Our first pregnancy was planned and conceived first week of trying. This time has been much harder and very trying. My specialist recommended either clomid or straight to IVF. I have been taking clomid for 3 months, first month 50mg did nothing and second month took 100mg and ovulated but did not conceive. I definitely know when I ovulated whilst taking clomid it was very obvious. Just finished round 3 100mg. Also had side effects on clomid such as hot flushes, mood swings and dizziness. Very emotional this time round. Fingers crossed.",

I'd have to wear sunglasses most of the day with a constant ache starting on about day 4 of 10. Still, it was worth it to try to have a baby. I didn't get very many rounds though. Due to an unexpected life circumstance, we had to stop trying. I'd like to give it another shot though when life settles back down. I felt that it may have been helping. Oh and it revved up my already-high libido by ten times.",

I bought a clear blue ovulation kit and started tracking when I ovulated. The digital test is the BEST. It told me my most fertile day (day 16) and hubby and I were at it like rabbits. Around day 29 of my clycle I started having period like symptoms and thought my period was about to start. A few days later, when I had NOT started bleeding, I thought it would be best to take a pregnancy test. 7 positive pregnancy test later, and I guess you can say I am pregnant.",
                    "Well, I was actually being treated for secondary hypogonadism. Clomid worked like a charm. The first 4 days I could seriously feel my testicals growing and it felt like pressure, which sort of caused me to feel aroused all day...strange but sort of pleasant. I also felt happy and young again, like I did when I was younger.. super positive...just all around great. Then after around 5 days, the super positive effect wore off, not a bad deal, just sort of a bummer, then I started to get lightheaded sort of having balance issues. Not so bad I couldn't drive or anything, but uncomfortable for sure. So I called my doc (endocrinologist) and he said it would be okay if I reduced my dose from 25mg/day to 12.5 mg/day (quarter tab). Just got worse.",

Finally saw a hormonal heath man and he said since I was under 60 years old he didn't want to put me on testosterone patch since he tested me an I had whatever enzyme level said clomid would work. After couple months I hit 758 with serume T level much better as well. Clomid saved my life and job. I don't notice any side effects I could contribute to it. I wish I could motivate my self to workout to take even m ore advantage. I have been on it around 5 years. 6mo on, 1 off. blood tested every 6mo. I read they are starting to approve drugs specifically for men - enclomiphene",

Unfortunately, just after my second dose (25mg) I woke up at night with numbness and tingling spreading over my whole left body side, with light tingling and muscle fasciculations continuing for over a week after disconinuing the medication. This is supposedly a very rare, but known, side effect of clomiphene, and was repeatable after trying it again after a few weeks. It also seemed to cause anxiety and even minor suicidal thoughts. On the plus side, it did probably increase my physical energy levels.",

No luck then February 2017 my doctor prescribed me Clomid. I bought the off brand and it was only $9 . I took it every month and checked my ovulation. Then Iovulated every month around the same time. I became impatient around April and took the clomid but also took premama fertility drink , used fertility lubricant and we did every position known to man lol while ovulating. So I don't know what worked in April maybe all things together worked. But May 26, 2017 I found out that I am 5 weeks and 1 day pregnant!! We were so happy and scared. But it is now June 25th 2017 and I am 9 weeks!",

I went to the ER for severe chest pain and all tests were negative. After researching I realize it's bad indigestion. I also have Fibro and am used to back pain but Clomid gave me the worst back pain I've ever felt along with nausea and migraines. I have to lay down or walk hunched over so relieve some pain. I've also been extremely fatigued.I had to nap 3 times a day for a few hours and still feel exhausted. My uterus feels so sore and heavy. I'm on cycle day 15 and still showing a flashing (OPK) Ovulation Predictor Kit. Hopefully tomorrow is peak day so I can get pregnant already!",
                    "I had my 1st round last month on 18-22 july 5-9 day and had high hopes but when I got my period on 11-Aug I got angry to everyone and went mad. But not loosing hope because I'm on my second round 50g",
                    "After taking this medication for three months I then became pregnant a month later. After my Right tube exploded @ (11 WEEKS) (ectopic pregnancy) and I had two blood transfusions. We are ready to try again. Hoping for better luck this next time with one tube left. PRAYING",
                    "I find out I wasn't ovulating at 24 years old,it was very hard for me and never thought at this young age I will have issues getting pregnant. I had an issue with my period too so my GYN prescribed clomid 50mg to take on day 4 of my period for 4 days. I took Provera to induce a period before taking the clomid. I looked up reviews on the medication and it was a success for others and not a success for some women. My period came on Thanksgiving November 24th I started taking the clomid on November 28th and did ovulation checking from day 12 day of my period. At day 28 nothing happened but my doctor encouraged me to keep tracking my ovulation and come see her at day 35 if I don't get my period. Find out I am pregnant on December 27. Wow",
                    "I have been trying so hard to have a baby im talking YEARS! I recently went to the Obgyn to talk to the Dr about my infertility. I have never had kids before because its all ways been so hard to conceive due to the fact that I am irregular on my periods.... so the Dr prescribed clomid to me and the first try i got pregnant... i am now 4 weeks pregnant with my first baby and i honestly still can't believe it. I took 6 pregnancy even blood work and all positive. I strongly recommend this pill it is A MIRACLE!!",
                    "Well I tried the drug and it was not for me. I tried it for 2 months and there was no results. I have the same results from when I was trying on my own after 10 year so it does not even matter or make any difference. Whoever is trying this medicine, Good luck.",
                    "Took Clomid in early 1980's due to PCO. Gave birth to a beautiful baby girl. Three years later (without clomid) a baby boy. To this day, I'm still so thankful for the drug. Don't give up, your wonderful life is waiting to happen!",
                    "I had severe bronchitis while traveling in the south of France this summer and had an excellent experience with the French socialized health system. A local doctor in a small village in Provence prescribed Exomuc (an orange flavored granular form of Acetylcysteine made to be taken orally when dissolved in a small glass of water). My cough was gone within 48 hours! Why is this not a commonly prescribed drug in the US? I normally take steroids, decongestants and cough formulas for 1-2 weeks in the U.S.!",
                    "Personally, taking 600mg. orally bid (or tid if symptomatic) for allergic bronchitis has reduced overall severity of seasonal exacerbations.  Have recommended it to others with chronic sinus or respiratory conditions where it's indicated, and most of the time, reports are very favorable.  A safe older drug that is largely neglected in the U.S.  Recent trial in China showed decreased hospitalizations in persons with COPD who are maintained on N-acetylcysteine.",
                    "When I came down with pneumonia while living in Israel, acetylcysteine (brand name Siran) made all of the difference. The medicine came as effervescent tablets with a lemon flavoring taken with water four times a day. Within 48 hours I could feel a world of difference as I started to purge all of the fluid and congestion from my lungs. Siran is one of the most effective medicines for expectoration I have ever used.",
                    "Got over the counter for severe respiratory congestion while traveling in Bruges, Belgium in 2012. Extremely and quickly effective. Will obtain additional supply in March 2015 when returning to Belgium. No adverse effects.",
                    "I started using acetylcysteine last May. For the first time in 20 years my lungs were clear. My bronchitis disappeared. My FEV1 increased 25 per cent. My sinus condition cleared up and the headaches were gone. I do not understand why this medicine is not used routinely for COPD and other respiratory ailments.",
                    "It helped my asthma a lot, diminishing the cough quite a lot. I didn't get any bronchospasm from it despite the warnings, however some itching appeared but soon went away. Before my asthma was under control it also helped a lot by making the mucus much easier to cough up. It works very well every single day (if a stop taking it the coughing soon enough increases).",
                    "I had severe bronchitis from a sinus infection while traveling. It was causing me severe pulmonary distress. I was taking my rescue inhaler every 2 hours. The doctor in Hungary prescribed acetylcysteine, to help clear the lungs. My lungs cleared in days. What a difference! The only side effect I had was dripping from my nose. It liquified the mucus there too.  Usually back home in the US they prescribe steroids (prednisone) and albuterol nebulizer treatments for weeks while the coughing clears. No more for me.",
                    "It was really early in the morning, and I went to take Tylenol, when I misread the directions. I meant to measure out two tablespoons of the drug, but accidentally used my measuring cup instead. I ended up chugging two cups of Tylenol instead! I was rushed to the hospital and given Mucomyst-10 to offset the effects. Mucomyst-10 saved my life. Thank you Mucomyst-10!",
                    "I have chronic bronchitis and the beginnings of emphysema and am a smoker. I'm also prone to ulcers. Since I started taking NAC, I breathe easier and my bronchitis seems to be less \"phlemmy\". I've had no ulcer attacks. I've been taking it for a bit more than a year. "

                    "//What is it?//Several steps are necessary for pregnancy to occur: the formation and release of an egg from the ovaries; its arrival through the fallopian tubes to the uterus; its union with the male sperm; and the attachment of the fertilized egg to the wall of the uterus (implantation). If problems occur in any of these steps, infertility may occur. Infertility is not exclusively a female problem. As a rule, one third of the causes are female, another third are male and the remaining cases result from a combination of problems in both partners.//Symptoms//Although the World Health Organization defines infertility as \u201cthe absence of pregnancy after two years of regular sexual intercourse and without the use of contraception\u201d, it is considered a case of infertility when a pregnancy is not achieved after one year of trying. For women over the age of 35, this limit is six months. Infertility is also referred to as women who, although they are able to get pregnant, are unable to carry the pregnancy to term.//Causes//In about 10% of cases, the cause of infertility cannot be identified. However, there are numerous causes of infertility, both male and female. Male: Varicocele (dilation of the veins in the testicles, increasing the temperature, which affects the number and shape of sperm); changes in the ability of sperm to move; torsion or trauma to the testicle; consumption of alcohol, drugs or tobacco reduces the number of healthy sperm; kidney disease, hormonal changes, mumps, contact with pesticides, medications, exposure to radiation or chemotherapy. All of these factors can affect sperm production, and age itself is associated with a reduction in the number and quality of these cells. Heat is important because it interferes with sperm production. Therefore, professions such as cooks or drivers present a greater risk.;/  Females: most cases result from ovulation problems. One of the signs of changes in ovulation is the occurrence of irregular periods. One of the most common causes is polycystic ovary syndrome, which causes a hormonal imbalance that interferes with ovulation. Another common cause is primary ovarian insufficiency, which occurs when the ovaries stop functioning normally before the age of 40. There are other possible causes: pelvic inflammatory disease, endometriosis, surgery, fibroids, uterine polyps, thyroid disease, history of voluntary termination of pregnancy or repeated miscarriages. As for men, age, smoking, alcohol consumption and stress are factors to consider. Poor nutrition, excessive physical activity, sexually transmitted diseases, and being overweight or underweight also interfere with fertility. Age is important because as age increases, the ovaries become less capable of releasing eggs, their number is smaller, they are not as healthy and the risk of other health problems increases.;///Diagnosis//In the initial assessment, it is important to know the couple's sexual habits and recommendations can be made that prove relevant. Diagnosis tends to be time-consuming and expensive and, as noted, even with all testing and counseling, it cannot be guaranteed that pregnancy will occur. The causes of infertility are multiple and may or may not be associated with anomalies in the male or female reproductive system. Therefore, diagnosis must be carried out in stages and include both partners simultaneously. In addition to medical observation, laboratory tests, genetic and hormonal studies and some imaging methods, such as ultrasound or hysterosalpingography, are necessary. In the case of men, one of the most important tests is the spermogram. For women, one of the important steps is to understand whether ovulation occurs every month.//Treatment//Treatment depends on the cause and may involve medication, surgery, artificial insemination or assisted reproduction. It may be necessary to combine different techniques in the same case. In general, the drugs used are hormonal in nature and seek to improve the ovulation process.  Dealing with infertility can be difficult, as there is no way of knowing when the problem will be resolved. As such, the emotional burden associated with it is considerable. It is therefore important for couples to define their own limits. Diagnostic methods and treatments are expensive and do not always achieve the desired results. All alternatives that can reduce the anxiety that infertility tends to bring should be considered. This can be minimised by enlisting the support of healthcare professionals, friends and family and using relaxation techniques, if necessary.//Prevention//Many of the male forms are not preventable. However, not smoking, not consuming excessive alcohol, and avoiding high temperatures are some measures to consider. For women, some measures are essential to prevent infertility: Practicing safe sex is one of the most important measures to avoid sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis and HPV (human papillomavirus). These infections can cause pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility and serious systemic diseases.;/ Avoid environmental toxins.;/ Avoid high levels of mercury in foods such as swordfish and mackerel. Avoid benzene (found in detergents, dyes, rubbers, lubricants, hair products, and paint) because it is an endocrine disruptor that can contribute to infertility. Benzene has been shown to interrupt women's periods and decrease sperm counts in men.;/ Quit smoking: Almost all studies on smoking and fertility show a serious impact, including secondhand smoke.;/ Avoid alcohol and drug use.;/ Reduce caffeine intake.;/ Pay attention to the use of medications.;/ Maintain a weight within normal values;/ Portuguese Infertility Association Attain Fertility Division of Reproductive Health, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion,12 de Fevereiro de 2013 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research Reproductive Health, Infertility, Directorate-General for Health, National Reproductive Health Program, Lisbon 2008 Sexual and reproductive health, World Health Organization Load more;/ Endometriosis has a major impact on a woman's life and diagnosis is often delayed.

                    "I took Clomid for the first time last month. My husband and I tried for a year. I have a blocked Fallopian tube. I had to use estrogen medicine also because my uterine lining was too thin. Then my doctor had me use HCG shot to stimulate ovulation since Clomid can apparently mess up if/when ovulation occurs. I took the HCG shot over 2 weeks ago. I noticed some weird symptoms a few days ago and I just took multiple pregnancy tests. And I'm pregnant! So Clomid worked great for me so far. Yay!",
                    "Am new to taking this drug...am very nervous about it and keep staring at the packet.. My husband and I had been trying for 4yrs to get pregnant and nothing g seemed to work. We have a 8 and 5 yr old already all done the natural way.. So we were stuck to why we couldn't this time round so off we go to the docs and they give me clomid to try. Before we started I got pregnant Dec 2013 which was amazing feeling. In may 2014 my baby girl came into the world at 26wks and passed away two days later.. My periods have been all over the place since so have been given tablets again. I think I'm ready and my brain is saying it's now or never...by reading all ur stories it works.... If anything were to happen I couldn't cope again... We so want a baby.",

                    "I was diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome. Took Clomid, Pregnant first month with TWINS! 3 months later, pregnant again (single birth) all on my own...no more Clomid. I had no side effects with Clomid. All 3 are perfectly healthy. Did I mention the twins are 28 now? Yes. For everyone who is taking or thinking of taking the medicine knowing that there are 28 year old perfectly healthy Clomid babies might make you feel more at ease! I know it would have been a relief for me to have heard some positive news 28 years ago while pregnant!",
                    "Took clomid on days 3-7. I am 38, with pcos and have a large reserve of eggs as I am not ovulating. Am pregnant after first cycle. Happy, but scared to death at the same time!",
                    "After over a year of trying to conceive, but being unsuccessful due to pcos, my obgyn prescribed clomid to me. I had no side effects whatsoever. Even though she warned me it could make me mean, I wasn't. I didn't know if it was working for that fact alone. Did the deed many times during the ovulation period. Came up pregnant on my first dose. Everyone is different, but this was the push I needed to make a mini.",
                    "Me and my husband have been trying to have a child together for a few years now and no success almost a year ago I found out that I have pcos and irregular periods so I am on clomid 50mg along with metformin 500mg my. And iron tabs because or low iron opgyn told me to take the clomid on days 3-7 I'm on day four of my cycle and day 2/7 on clomid sense I been taking it I have been experiencing bloating and bad cramps I'm on my period 4/5 and I feel like its from the clomid so maybe that means its doing its job my obgyn told me to have intercourse on day 12,14,16 and sooner then that if I wanted so I really hopes this works for us I'm hearing nothing but positive things about the medication and excited to find out",
                    "My husband and I had been trying for 1 year when I went to the doc and found out I had polycystic ovarian syndrome and he immediately put me on 50mg of Clomid from Day 3-7 and shortly after that discovered we were having twins. Well Harrison and Harmony were born January 1st of this year and I found out 2 months ago I'm pregnant again, WITH FRATERNAL TWINS AGAIN, and this pregnancy was all a OOPS! But I believe that Clomid is a miracle. It worked for me and I hope that all the ladies who are/will be taking Clomid that it works just as good for them as well. I had no side effects from it at all. I felt just like I always have, nothing changed.",
                    "My fiance and I have been trying to conceive for four years. We are both 26 years old. Last year I was rushed into emergency surgery because I had cancerous cysts on my right ovary and cysts that had burst. After the procedure was done my doctor told me that my left ovary didn't work. It wasn't producing anything. So, he told me that that cancerous cysts were probably the cause of why we hadn't gotten pregnant yet and if in a year we still weren't pregnant to come back in. Well, one year went by and nothing. So, he prescribed me clomid and told me to take it day 1 of my period for 5 days. I am currently on day 4/5 and have had no serious side affects besides a minor headache that goes away with tylenol. I am so excited to see if this works!",

I have Polycystic ovarian syndrome and it was determined that I was having anovulatory cycles. 50mg for 5 days. Paired with Estradiol and Progesterone suppositories. The only side effects I noticed were hot flashes, but Estradiol is known to cause those so I am not sure that it was the Clomid. Any side effects would have been tolerable to conceive our child. This drug is seriously a miracle worker.",
                    "Hi, well I was on clomid for 5 month, I just find out I am pregnant ... It worked for me , we are just waiting for our app next Wednesday , two years ago I had a miscarriage ",
                    "I hard a hard time getting pregnant the first time.4 years. I heard a bout clomid from a friend & i asked my doctor. Then I got pregnant. Using clomid. It did make me vomit but was worth it.  My insurance didn't cover clomid",
                    "After reading all positive reviews I was extremely hopeful but after 3 rounds still nothing..",
                    "Had no luck with Clomid been on it now for over a year and no success we have no problems and even did an Intrauterine insemination (IUI) and no success told doctor this Isn't working been on a 100 mg but they don't care its just bern very unsuccessful",
                    "My husband and I have been trying to conceive number 2 for 9 months. I have PCOS and was not ovulating on my own. My husbands tests also showed a low sperm count. Our first pregnancy was planned and conceived first week of trying. This time has been much harder and very trying. My specialist recommended either clomid or straight to IVF. I have been taking clomid for 3 months, first month 50mg did nothing and second month took 100mg and ovulated but did not conceive. I definitely know when I ovulated whilst taking clomid it was very obvious. Just finished round 3 100mg. Also had side effects on clomid such as hot flushes, mood swings and dizziness. Very emotional this time round. Fingers crossed.",
                    "Tried this in order to start a family. I had some pretty awful eye problems while taking it. I'd have to wear sunglasses most of the day with a constant ache starting on about day 4 of 10. Still, it was worth it to try to have a baby. I didn't get very many rounds though. Due to an unexpected life circumstance, we had to stop trying. I'd like to give it another shot though when life settles back down. I felt that it may have been helping. Oh and it revved up my already-high libido by ten times.",
                    "The first round worked for me and I am still in shock. My OBGYN prescribed 50mg for days 5-9 of my cycle. I bought a clear blue ovulation kit and started tracking when I ovulated. The digital test is the BEST. It told me my most fertile day (day 16) and hubby and I were at it like rabbits. Around day 29 of my clycle I started having period like symptoms and thought my period was about to start. A few days later, when I had NOT started bleeding, I thought it would be best to take a pregnancy test. 7 positive pregnancy test later, and I guess you can say I am pregnant.",
                    "Well, I was actually being treated for secondary hypogonadism. Clomid worked like a charm. The first 4 days I could seriously feel my testicals growing and it felt like pressure, which sort of caused me to feel aroused all day...strange but sort of pleasant. I also felt happy and young again, like I did when I was younger.. super positive...just all around great. Then after around 5 days, the super positive effect wore off, not a bad deal, just sort of a bummer, then I started to get lightheaded sort of having balance issues. Not so bad I couldn't drive or anything, but uncomfortable for sure. So I called my doc (endocrinologist) and he said it would be okay if I reduced my dose from 25mg/day to 12.5 mg/day (quarter tab). Just got worse.",
                    "Im on my 3 week of clomid i ovulated the 2 and 3 week and nothing no baby yet",
                    "I was put on Clomid for cycle days 5-9 not sure when I ovulated, now I'm 5 weeks pregnant after 1st round! This is my 2nd child my first was natural.",
                    "I had low T (305). Thought I was dying... Slow thinking, hard to recall 4 digits let alone the whole phone number. Almost lost my job it got so bad. Finally saw a hormonal heath man and he said since I was under 60 years old he didn't want to put me on testosterone patch since he tested me an I had whatever enzyme level said clomid would work. After couple months I hit 758 with serume T level much better as well. Clomid saved my life and job. I don't notice any side effects I could contribute to it. I wish I could motivate my self to workout to take even m ore advantage. I have been on it around 5 years. 6mo on, 1 off. blood tested every 6mo. I read they are starting to approve drugs specifically for men - enclomiphene",
                    "My hubby and I have been TTC for over a year, with no results. I finished my first round of clomid just over a week ago. I definitely ovulated a few days ago. As of yesterday, I have really sore breasts and I'm so tired. While taking the pills I didn't have any side effects at all! I really hope I get my BFP next week! Will post again soon with an update. Good luck and baby dust!",

We have been on Clomid for over a year. I conceived but miscarried conjoined twins at 11 weeks. My doctor says we can try again in 3 months so back on the Clomid I go.",

I bought Clomid at an online pharmacy after seeing a fertility specialist. I wasn't ovulating on my own. Clomid 100 mg first cycle I ovulated but not pregnant, second cycle got pregnant miscarried at 8 weeks, skipped a month, 3rd cycle got Big fat positive test (BFP) so pregnant with Dear Daughter (DD) happy healthy 10 month old now.

                    "I tried Clomiphene to increase my low testosterone without negatively affecting sperm quality. Unfortunately, just after my second dose (25mg) I woke up at night with numbness and tingling spreading over my whole left body side, with light tingling and muscle fasciculations continuing for over a week after disconinuing the medication. This is supposedly a very rare, but known, side effect of clomiphene, and was repeatable after trying it again after a few weeks. It also seemed to cause anxiety and even minor suicidal thoughts. On the plus side, it did probably increase my physical energy levels.",

No luck then February 2017 my doctor prescribed me Clomid. I bought the off brand and it was only $9 . I took it every month and checked my ovulation. Then Iovulated every month around the same time. I became impatient around April and took the clomid but also took premama fertility drink , used fertility lubricant and we did every position known to man lol while ovulating. So I don't know what worked in April maybe all things together worked. But May 26, 2017 I found out that I am 5 weeks and 1 day pregnant!! We were so happy and scared. But it is now June 25th 2017 and I am 9 weeks!",
                    "I took 2 months of the medication and conceived during the second month. I was ecstatic! This was my first pregnancy. The pregnancy was a breeze the birth was awesome! I have a beautiful baby girl! Planning my next pregnancy for Fall 2016. I can only hope and pray I have the same experience! Very very pleased!",
                    "I took Clomid for the first time days 5-9 and the side effects are the worst! I already have heart problems so I thought that's what was going on. I went to the ER for severe chest pain and all tests were negative. After researching I realize it's bad indigestion. I also have Fibro and am used to back pain but Clomid gave me the worst back pain I've ever felt along with nausea and migraines. I have to lay down or walk hunched over so relieve some pain. I've also been extremely fatigued.I had to nap 3 times a day for a few hours and still feel exhausted. My uterus feels so sore and heavy. I'm on cycle day 15 and still showing a flashing (OPK) Ovulation Predictor Kit. Hopefully tomorrow is peak day so I can get pregnant already!",
                    "I had my 1st round last month on 18-22 july 5-9 day and had high hopes but when I got my period on 11-Aug I got angry to everyone and went mad. But not loosing hope because I'm on my second round 50g",
                    "After taking this medication for three months I then became pregnant a month later. After my Right tube exploded @ (11 WEEKS) (ectopic pregnancy) and I had two blood transfusions. We are ready to try again. Hoping for better luck this next time with one tube left. PRAYING",
                    "I find out I wasn't ovulating at 24 years old,it was very hard for me and never thought at this young age I will have issues getting pregnant. I had an issue with my period too so my GYN prescribed clomid 50mg to take on day 4 of my period for 4 days. I took Provera to induce a period before taking the clomid. I looked up reviews on the medication and it was a success for others and not a success for some women. My period came on Thanksgiving November 24th I started taking the clomid on November 28th and did ovulation checking from day 12 day of my period. At day 28 nothing happened but my doctor encouraged me to keep tracking my ovulation and come see her at day 35 if I don't get my period. Find out I am pregnant on December 27. Wow",
                    "I have been trying so hard to have a baby im talking YEARS! I recently went to the Obgyn to talk to the Dr about my infertility. I have never had kids before because its all ways been so hard to conceive due to the fact that I am irregular on my periods.... so the Dr prescribed clomid to me and the first try i got pregnant... i am now 4 weeks pregnant with my first baby and i honestly still can't believe it. I took 6 pregnancy even blood work and all positive. I strongly recommend this pill it is A MIRACLE!!",
                    "Well I tried the drug and it was not for me. I tried it for 2 months and there was no results. I have the same results from when I was trying on my own after 10 year so it does not even matter or make any difference. Whoever is trying this medicine, Good luck.",
                    "Took Clomid in early 1980's due to PCO. Gave birth to a beautiful baby girl. Three years later (without clomid) a baby boy. To this day, I'm still so thankful for the drug. Don't give up, your wonderful life is waiting to happen!",
                    "I had severe bronchitis while traveling in the south of France this summer and had an excellent experience with the French socialized health system. A local doctor in a small village in Provence prescribed Exomuc (an orange flavored granular form of Acetylcysteine made to be taken orally when dissolved in a small glass of water). My cough was gone within 48 hours! Why is this not a commonly prescribed drug in the US? I normally take steroids, decongestants and cough formulas for 1-2 weeks in the U.S.!",
                    "Personally, taking 600mg. orally bid (or tid if symptomatic) for allergic bronchitis has reduced overall severity of seasonal exacerbations.  Have recommended it to others with chronic sinus or respiratory conditions where it's indicated, and most of the time, reports are very favorable.  A safe older drug that is largely neglected in the U.S.  Recent trial in China showed decreased hospitalizations in persons with COPD who are maintained on N-acetylcysteine.",
                    "When I came down with pneumonia while living in Israel, acetylcysteine (brand name Siran) made all of the difference. The medicine came as effervescent tablets with a lemon flavoring taken with water four times a day. Within 48 hours I could feel a world of difference as I started to purge all of the fluid and congestion from my lungs. Siran is one of the most effective medicines for expectoration I have ever used.",
                    "Got over the counter for severe respiratory congestion while traveling in Bruges, Belgium in 2012. Extremely and quickly effective. Will obtain additional supply in March 2015 when returning to Belgium. No adverse effects.",
                    "I started using acetylcysteine last May. For the first time in 20 years my lungs were clear. My bronchitis disappeared. My FEV1 increased 25 per cent. My sinus condition cleared up and the headaches were gone. I do not understand why this medicine is not used routinely for COPD and other respiratory ailments.",
                    "It helped my asthma a lot, diminishing the cough quite a lot. I didn't get any bronchospasm from it despite the warnings, however some itching appeared but soon went away. Before my asthma was under control it also helped a lot by making the mucus much easier to cough up. It works very well every single day (if a stop taking it the coughing soon enough increases).",
                    "I had severe bronchitis from a sinus infection while traveling. It was causing me severe pulmonary distress. I was taking my rescue inhaler every 2 hours. The doctor in Hungary prescribed acetylcysteine, to help clear the lungs. My lungs cleared in days. What a difference! The only side effect I had was dripping from my nose. It liquified the mucus there too.  Usually back home in the US they prescribe steroids (prednisone) and albuterol nebulizer treatments for weeks while the coughing clears. No more for me.",
                    "It was really early in the morning, and I went to take Tylenol, when I misread the directions. I meant to measure out two tablespoons of the drug, but accidentally used my measuring cup instead. I ended up chugging two cups of Tylenol instead! I was rushed to the hospital and given Mucomyst-10 to offset the effects. Mucomyst-10 saved my life. Thank you Mucomyst-10!",
                    "I have chronic bronchitis and the beginnings of emphysema and am a smoker. I'm also prone to ulcers. Since I started taking NAC, I breathe easier and my bronchitis seems to be less \"phlemmy\". I've had no ulcer attacks. I've been taking it for a bit more than a year. "

                    "//What is it?//Several steps are necessary for pregnancy to occur: the formation and release of an egg from the ovaries; its arrival through the fallopian tubes to the uterus; its union with the male sperm; and the attachment of the fertilized egg to the wall of the uterus (implantation). If problems occur in any of these steps, infertility may occur. Infertility is not exclusively a female problem. As a rule, one third of the causes are female, another third are male and the remaining cases result from a combination of problems in both partners.//Symptoms//Although the World Health Organization defines infertility as \u201cthe absence of pregnancy after two years of regular sexual intercourse and without the use of contraception\u201d, it is considered a case of infertility when a pregnancy is not achieved after one year of trying. For women over the age of 35, this limit is six months. Infertility is also referred to as women who, although they are able to get pregnant, are unable to carry the pregnancy to term.//Causes//In about 10% of cases, the cause of infertility cannot be identified. However, there are numerous causes of infertility, both male and female. Male: Varicocele (dilation of the veins in the testicles, increasing the temperature, which affects the number and shape of sperm); changes in the ability of sperm to move; torsion or trauma to the testicle; consumption of alcohol, drugs or tobacco reduces the number of healthy sperm; kidney disease, hormonal changes, mumps, contact with pesticides, medications, exposure to radiation or chemotherapy. All of these factors can affect sperm production, and age itself is associated with a reduction in the number and quality of these cells. Heat is important because it interferes with sperm production. Therefore, professions such as cooks or drivers present a greater risk.;/  Females: most cases result from ovulation problems. One of the signs of changes in ovulation is the occurrence of irregular periods. One of the most common causes is polycystic ovary syndrome, which causes a hormonal imbalance that interferes with ovulation. Another common cause is primary ovarian insufficiency, which occurs when the ovaries stop functioning normally before the age of 40. There are other possible causes: pelvic inflammatory disease, endometriosis, surgery, fibroids, uterine polyps, thyroid disease, history of voluntary termination of pregnancy or repeated miscarriages. As for men, age, smoking, alcohol consumption and stress are factors to consider. Poor nutrition, excessive physical activity, sexually transmitted diseases, and being overweight or underweight also interfere with fertility. Age is important because as age increases, the ovaries become less capable of releasing eggs, their number is smaller, they are not as healthy and the risk of other health problems increases.;///Diagnosis//In the initial assessment, it is important to know the couple's sexual habits and recommendations can be made that prove relevant. Diagnosis tends to be time-consuming and expensive and, as noted, even with all testing and counseling, it cannot be guaranteed that pregnancy will occur. The causes of infertility are multiple and may or may not be associated with anomalies in the male or female reproductive system. Therefore, diagnosis must be carried out in stages and include both partners simultaneously. In addition to medical observation, laboratory tests, genetic and hormonal studies and some imaging methods, such as ultrasound or hysterosalpingography, are necessary. In the case of men, one of the most important tests is the spermogram. For women, one of the important steps is to understand whether ovulation occurs every month.//Treatment//Treatment depends on the cause and may involve medication, surgery, artificial insemination or assisted reproduction. It may be necessary to combine different techniques in the same case. In general, the drugs used are hormonal in nature and seek to improve the ovulation process.  Dealing with infertility can be difficult, as there is no way of knowing when the problem will be resolved. As such, the emotional burden associated with it is considerable. It is therefore important for couples to define their own limits. Diagnostic methods and treatments are expensive and do not always achieve the desired results. All alternatives that can reduce the anxiety that infertility tends to bring should be considered. This can be minimised by enlisting the support of healthcare professionals, friends and family and using relaxation techniques, if necessary.//Prevention//Many of the male forms are not preventable. However, not smoking, not consuming excessive alcohol, and avoiding high temperatures are some measures to consider. For women, some measures are essential to prevent infertility: Practicing safe sex is one of the most important measures to avoid sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis and HPV (human papillomavirus). These infections can cause pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility and serious systemic diseases.;/ Avoid environmental toxins.;/ Avoid high levels of mercury in foods such as swordfish and mackerel. Avoid benzene (found in detergents, dyes, rubbers, lubricants, hair products, and paint) because it is an endocrine disruptor that can contribute to infertility. Benzene has been shown to interrupt women's periods and decrease sperm counts in men.;/ Quit smoking: Almost all studies on smoking and fertility show a serious impact, including secondhand smoke.;/ Avoid alcohol and drug use.;/ Reduce caffeine intake.;/ Pay attention to the use of medications.;/ Maintain a weight within normal values;/ Portuguese Infertility Association Attain Fertility Division of Reproductive Health, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion,12 de Fevereiro de 2013 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research Reproductive Health, Infertility, Directorate-General for Health, National Reproductive Health Program, Lisbon 2008 Sexual and reproductive health, World Health Organization Load more;/ Endometriosis has a major impact on a woman's life and diagnosis is often delayed.

I take 75 mg of diph. an hour before I want to go to sleep, have a couple puffs of indica (night time pot,) ( it's legal here) and it works like a charm, I stay asleep for 5 or 6 hrs which is a long time for me, little groggy when I wake up but it goes away after a couple puffs of sativa (day time pot) I've been a toker for 49 yrs, it's good for a lot of uses. I am 66 My doctor says he agrees that pot is easier on the body and mind than prescription drugs for anxiety, insomnia, depression, pain,and loss of appetite. They make edibles, gum, etc for those that hate smoke.",

                    "I use this instead of Xanax. It works and has no hangover effect. My concern, however, is that a thrombophlebitis might have been the result of more that a month's moderate usage. I did go to the hospital where lab work was done and a wet-scan ultra-sound was done, with no evidence of clotting. I will continue to use it because it's more effective than any other product. ",
                    "Good antihistamine. Can cause drowsiness, but it works quickly and shrinks nasal swelling better than some of the other choices. I take a newer antihistamine during the day, but this helps a ton at night when the other wears off and the pollen is still bad.",
                    "I take it 3 or 4 times a week and it works well. Full night's sleep. A little drowsy when I wake up but it passes after my morning coffee. I love it.",

                    "After I was in a severe car accident 8 years ago I've had chronic back pain and muscle spasms which has made it very hard to sleep.

Love it!",
                    "I have emtophobia, that is, a pervasive fear of vomiting. I do not know if this affects vomiting, but if I feel nauseous, Benadryl works wonders. My stomach settles right down and my anxiety lowers just enough for me to deal with it without the use of benzodiazepines.",
                    "This did not work for me at all. I lay in bed for the third night in a row, congested and unable to sleep. Not sure why it doesn't work for me, but I am severely unsatisfied. No side effects, but no desired effects either.",
                    "I have occasional sleeping problems such linked to stress, such as not being able to fall asleep for around 2 to 5 hours or waking up in the middle of night and not being able to fall asleep afterwards. Someone recommended me to try Nustasium (diphenhydramine). It kicked in after 30 minutes to 1 hour I took it and it helped me sleep without waking up till morning for as many as 8-9 hours. However I felt dizzy and sleepy in the mornings. And in cases when I slept more than 8 hours like at the weekend I felt very weak and dizzy the whole day. Might be good for occasional use when I know I need long hours of sleep as with it I don't wake up early, but certainly not for continuous use, at least for me.",
                    "This sleep aid is amazing. The only \"complaint\" I have is that sometimes wears off if you hold off too long. Take it, give it one hour, you'll be ready to be out. I haven't had any side effects.",

                    "The most effective and reasonable sleep aid I've taken. A single pill (25 mg) before bedtime will make me drowsy enough to fall asleep within a half hour, and it generally keeps me asleep throughout the night. Drowsiness the next day is a problem for me, however, if I take it too late in the previous night; it tends to stay in my system for quite a while and, as said in previous reviews, it's not something you should be taking every night. But it's still my go-to drug whenever I know that I need a good night's rest and I'll be able to sleep in the following morning.",
                    "I use this medicine before going to bed when I have allergies and it helps me a lot.",

                    "In a lower dose of 25mg it made it easier to wake up in the morning and increased my appetite but in the higher dose of 50mg I got headaches, lost my appetite, and my sleep got even more messed up.",
                    "I had a severe migraine, was driven to the hospital when regular pain relievers did not work. I was given IV Benadryl along with an anti-nausea medicine and fluids. I felt sleepy almost immediately, and my pain was lessened. The huge down side was that I felt a huge amount of anxiety for 48 hours afterward. I do not suffer from anxiety normally. I believe this was an adverse reaction of the Benadryl. ",

Worked perfectly with no side effects. Went away for the weekend and forgot to take them with me. First night, didn't sleep at all, second night finally drifted off sometime after 7.30am and was woke at 9.45, last night got about an hour to 2 hours. Was absolutely done in, got home and that night took a nytol and slept like a baby. My fear is can I survive without these tablets now. Hopefully they keep working so I don't need too.",
                    "After trying several different sleeping aids, I ran across Compoz in K-Mart. I hadn't seen it anywhere else so I thought I would give it a try. I got a good nights sleep for the first time in quite a while. I still take it occasionally and still get that qood night of sleep. You can't take it every night for an extended period of time or it won't work as well, I can promise you that. ",

I have sneezing fits both indoors and outdoors and Benardryl is the only allergy pill that works for me. It works fast and stops my runny nose immediately. Although I do feel sleepy (most of the time), I can't be without it. ",
                    "I have severe allergies and life has been miserable. I couldn't afford the time or money anymore for allergy shots. Claritan stopped working. So did a bunch of over the counter allergy medications. I took so many cough and zinc lozenges my tongue became sore. I coughed all the time, to the point of stomach pain and incontinence. My coworker just gave me a Benadryl. I was on the verge of going home sick, but now I'm 100% better. A stress rash that was erupting on the back of my neck just now went away. This is a marvelous product, and I didn't know it had so many uses.",
                    "Drowsiness is a reoccurring problem for me. I have difficulty focusing and end up passing out. The effect of the drug comes a little slowly depending on how severe my allergy attack is.",
                    "I use benedryl for motion sickness and it does work. I can never remember the car ride, due to being asleep. I love it.",
                    "I have taken Benadryl or its generic equivalent for many years. It is very good for itchy throats and ears and all kinds of symptoms, and particularly good for sneezing. If the Benadryl doesn't work, then I know I'm coming down with something more than just seasonal allergies. I try to keep Benadryl with me all the time. There are so many food products that I am supposed to be allergic to that sometimes I take a Benadryl before I eat, especially peanut butter and bananas, two of my favorite foods.",
                    "Certainly helps me to sleep. But first time I slept for about 12 hours which meant that I slept badly the following night. I now take 3/4 of the tablet for a solid 8 hours. I suggest trying 1/2 or 3/4 your first time The first half hour or so on waking leaves me groggy, then I'm fine. Also seems to help me sleep really well the following night. I use only occasionally.",
                    "After having scripts for lots of different benzodiazepines and sleeping pills, I still rely on this a couple times a month. The ONLY problem is after a couple of days it loses it's effectiveness. It is perfect for sleep and not feeling drugged.",
                    "Benadryl seems to help but makes me so sleepy it isn't really worth the symptom relief.",
                    "Works quite well on insomnia but careful when combining with other meds that also work on your sympathetic/parasympathetic nervous system. I took it with lexapro and got significant problems with too low heart rate, respiratory issues and hypnic jerks.",
                    "Variant asthma, chronic, have been on many antihistamines and other costly asthma medicines over the years. I began taking Benadryl in late November 2011. Taking 25 mg after awakening in the morning followed an hour or so later with 25 mg with another 25mg early afternoon (when symptoms occur) and 25 mg prior to bedtime in conjunction with Symbicort twice/day. I have a much improved quality of life and am beginning to have some control over the chronic cough. ",
                    "Diphenhydramine is an extremely effective sleep aid. It takes half an hour or less for 25 mg to knock me out.  The biggest problem I have with diphenhydramine is that it makes me feel kinda' groggy and nauseous the next day. I feel like I'm walking around in some weird twilight and food just doesn't taste good to me. Still, out of the three sleeping pills I've tried, diphenhydramine is by far the most effective. Ambien made me feel like I was on a roller coaster and melatonin mainly makes me fall asleep a little faster.",
                    "Best drug for me to wake up with good sleep and not have a headache. I have used it for 8 years for allergies (itchy eyes, bug reactions) and my house always has it in stock. Love the drug!",
                    "Very sensitive to medication. Can not take histamines. Finally have outgrown allergies. Off and on about 20 yrs.",
                    "As a former bartender, I'm a night owl by nature. Now that I'm in law school and have 8am classes, I can't afford to be up all night. It ruins my entire next day because I cannot think and I am useless. Also, lack of sleep depresses me and gives me anxiety. Anyhow, I have tried literally everything under the sun- Ambien, Sleepy time, Valerian, melatonin, Simply sleep, and 4-5 others, both natural and not, and Sominex is the only one that has ever consistently worked to not only put me to sleep, but KEEP me asleep, on most nights.

I had gone through the gamut of second generation antihistamines (Claritin, Zyrtec and Allegra) with minimal success in treating my extreme symptoms. I decided to try the first generation antihistamine: Benadryl. Of course, it's been around for a long time, but it's definitely the most effective. The drawback to this older antihistamine is that it causes sleepiness, and it's not slight. Also, the newer antihistamines can be taken once a day, while Benadryl doses last only 4-6 hours. But to this extreme allergy sufferer, it's a small tradeoff, because it certainly treats the symptoms far better. ",

Tried them again just in case it wasn't the pills, happened again. So for now I'm going to stick to taking 1 instead of 2, and see if that helps any.",

If I eat something that has been in contact with nuts I take two pills or a gulp of the syrup and my itchy mouth and throat, swollen lips are instantly soothed. The syrup does work faster than the pills but pills are lighter to carry around. I once ate a huge piece of hazelnut chocolate and having benadryl on me really saved me. It won't work on severe reaction i.e. eating peanut butter but it is definitely a life saver for all other allergic reactions. I am never without benadryl and my epipen. Only thing to look out for is intense drowsiness, so make sure to be at home to take a long nap when it takes effect.",

I do remember it making me crazy itchy, and feeling like my skin was crawling. But, once I got in to bed, I knocked out and slept great and felt great in the morning. However, I took it last night around 930pm, and was up ALL night... I have to be up at 445a for work, and I fell asleep about 330 and just now feel like it's effects are kicking in. I may end up leaving work early because I feel so awful and tired. I dont know that I will take this again.",

It works like a charm, enabling me to sleep without needing to get up and pee or waking up with my life concerns preventing a return to sleep, for 6-7 hours. My concern is whether it is habit-forming, whether taking this drug for sleep on some nights increases the difficulty I have in falling asleep without the drug, on other nights.",

The active ingredient, dyphenhydramine HCL, you will find is the main ingredient in quite a few over the counter sleep medications so that should tell us something. And Benadryl or a generic drugstore brand are cheaper and just as effective. Have been taking this for over 20 years and have no side effects",

I took 50mg, which is supposed to be equivalent to 25mg of doxylamine, but I found that for me the doxylamine was better. I guess everyone is different, though considering that doxylamine has a higher rating, I guess I'm not the only one who thinks it's better.",

If I touch it, I break out into hives, if I eat it or just put it in my mouth and then spit it back out, I go into anaphylactic shock. (where my lungs close up and I stop breathing) I always carry around the liquid Benadryl (because it works faster than the pills) in my purse. On many occasions, a double dose of it has saved my life and delayed the reaction from getting worse until I could get to the emergency room. Literally a life saver.",

                    "I work night shift and I use OTC diphenhydramine to get sleep during the day. It works so much better than the Ambien I was on. I don't wake up and sleep eat like I did while on Ambien.",
                    "After I was in a severe car accident 8 years ago I've had chronic back pain and muscle spasms which has made it very hard to sleep. I am in the medical field and have tried lots of over the counter medicines and have also been prescribed medication however since taking Sominex I have been able to sleep through the night and I don't wake up groggy! Love it!",
                    "I have emtophobia, that is, a pervasive fear of vomiting. I do not know if this affects vomiting, but if I feel nauseous, Benadryl works wonders. My stomach settles right down and my anxiety lowers just enough for me to deal with it without the use of benzodiazepines.",
                    "This did not work for me at all. I lay in bed for the third night in a row, congested and unable to sleep. Not sure why it doesn't work for me, but I am severely unsatisfied. No side effects, but no desired effects either.",
                    "I have occasional sleeping problems such linked to stress, such as not being able to fall asleep for around 2 to 5 hours or waking up in the middle of night and not being able to fall asleep afterwards. Someone recommended me to try Nustasium (diphenhydramine). It kicked in after 30 minutes to 1 hour I took it and it helped me sleep without waking up till morning for as many as 8-9 hours. However I felt dizzy and sleepy in the mornings. And in cases when I slept more than 8 hours like at the weekend I felt very weak and dizzy the whole day. Might be good for occasional use when I know I need long hours of sleep as with it I don't wake up early, but certainly not for continuous use, at least for me.",
                    "This sleep aid is amazing. The only \"complaint\" I have is that sometimes wears off if you hold off too long. Take it, give it one hour, you'll be ready to be out. I haven't had any side effects.",
                    "I get severe migraines and was given this in the hospital instead of traditional nausea meds. It work well and I now use it at home and actually works better than Zofran or Phenagren.",

                    "The most effective and reasonable sleep aid I've taken. A single pill (25 mg) before bedtime will make me drowsy enough to fall asleep within a half hour, and it generally keeps me asleep throughout the night. Drowsiness the next day is a problem for me, however, if I take it too late in the previous night; it tends to stay in my system for quite a while and, as said in previous reviews, it's not something you should be taking every night. But it's still my go-to drug whenever I know that I need a good night's rest and I'll be able to sleep in the following morning.",
                    "I use this medicine before going to bed when I have allergies and it helps me a lot.",

                    "In a lower dose of 25mg it made it easier to wake up in the morning and increased my appetite but in the higher dose of 50mg I got headaches, lost my appetite, and my sleep got even more messed up.",
                    "I had a severe migraine, was driven to the hospital when regular pain relievers did not work. I was given IV Benadryl along with an anti-nausea medicine and fluids. I felt sleepy almost immediately, and my pain was lessened. The huge down side was that I felt a huge amount of anxiety for 48 hours afterward. I do not suffer from anxiety normally. I believe this was an adverse reaction of the Benadryl. ",
                    "Does what it says. Puts you right to sleep. ",
                    "I took these every night for a week after struggling with insomnia, hate the groggy feeling sleeping tablets give you the next day so thought I'd give these ago. Worked perfectly with no side effects. Went away for the weekend and forgot to take them with me. First night, didn't sleep at all, second night finally drifted off sometime after 7.30am and was woke at 9.45, last night got about an hour to 2 hours. Was absolutely done in, got home and that night took a nytol and slept like a baby. My fear is can I survive without these tablets now. Hopefully they keep working so I don't need too.",
                    "After trying several different sleeping aids, I ran across Compoz in K-Mart. I hadn't seen it anywhere else so I thought I would give it a try. I got a good nights sleep for the first time in quite a while. I still take it occasionally and still get that qood night of sleep. You can't take it every night for an extended period of time or it won't work as well, I can promise you that. ",

I have sneezing fits both indoors and outdoors and Benardryl is the only allergy pill that works for me. It works fast and stops my runny nose immediately. Although I do feel sleepy (most of the time), I can't be without it. ",
                    "I have severe allergies and life has been miserable. I couldn't afford the time or money anymore for allergy shots. Claritan stopped working. So did a bunch of over the counter allergy medications. I took so many cough and zinc lozenges my tongue became sore. I coughed all the time, to the point of stomach pain and incontinence. My coworker just gave me a Benadryl. I was on the verge of going home sick, but now I'm 100% better. A stress rash that was erupting on the back of my neck just now went away. This is a marvelous product, and I didn't know it had so many uses.",

                    "I have taken Benadryl or its generic equivalent for many years. It is very good for itchy throats and ears and all kinds of symptoms, and particularly good for sneezing. If the Benadryl doesn't work, then I know I'm coming down with something more than just seasonal allergies. I try to keep Benadryl with me all the time. There are so many food products that I am supposed to be allergic to that sometimes I take a Benadryl before I eat, especially peanut butter and bananas, two of my favorite foods.",
                    "Certainly helps me to sleep. But first time I slept for about 12 hours which meant that I slept badly the following night. I now take 3/4 of the tablet for a solid 8 hours. I suggest trying 1/2 or 3/4 your first time The first half hour or so on waking leaves me groggy, then I'm fine. Also seems to help me sleep really well the following night. I use only occasionally.",
                    "After having scripts for lots of different benzodiazepines and sleeping pills, I still rely on this a couple times a month. The ONLY problem is after a couple of days it loses it's effectiveness. It is perfect for sleep and not feeling drugged.",
                    "Benadryl seems to help but makes me so sleepy it isn't really worth the symptom relief.",
                    "Works quite well on insomnia but careful when combining with other meds that also work on your sympathetic/parasympathetic nervous system. I took it with lexapro and got significant problems with too low heart rate, respiratory issues and hypnic jerks.",
                    "Variant asthma, chronic, have been on many antihistamines and other costly asthma medicines over the years. I began taking Benadryl in late November 2011. Taking 25 mg after awakening in the morning followed an hour or so later with 25 mg with another 25mg early afternoon (when symptoms occur) and 25 mg prior to bedtime in conjunction with Symbicort twice/day. I have a much improved quality of life and am beginning to have some control over the chronic cough. ",
                    "Diphenhydramine is an extremely effective sleep aid. It takes half an hour or less for 25 mg to knock me out.  The biggest problem I have with diphenhydramine is that it makes me feel kinda' groggy and nauseous the next day. I feel like I'm walking around in some weird twilight and food just doesn't taste good to me. Still, out of the three sleeping pills I've tried, diphenhydramine is by far the most effective. Ambien made me feel like I was on a roller coaster and melatonin mainly makes me fall asleep a little faster.",
                    "Best drug for me to wake up with good sleep and not have a headache. I have used it for 8 years for allergies (itchy eyes, bug reactions) and my house always has it in stock. Love the drug!",

It ruins my entire next day because I cannot think and I am useless. Also, lack of sleep depresses me and gives me anxiety. Anyhow, I have tried literally everything under the sun- Ambien, Sleepy time, Valerian, melatonin, Simply sleep, and 4-5 others, both natural and not, and Sominex is the only one that has ever consistently worked to not only put me to sleep, but KEEP me asleep, on most nights. Occasionally I'll have an off night when I wake up mid-sleep or when I'm super groggy in the morning, but at least 90% of the time it works great. I usually take it about 1-2.5 hours before I want to fall asleep.",

Nothing else my routine has changed, but now I am up all through the night, tired all day, and still can't sleep at night. I regret making the mistake of using this product.",
                    "If you got a migraine cocktail in ER, then the med that gave you the anxiety, was most likely the compazine, it makes you feel very anxious that's why they give the benadryl with it to counteract the side effect of anxiety. (migraine cocktail consists of benadryl, compazine and depakote or Solumedrol). I had to take more benadryl to get rid of the severe anxiety",

I awake feeling refreshed and not drowsy or anything like the other sleep aids left me. I was concerned about taking them nightly and spoke to my doc who said he would rather I take the NYTOL as opposed to a sleeping pill prescription. He said NYTOL was just Benedryl and wouldn't hurt me. I have been taking NYTOL nightly for almost 2 years now and am so glad to have found it!",

I had gone through the gamut of second generation antihistamines (Claritin, Zyrtec and Allegra) with minimal success in treating my extreme symptoms. I decided to try the first generation antihistamine: Benadryl. Of course, it's been around for a long time, but it's definitely the most effective. The drawback to this older antihistamine is that it causes sleepiness, and it's not slight. Also, the newer antihistamines can be taken once a day, while Benadryl doses last only 4-6 hours. But to this extreme allergy sufferer, it's a small tradeoff, because it certainly treats the symptoms far better. ",
                    "I could not afford the expensive sleeping prescriptions, and was afraid of getting addicted to them, so I tried Sleep Aid Liquidcaps.

Tried them again just in case it wasn't the pills, happened again. So for now I'm going to stick to taking 1 instead of 2, and see if that helps any.",

If I eat something that has been in contact with nuts I take two pills or a gulp of the syrup and my itchy mouth and throat, swollen lips are instantly soothed. The syrup does work faster than the pills but pills are lighter to carry around. I once ate a huge piece of hazelnut chocolate and having benadryl on me really saved me. It won't work on severe reaction i.e. eating peanut butter but it is definitely a life saver for all other allergic reactions. I am never without benadryl and my epipen. Only thing to look out for is intense drowsiness, so make sure to be at home to take a long nap when it takes effect.",
                    "I have mixed feelings about this.. the first night I took it, it took about 1 and a half hours to kick in, and when it did my husband said I was acting like I was seriously drunk...which I remember very little of. I do remember it making me crazy itchy, and feeling like my skin was crawling. But, once I got in to bed, I knocked out and slept great and felt great in the morning. However, I took it last night around 930pm, and was up ALL night... I have to be up at 445a for work, and I fell asleep about 330 and just now feel like it's effects are kicking in. I may end up leaving work early because I feel so awful and tired. I dont know that I will take this again.",

It works like a charm, enabling me to sleep without needing to get up and pee or waking up with my life concerns preventing a return to sleep, for 6-7 hours. My concern is whether it is habit-forming, whether taking this drug for sleep on some nights increases the difficulty I have in falling asleep without the drug, on other nights.",

The active ingredient, dyphenhydramine HCL, you will find is the main ingredient in quite a few over the counter sleep medications so that should tell us something.

New Dr thinks I'm depressed BUT I'm far from that & keeps wanting to put me on depression medicine!! Called sleep Dr back in Iowa to tell new Dr here in Louisiana that I have insomnia which she did BUT new Dr doesn't believe sleep specialist!!",
                    "This medicine does not help at all for my insomnia. I have taken small and larger doses and I still find myself just as awake as if I had taken nothing. It probably just is not strong enough because none of the OTC sleep aids worked for me. I eventually was put on Ambien CR which works very well.",

Read about benadryl being used to prevent this side effect. I took 3 25 mg tabs.

                    "//What is it?//Whooping cough (also known as pertussis or whooping cough) is a highly contagious respiratory disease (of the trachea and bronchi) caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. The disease is spread through respiratory droplets that the infected person expels when coughing or sneezing. It can also occur through contact with objects contaminated with a patient's secretions. In 2018, there were more than 151,000 cases of this acute infectious disease worldwide. Pertussis is most dangerous for babies and is a significant cause of illness and death in this age group.//Symptoms//The incubation period for whooping cough is 7-10 days, but can range from 5-21 days. The symptoms of whooping cough are usually mild and similar to those of a cold: Runny nose;/ Nasal congestion;/ Watery and red eyes;/ Fever;/ Cough;/  Whooping cough progresses in phases. The first is the catarrhal phase (lasting 1-2 weeks), in which the following occurs: Inflammation and runny nose;/ Non-productive cough;/ Low fever;/  In the second phase - the paroxysmal phase, which lasts for 2-6 weeks - the cough worsens, is more frequent at night and can worsen with crying (in the case of children) and eating. It can be accompanied by cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin and lips) and swelling of the tongue. In addition, the patient may produce a characteristic noise of the disease when breathing in and the cough can even cause vomiting. During the convalescence phase (2-6 weeks), the cough progressively decreases in intensity and frequency. The noise produced when inhaling and vomiting also disappear. However, whooping cough does not appear equally in all patients. There are people who do not develop noise when breathing. There are cases where a persistent cough is the only sign that a teenager or adult may be infected. Babies, on the other hand, may not have a cough, but may only have difficulty breathing or even suddenly stop breathing. Vaccinated children, adolescents and young adults may have only mild symptoms, such as a persistent cough. Patients with whooping cough are most contagious until about 3 weeks after the cough appears. It is a good idea to consult your doctor if you have prolonged coughing attacks and experience symptoms such as: Vomiting;/ Red or blue coloration of the face;/ Difficulty breathing;/ Breathing noise when inhaling;///Possible complications//Complications associated with whooping cough are often side effects of persistent coughing, such as: Broken or sore ribs;/ Abdominal hernias;/ Rupture of blood vessels in the skin or eyes;/  Pneumonia is a relatively common complication, while seizures and neurological disease rarely occur.  In babies\u2014especially before 6 months of age\u2014complications of whooping cough can be more serious, including: Pneumonia;/ Slower breathing or respiratory arrest;/ Dehydration or weight loss due to difficulties in eating;/ Dizziness;/ Neurological damage;///Causes//Whooping cough is caused by the bacteria Bordetella pertussis. Transmission occurs when an infected person sneezes or coughs, expelling microbes into the air. These droplets can then be inhaled by other people, infecting them.//Diagnosis//Diagnosing whooping cough in the early stages can be difficult because the signs and symptoms are very similar to those of other respiratory illnesses, such as colds, flu and bronchitis. In most cases, the diagnosis is made through clinical observation. However, tests may be done to help confirm the diagnosis, such as: Collection of nasopharyngeal exudate;/ Blood tests;/ Chest X-ray;///Treatment//In older children and adults, pertussis treatment is usually done at home and includes taking antibiotics. Because babies are at higher risk of complications, they are more likely to need hospital treatment. If your child is unable to take in liquids or food, intravenous fluids may need to be administered. Your child may also be isolated from other people to prevent transmission of the disease. Family members who have been exposed to the infection may need to take prophylactic antibiotic treatment. Cough relief is difficult. Over-the-counter cough medicines have little effect on whooping cough and are not recommended. Always follow your doctor's instructions.//What you can do at home//In addition to the prescribed medical treatment for whooping cough, there are some measures you can take at home: Rest, preferably in a dark, cool and quiet room.;/ Increase fluid intake: water, juice and soup are good options to stay well hydrated. Be aware of possible signs of dehydration in children, such as dry lips, crying without tears and urinating infrequently.;/ Eat lighter meals. This is important to prevent vomiting associated with coughing.;/ Air out the house, keeping the interior free of irritants that could aggravate the cough, such as tobacco smoke or fireplace smoke.;/ Practice proper respiratory etiquette by covering your face whenever you cough. It is also important to wash your hands frequently and wear a mask around other people.;///Prevention//The best way to prevent whooping cough is through vaccination. The pertussis vaccine is free and is included in the National Immunization Program (PNV), and must be administered in five doses at 2, 4, 6, 18 months and 5 years of age. Pregnant women should also be vaccinated between 20 and 36 weeks of gestation, ideally up to 32 weeks. The combined vaccine against pertussis, tetanus and diphtheria is also included in the PNV.  There are also preventive medications against whooping cough, which can be prescribed by your doctor for some specific groups that have been exposed to the disease: Health professionals;/ Pregnant women;/ Babies under 12 months;/ Patients with a health condition that increases the risk of serious illness or complications, such as immunosuppression or asthma;/ Living with someone who has whooping cough;/ Living with someone who is at increased risk of developing a serious illness or complications from pertussis;/ Mayo Clinic, janeiro 2021 World Health Organization, January 2021 SNS 24, janeiro 2021 Whooping cough has returned and again poses a threat, especially to babies. It is essential to vaccinate pregnant women between 20 and 36 weeks of gestation. It can be scary to see that you have spit or coughed up blood, but it may not be serious and there are several possible reasons. The answer is \"yes\". Although infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus confers some immunity, no one is 100% protected and reinfection with COVID-19 can occur.

My concern, however, is that a thrombophlebitis might have been the result of more that a month's moderate usage. I did go to the hospital where lab work was done and a wet-scan ultra-sound was done, with no evidence of clotting. I will continue to use it because it's more effective than any other product. ",

Love it!",

                    "This did not work for me at all. I lay in bed for the third night in a row, congested and unable to sleep. Not sure why it doesn't work for me, but I am severely unsatisfied. No side effects, but no desired effects either.",

Someone recommended me to try Nustasium (diphenhydramine). It kicked in after 30 minutes to 1 hour I took it and it helped me sleep without waking up till morning for as many as 8-9 hours. However I felt dizzy and sleepy in the mornings. And in cases when I slept more than 8 hours like at the weekend I felt very weak and dizzy the whole day. Might be good for occasional use when I know I need long hours of sleep as with it I don't wake up early, but certainly not for continuous use, at least for me.",
                    "This sleep aid is amazing. The only \"complaint\" I have is that sometimes wears off if you hold off too long. Take it, give it one hour, you'll be ready to be out. I haven't had any side effects.",

                    "The most effective and reasonable sleep aid I've taken. A single pill (25 mg) before bedtime will make me drowsy enough to fall asleep within a half hour, and it generally keeps me asleep throughout the night. Drowsiness the next day is a problem for me, however, if I take it too late in the previous night; it tends to stay in my system for quite a while and, as said in previous reviews, it's not something you should be taking every night. But it's still my go-to drug whenever I know that I need a good night's rest and I'll be able to sleep in the following morning.",
                    "I use this medicine before going to bed when I have allergies and it helps me a lot.",

I felt sleepy almost immediately, and my pain was lessened. The huge down side was that I felt a huge amount of anxiety for 48 hours afterward. I do not suffer from anxiety normally. I believe this was an adverse reaction of the Benadryl. ",

First night, didn't sleep at all, second night finally drifted off sometime after 7.30am and was woke at 9.45, last night got about an hour to 2 hours. Was absolutely done in, got home and that night took a nytol and slept like a baby. My fear is can I survive without these tablets now. Hopefully they keep working so I don't need too.",

I got a good nights sleep for the first time in quite a while. I still take it occasionally and still get that qood night of sleep. You can't take it every night for an extended period of time or it won't work as well, I can promise you that. ",

I have sneezing fits both indoors and outdoors and Benardryl is the only allergy pill that works for me. It works fast and stops my runny nose immediately. Although I do feel sleepy (most of the time), I can't be without it. ",
                    "I have severe allergies and life has been miserable. I couldn't afford the time or money anymore for allergy shots. Claritan stopped working. So did a bunch of over the counter allergy medications. I took so many cough and zinc lozenges my tongue became sore. I coughed all the time, to the point of stomach pain and incontinence. My coworker just gave me a Benadryl. I was on the verge of going home sick, but now I'm 100% better. A stress rash that was erupting on the back of my neck just now went away. This is a marvelous product, and I didn't know it had so many uses.",

                    "I have taken Benadryl or its generic equivalent for many years. It is very good for itchy throats and ears and all kinds of symptoms, and particularly good for sneezing. If the Benadryl doesn't work, then I know I'm coming down with something more than just seasonal allergies. I try to keep Benadryl with me all the time. There are so many food products that I am supposed to be allergic to that sometimes I take a Benadryl before I eat, especially peanut butter and bananas, two of my favorite foods.",
                    "Certainly helps me to sleep. But first time I slept for about 12 hours which meant that I slept badly the following night. I now take 3/4 of the tablet for a solid 8 hours. I suggest trying 1/2 or 3/4 your first time The first half hour or so on waking leaves me groggy, then I'm fine. Also seems to help me sleep really well the following night. I use only occasionally.",
                    "After having scripts for lots of different benzodiazepines and sleeping pills, I still rely on this a couple times a month. The ONLY problem is after a couple of days it loses it's effectiveness. It is perfect for sleep and not feeling drugged.",
                    "Benadryl seems to help but makes me so sleepy it isn't really worth the symptom relief.",
                    "Works quite well on insomnia but careful when combining with other meds that also work on your sympathetic/parasympathetic nervous system. I took it with lexapro and got significant problems with too low heart rate, respiratory issues and hypnic jerks.",
                    "Variant asthma, chronic, have been on many antihistamines and other costly asthma medicines over the years. I began taking Benadryl in late November 2011. Taking 25 mg after awakening in the morning followed an hour or so later with 25 mg with another 25mg early afternoon (when symptoms occur) and 25 mg prior to bedtime in conjunction with Symbicort twice/day. I have a much improved quality of life and am beginning to have some control over the chronic cough. ",
                    "Diphenhydramine is an extremely effective sleep aid. It takes half an hour or less for 25 mg to knock me out.  The biggest problem I have with diphenhydramine is that it makes me feel kinda' groggy and nauseous the next day. I feel like I'm walking around in some weird twilight and food just doesn't taste good to me. Still, out of the three sleeping pills I've tried, diphenhydramine is by far the most effective. Ambien made me feel like I was on a roller coaster and melatonin mainly makes me fall asleep a little faster.",
                    "Best drug for me to wake up with good sleep and not have a headache. I have used it for 8 years for allergies (itchy eyes, bug reactions) and my house always has it in stock. Love the drug!",
                    "Very sensitive to medication. Can not take histamines. Finally have outgrown allergies. Off and on about 20 yrs.",
                    "As a former bartender, I'm a night owl by nature. Now that I'm in law school and have 8am classes, I can't afford to be up all night. It ruins my entire next day because I cannot think and I am useless. Also, lack of sleep depresses me and gives me anxiety. Anyhow, I have tried literally everything under the sun- Ambien, Sleepy time, Valerian, melatonin, Simply sleep, and 4-5 others, both natural and not, and Sominex is the only one that has ever consistently worked to not only put me to sleep, but KEEP me asleep, on most nights. Occasionally I'll have an off night when I wake up mid-sleep or when I'm super groggy in the morning, but at least 90% of the time it works great. I usually take it about 1-2.5 hours before I want to fall asleep.",
                    "This is the only OTC medicine I have found that helps with my insomnia. ",
                    "I have never had a problem with going to sleep at night, but I bought some Sominex at the airport the other day in order to help me sleep in a 9 hour flight, and now for the past few days I have had severe insomnia. Nothing else my routine has changed, but now I am up all through the night, tired all day, and still can't sleep at night. I regret making the mistake of using this product.",
                    "If you got a migraine cocktail in ER, then the med that gave you the anxiety, was most likely the compazine, it makes you feel very anxious that's why they give the benadryl with it to counteract the side effect of anxiety. (migraine cocktail consists of benadryl, compazine and depakote or Solumedrol). I had to take more benadryl to get rid of the severe anxiety",
                    "Experienced an allergic reaction during dinner at a new restaurant. Throat started itching terribly so we left and drove to the nearest pharmacy. Used Benadryl syrup because I thought it would work faster. Fixed my allergic reaction in a minute.",

I decided to try the first generation antihistamine: Benadryl. Of course, it's been around for a long time, but it's definitely the most effective. The drawback to this older antihistamine is that it causes sleepiness, and it's not slight. Also, the newer antihistamines can be taken once a day, while Benadryl doses last only 4-6 hours.

The syrup does work faster than the pills but pills are lighter to carry around. I once ate a huge piece of hazelnut chocolate and having benadryl on me really saved me. It won't work on severe reaction i.e. eating peanut butter but it is definitely a life saver for all other allergic reactions. I am never without benadryl and my epipen. Only thing to look out for is intense drowsiness, so make sure to be at home to take a long nap when it takes effect.",

However, I took it last night around 930pm, and was up ALL night... I have to be up at 445a for work, and I fell asleep about 330 and just now feel like it's effects are kicking in.

(where my lungs close up and I stop breathing) I always carry around the liquid Benadryl (because it works faster than the pills) in my purse.

So my doctor started putting me on codiene, then vicoden, then tramadol, and then so on but they all gave me hours of vomiting, gut wrenching cramps, and sweating. Read about benadryl being used to prevent this side effect. I took 3 25 mg tabs. I know that is one over recommended but I was desperate. 35 mins later I was sitting with my kids and not the trash can for the first time in a while.

No one can really tell or know when you have went too far because you are suppose to hurt and be in pain. If you are in pain, it means that your body muscles are stretching and you are making room for more muscles to fit. Many people don't understand that when you go home then that's when the adrenaline wears off and you start to think \"I went a little too far that time\".  Since most of what I do is shoulder press, I have to say that this back patch for pain has saved me from several night where I wouldn't have been able to sleep.

                    "//What is it?//Whooping cough (also known as pertussis or whooping cough) is a highly contagious respiratory disease (of the trachea and bronchi) caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. The disease is spread through respiratory droplets that the infected person expels when coughing or sneezing. It can also occur through contact with objects contaminated with a patient's secretions. In 2018, there were more than 151,000 cases of this acute infectious disease worldwide. Pertussis is most dangerous for babies and is a significant cause of illness and death in this age group.//Symptoms//The incubation period for whooping cough is 7-10 days, but can range from 5-21 days. The symptoms of whooping cough are usually mild and similar to those of a cold: Runny nose;/ Nasal congestion;/ Watery and red eyes;/ Fever;/ Cough;/  Whooping cough progresses in phases. The first is the catarrhal phase (lasting 1-2 weeks), in which the following occurs: Inflammation and runny nose;/ Non-productive cough;/ Low fever;/  In the second phase - the paroxysmal phase, which lasts for 2-6 weeks - the cough worsens, is more frequent at night and can worsen with crying (in the case of children) and eating. It can be accompanied by cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin and lips) and swelling of the tongue. In addition, the patient may produce a characteristic noise of the disease when breathing in and the cough can even cause vomiting. During the convalescence phase (2-6 weeks), the cough progressively decreases in intensity and frequency. The noise produced when inhaling and vomiting also disappear. However, whooping cough does not appear equally in all patients. There are people who do not develop noise when breathing. There are cases where a persistent cough is the only sign that a teenager or adult may be infected. Babies, on the other hand, may not have a cough, but may only have difficulty breathing or even suddenly stop breathing. Vaccinated children, adolescents and young adults may have only mild symptoms, such as a persistent cough. Patients with whooping cough are most contagious until about 3 weeks after the cough appears. It is a good idea to consult your doctor if you have prolonged coughing attacks and experience symptoms such as: Vomiting;/ Red or blue coloration of the face;/ Difficulty breathing;/ Breathing noise when inhaling;///Possible complications//Complications associated with whooping cough are often side effects of persistent coughing, such as: Broken or sore ribs;/ Abdominal hernias;/ Rupture of blood vessels in the skin or eyes;/  Pneumonia is a relatively common complication, while seizures and neurological disease rarely occur.  In babies\u2014especially before 6 months of age\u2014complications of whooping cough can be more serious, including: Pneumonia;/ Slower breathing or respiratory arrest;/ Dehydration or weight loss due to difficulties in eating;/ Dizziness;/ Neurological damage;///Causes//Whooping cough is caused by the bacteria Bordetella pertussis. Transmission occurs when an infected person sneezes or coughs, expelling microbes into the air. These droplets can then be inhaled by other people, infecting them.//Diagnosis//Diagnosing whooping cough in the early stages can be difficult because the signs and symptoms are very similar to those of other respiratory illnesses, such as colds, flu and bronchitis. In most cases, the diagnosis is made through clinical observation. However, tests may be done to help confirm the diagnosis, such as: Collection of nasopharyngeal exudate;/ Blood tests;/ Chest X-ray;///Treatment//In older children and adults, pertussis treatment is usually done at home and includes taking antibiotics. Because babies are at higher risk of complications, they are more likely to need hospital treatment. If your child is unable to take in liquids or food, intravenous fluids may need to be administered. Your child may also be isolated from other people to prevent transmission of the disease. Family members who have been exposed to the infection may need to take prophylactic antibiotic treatment. Cough relief is difficult. Over-the-counter cough medicines have little effect on whooping cough and are not recommended. Always follow your doctor's instructions.//What you can do at home//In addition to the prescribed medical treatment for whooping cough, there are some measures you can take at home: Rest, preferably in a dark, cool and quiet room.;/ Increase fluid intake: water, juice and soup are good options to stay well hydrated. Be aware of possible signs of dehydration in children, such as dry lips, crying without tears and urinating infrequently.;/ Eat lighter meals. This is important to prevent vomiting associated with coughing.;/ Air out the house, keeping the interior free of irritants that could aggravate the cough, such as tobacco smoke or fireplace smoke.;/ Practice proper respiratory etiquette by covering your face whenever you cough. It is also important to wash your hands frequently and wear a mask around other people.;///Prevention//The best way to prevent whooping cough is through vaccination. The pertussis vaccine is free and is included in the National Immunization Program (PNV), and must be administered in five doses at 2, 4, 6, 18 months and 5 years of age. Pregnant women should also be vaccinated between 20 and 36 weeks of gestation, ideally up to 32 weeks. The combined vaccine against pertussis, tetanus and diphtheria is also included in the PNV.  There are also preventive medications against whooping cough, which can be prescribed by your doctor for some specific groups that have been exposed to the disease: Health professionals;/ Pregnant women;/ Babies under 12 months;/ Patients with a health condition that increases the risk of serious illness or complications, such as immunosuppression or asthma;/ Living with someone who has whooping cough;/ Living with someone who is at increased risk of developing a serious illness or complications from pertussis;/ Mayo Clinic, janeiro 2021 World Health Organization, January 2021 SNS 24, janeiro 2021 Whooping cough has returned and again poses a threat, especially to babies. It is essential to vaccinate pregnant women between 20 and 36 weeks of gestation. It can be scary to see that you have spit or coughed up blood, but it may not be serious and there are several possible reasons. The answer is \"yes\". Although infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus confers some immunity, no one is 100% protected and reinfection with COVID-19 can occur.

                    "I was diagnosed with PCOS in 2013 but did not start taking Metformin seriously until late 2014. I am also prediabetic, which is what has jump started my desire to seriously lose weight. I cannot speak for blood sugar levels as I have not had them rechecked, nor have I gotten my cycle back, but I also have a significant amount of weight to lose first. I definitely experience upset stomach and pretty intense diarrhea; however, this only seems to happen if I do not watch my carb and/or sugar intake. If I eat sensibly, I have little to no issues in the side effect department. I am losing weight and moving more, and hope to one day not need medication anymore.",
                    "Metformin is for 'PCOS type 1', insulin resistant, becoming insulin resistant, prediabetic or diabetic. If you're like me & have no diabetes/non-insulin resistance, you're 'PCOS type 2'. This great drug is NOT for us! My ex PCP & ex Endo both pushed this on me. I took it for almost two years. Over a 2yr span I developed every symptom of hypothyroidism, goitre & my PCOS went crazy! I lost 60% of my hair, choking in my sleep from the goitre & zero energy. I gained 80lbs & my Doctors couldn't figure out why. Got a new Endo, stopped Metformin! I'm dropping weight & Goitre/hypo GONE! Full Thyroid panel was always perfect btw. Google \"5 types of PCOS\"!",
                    "I don't like this particular brand of Metformin. It doesn't have consistent results. My A1C was down to 5.9 from 11.8 when first diagnosed in 2009 after receiving a round of steroid shots for my back pain. My doctor had put me on a series of different diabetic type 2 meds. They found I was insulin resistance. So, they put me on Actos for about 6 months and that is what got everything under control. I also had a extreme diet change in 4 months I lost 100 lbs. Also helped my numbers. Unfortunately I had a life changing event which required me too move out of state. I just had my urine checked and my kidneys seem to be fine but having major issue when my sugar is 129 -. My A1C has gone up since taking this. Itching, diarrhea, weight gain",
                    "I was diagnosed with PCOS about two years ago with my lack of energy, weight gain and irregular periods. I started on 500mg/day, then slowly upped the dose to now taking 2000mg/day. I have been on 2000mg/day for over a month now and still feel awful side effects. I am always nauseous, burping, indigestion, heartburn, diarrhrea, reduced sex drive (due to previously mentioned side effects), joint pain, loss of appetite, weakness... the list goes on. I am already low weight so feeling ill and not having an appetite is concerning. Also my period has not become more regular and in fact has become worse. When I was on just 500mg/day I felt fantastic so the doctor kept increasing the dose. I think I will go back down to a lower dose or stop",
                    "I am 43 and have suffered for about 10 years from extreme tiredness, acne around the mouth and chin, and weight gain. Was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia in 2000. Started taking Metformin 3 weeks ago and have had little side effects. I am also taking spironolactone. My biggest complaint is severe, sudden cramping in the small muscles in the front of my legs and toes. Taking calcium with magnesium seem to help. I felt tired for several days, but have lost 5 lbs already. (Could also be from water weight). My brain seems less foggy and I don't feel as depressed. I do not eat sweets in general, but this medication has affected my appetite in a good way!!",
                    "Hey guys. I was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome a few days ago. I gained weight and I didn't have my period for over 8 months. I am not over weight but I was still advised to lose weight. I am on Metformin 500 one a day and after ONE day I got my period! Amazing! I did have pains and I felt sick but nothing horrible. I am going back to GP for check in 6 weeks so I will let you know more. Just had to share my excitement as this was the website I was reading regarding to Metformin.",

Having gained so much weight over the past year now weighing 75kgs, this medication does not seem to be working at all with my weight loss. I'm on 2 x 500mg a day. Have had few bad side effects, nausea and bad breath. I brush my teeth endlessly, but doesn't seem to improve. As long as I can lose weight I don't mind the side effects, but I've been on this medication for over a month now and I have not lost any weight.",

When I turned 25 my periods started getting farther and farther apart. I'd have a 25 day cycle and then he next would be 90 days. I ended up in the ER with two ruptured cysts and one the size of a baseball. After years of feeling tired all the time and strange hairs on my breasts and random places I was finally diagnosed with PCOS. I had also been trying to conceive for one year. My doctor started me on metformin 500mg once a day. Just 3 weeks later I conceived and 9 days after that I had a positive pregnancy test. After a entire year of trying!!! I feel so much better on this medicine.",
                    "My Husbend is overweight. We took this drug to help him lose weight. However everyone in his family has diabetes or pre-diabetes. His A1C at the time was 5.7 and he weighed about 210. He is 5.6. The weight should be 165-170. I don't know however if we took the brand name or a generic form. I also don't remember the amount he took. Anyway, he lost like 5-10 pounds on it and after that no more. But we saw around that time a rise in his estrogen from 35 to 49. The lab say that it should be up to 40. When we married 2 years prior, it was 35. So I knew what it was to begin with. I can't say for sure that metaphorine did it. However, we got off of it and now one year later it went back to 35. Trace your estrogen before taking this",

Since then I've had an HSG text, been on Metformin and am now to my limit of 2,000 mgs, Clomid, and was on Prometrium (progesterone) this last month. This last month my doctor also put me on a pill again to get my period. My periods have always been irregular. This morning 6/23/15 I took a pregnancy test and it was negative. My husband and I are hoping for the best next month.",

I'd actually rate metformin a dang good laxative more than a diabetic med, but ahh well. I got used to it, and that side effect helped me eat less.",
                    "(54) yr old male: Metformin worked very quickly to lower my blood glucose levels from almost 400 to progressively down to avg of 130 within 10 days. My only complaint is the side effect of very noticeable BLURRED vision and soreness around my eyes. I have always been blessed to have 20/20 vision so this is not something I am used to. I am willing to deal with this side effect as long as my glucose levels are back to normal. As we all know, a lifestyle change with regard to diet and exercise is a MUST. My situation was a \"wake up call\" and my plans are to eventually be weaned off Metformin within 6 months. Be encouraged and don't give up. ",

So I was put back on birth control just to have a cycle.. Me and my husband are trying to conceive so I went to the doctor to have an ultrasound did on me to check my ovaries and that's when I found out I have PCOS.. My doctor started me on Metformin.. I started taking it on 06/20/15.. The symptoms started immediately! Really bad cramps and MAJOR diarrhea.. I haven't been taking it for a week yet and I'm not to stop but right now I don't like the feeling. But my doctor said this helps with me trying to have a baby.. So hopefully good news soon :)",
                    "I was diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome when I was 16 Y/O and very irregular periods and some body hair. I was becoming increasingly unhappy with how things were and so the doctor tried to help by putting me on the pill. This helped only by regulating my 'period' every month instead of having a random period twice a month or nothing for 4 - 6 months. I'm 28 now and I've literally been on Yasmin since I was 17 to 27 y/o with no breaks. My hubby and I are trying to conceive so I came off the pill in March 2014 and from then till Nov 2014 I had one natural period. So, the doctor prescribed Metformin in November, I take only 500mg twice a day and on Dec 24th 2014 I had my period. Then again now Jan 30th 2015. The only down fall is very sore cramps.",
                    "I've been taking metformin for years but I'm finding that different generics not only are less affected but give me more acid and G.I. problems. Teva was good but they stop making it. Sun pharmacuticals/ Cacarowas also good at contolling BG. WITH NO SIDE EFFECTS but I find the pharmacies are carrying cheaper generics particularly with the Medicare drug plan insurance. I'm finding that my blood sugar is not as well controlled and I'm having more problems with nausea and cramping though no diarrhea. I may have to switch to something else I'll see what the next A1 C is like",

I was overweight and already being treated for Hypothyroidism with Levothyroxine sodium. after several months on it I started losing muscle strength and tiring easily, sleeping in afternoons, something I'd never done before. My husband was also on it 2 or 3x 800 mg per day,I don't remember now, but having been diagnosed years earlier in UK. he was ok on it, despite also being on French equivalent of Warfarin, and something else, since his triple bypass op in 2008. So same drug doesn't always suit everyone, depending on other health factors. I ended up with a swollen spleen after taking Metformin, so took myself off it just B4 scan confirmed it!",
                    "Metformin they say makes you hyper-fertile. Yea, I agree. My hormones got a little wacky for a week or so. I've calmed down now and feel pretty good. I take the dose up slow, only one 500mg pill for seven days before adding one more 500 mg for another seven and so forth until I reach four pills a day. I noticed that without using any lantus that my blood sugar readings were lower. Not low enough however to discontinue the lantus. I noticed while on lantus alone I never felt all that chipper. When I started the metformin my moods improved dramatically and I became a much happier person. The diarrhea did not last long, but did return when I increased the dose. Getting used to the pils nowl and bowels returned to normal.",

A few months later I had two heart attacks my doctor put me on metformin to help with my sugar but I started losing weight slowly. I also started working out a little at a time. Now to date I have lost 92 pounds with in a year. Metformin may not work as well for you if you don't work out and go for walks but if you watch what you eat and how much slowly reduce the amount of food you eat go for walks and work out metformin will help , the first few weeks can be hard as your body adjust to it but that will pass. I feel great - I got my health back thank you metformin for the help !",

It helped curb my appetite and I am eating much healthier - I have lost 15 pounds, due not just to the metformin, but also healthier eating and increased exercise. Another positive is that I have a decrease in the number of migraine headache episodes that I had before I started metformin. Again, a combination of meds and healthier lifestyle habits.",

                    "Metformin so far has been good to me. I have had no side effects. Most likely because I stick to the diet the doctor prescribed. I stay away from carbs from bread, fried food, and candy and sweets. I mainly eat fruits, veggies, and salads in moderation. I feel really good.",

But the most effective control I have is diet. I was eating healthy and exercising regularly until about 2 years ago. Had my A1c down to 5.9. Got lazy and now it is in the 7's. Also have arthritis in knees and it is hard to exercise. I take 2500mg a day.",
                    "I used metformin for about 3 months and only had nausea and heartburn after a greasy meal, this made me change to the Metformin ER. It did help me lose about 20 pounds which is great because with PCOS it is hard to lose weight. I only used this to lose some weight and make me ovulate (which only took about 3 weeks). I do not have insulin resistance. Overall this is a great drug for PCOS!",

During the 2 years since I was diagnosed my doctor has had me try everything and nothing has helped. Finally she decide to give me metformin. I've been on it for 10 days now. I'm currently only up to 1000 mg, but I've already lost 5 pounds. I've hardly had any side effects. Also my facial hair growth has slowed and I'm breaking out less.",
                    "I was diagnosed with PCOS late. I am 49 years old but didnt know I had PCOS for quite a few years. I just thought it was early menopause. I gained 100 lbs in 2 years. I started at 285 lbs. Here is the key: Whatever the doc prescribes, start first week taking only one 500 mg pill per day and take it after you have had a few bites of your meal, then eat the rest of your meal. Then the second week, add the 2nd pill per day, etc. Its all about gradual adding. Per this smart doc, if you allow your body to get used to it the first week and take with food, you will be less likely to suffer the nausea, etc. Using it, I have finally had a period and my energy level has increased. I am looking forward to the weight loss and other benefits.",

I'm nauseous, I have the poops, and no appetite because I'm nauseous. The symptoms were starting to wear off then I started to take 2 a day.

Walking up the steps caused me to pant and have to sit and rest. I wanted to sleep all the time. I never took a sugar reading during the 8 days I was taking it, so it may very well have worked to lower my sugar. I just couldn't live with the side effects, and felt better within hours of stopping taking it (and Glimepiride). I will go back to my doctor after the holiday to try something else.",

I only regret that I did not take it sooner (like in my 20's) After suffering through years of acne and struggling to get pregnant when I wanted (frustrating business when your not ovulating at all) and people asking constantly if I was pregnant (due to my big fat tummy that I could NEVER get rid of...) I finally found Metformin. Now, not only has my skin cleared up, my weight also came off AND I was able to have my beautiful 4th child easily - because my periods have become bang on regular. I am so blessed to have had four children with polycystic ovarian syndrome but it was a long road trying for most of them. This medicine HAS changed my life in that it has given me ME back - the CONFIDENT ME I am supposed to be.",

For those of you who want to have a baby you should try seed rotation along with your metformin. Pcos is a hormonal imbalance which the seeds WILL regulate allowing you to conceive. I have not started Metformin not until Sat but i do take my seeds regularly and have seen a decrease in hair growth (lighter eventually stopped) as well as weigth loss. I am not curently sexually active but i did recommend it to someone who was having trouble concieve and within 4 months they were pregnant. I am attaching a link so you can read further.

My triglycerides were through the roof....3500 at one point! Prior to starting Metformin I had worked on improving my diet, watching calories and quality of foods I ate and I had seen some moderate weight loss. Once on the metformin, my triglycerides dropped 90% (from 3500 to 350) and the pounds began to drop away....several pounds every few weeks to the point that I am down 42 pounds (from 220 down to 178) in about 4 months.

I find the cramps, diarrhea return every time I fall off the wagon, overeat or take in too much carb. it is a great motivator to keep you on your diet. And it is a great one to gradually, safely and permanently lose weight. I lost 30 lbs in 2 years and kept it, with no particular diet (except low carb) and hardly any exercise. Absolutely the best diet pill I've seen in my many diet trials over past 30 yrs.I think anyone wanting to lose weight should try this, even non diabetics.",

My side effects have calmed down now my appetite is still lacking but I'm not as nauseas and my skin has calmed down although it's very dry.

For the last 5 years I stayed under 1000 calories a day, and my readings were 175 or 83, I was up and down like a yo-yo all day and night. I gained weight constantly, I weighed in at 196lbs on Feb 20. Now 2 months later on glucophage I have lost 29 lbs, and I eat like a normal person. I can't believe the difference. The first week on it I had some nausea but it went away and I now have no side effects. I keep thinking this is a fluke, a pill can't make that much of a difference. I feel better than I have in 20 years, I now have energy because I am eating enough and my readings are amazing.",

I experienced mild stomach discomfort and no other side effects. The first month, my cycle length was cut in half and the second month, I got pregnant! I never thought the day would come that I would see a positive pregnancy test. I continued the Metformin through my first trimester and we now have a perfect baby boy.

I suspect this was my body adjusting to a lower blood sugar level (pre-diabetic). This began wearing off after a couple weeks and I felt better than I ever have. It really helped. My dosage is 1000 mg 2x daily. I have now lost over 100 pounds over the past 2 years, though I can't say if the metformin contributed to weight loss, as I did a drastic lifestyle change; but I suspect that it has. Now that I am healthier, though, I am starting to get that same foggy feeling as I had in the beginning. I think the dosage is too high now that I am overcoming PCOS through a healthy lifestyle.

He told me that it makes you feel nauseous, he was right. I did feel quite sick, So i would recommend staggering the dosage and working up to three tablets a day. It worked for me. It also gave me diarrhea every now and then but it wasn't that bad, more like loose stools, not explosive. I was on metformin for a few months, my periods were semi-regular and then I fell pregnant. Didn't really loose much weight, just a couple of kg's which i think was because i felt sick from the tablet.",

I have a system with it- I will eat and take them before 8pm - if not you will wake up vomiting or worse diarrhea.

I gained 20 lbs since 2013 and am hoping i will lose some on metformin since a lot of reviews say they lost some pounds on it. Keeping my fingers crossed.

Within a week my periods started again and have been semi-regular since (only ever off by a max of 3 days at my due date). My anxiety and depression calmed down dramatically too. I have experienced weight loss on the medication but only through hard work, not with some of the ease I have read about.

I have since found a (female) doctor who is a specialist with PCOS cases and has me on all the right hormone replacement therapy as well as the Metformin. I take 5 pills a day and it is helping tremendously. I am losing weight and feeling better. I do get a bit tired as I adjust to the higher dosing. However, I have never felt better in my life.

ALL side effects of metformin are indicators that you're eating too many carbs. A doctor that prescribes metformin that doesn't also prescribe a low carb diet is being absurd. I've been amazed at how many people I've talked to over the years that have had that happen. Diarrhea, nausea, metallic taste, all mean you're eating the wrong things!  They're not a reason to quit the meds. They're proof you need to eat low carb. 7 years later, still down 100, and increasing dose to continue losing.",

I switched from the regular fast acting metformin to the extended release metformin XR. The difference was like night and day. I have had no nausea at all using the metformin XR.

Got married in 2010 and started trying for a baby. Got pregnant in Jan of 2011 even without having regular periods but unfortunately I miscarried. Was only diagnosed in late 2012 with PCOS and went onto Glucophage in august 2011. With the help my wonderful doc I conceived in November of the same year and delivered a health baby boy in August of 2012. Glucophage was really helpful to me and I would really ask all you ladies to keep the faith and stay on even if it makes you sick for a while.",

I've not had any negative side effects. None. I have felt fuller and don't have the urge to eat all the time. I no longer crave sweets or greasy food. All my pms symptoms are completely gone! I don't feel like sleeping through the day anymore, I feel like I have way more energy, I feel normal again for once.

If I eat a good, healthy dinner right before I take the pills, I don't feel sick at all. Another side effect, I've lost all interest in alcohol because it makes me feel terrible immediately.

I usually can handle the pain and discomfort but since we've been trying to conceive for five years, all the symptoms similar to pregnancy plays games with my mind.

For the first time in my life, I have since experienced life as someone without a weight problem. I no longer think about food ruminatively, have to remind myself to eat, and I stop eating when full (eating smaller portions than previously). I have not had my blood glucose re-tested yet so can not speak to the effectiveness of Metformin for glucose control, but I expect much improvement, even at this sub clinical dose.

Keep in mind, I never knew what an A1C was until that day I was pissed! When I asked my doc what my A1C was in December, she told me 6, never EVER saying \"Hey, you're pre-diabetic.\" They tried to also put me on insulin and I told them to kick rocks. 3 months later (2 days ago) my A1C is down to 6.7!

I'm down 25lbs combined with only a healthy diet. It suppresses my appetite, but not enough to cause any harm. I am on 500mg 2x a day.

I went off the med, felt better, and tried it a second time with the same effect. I gave this a two because I know this drug can work for some people.

I am very limited in physical excercise due to a spinal cord injury, degenerative arthritus in my spine, several problems with my legs, broken bones, etc. I used to hike a lot, but can't now.

The first couple days I was a little nervous so I was very careful not to eat carbs but so far I have had very minimal side effects. I have been taking it for 1 week now and yesterday I increased my dose to 500mg with breakfast and 500mg with dinner (I have the extended release). In the first 4 days I lost 5lbs just because it really helped me feel less bloated and it took away my appetite. I used to think about food 24/7 and constantly crave sweets but I no longer have that issue. So far I feel great on it and I will see how 1500mg/day goes.",

I wasn't able to handle even a half of a dose. It made me feel really spacey almost like I had taken anti-anxiety medicine. It also caused me to have very high blood sugar. My bs after a snack was 180. One morning it was even 105 fasting. That's never been my case. Stopped taking it and can really feel my body detoxing out of my system. My bs are back to normal. BS 84 fasting and 118 after a very yummy sweet potatoe souffle (guilty). This medication was definitally doing more harm than good. Went and got my A1C checked so we'lol what it's now after 3 years",

By day three or four, I had no more negative side effects. It worked very quickly, I quickly began to lose weight and started menstruating again. My skin also began to clear up within the first week. Glucophage helps so many of the terrible issues caused by PCOS. I need more time to better evaluate the medicine, but so far it is like a miracle.

I decided to finally do something about it, I was actually enjoying the lack of periods to be honest! I had some tests done and the diagnosis of PCOS was confirmed. My doctor put me on metformin 500mg twice a day and I hated it. I was so nauseous for the first two weeks, frequent diarrhea and lots of dizziness but it all passed.

For the next 7 years I was on and off different contraceptive pills, metformin or no contraceptive at all With no luck of getting pregnant as I was now back up to 115kg after first child.

I haven't lost lots of weight but I am currently swimming and running to help make the weight loss quicker. I am 19 years old so it was quite hard to find out that I have PCOS but I knew that it was a possibility because my mum has it. I'm hoping that it will aid in keeping the hair away from my face!

Prior to metformin, I couldn't control my craving for salty, carb filled food. For the past two and a half weeks I have been able to finally control the cravings. My energy levels have increased by 50%. I also waxed the unwanted hair the day I started, and already I have noticed that less is growing back in.

On rough days, I would take an Imodium with my metformin, careful not to overtake it.

I have mild gastrointestinal discomfort but well worth it. It seems to help with food cravings. I used to drink 5 cups of coffee in the morning and I am down to only one without any caffeine withdrawal symptoms. I also don't crave sugar or high carb foods.

I knew that the metformin caused it because as I sat with wife over supper, I took the 500mg pill half way through the meal. Within a few minutes my heart was pounding almost out of control. My blood pressure monitor showed normal blood pressure, but a pulse of 101. I stopped the drug right away. The problem is that it takes 4 days for this damn drug's effects to leave the body. So now I am taking a sedative which lowers the heart rate, while I wait for these 4 days to pass. I am a 67 year old male.",

Plus, it felt like I had a stomach bug that wouldn't go away, because my blood sugar constantly measured at high levels. After been on Metformin for only a few days, my blood sugar levels have started to stabilize, and my fasting range is now between 85-120.

As much as I tried to carefully titrate on to the medicine, metformin left me feeling bloated and with chronic diarrhea. My body simply would not tolerate metformin. I ended up seeing an endocrinologist, and he switched me to insulin, and I am VERY happy with that move. My glucose levels are under control, and I don't have to deal with any adverse effects.

I went from 138 lbs to 350 lbs in 8 years before the pcos was even diagnosed. 7 months on metformin, with a healthy diet and moderate exercise and I'm 140 lbs down. For me, it worked. I went through 2 or 3 brands until I got to one that didn't make me sick. But I'm grateful I stuck it out.

Today, Dec 2014, I started my first period and I am so excited about. Moving forward, my next step is to conceive, become diabetic free, and facial hair free.

Me AFTER metformin: I'm more energetic, my mood is way better, the muscle aching is gone and I only eat 3 meals a day now without craving anymore.

Another fantastic thing is that I can now function when I am menstruating which used to be impossible for me due to the horrible pain. I now have manageable pain and don't have to get shots for it. I've also been able to lose 77 lbs that I had gained. Overall I've had a wonderful experience with this medication.

I was prescribed metformin but stopped taking it & didn't go back to the doctor again until this past Feb. I've had irregular periods since 2005 after I gained a lot of weight. I had a period, maybe every 3-4 months & the flow never was normal. It usually was very light & lasted just a few days. I started taking metformin 500mg on Feb. 7th & I started my period on Mar. 5th & the cramps were absolutely awful & the bleeding was excessively heavy . I'm now 6 days late & neg preg test. I'm 29 & want to be a mother so badly. I really hope metformin helps me with this.",

                    "I am on slow release metformin (1500 mg), & since changing away from the regular type,12 years ago I have zero loose bowels. You must insist to have a chance to try this much better version, if frequently bothered by the standard pills. Even more important, Please look up this fairly obscure nutritional cap...PTEROSTILBENE. It has proven to be a near miracle to free me from diabetes symptoms. I still take metformin, & only a doctor call put you on that med. But it works pretty darn well...but if you take METF along with PTEROSTILBENE, diabetes is largely controlled. Almost like a true cure...except you have to continue both. Pterostibene is found in the skin of blueberries, and a few other plant sources. I take 2 50mg caps,daily. Morn.& night",

I have it the inside of my elbows and underneath my breasts and down my abdomen. It has made it less noticeable. No luck on reducing the unwanted patches of hair on my chin but tweezers are my best friend. No weight loss at this time either but it has leveled my blood sugars.

My doctor put me on 500mg of metoformin three times a day, I was worried about side effects but the only things I have experienced are acid reflux and slight nausea - but the nausea makes me less likely to snack on things so it's actually kind of a good thing.

The side effects were horrible the first two weeks along with horrible cramping and a constant period for 3 weeks. However, now I have no side effects at all, you just have to stick with it.

I had constipation all the time. Only a good dose of laxatives would help, but even then I had to strain pretty hard to relieve myself. Finally, my doctor decided to take me off the medication, since my readings were in the mid 80's. I've been off for about two days and I'm feeling very light-headed. I'm hoping this will pass soon.

When asked if there was a ceiling for the dosages he said we have plenty of room to adjust (there actually is no recorded max dose I could find in the literature). The typical patient uses about 4 mg four times a day. I have found that I have had to increase as much as 16mg four times a day to see adequate glucose changes.

The next morning, my blood was 120 or so. I reasoned that if I took it again, and it brought my blood sugar down 60 points, it would be too low. So I didn't take it. For the next five days, I took only my metformin because my levels were in a very reasonable range. On the fifth or sixth day, my level went above 150.

But as long as I have something on hand for it, it's not major for me. I agree with comment that a mid-morning snack is probably a good idea with this. Also, I noticed that when I eat things that are sugary, my body is better at saying \"enough\" and an aversion to things too sweet. That's a good addition. Overall, I can't complain.

Unlike most reviewers, I did not see an immediate reduction in blood sugar level until the last week, when my average dropped from the high 130s to five straight days between 101 and 108. This drop also corresponded to an extremely active week, tennis six straight days, bowling once and jogging a three-mile course twice. Appetite is great, so must watch weight.

The lows about 2 hours after taking the breakfast dose were immediately a problem. I then switched to a 1/4 tab (cutting that tab into 4 parts is a skill in itself), four times per day, and the lows became minimal. And my A1c is back to 6.4.

I now take Double the dose of glimipiride in the evening. However when I got serious about my diabetes, I changed the way I eat. Smaller meals more often is best on this medication in order to not have dips and spikes. A good breakfast and a mid morning snack works well. A moderate lunch with an afternoon snack makes good sense. A low carb-high lean protein dinner. The med works well",

It also must be taken with a calcium supplement. I had been taking the D2 for several years, and then they wanted me to take Prolia as my bone loss was getting worse. Stopping the D2, and starting the D3 at 5,000 iu a day with 600 mg of calcium has helped quite a bit. I would suggest anyone try this before taking something like Prolia, or Forteo for bone loss. If you have osteoporosis, you need the supplements either way.

                    "//What is it?//Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disease, which can have several causes and which results from several pathophysiological changes that lead to a permanent increase in glycemia (blood sugar concentration). This increase is essentially due to defects in the normal action of insulin and/or a lack of it. The incidence is growing and affects around 13% of the Brazilian adult population. It is estimated that there are around 400 million people with diabetes worldwide, and the numbers continue to increase. Sugar is necessary for the metabolism of cells. In order for it to be transported there, the pancreas produces insulin, a hormone that captures glucose from the bloodstream and takes it to cells throughout the body where it is used as energy. Anyone can suffer from this disease, however, exposure to risk factors can increase the likelihood of its occurrence. Around 90% of diabetes cases are classified as type 2 diabetes. This type mainly affects adults and elderly people, who are overweight or obese, sedentary and have unhealthy lifestyles, and there is often a family history. Type 1 diabetes is much less common and essentially results from the sudden and irreversible destruction of pancreatic cells, usually due to autoimmune inflammation. These patients are usually teenagers or young adults. In pregnant women, the new hormonal environment, combined with excess weight, a sedentary lifestyle and an unbalanced diet, can produce a type of diabetes typical of pregnancy, called gestational diabetes. It is usually controlled with diet and physical activity alone, but may require insulin treatment. The main problems with this type of diabetes, when left uncontrolled, are fetal and birth complications.//Symptoms//Symptoms are caused by the amount of sugar in the blood, either associated with an increase in its level (hyperglycemia) or a decrease in its level (hypoglycemia).//Symptoms of hyperglycemia//Hyperglycemia can occur in poorly controlled diabetics or when a large amount of sugar is ingested. This condition can cause blurred vision, a dry mouth, excessive sweating and fatigue.//Symptoms of hypoglycemia//Hypoglycemia usually occurs in diabetics who use medications to control the disease, whether insulin or oral antidiabetics. This condition can result from taking too much or incorrect medication, prolonged fasting or inadequate physical exercise. Blood sugar levels should not be below 70mg/dl. When taking medications to control the disease, it is necessary to pay close attention to what you eat so that your sugar levels do not drop too low. Unexplained tiredness, dizziness, blurred vision and difficulty thinking are the main symptoms of hypoglycemia.//Causes//The pancreas releases insulin, the hormone that controls the storage and use of sugar in the blood. Diabetes occurs when: The pancreas produces insufficient insulin or is unable to produce any insulin at all;/ When the body does not respond adequately to insulin - a condition of \"insulin resistance\";/  It is a public health problem that often results from the way people live and the habits they have. Its incidence has been increasing. In 2010, around 34.9% of the Portuguese population between 20 and 79 years old had diabetes or pre-diabetes and around 43.6% of cases were undiagnosed. This disease is responsible for several complications that reduce quality of life and can cause early death. It is an illness that has no cure. However, advances in treatments and understanding of the disease allow diabetics to lead practically normal lives. Often, careful eating and regular exercise are enough to prevent the disease or keep it under control. Some risk factors are possible to control (modifiable); others are not (non-modifiable). Modifiable risk factors: High blood pressure;/ Obesity;/ Sleep deprivation;/ Sedentary lifestyle;/ Smoking;/ Non-modifiable risk factors: Diseases of the pancreas or endocrine diseases;/ Family history;/ Newborn weighing more than four kilos;/ Gender and age: Women over 45 are most affected;///Diagnosis//One of the main problems is that symptoms often go unnoticed, leading to late diagnosis. To do this, an analysis of the symptoms and risk factors is necessary. Generally, only one parameter is used to make the diagnosis. If two are used, they must be consistent and, if they are not, the analysis must be repeated two weeks after the first.//Treatment//Type 1 diabetics are treated with insulin (insulin therapy), which is administered subcutaneously several times a day from the beginning of the disease. This must be done together with correct blood glucose monitoring and a healthy diet and regular exercise. Type 2 diabetics monitor their blood sugar levels with oral antidiabetic drugs. Sometimes no medication is necessary, as this type of diabetes can be controlled by adopting a healthy lifestyle, restricting high-calorie foods, eating in portions, exercising, taking medications that facilitate the action of insulin, and in certain cases or more advanced stages of the disease, by administering insulin (if treatment with oral antidiabetics is not able to achieve the expected goals). Weight loss is essential for these patients.//Prevention//Although there is no cure, good blood sugar control can prolong life and prevent complications. Prevention involves three important points: Understanding diabetes: It is important for patients to understand their type of diabetes well. This is the only way to comply with and improve their treatment. The way patients deal with the disease is the main factor for success.;/ Control blood glucose: if it is within normal limits there is less chance of suffering complications.;/ Diet: One of the priorities for type 2 diabetics is to improve their eating habits and lose weight. As this is one of the risk factors that most contributes to the development of the disease and the appearance of complications, it is also one of the most important to control. Medication is not effective if eating habits do not improve.;/ Diabetes Portal (http://portaldadiabetes.pt) Gardete-Correia L e col.,First diabetes prevalence studyin Portugal: PREVADIAB study, Diabet Med. 2010 Aug;27(8):879-81 Medscape Reference(http://emedicine.medscape.com) Load more;/ Diabetics are at risk for COVID-19 infection, not because they have a greater chance of contracting it, but rather because of the severity of the complications. Diabetes in children is increasingly common and is a chronic disease that can have several complications. Keeping it under control is essential. One means your blood sugar levels are too low and the other means your blood sugar levels are too high. But they have one thing in common: they are both harmful to health.

                    "I am so glad I found this! I've been dealing with motion sickness for years. It was almost impossible for me to ride in the backseat of a car before this medication. I first used Dramamine for a 4 hour road trip in a large van. I was so nervous about getting motion sickness I almost did go. I took 2 pills about 30 minutes before and it completely kept the sickness away! It did make me tired and I ended up taking a little nap but thats better than nausea. I can do everything I couldn't do before in a car from reading to having a normal conversation.",
                    "This is amazing! I've been struggling with motion sickness, and its gotten worse as I got older. I took this on a 3 hour drive to San Diego and 3 hour drive back, and I was feeling better than ever! It seems to help with anxiety as well, I forgot how it felt to just be normal. I'm always nauseous, so its a refreshing feeling to not feel anything on the drive. I don't get sleepy that easily so the drowsiness doesn't kick in til later, but this is amazing I recommend. Its good to have trust with a medication because it'll ease your mind on the trip you're going to take, and thats what I have with dramamine.",
                    "We use Dramamine prior to fishing trips. However an old sea captain told me to take one pill the night before and then another the morning of the trip. This way it really gets in your system. It works!",
                    "I have been experiencing motion sickness every time I travel by plane and decided to give this a try. Not only did I not experience any nausea, but it knocked me out for my two hour flight! I fell asleep while people were still boarding and woke up when the plane hit the ground again. Amazing!",
                    "I've taking dramamine a couple of times with good results however the other day I took it and it was a disaster. I usually experience agitation and dizziness while being a passenger in a car and it usually dulls it but, this time... it made my symptoms substantially worst I developed sensitivity to light , sound , and even temperature felt more intense and that was in addition to the agitation and dizziness. Please use with caution.",
                    "For me, dramamine works better than phenergan. I have a lot of nausea due to rheumatoid medications I take. I also get vertigo or migraine on occasion that cause nausea. This med helps me a lot",
                    "Wow 50 mg of this everyday for insomnia put me right to sleep and the quality of sleep is so good :)",
                    "I have such a hard time with motion sickness, so I am always sure to bring Dramamine along with me for flights, cruises, etc. I do not recommend the non-drowsy formula, however because it does not work for me. I will take drowsiness over nausea any day!"

                    "//What are they?//Vertigo is not a disease but rather a symptom that can occur in various pathologies. The word vertigo comes from the Latin vertere, which means spinning or rotating movement. Vertigo, or vertigo syndrome, is defined as a distortion of the body's movement in space. To understand what causes vertigo, we must understand the entire mechanism involved in maintaining balance. There are several systems involved in the orientation of our body: the visual, the vestibular (inner ear) and the proprioceptive (these receptors are located in the muscles, tendons, joints and skin). Vertigo occurs when there is an anomaly in one of these systems and can also result from a problem in the brain, which is responsible for analysing and integrating information about the movement and position of the head and body. This condition can affect people of any age and is usually accompanied by other symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, headaches, paleness, increased heart rate and loss of consciousness. They correspond to an illusion of movement, with a sensation of movement of surrounding objects in relation to the individual or vice versa. They are most often rotatory (the environment seems to move around the patient), but they can also manifest as a sensation of sliding to one side or up and down. It is necessary to distinguish vertigo from dizziness: dizziness is a generic designation that encompasses all situations where there is a disturbance in the individual's relationships with space, and vertigo must be considered a particular form of dizziness. This distinction is not always easy, especially in cases of great anxiety or when dizziness occurs in the context of a psychiatric illness. In general, vertigo results from an injury to the inner ear, its peripheral receptors, the pathways that carry the information collected or the centers of the central nervous system that process this information. Vision disorders and a special type of sensitivity (proprioceptive) in the skin, bones, muscles and joints throughout the body can also cause dizziness, which can be very difficult to distinguish from vertigo. Vertigo is part of a broader set of disorders, known as vestibular disorders, which are very common. For example, in the United States, it is estimated that approximately 35% of the population over the age of 40 has had at least one episode of vestibular disease.//Symptoms//Vertigo, or vertigo syndrome, can be accompanied by dizziness, a feeling of lightheadedness or fainting, loss of balance or instability. The duration of episodes can vary from a few minutes to hours and are often accompanied by intense nausea and vomiting. In general, headaches, slurred speech, double vision, weakness of one of the upper or lower limbs, and uncoordinated movements are signs that the vertigo is caused by a neurological disorder in the brain and not a problem limited to the ear. Elderly people or those taking medications for heart disease or high blood pressure may experience dizziness or fainting when they stand up abruptly. This happens due to a momentary drop in blood pressure (orthostatic hypotension) that lasts just a few seconds. It can often be prevented by standing more slowly or wearing compression stockings.//Causes//There are many causes of vertigo. The body detects posture and controls balance through balance organs located in the inner ear. These have nerve connections with specific areas of the brain that allow balance to be maintained. Therefore, vertigo can be caused by disorders of the ear, the nerves that connect the ear to the brain or the brain itself - in more aggressive acute or chronic otitis, toxic substances can spread to the inner ear and interfere with its proper functioning for balance. It can also be related to visual problems or sudden changes in blood pressure, but also to labyrinthitis, neuritis, traumatic brain injury, auditory nerve or brain tumors, strokes, meningitis, ototoxicity from certain medications, barotrauma due to pressure changes, among others. Cardiac arrhythmia, hypoglycemia, a sudden drop in blood pressure, or anxiety that causes the patient to constantly take deep breaths can cause syncope that can be confused with vertigo. Changing the prescription of glasses lenses can also cause this condition. The most common cause is motion sickness, which can occur in anyone whose inner ear is sensitive to certain movements, such as rocking or sudden braking and acceleration. These people may feel particularly dizzy during car or boat journeys. This type tends to be more common in women and is more common in older people, and its exact cause is not always known. In some cases, the condition occurs after a head injury, reduced blood flow to certain areas of the brain, a viral infection, after ear surgery or prolonged breastfeeding. M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease causes episodic and abrupt attacks of vertigo, along with ringing in the ears and progressive deafness. They can also be caused by bacterial or viral infections, tumors, abnormal pressure, nerve inflammation or toxic substances that affect the aforementioned structures. At a cerebral level, they occur in the context of migraines, after a stroke, following transient episodes of ischemia or in multiple sclerosis.//Diagnosis//Diagnosis is based on clinical history and medical examination of the auditory system or nervous system. Some tests can provoke an episode of vertigo and thus help to understand its cause. Tests such as audiometry, impedance analysis, evoked potentials, electro or videonystagmography, posturography and imaging tests (computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) are frequently used.//Treatment//Some cases do not require treatment and disappear spontaneously. In others, certain maneuvers can be performed to control the condition. Depending on the cause, there are other treatment options, such as anti-inflammatory or antiemetic drugs (if there is significant vomiting), among others.//Prevention//Anyone can experience vertigo and there is no way to prevent a first episode. Since it causes a strong feeling of imbalance, it is important to avoid situations in which you could fall. American Academy of Family Physicians, 2014 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, 2013 MedicineNet, 2014 Vestibular Disorders Association, 2014 Load more;/ Vestibular neuritis is an inflammation of the vestibular nerve after an episode of acute vertigo, which can maintain the sensation of imbalance for weeks. Different from simple dizziness, vertigo can be a symptom of various illnesses and require medical advice. Discover some of the causes of vertigo.

Tried many types of \"sleeping pills\" (Zopiclone was hilarious: after 3 nights in a row - in repeated trials - it made me sooo depressed, and my memory was seriously disrupted ( another side effect) ...  Dramamine (25 or 50 mg, an hour before sleep time) has been a miracle drug for me. My sleep is still not perfect but so much improved that my life is coming back.",
                    "I am so glad I found this! I've been dealing with motion sickness for years. It was almost impossible for me to ride in the backseat of a car before this medication. I first used Dramamine for a 4 hour road trip in a large van. I was so nervous about getting motion sickness I almost did go. I took 2 pills about 30 minutes before and it completely kept the sickness away! It did make me tired and I ended up taking a little nap but thats better than nausea. I can do everything I couldn't do before in a car from reading to having a normal conversation.",
                    "This is amazing! I've been struggling with motion sickness, and its gotten worse as I got older. I took this on a 3 hour drive to San Diego and 3 hour drive back, and I was feeling better than ever! It seems to help with anxiety as well, I forgot how it felt to just be normal. I'm always nauseous, so its a refreshing feeling to not feel anything on the drive. I don't get sleepy that easily so the drowsiness doesn't kick in til later, but this is amazing I recommend. Its good to have trust with a medication because it'll ease your mind on the trip you're going to take, and thats what I have with dramamine.",
                    "We use Dramamine prior to fishing trips. However an old sea captain told me to take one pill the night before and then another the morning of the trip. This way it really gets in your system. It works!",
                    "I have been experiencing motion sickness every time I travel by plane and decided to give this a try. Not only did I not experience any nausea, but it knocked me out for my two hour flight! I fell asleep while people were still boarding and woke up when the plane hit the ground again. Amazing!",
                    "I've taking dramamine a couple of times with good results however the other day I took it and it was a disaster. I usually experience agitation and dizziness while being a passenger in a car and it usually dulls it but, this time... it made my symptoms substantially worst I developed sensitivity to light , sound , and even temperature felt more intense and that was in addition to the agitation and dizziness. Please use with caution.",
                    "For me, dramamine works better than phenergan. I have a lot of nausea due to rheumatoid medications I take. I also get vertigo or migraine on occasion that cause nausea. This med helps me a lot",
                    "Wow 50 mg of this everyday for insomnia put me right to sleep and the quality of sleep is so good :)",
                    "I have such a hard time with motion sickness, so I am always sure to bring Dramamine along with me for flights, cruises, etc. I do not recommend the non-drowsy formula, however because it does not work for me. I will take drowsiness over nausea any day!"

                    "During a migraine attack, I took a Dramamine to help me sleep (as, yes, it packs a wallop in the drowsy department). It did make me a little drowsy, but what was more interesting is that my migraine went from a \"10\" to a \"4\" on the pain scale. Now when I start to get migraine symptoms, I take an Excedrin and a Dramamine. The combination works tremendously for me.",
                    "Works excellent. Went on. Whale watch with family. Took it 1 hour before boat trip and it worked awesome. I Even was able to have food on the boat with no nausea.",
                    "I take this for motion sickness, as well as occasional nausea. It works beautifully. I'm able to go on longer road trips and boats without being bothered by motion. And not only do I feel well physically, but my mind is at ease knowing that I don't really have to worry about it. I also appreciate the fact that it's widely available and relatively inexpensive. I usually buy the generic version, but I find that it works just as well.",
                    "Need Something over the counter now...This stuff works. Use as directed every 4 hours and promise you your nausea and vomiting will disappear.. I still think Zofran (Prescription ONLY) is the best stuff but this is a close second for over the counter.",
                    "I have been taking dramamine for years (since I was a child) to prevent my terrible motion sickness. It works incredibly well at keeping me from getting nauseated. My only problem with it is that it makes me so drowsy! If it is a shortish flight or bus ride, I still get nauseous but don't always want to take a dramamine because I'll be so drowsy once arriving at my destination. A 4+ hour flight/bus/boat though, and dramamine is for sure the way to go, particularly if it is overnight travel and you will be wanting to sleep anyway.",
                    "I have been experiencing severe nausea and vomiting due to my long-term medications. So far, dimenhydrinate combined with ginger tea (ginger root soaked in hot water) has had the best results. I'm finally able to eat some food again.",
                    "For me it's a miracle medicine. I purchase it OTC and can't believe how well it relieves symptoms of vertigo. Wonderful success with this medication. In the past, I actually had to pull over when driving a vehicle because I couldn't focus on the road. I take 100mg and in a few minutes I'm back on the road. Amazing! I suffer from tinnitus and get \"off balanced\" very easily. It completely cures my motion sickness.",
                    "Very good for motion sickness, but takes some time (about 1 1/2 - 2 hrs) to fully kick in.",
                    "I had to stop taking my migraine medicine because of a life threatening side effect. Nothing else touched my migraines. I was desperate because of the nausea and dizziness on top of the unbelievable pain, and took a Dramamine. Not only did it stop the nausea and dizziness, it knocked out my migraine enough that I was able to get out aof bed and function - probably from a 10 on the pain scale to a 5. Huge difference!",

                    "For me, it works miracles. When I used to drink I'd get the worst hangovers because of the horrible stomach ache and vomiting. If I take this, I know in one hour exactly (it literally takes exactly 60 minutes for me) I will feel better and not even a little nauseous. I also get nasty random bouts of nausea (I have no idea why). Before knowing about Dramamine, I'd have to force myself to vomit just to feel a little bit of relief but after finding this stuff, I no longer suffer. I do not know what I will do if this medicine is ever discontinued. ",
                    "Amazing. Helps with my serve nausea and helps me sleep. It's better if you take it 30 minutes before the trip. And also helps with anxiety it relaxes you.",
                    "I enjoy sport fishing. most of the time about 3 to 4 days out at sea on a 30footer boat which could rocks severally during storms. to help myself from being seasick/motion-sickness I frequently take 1 NOVOMIT pill every 8-9 hourly. I am in my mid 40s and I felt the pills do really help. it would cost abt USD$4 per box/8pills from pharmacy. hope these information is useful.",
                    "I have taken Dramamine every day of my adult Life. I have suffered from motion sickness my entire life and it is not unusual for me to become motion sick from working on the computer if I haven't taken a Dramamine yet. I recently noticed yellowing of my skin and eyes. My doctor Ordered blood work and I was diagnosed with Hepatitis A. there is no reason I would have contracted hepatitis. Is there a correlation with Dramamine?",

                    "Our six year old gets terrible motion sickness even on short trips. We recently went on vacation and the drive was proving to be too much for her. She threw up the whole day and then some the next even after she was out of the car - really heartbreaking. We purchased dimenhydrinate at the suggestion of the pharmacist and she was perfectly fine in 20 minutes. We finished our drive from Canada to North Carolina and she was completely healthy and happy the entire trip. FABULOUS!",

Best sea sick pill I've ever had, would recommend have been cruising for approximately 10years but have only been using Travel-Eze for about 5 years when a Boots customer said that it was the best one she had used for her daughter who is now never ill while traveling on any form of transport.
