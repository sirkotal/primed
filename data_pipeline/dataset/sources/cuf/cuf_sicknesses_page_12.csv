Meningitis,"//What is it?// Meningitis is a disease caused by inflammation of the meninges, which are the membranes that protect the brain and spinal cord. This inflammation is usually the result of an infection of the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Within infections, it is important to distinguish between the different strains: Viral meningitis, the most common and which tends to be less serious and which is caused by viruses such as enteroviruses;;/ Bacterial meningitis, in which the bacteria most frequently involved are Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus), Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) and Haemophilus influenzae type B and which are serious infections that can be fatal;;/ Fungal meningitis, which is rarer and can occur from inhaling fungi in the environment or in patients affected by diabetes, cancer or HIV/AIDS infection;;/ Meningitis caused by parasites, important in less developed countries.;/ When the meninges are inflamed, damage to the brain or spinal cord can occur. Meningitis in children is an important public health problem and, despite advances made in recent decades, mortality associated with this disease has remained practically unchanged. In fact, the majority of cases, around 70%, occur before the age of five. Although there is also progress in terms of antibiotic treatment, the mortality rate inherent to this infection remains high, between 5% and 15%, and permanent sequelae, such as deafness and changes in psychomotor development, occur in around 25% of survivors. //Symptoms// It's not always easy to recognize your symptoms. In the early stages, they are similar to flu or gastroenteritis, but the disease can progress quickly and be fatal within hours. In the case of meningococcal meningitis, the incubation period varies between one and 10 days, but, in general, does not exceed four. Meningitis may initially manifest as vomiting, nausea, muscle pain, fever, headache, cold extremities and skin rashes that persist under pressure. These begin as small spots and progress to resemble bruises, which means that blood has passed from the vessels to the tissues under the skin. In babies, meningitis can be manifested by crying, a more prominent fontanelle, difficulty waking up, limp or very stiff limbs, refusal to feed, difficult breathing and a skin rash. In older children, there may be stiff neck, joint pain, drowsiness or confusion, photophobia, chills with cold extremities, and rash. //Causes// Although the causes of meningitis are diverse, viral infections are, in fact, the most common. Bacterial meningitis is generally acquired from the environment through the airways and, as such, is very contagious. Other possible causes include trauma with skull fracture, brain surgery, some types of cancer, ear infections and mastoiditis, or the use of certain drugs. The type of bacteria that causes meningitis varies in different age groups. Streptococci and other gram-negative bacteria are common in newborns, but in older children, meningococcus and pneumococcus predominate. In Portugal, serogroup B of Neisseria meningitidis is the main responsible for the invasive disease. The introduction of the conjugate vaccine against meningococcus C in the National Vaccination Plan, in 2006, allowed an important reduction in the incidence of meningococcus C meningitis. The vaccine against meningococcus B is recommended by the Portuguese Society of Pediatrics, but is not yet mandatory, except for some risk groups. Other meningococci such as A, W and Y also have a vaccine that gives them protection. Pneumococcal meningitis is associated with a high mortality rate and serious sequelae. The pneumococcal vaccine has been available since 2001 and was included in the National Vaccination Schedule in 2015, which represents an important step in the fight against this disease. In Portugal, there was a clear decrease in the number of cases of pneumococcal disease caused by the serotypes included in the vaccine. Invasive disease caused by Haemophilus influenzae is caused by strains that belong, in most cases, to type B. After the start of universal vaccination, the incidence of this agent decreased significantly. //Diagnosis// It is based on the clinical history, medical examination and additional tests. Of these, the most important are blood tests and lumbar puncture, which allows the collection and analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid that circulates around the brain and spinal cord, under the meninges. This is by far the most important test. //Treatment// Treatment depends on age, severity of the disease, the causal agent and the presence of other associated pathologies. Viral meningitis, which is much more common, resolves quickly without any treatment. In bacterial cases, treatment is essential and involves hospitalization, antibiotics and supportive medications. This type can invade the bloodstream, causing a generalized infection (septicemia) and should be considered a medical emergency. //Prevention// There are several vaccines that prevent meningitis caused by meningococcus, pneumococcus and Haemophilus and that are administered in childhood. Some are included in the National Immunization Program, being free, and others must be purchased. The doctor should always be consulted when planning the various vaccines available to prevent meningitis.

Menopause,"//What is it?// Menopause corresponds to the end of spontaneous menstruation and can be confirmed after 12 consecutive months without any menstrual period. It is a natural and perfectly normal biological process in a woman's life. This period signals the end of fertility. In the Western world, the average age at which women reach menopause is 51.4 years, and it can occur between 40 and 58 years. Some cases occur very early, around 30, and others occur later, around 60 years of age. It is estimated that the average age at which spontaneous menopause occurs in the Portuguese population is around 48 years. Although average life expectancy has increased, the age at menopause has remained constant. This is a reduction in the activity of the ovaries, which stops releasing eggs monthly. At the same time, estrogens begin to be produced in smaller quantities. This new hormonal environment, when it occurs suddenly, causes more intense symptoms than if it occurs gradually, more slowly. The first expression of a significant reduction in the function of ovarian follicles is the appearance of menstrual irregularities, which can last for several years. Initially, the cycles become shorter, maintaining some regularity; later, they become irregular, with cycles of very variable duration occurring. Amenorrhea (i.e., absence of normal menstruation) appears after some time, when ovarian failure occurs, due to the total consumption of its follicles. Although it is a normal process, the changes associated with menopause have an important impact on several aspects of a woman's life, and can make this stage a very difficult period. //Symptoms// The symptoms result, fundamentally, from the lack of estrogen that manifests itself in various organs and systems. The earliest ones result from vasomotor, psychological and genitourinary disorders. Vasomotor disorders correspond to “hot flashes” and sweating and are the most common complaints, affecting around 60% to 80% of women, and tend to be more intense in the first two years, ending spontaneously five years after menopause. Hot flashes manifest as a wave of heat that mainly affects the upper half of the body followed, after a few minutes, by cold sweats. They are accompanied by an increase in frequency and can be associated with vertigo. They are neither controllable by the woman nor predictable. Psychological disorders include difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep, as well as morning insomnia. There may be symptoms of depression, although an association between depression and menopause has not yet been clearly defined. Genito-urinary disorders result in atrophy of the vaginal mucosa with dryness that causes irritation and pain associated with sexual intercourse. There is also a greater tendency to urinary infections. This situation can reduce a woman's libido and self-esteem, harming life as a couple. Later symptoms of menopause occur at the brain, skin, joint, cardiovascular, bone and weight levels. These include a higher incidence of Alzheimer's disease and strokes, less elasticity of the skin, with the more intense appearance of “wrinkles”, more joint complaints, especially in the hands, a higher incidence of acute myocardial infarction in women From the age of 50, there is an increase in the occurrence of osteoporosis and weight gain. Decreased estrogen levels further increase the risk of retinal disease, glaucoma and colon cancer. //Causes// This is a normal process related to age. However, there are several factors that can influence its onset. Smoking, lack of pregnancy, exposure to toxic chemicals, antidepressants and epilepsy are other factors associated with early menopause. On the other hand, having several pregnancies, being overweight and having a high IQ in childhood are related to the later onset of menopause. Genetics can play an important role in this entire process. Radiotherapy, chemotherapy, premature ovarian failure, in which a woman stops producing hormones before the age of 40, smoking and hypothyroidism are other causes of earlier menopause. //Diagnosis// This diagnosis is essentially clinical: a woman between 45 and 52 years of age, with no normal menstruation for at least one year, with no identifiable cause for this amenorrhea, or with menstrual irregularities and vasomotor disorders, is certainly in the menopause phase. Hormone levels are of limited value, as hormones are secreted in peaks and present large variations at this stage. However, they are important in specific cases. //Control symptoms// For many women, no treatment is necessary because the symptoms tend to go away on their own or because they can tolerate them without much discomfort. Controlling the symptoms of menopause involves the use of low-dose contraceptives that reduce hot flashes, vaginal dryness and mood swings. In addition to hormonal treatments, medications from other classes can be used to control symptoms. The choice of medication should always be individualized and defined by the doctor. Introducing changes in lifestyle and diet, practicing physical exercise, and reducing stress levels are some strategies that can alleviate typical symptoms. It is important to stop smoking, as smokers begin menopause one to two years earlier than non-smokers. Tobacco also contributes to heart disease and osteoporosis. Taking calcium and vitamin D supplements can protect against osteoporosis. When menopause occurs before the age of 40, it is considered premature, which can happen for genetic reasons or other factors. It is necessary to understand the reasons that lead to the absence of menstruation in a woman of childbearing age, as amenorrhea can be a symptom of a health problem. Abnormal uterine bleeding can occur at any age, but it requires proper evaluation and treatment due to the risk of anemia and other complications.

Ringworm,"//What is it?// Mycoses are infections caused by fungi that affect the skin, nails and hair and are present in all places, and can be found in soil and animals. Even on human skin there are several species of fungi that, under normal conditions, do not cause disease. Keratin is a substance that is present on the surface of the skin, nails and hair, and constitutes a source of nutrients for these fungi which, whenever they find conditions favorable to their growth, reproduce and start to cause the disease. These conditions, which alter the balance between the fungus and its host, can be heat, humidity, a decrease in defenses or the long-term use of antibiotics. Basically, they are opportunistic infections, because these fungi only cause disease when there is a weakness in the host. There are several types of superficial mycoses, the most common being pityriasis versicolor, ringworm, candidiasis and onychomycosis. Apithyriasis versicolor is a chronic disease that appears and disappears cyclically and is universally distributed. The fungus that causes it belongs to the Malassezia genus and is more common in adolescents and young people. The typical appearance of pityriasis versicolor is the presence of white patches on the skin, with scaling, located on the upper part of the arms, trunk, neck and face. These can be grouped or isolated. More rarely, these spots are dark or reddish. In these cases, it is possible that the skin does not recover its normal pigmentation or that it takes many months after treating the infection for this to happen;;/ Mycoses are another set of superficial mycoses caused by different types of fungi. They can affect the feet (athlete's foot), scalp, nails, beard or any other part of the body and appear in the form of red, peeling spots with a well-defined contour and the formation of blisters or crusts. The most common complaint is itching, which can be very intense or even painful. Injuries caused by scratching can infect them;;/ In the case of Candidiasis, the infection is caused by fungi of the Candida genus. This genus can cause superficial and deep mycoses, which are more serious. Some of its forms of presentation are ""thrush"" in newborns, which takes the form of whitish plaques on the oral mucosa, fissures in the corners of the mouth, more common in the elderly, or the formation of delimited red plaque lesions that present a whitish exudation with fissures at the level of the skin folds, such as the inframammary, axillary or inguinal folds. These infections are also referred to as intertriginous or intertrigo. Mycoses caused by fungi of the genus Candida tend to cause itching or burning. When this fungus affects the nails, it tends to grow at their base, causing painful inflammation with the formation of pus. Nails may turn white or yellow and stand out from the finger.;/ Onychomycosis can affect toenails and fingernails. They are more common after the age of 55 and are rare in childhood. Infected nails have a different color and become deformed and thickened, and may become detached from their bed.;/ //Symptoms// Often, the first signs of mycosis are very subtle and can result in the appearance of spots, blisters, cracks, scales or itching. The development pattern then depends on the type of fungus, its location and the general condition of the patient. //Causes// These fungi are present in the most diverse places, including on human skin where, under normal conditions, they do not cause any disturbance. When these fungi find favorable conditions for their growth, they reproduce and cause disease. It is therefore an opportunistic infection, in which anything that can reduce the host's defenses becomes a potential cause of mycosis. Diabetes, prolonged use of oral antibiotics and any pathology or treatment that affects the normal functioning of the immune system stand out due to their frequency. //Diagnosis// The initial diagnosis of mycosis results from the clinical history and medical examination, but it is the direct examination of samples obtained from lesions on the skin, nails or mucosa that allows a more accurate diagnosis that can guide treatment. This material can be cultivated in the laboratory for a better characterization of the fungus involved, but the process is slow. //Treatment// It depends on the type and severity of the mycosis: Treatment of pityriasis versicolor can be done with topical or oral antifungal medications;;/ For ringworm, it is done with antifungal creams. The most common active ingredients are miconazole, clotrimazole, econazole and ketoconazole;;/ Superficial Candida mycoses are easily cured by using antifungal creams or lotions. The cream should usually be applied for seven to 10 days. As this is an opportunistic infection, it is essential to identify the underlying factors and try to correct them in order to prevent further episodes.;/ In onychomycosis, local or oral medications are used. These nail mycoses are the most difficult and time-consuming to treat, and can last more than 12 months. Stopping treatment prematurely can lead to failure.;/ //Prevention// Adopting adequate hygiene habits is important in this prevention. Given the widespread presence of these fungi and their opportunistic nature, it is essential to take measures that, on the one hand, avoid direct contact with the fungus and, on the other, reduce the development of conditions conducive to its multiplication. Therefore, after bathing, the skin must be thoroughly dried, especially the skin folds and toes, in order to avoid moisture that facilitates the growth of fungi. For the same reason, it is important to avoid keeping wet clothes on for long periods, avoid warm, tight clothing and closed shoes in summer, not wear other people's clothing or personal objects, not use manicure materials that are not properly disinfected, and not go barefoot on damp floors or where other people frequent. The use of antibiotics must be subject to medical prescription and the duration of use must be respected. Diabetes control is also essential. And if there are pets, it is important to detect and treat any changes to their skin or fur. Finally, whenever moving on land, gloves should be worn.

Multiple myeloma,"//What is it?// Multiple myeloma (also known simply as myeloma) is a cancer originating in the plasma cells of the bone marrow. Mutations in plasma cell genes can turn them into myeloma, and unlike normal plasma cells, myeloma cells produce new cells that are not needed and do not die when old or damaged. Myeloma cells successively make more copies of themselves. As a result, a group of myeloma cells is formed, all with the same genetic defect. Myeloma cells are diseased plasma cells that still produce immunoglobulins. These immunoglobulins are ineffective, they are all the same and are called monoclonal because they originate from the same clone, accumulate in the blood and are eliminated through the urine. Therefore, in a patient with multiple myeloma, a blood test is very important to find these immunoglobulins. //Prevention// There are no prevention or screening strategies for multiple myeloma. Your doctor will be monitoring your routine blood tests and any symptoms you may have. //Risk Factors// Any behavior or condition that increases your risk of developing a disease is a risk factor. Just because one or more risk factors apply to you, it does not necessarily mean that you will develop multiple myeloma. Similarly, multiple myeloma can occur in individuals who have no known risk factors. The causes of multiple myeloma have not yet been found, but some risk factors are known. The main risk factors are as follows: Age - The majority of multiple myeloma diagnoses occur in individuals over 65 years of age; Being male - The incidence is higher in men, although the reasons for this are not known; Personal history of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance - This pathology is not malignant in nature and is a laboratory finding of an abnormal immunoglobulin, and occurs when some plasma cells produce immunoglobulins that are all the same (monoclonal). It may evolve into myeloma over years or decades. It is not treatable and the level of immunoglobulins should be monitored; Family history of multiple myeloma - Studies indicate that the risk increases if you have direct family members with a history of the disease. //Symptoms// The symptoms of multiple myeloma are not exclusive, they can appear in other diseases. Just because you have one or more of the symptoms described here does not mean you have multiple myeloma. In healthy individuals, there are enough normal blood cells to produce antibodies. In a patient with myeloma, there is a deficit of normal blood cells produced when the marrow is full of myeloma cells. Likewise, normal antibodies are fewer in quantity than the defective monoclonal antibodies produced by myeloma cells. Symptoms of myeloma may include: Fatigue and lack of strength – fatigue and lack of strength are symptoms of anemia, or a low number of red blood cells. Anemia can be caused by the bone marrow being occupied by too many myeloma cells, which reduces the production of red blood cells;;/  Bruising or bleeding easily from wounds or other trauma – Platelets help repair wounds and stop bleeding by creating clots. Bruising or bleeding easily is a symptom of low platelet counts.;/  Frequent infections and fever – Fever is a sign that the body is trying to fight an infection. Fevers and frequent infections are symptoms of altered immunity that can occur due to a low number of white blood cells, or due to changes in the quantity and quality of monoclonal antibodies that do not effectively combat infections;;/  Bone injuries and pain – myeloma can cause injuries to the bones and these can be painful and cause fractures. The regions most frequently affected by myeloma are the spine, skull and pelvis. And the most frequent location of fracture is in the vertebrae;;/  Kidney malfunction- the kidneys are a pair of organs that filter the blood in order to remove metabolic waste, and are often affected by the immunoglobulins produced by myeloma.;/  Intense thirst, nausea and/or constipation – symptoms that can be caused by poor kidney function, as mentioned in the previous item;;/  Weight loss – a common symptom of oncological diseases in general.;/ //Who should I contact?// If myeloma is suspected, due to symptoms or a complementary diagnostic test that shows changes, a Clinical Hematologist should be consulted. Meet our team of experts Make your contact request so we can follow up from the first moment. If you prefer, you can schedule an appointment via our toll-free line. It is important to distinguish between isolated or solitary plasmacytoma and multiple myeloma. Plasmacytoma is an accumulation of diseased plasma cells in a single bone location, usually a vertebra. Multiple myeloma is a disease in which there are diseased plasma cells that cause multiple bone lesions, in addition to changes in the functioning of the bone marrow, caused by the occupation of the marrow by these diseased cells. //Diagnosis and Staging// The tests most frequently used to diagnose multiple myeloma are: Blood tests – the aim is to measure the level of dysfunctional immunoglobulins in the blood, the level of red blood cells to identify anemia, white blood cells and platelets. The level of calcium in the blood and creatinine are also analyzed, as an indicator of kidney function; Urine analysis – to identify the presence of abnormal immunoglobulins in the kidneys; Skeletal imaging exams – imaging exams, namely radiography, are used to check for possible fractures or reduction in thickness; Iliac bone biopsy and myelogram – these procedures that can be done together consist of removing a small fragment of iliac bone or aspiration of bone marrow contents. It is a procedure performed by a hematologist or oncologist, with the individual lying face down, using local anesthesia. It is not a very painful procedure and is essential in diagnosing this disease. Only observation under a microscope of the cells collected in the biopsy and myelogram by Pathological Anatomy can confirm the diagnosis of multiple myeloma. Staging is the process by which we assess the extent to which myeloma has spread to various bones and the impact the disease has on the body. The information obtained through the staging process determines the stage of the disease, which is essential for treatment to be planned. When the diagnosis of multiple myeloma is confirmed through a bone biopsy and a myelogram, the next step is to stage the disease through blood tests that include analysis of albumin and beta 2 microglobulin, as well as imaging tests such as CT scan and Magnetic Resonance Imaging to assess the state of the bone structure. Based on the diagnostic tests performed, myeloma staging can be classified as follows: Stage I - multiple myeloma causes the first symptoms; blood tests show mild anemia and the presence of low levels of dysfunctional immunoglobulin; calcium levels are normal and radiological examinations of the bones do not indicate any lesions; Stage II – multiple myeloma has progressed, presenting symptoms intermediate between stage I and stage III; Stage III – blood tests indicate anemia below 8.5, high calcium levels and high levels of dysfunctional immunoglobulins; radiological examinations show more than 3 lesions in the bones. //Treatment// The multidisciplinary clinical team will assess the best treatment to follow. Treatments for multiple myeloma may include systemic therapy such as chemotherapy, thalidomide therapy, cortisone, radiotherapy and bone marrow transplant. The modalities to be used vary from case to case, but generally all patients receive systemic therapy. Most patients under the age of 65 are candidates for a bone marrow transplant, and in some cases radiotherapy can be used to treat a more affected bone. If the patient has subclinical or Stage I multiple myeloma, he or she may decide with his or her doctor not to undergo treatment before showing symptoms, but rather maintain surveillance. Although this decision may avoid or delay treatment, it increases the risk of not being able to control the disease before it progresses. The patient should discuss the pros and cons of it with their doctor and decide the best option for their case. Monitoring for multiple myeloma includes consultations with the doctor who treated you and blood tests. Multiple myeloma is generally treated and followed by hematologists. Imaging tests and myelogram or bone biopsy may be necessary to make sure that the myeloma remains inactive. Blood is composed of plasma and three types of elements: platelets, red blood cells and white blood cells. Platelets help prevent bleeding, red blood cells carry oxygen to all areas of the body and white blood cells are cells that form our immune system and help fight infections. Blood cells are produced in the bone marrow - a tissue of the blood system that lies at the centre of most bones. It is in the bone marrow that the so-called stem cells and all the other blood cells in various stages of formation are found, from which all blood cells are produced. Many classes of white blood cells are formed from a stem cell. One such class is B lymphocytes, which become plasma cells when a bacterium or virus (microorganism) invades the body. In a healthy person, fewer than 5 out of 100 cells in the bone marrow are plasma cells. In normal bone marrow there are plasma cells, cells that produce antibodies - also called immunoglobulins - which are proteins that cling to bacteria and viruses in order to help the body eliminate them. Each type of plasma cell makes only one  antibody against a specific antigen, designed to attack a specific type of microorganism that is causing a disease. There are 5 types of antibodies, and they all differ from each other in the way they fight infections. Some are more present in the blood, others are more present in other places, such as secretions. Without the necessary diversity of plasma cells to produce antibodies, the body cannot fight infectious diseases.

Myoma,"//What is it?// A uterine fibroid (also called fibroid, leiomyoma or fibromyoma) is a benign tumor that grows in the tissue of the uterus and is very rare to become malignant. It may be isolated or several small ones may appear, occurring in around 20% to 50% of women of childbearing age. Depending on the location, fibroids can be intramural, subserous or submucosal. The first, which grow in the wall of the uterus, are the most common. The second are located in the endometrium, and tend to cause more blood loss. The third ones grow on the outer wall of the uterus. In many cases, myoma can go unnoticed without manifestations. In around 30% of women, they cause symptoms such as abnormal uterine bleeding, very heavy and prolonged periods, which can lead to anemia. The risk of developing them increases with age, family history, eating habits and obesity. In Portugal, uterine fibroids affect between 30% and 60% of the female population in general. In women of reproductive age the incidence is between 20% and 40%. But it is estimated that around two million have this condition. //Symptoms// The most common symptoms are pain in the back of the legs, a feeling of pain or pressure in the pelvic region, heavy and prolonged menstrual periods and blood loss between periods, constipation or gas due to compression of the abdomen, an increase in volume that can be confused with excess weight or pregnancy, pain during sexual intercourse, pressure in the bladder with a constant feeling of needing to urinate, incontinence or inability to empty the bladder. Sometimes, they can cause polyps to grow in the endometrium, which worsens pain and menstrual bleeding. If these are abundant and prolonged, anemia can occur, with fatigue, difficulty breathing and paleness. Fibroids can interfere with the implantation of fertilized eggs, causing infertility. During pregnancy, they can affect the blood flow to the placenta, causing miscarriage or premature birth. Pregnancy has a variable and unpredictable effect on the growth of fibroids, but they rarely increase during pregnancy. //Causes// Its causes have not yet been identified. It is known that they develop in women of reproductive age and that they do not appear before the body is capable of producing estrogens. Fibroids grow faster when the body receives additional doses of estrogen. After menopause, they stop growing and begin to reduce their size, due to the loss of this hormone. All of these elements suggest that the hormonal environment is important in the development of this disease. Genetic factors also play an important role in the development of uterine fibroids. In fact, first-degree relatives of women with fibroids have a two and a half times greater risk of developing them. //Diagnosis// The diagnosis is based on a gynecological examination and tests such as ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging, which make it possible to confirm the presence, location and size of the fibroid. //Treatment// Treatment depends on several factors, such as age, general health, severity of symptoms, personal history and location of the fibroids. In the absence of symptoms, the doctor may decide not to treat and maintain regular monitoring. In the past, the most common treatment was removal of the uterus (hysterectomy). There are now other options. As a rule, therapy is indicated when the fibroid grows to the point of compressing other organs, such as the bladder, when it grows very quickly, when it causes abnormal bleeding or when it is associated with infertility. Treatments may include hormones that, used in combination, help to reduce its size before surgery. Fibroids can be removed through the uterus (hysteroscopy), by laparoscopy (insertion of surgical instruments through small holes in the abdomen) or by open surgery, when they are larger. In this case, the walls of the uterus may become weakened, making it necessary to have a caesarean section in a subsequent pregnancy. Removing the fibroid while preserving the uterus is important for women who wish to become pregnant, but in about 25% of cases, the disease may reappear. When it is necessary to remove the entire uterus (hysterectomy), the woman can no longer become pregnant. //Prevention// Although researchers continue to study their causes, little scientific evidence is available on how to prevent them. Preventing uterine fibroids may not be possible. However, by making healthy lifestyle choices, such as maintaining a normal weight and eating fruits and vegetables, you can lower your risk. Some studies suggest that the use of oral contraceptives may be associated with a lower risk of fibroids. Mayo Clinic Yes, they can, but not always. There are several types of uterine fibroids and not all of them influence a woman's ability to get pregnant. Abnormal uterine bleeding can occur at any age, but it requires proper evaluation and treatment due to the risk of anemia and other complications.

Myopia,"//What is it?// Myopia, like astigmatism and hyperopia, corresponds to a refractive error, that is, a change in the morphology of the eyeball that affects the way images are formed and transmitted to the brain. In this case, the eyeball is larger than normal or the cornea, its most anterior layer, is more curved than it should be. In either situation, the images focus in front of the retina and become blurred. This refractive error is very common, affecting around 20% to 30% of the world's population. Its prevalence varies with age, race and sex. It increases in the first decades of life, particularly during late childhood and adolescence. It is present in 1% of children at age five, increasing to 8% at age 10 and 15% at age 15. It is slightly more common in females. In Portugal it is estimated that around 20% of children and half of the adult population suffer from significant refractive errors, including myopia and astigmatism. //Symptoms// Myopia determines a reduction in the quality of distance vision. In a child, this decrease may go unnoticed, especially if it affects only one eye. Near vision is not achieved, except in cases of very high myopia. Children may complain of headaches, tiredness, their school performance may suffer and they tend to get too close to the television or objects. As in many situations these symptoms are not noticeable, it is essential to have an ophthalmology consultation around the age of three to detect the presence of astigmatism, myopia or hyperopia and, if necessary, correct it. In adults, complaints are more obvious because visual difficulties are easily detected and correspond to headaches, eye fatigue or fatigue when driving. //Causes// Its exact cause is not known. As a rule, it is present from birth and is almost always associated with astigmatism. Although its basis is essentially genetic, myopia can appear after trauma or eye surgery. Some eye diseases, such as keratoconus, in which the cornea becomes progressively thinner, are associated with high degrees of myopia. There are several risk factors for its appearance in a child. A family history is a very important indicator. Its prevalence in the presence of a myopic parent is 20% to 40% and with both myopic parents it is 30% to 60%. Excessive use of near vision, which includes frequent and regular reading, apparently also constitutes a risk factor, although this fact has not been fully proven and is still quite controversial. In most cases it presents in a simple form that increases during childhood and adolescence at a variable rate, not exceeding six diopters. Degenerative myopia is rarer, corresponds to values ​​greater than six diopters and is associated with greater visual difficulty and changes in the retina that can cause complications, such as detachment. Glaucoma is also more common in these patients. //Diagnosis// In an ophthalmology consultation, there are several devices that allow for rapid detection and quantification of myopia. Even in children who do not yet cooperate with normal vision tests, there are alternatives that allow for an accurate diagnosis. In this consultation, the entire eyeball is assessed in order to study its characteristics and to exclude possible causes of myopia as well as other eye diseases. //Treatment// Mild forms, which do not significantly interfere with vision, do not require treatment. When it is high and/or when it affects the quality of vision, it is important to correct it using glasses, contact lenses or refractive surgery. Glasses are the ideal solution for children up to the age of 15. For people over 40, progressive lenses with different graduations across their surface may be necessary. Contact lenses can be used from the age of 15 as long as there are no contraindications, such as the presence of allergies, lack of tears, intense exposure to smoke or very dry environments. Its use requires rigor, hygiene and discipline, and regular medical monitoring is important to ensure the prompt detection and correction of any anomalies resulting from its use. There are several types of contact lenses and selecting the most appropriate one always depends on a prior medical evaluation. Both glasses and contact lenses compensate for refractive error but do not cure it or prevent its progression. Refractive surgery is recommended for people with myopia who are over 18 years old and have had a stable prescription for at least 12 months. Not everyone can undergo this type of intervention, so a prior medical study of each case is essential. This surgery, when performed using a laser, allows the surface of the cornea to be shaped and surface errors corresponding to myopia to be corrected. This is a simple procedure, carried out under local anesthesia, lasting 15 to 20 minutes and allowing normal vision in less than 24 hours. Even in the presence of a combined condition of astigmatism and myopia or astigmatism and hyperopia, this surgery allows reliable and safe results. An alternative to laser is the placement of a lens inside the eyeball to compensate for myopia.  //What is the prognosis for myopia?// Although myopia can change over time, making it necessary to update your glasses or contact lens prescription, it is a benign process with no permanent implications for vision. The exceptions are cases of degenerative myopia, which can be associated with complications such as glaucoma or retinal detachment and therefore deserve more regular observation. Children under the age of five or six are an exception. If there is significant myopia present from the first years of life and not corrected until that age, a condition called amblyopia, the common “lazy eye”, may occur, which implies interruption of the normal development of vision. This interruption, after this age, tends to become permanent and irreversible. Hence the need for a first consultation for all children around the age of three, in order to ensure that any type of refractive error is promptly diagnosed and corrected before the onset of amblyopia. //Prevention// It is present from birth and although its exact cause is unknown, it is known that there is a genetic basis for its occurrence. Therefore, it is not possible to prevent it.

Molluscum contagiosum,"//What is it?// Molluscum contagiosum is a common and contagious skin viral infection caused by a virus, very common in children, especially those with atopic eczema, although it can sometimes also appear in adults. It causes raised nodules or papules with a depressed center, similar to pearls, white, pink or yellowish in color. The virus mainly affects children under 15 years of age. The papules are usually painless and do not itch. They can affect any area of ​​the skin, but are usually found on the trunk, arms and legs. They usually heal without intervention within six to 12 months and do not leave scars. In less common cases, it can take up to four years for the cure to occur. It is not serious or has any impact on general health and, therefore, is not included in the legal list of diseases that result in mandatory school exclusion. //Symptoms// Molluscum contagiosum manifests itself through the appearance of small, skin-colored or slightly yellowish spots. The size varies between the head of a pin and three millimeters. They can affect any location, face, trunk or limbs, and vary in number between half a dozen and dozens of lesions. //Causes// Molluscum contagiosum is contracted through direct contact, usually in humid environments such as swimming pools or changing rooms. Humidity softens the skin and facilitates the penetration of the virus. //Diagnosis// The diagnosis of molluscum contagiosum is based on the characteristic appearance of the lesion. In case of doubt, a skin biopsy can be performed to confirm the diagnosis. //Treatment// There is no specific treatment. Normally the initial approach is with corrosive products. Its application is intended to destroy the molluscs and cause some irritation around the lesions. This will help the child's body to create defenses against the virus, facilitating its elimination and protecting it from future reinfections. If this method fails, local anesthesia is performed with the application of anesthetic creams and the molluscs are removed by scraping. //Prevention// This condition can be prevented by avoiding direct contact with the skin lesions of an infected person. Treating the underlying eczema in children can help prevent the spread of molluscum contagiosum. Sharing towels and bathing suits should be avoided. In situations of sexual transmission, prevention must be carried out with the use of condoms.

Open bite,"//What is it?// Open bite is a type of malocclusion characterized by misalignment and lack of contact between the upper and lower dental arches when the mouth closes. Open bite malocclusion is one of the most challenging orthodontic problems. Its prevalence varies from 1.5% to 11% according to chronological and dental age. It is a type of malocclusion with a multifactorial cause and its approach is not limited to strict mechanical treatment. This condition is based on muscular, bone and dental changes associated with incorrect habits. //Symptoms// The main characteristic of this condition is the alteration of dental alignment conditioned by the anterior projection of the upper and lower incisor teeth associated with the impossibility of closing the space between both arches when the mouth is closed. //Causes// Open bite is mainly caused by four factors: Sucking your thumb or pacifier, creating tension forces that cause misalignment of the teeth;/ Speaking or swallowing by pushing the tongue between the upper and lower front teeth;/ Temporomandibular joint disorders that can cause chronic jaw pain;/ Change in the facial skeleton that is the result of non-simultaneous growth of the upper and lower jaws. This factor is generally influenced by genetics.;/ //Diagnosis// The diagnosis of open bite is based on the evaluation of the jaws and upper and lower dental arches, observation of the dynamics of mouth opening and closing and inspection of the oral cavity. The evaluation involves: Complete clinical and dental history;/ Clinical examination of the oral cavity and facial skeleton;/ X-rays of the teeth and jaw;/ Study of dental alignment made with molds;/ //Treatment// As many treatments are available, it is up to the specialist to recommend specific therapy taking into account age and the presence or absence of baby teeth. Methods include: Behavioral modification;/ Mechanical treatment, such as braces or Invisalign;/ Surgery;/ When open bite occurs in children who still have most of their baby teeth, it may resolve on its own by stopping the causative factors such as prolonged pacifier use and thumb sucking. If it occurs when permanent teeth are replacing baby teeth but the process is not yet complete, behavior modification may be the best recourse. It involves therapy to correct the pressure of the tongue on the jaw. If the adult teeth are growing in the same open bite pattern as the baby teeth, the placement of custom orthodontic devices may be indicated. For people with fully grown adult teeth, a combination of braces and behavior modification is often suggested. In severe cases, jaw surgery may be recommended to reposition the jaw. Other treatments include wearing a special appliance to limit the tongue's ability to push against the front teeth and wearing a guard that applies tension to pressure the jaws into realigning into the correct position. //Prevention// Some causes of open bite can be prevented, such as avoiding thumb or pacifier sucking; and speaking or swallowing by pushing the tongue between the upper and lower front teeth.

Crossbite,"//What is it?// Anterior crossbite is defined as a malocclusion resulting from the posterior retroclination (in the lingual direction) of the upper incisor teeth in relation to the lower incisor teeth that are vertical. It may have a muscular and skeletal component. Different techniques have been used to correct it. //Symptoms// Patients with anterior crossbite present occlusion alterations resulting from poor upper vs. lower dental alignment. The cause may originally be dental or skeletal, the latter being the most frequent (e.g. mandibular prognathism or developmental alterations in the midface). //Causes// There are several causes of an open bite: Genetics;/ Delayed change of teeth or abnormal eruption of permanent teeth;/ Prolonged thumb or pacifier sucking;/ Anomalies of swallowing dynamics;/ //Diagnosis// The diagnosis of crossbite involves the assessment of changes in jaw and dental alignment carried out by an oral and dental health specialist. //Treatment// Depending on the changes diagnosed, several treatment methods are available to correct anterior dental crossbite. The most common are fixed or removable palatal expanders associated with dental alignment devices. //Prevention// Following the causes of crossbite, prevention essentially involves changing finger or pacifier sucking habits, as well as changing the habit of projecting the tongue against the teeth during swallowing.

Narcolepsy,"//What is it?// Narcolepsy is a neurological disease characterized by episodes of daytime hypersomnia accompanied by sleep disturbances. It is a type of hypersomnia. It corresponds to a neurological change in which sleep and wake control are affected. It is characterized by excessive sleepiness during the day, with intermittent and uncontrollable episodes of falling asleep. Although, in itself, it does not have serious health consequences, it is associated with feelings of fear and anxiety and increases the risk of potentially fatal accidents. As such, its impact on quality of life is very significant. The diagnosis of this pathology is often late and patients are labeled with other disorders, namely psychiatric or neurological. Its prevalence in Europe is three to five per 10,000 inhabitants, and is most common between the second and third decades of life. The manifestations of narcolepsy usually begin early, in adolescence or young adulthood, and tend to persist throughout life. //Symptoms// In narcolepsy, patients experience sleep attacks at any time and are only temporarily able to resist the urge to sleep. These episodes can occur during any type of activity and at any time, but attacks are more likely to occur in monotonous situations, such as uninteresting meetings or long drives on the highway. Awakening from this narcoleptic sleep is as easy as from normal sleep. The person may feel good when they wake up and go back to sleep a few minutes later. There may be one or several attacks per day and each one is not very long, lasting an hour or less. Sometimes, momentary paralysis without loss of consciousness (cataplexy) occurs in response to sudden emotional situations. In these cases, the patient's extremities appear weak, and they may drop what they are holding or fall. Another manifestation of narcolepsy is the occurrence of sporadic episodes of sleep paralysis in which the patient feels, immediately after waking up, that he or she wants to move but is unable to, which gives rise to feelings of fear and anxiety. Visual or auditory hallucinations may occur at the beginning of sleep or, less frequently, upon waking, which are similar to those experienced during normal sleep, although more intense. In general, few patients with narcolepsy, around 10%, present all of these symptoms; most report only a few. //Causes// The cause of narcolepsy is a deficiency of the neurotransmitter orexin (also called hypocretin) in the hypothalamus. A deficiency of this neurotransmitter leads to excessive sleepiness. This disorder usually occurs in people with other cases in the family, which suggests a genetic predisposition. On the other hand, some tests have revealed the presence of anomalies in various brain regions in these patients that may contribute to the development of narcolepsy symptoms. The most common secondary causes of narcolepsy are: Head injuries;/ Multiple sclerosis;/ Parkinson's disease;/ Sarcoidosis;/ //Diagnosis// Although the diagnosis is usually based on symptoms, it is important to emphasize that their presence does not necessarily indicate the presence of narcolepsy. Cataplexy, sleep paralysis and hallucinations are common in young children and sometimes in healthy adults who do not have other sleep disorders. If the doctor has doubts about the diagnosis, the patient may be referred to a sleep study laboratory. Recording the electrical activity of the brain through an electroencephalogram can help with this diagnosis. Before proceeding with other studies, objective and subjective sleep monitoring should be performed for 1 week (sleep diary). Narcolepsy is a disease in which no structural changes in the brain or abnormalities are observed in blood tests, so this type of test will not be useful. //Treatment// Although there is no cure for narcolepsy, some lifestyle changes may be helpful: going to bed and waking up at the same time every day; keep the room dark, at a pleasant temperature, with a comfortable bed and pillow; avoid caffeine, alcohol and heavy meals before bed; do not smoke; try to relax (hot bath, read a book) before bed; practice physical exercise regularly. Taking short naps during the day when you are most tired can also be beneficial. It is important to inform teachers or colleagues of the existence of this condition and, if necessary, try to obtain psychological support to reduce the stress associated with narcolepsy. It may also be safer not to drive. For relief from narcolepsy, stimulant medications such as ephedrine, amphetamines, dextroamphetamine, and methylphenidate are sometimes prescribed. All of these drugs must be subject to strict medical control when starting treatment. Imipramine, an antidepressant, is the drug of choice in the treatment of cataplexy. //Prevention// Narcolepsy cannot be prevented, but treatment can reduce the number of attacks. On the other hand, it is important to identify and avoid any situations that may trigger your attacks.

Femoral head necrosis,"//What is it?// Osteonecrosis, also known as avascular necrosis or aseptic necrosis, is a disease in which there is compromised blood circulation to the femoral head. Bone necrosis leads to weakening of the bone structure and eventually to the sinking of the femoral head and loss of its sphericity.  This problem affects individuals over the age of 30 and can have a major impact on quality of life, as many of the patients are young, so they need to change their work and leisure activities after diagnosis.  5% to 12% of total hip arthroplasties are performed in patients with NACF in which there is collapse and loss of sphericity of the femoral head. //Symptoms// The most common symptom is mechanical pain, referred to the groin, and may also be referred to the buttock or trochanteric region. //Diagnosis// An early diagnosis of osteonecrosis allows treatment at an early stage.  As with any other diagnosis, clinical history is decisive. A high level of suspicion is essential, especially if the patient has risk factors for this pathology.  Plain radiography should be the first step. Radiographic changes become visible some time after the onset of the disease and include cysts, sclerosis, or a crescent sign (sign of subchondral collapse of the necrotic segment) of the femoral head. Visualization of these changes is easier on the lateral view of the hip.   Bone scintigraphy with technesium 99 was widely used in high-risk patients with negative radiographic examinations. However, recent studies have shown that bone scintigraphy has limited value and is less sensitive than MRI.  Magnetic resonance imaging, due to its high sensitivity and specificity, is currently the imaging method of choice for the early diagnosis of osteonecrosis.  Computed tomography (CT) can identify collapse of the femoral head. //Treatment// The ultimate goal of treatment for avascular necrosis of the femoral head is preservation of the native hip. The etiology and progression of the disease is highly variable.   The non-surgical methods described are hyperbaric oxygen therapy and pharmacological therapy with bisphosphonates.  Possible surgical methods include decompression of the femoral head, vascularized fibular graft, osteotomies, non-vascularized graft and arthroplastic techniques. The aim of decompression of the femoral head is to reduce intraosseous pressure and stimulate vascular flow and bone regeneration at the femoral head by creating perforations in the femoral head through the neck. This technique is indicated in the early stages of the disease and before there is collapse of the femoral head. //Causes// Osteonecrosis may be associated with traumatic or non-traumatic causes.  Osteonecrosis of the femoral head secondary to trauma almost always involves a decoapted fracture of the femoral neck or a dislocation of the hip.  Osteonecrosis of a non-traumatic nature is associated with several situations: Use of corticosteroids;/ Excessive alcohol consumption;/ Hemoglobinopathies;/ Disbarismo;/ Gaucher disease;/ Intraosseous lipid deposition;/ HIV infection;/ Retroviral treatment;/ Hypersensitivity reactions;/ Situations related to the release of thromboplastin such as pregnancy, malignant tumors and inflammatory bowel diseases.;/ Having a cast on your arm or leg helps you recover from fractures and reduces pain.

Nephritis,"//What is it?// It is a term used to refer to the presence of inflammation of the kidneys. This is generally caused by an immunological reaction, when the body tries to defend itself against some aggression. Nephritis is responsible for 50% of kidney diseases. The kidneys are the organs that filter the blood, removing excess water, salts and metabolic products, maintaining proteins. When there are disturbances in its function, proteins are lost and tissue fluid accumulates. According to the level of severity, there are two types of nephritis: acute and chronic. In the first case, because it is a milder manifestation of the disease, with a tendency for spontaneous recovery. In the chronic form, there is progressive damage to the renal glomeruli. It can also result from an infection, such as pyelonephritis. The signs of nephritis depend on the type, location, and intensity of the immune reaction. However, the various disorders that damage the kidneys can produce different lesions, symptoms, and consequences. In general, inflammation does not affect the entire kidney. The resulting disease depends on inflammation basically affecting the glomeruli (the first part of the kidney's filtering system), the tubules and tissues surrounding the glomeruli or infrarenal blood vessels, causing vasculitis. //Symptoms// Its main symptoms are abdominal pain and fever, reduced urine volume and the presence of blood. There is also high blood pressure, edema (swelling in a region of the body or an organ caused by the abnormal accumulation of fluids), mainly in the eyes and/or legs, extreme fatigue, difficulty sleeping, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, itching and dry skin. Cramps may occur, especially at night. //Causes// One of its main causes is infections caused by any microorganism that forms a complex known as antigen-antibody that attaches to kidney tissues. Malaria, typhus, salmonella, toxoplasmosis, herpes, and other viruses and bacteria can cause these infections. Inappropriate use of antibiotics, anti-inflammatories and medications containing lithium, gold or captopril is another possible cause. Nephritis occurs more frequently in diabetics and in the presence of autoimmune pathologies, such as Lupus. //Diagnosis// Diagnosis begins by identifying symptoms and clinical examination. Laboratory studies allow us to characterize the type and severity of nephritis and can provide information about its cause. Kidney biopsy is the most effective and conclusive diagnostic method and should be performed whenever there are doubts or when the patient does not show clinical improvement. Imaging studies, such as ultrasound, may also be useful. Renal scintigraphy is used in some cases. //Treatment// Treatment is different for the acute and chronic forms of nephritis. In the case of acute cases, rest and some caution regarding excess water and salt are generally sufficient. If it is caused by an infection, the use of an antibiotic may be important. In chronic forms, it is very variable, depending on its type, its severity and the presence of other associated diseases. In some cases, the use of corticosteroids or other medications is very important. As well as a diet with restricted protein, potassium and salt. Likewise, blood pressure control is relevant for all forms of nephritis in order to prevent deterioration of kidney function. When there is fluid retention, diuretics may be helpful. //Prevention// An early diagnosis helps prevent many of its complications. Adequate control of blood pressure, diabetes and weight are essential aspects, as is not smoking and maintaining a healthy diet. It is very important not to take medications without a prescription, as many cases of nephritis are due to the effects of drugs. ProRim, 2013 Manual Merck online Charles M.

Vagus nerve,"//What is it?// The vagus nerve (or pneumogastric nerve) is part of the autonomic nervous system - which controls involuntary bodily functions - and is one of many nerves that transmit messages between the brain and other parts of the body, such as the heart and digestive system. This nerve, which is the longest in the human body and the tenth of the 12 cranial nerves (cranial pair X), originates in the brain stem, passing through the neck, thorax and abdominal area to the intestine. From its origin, it divides into the right vagus nerve, which passes through the right side of the body, and the left vagus nerve, which passes through the left side. In general, the vagus nerve regulates different organs and systems of the human body, monitoring their autonomous and involuntary functioning. Involuntarily - that is, in a way that is not possible for the person to consciously control - the different branches of the vagus nerve are responsible for the increase in heart rate or the feeling of a stomach ""churning"" when faced with a threat or stress, but also for the opposite: the slowing of breathing and the relaxation of the body.  //Functions// The vagus nerve controls involuntary functions of the body and, since it contains both sensory and motor fibers, it is responsible for sensations and movements and manages bodily functions such as: Heart rate and blood pressure;/ Breathing;/ Immune system;/ Digestion;/ Swallowing;/ Humor;/ Sensations in the skin and muscles;/ He speaks;/ Palate;/ Urination;/ Production of saliva and mucus;/  By managing these bodily functions, the vagus nerve ensures the body's safety, keeping the body alert in case of danger and, consequently, the person safe, even before they are aware of the existence of a threat. If this is the case, it triggers a ""fight or flight"" response. On the contrary, it also reacts to safety situations and, in these cases, provides a feeling of calm and tranquility.  //Illnesses// There are diseases that can somehow involve the vagus nerve, for example: Gastroparesis: This occurs when damage to the vagus nerve makes it difficult for food to pass from the stomach to the intestines. This type of damage can result from problems such as viral infections, diabetes, abdominal surgery, and scleroderma.;/ Syncope (fainting) or vasovagal crisis: occurs when the vagus nerve, which is connected to the heart, overreacts in certain situations, such as extreme heat, anxiety, stress, hunger or pain. This type of fainting is the result of a very sudden drop in blood pressure or heart rate, causing a feeling of dizziness or fainting.;/  //Warning symptoms// Depending on the cause and the area of ​​the nerve that is affected, problems with the vagus nerve can cause symptoms such as: Changes in heart rate, blood pressure or blood sugar;/ Abdominal pain and swelling;/ Nausea and vomiting;/ Gastroesophageal reflux;/ Difficulty swallowing or loss of gag reflex;/ Dizziness or fainting;/ Hoarseness, tired voice;/ Loss of appetite, feeling that the stomach is full quickly;/ Weight loss for no apparent reason;/  //Diagnosis// When there are health problems related to the vagus nerve, the attending physician may prescribe tests related to the affected organs, such as: Echocardiogram, Holter, if there are changes in heart function;/ Computerized tomography (CT) scan or MRI scan, if there are bowel problems;/ Abdominal X-ray, ultrasound and/or digestive endoscopy if there are gastrointestinal changes;/  //Healthy nervous system// There are some lifestyle habits that can be adopted to keep the nervous system - of which the vagus nerve is a part - healthy: Adopt a healthy diet;/ Be physically active;/ Properly manage stress from illnesses such as diabetes or high blood pressure;/ American Association of Neurological Surgeons, março de 2022 Cleveland Clinic, March 2022 Psychology Today, March 2022 University of California San Francisco Health, March 2022 About us;/ Events;/ Clients and Companions;/ News;/ CUF Academic Center;/ Partnerships;/ Contacts;/ Frequently Asked Questions;/ Join us;/ Virtual Visit;/ English version;/ My CUF;/ Access Solutions and Health Plans;/ Facebook;/ Facebook Instagram;/ Instagram LinkedInCreated with Sketch.;/ LinkedIn Youtube;/ Youtube award4;/ award4 certification1;/ certification1 certification2;/ certification2 certification3;/ certification3 Complaints and compliments;/ Complaints and compliments Privacy and Cookies Policy;/ Terms and Conditions;/ Whistleblower Channel;/ © CUF 2024 All rights reserved Home;/ Health A-Z: Diseases, Symptoms and Treatments;/"
Morton's neuroma,"//What is it?// Morton's neuroma is defined as a benign swelling of the interdigital nerve (in the space between the metatarsals). Its treatment is surgical and consists of neurectomy (excision of the neuroma). This condition can be described as an “irritation” and/or “swelling” of the sensory nerve located near the metatarsal heads, between two toes. The neuroma is most common in the third intermetatarsal space (between the 3rd and 4th metatarsals) and less common in the second space. It mainly affects women and sometimes appears on both feet. This “irritation” may be due to external mechanical factors, such as bursitis, arthritis or metatarsal-phalangeal arthrosis or overload. And this is the reason why Morton's neuroma is often associated with hallux valgus (bunion). //Symptoms// Typically patients with Morton's Neuroma complain of intense plantar pain, described as a kind of electrical discharge between two fingers. Typically, the pain appears only when walking and especially when wearing tighter shoes, relieving when barefoot and with the feet on a cold surface. Some patients also report pain radiating backwards along the metatarsals. In some cases, they feel tingling and numbness (paresthesias) in the fingers affected by the affected sensory nerve. //Causes// The cause of Morton's neuroma is unclear. Its genesis appears to be associated with irritation, pressure or injury to one of the nerves that innervate the toes; recurrent trauma stimulates the appearance of thickening of the nerve leading to the development of the neuroma. A high percentage of patients with Morton's neuroma are women who wear high-heeled or narrow shoes. Conditions and situations that can cause nerve trauma to the bones of the toes include: High heel shoes;/ Shoes with a pointed or tight toe box that compresses the toes;/ Pes cavum (arched);/ Flat feet (commonly called flat feet);/ Bunion;/ Hammertoe, a deformity in a joint of the second, third, or fourth toe that causes it to be permanently flexed;/ High-impact sporting activities such as running, football, tennis, karate and basketball;/ foot injury or trauma;/ The impact of high-heeled shoes and pointe shoes likely explains why the condition is more common in women than men. //Diagnosis// If there is clinical suspicion, an X-ray of the foot and an ultrasound scan should be requested. If doubts persist, an MRI scan can confirm the diagnosis. //Treatment// Considering that the basis of Morton's Neuroma is repeated “irritation” of the nerve, treatment methods are based on reversing this mechanism. Modifying footwear or using insoles and unloading orthoses should be the first line of treatment. Corticosteroid infiltration can provide symptomatic relief, at least temporary. If conservative treatment fails, surgery is indicated. The neuroma is first freed from the fibrosis surrounding it and is then usually removed. This procedure results in pain relief but also partial loss of sensitivity in the affected toes. Associated injuries, such as hallux valgus and/or metatarsalgia (plantar pain in the metatarsal heads) can be treated during the same surgical procedure. //Prevention// Do not wear tight or high-heeled shoes for long periods of time.;/ Wear comfortable shoes that do not cause compression of the toes;/ Wear sports shoes with cushioned insoles to cushion your toes when exercising;/ Cleveland Clinic Medical News Today  Load more;/ They are chronic diseases that are sometimes confused, but different.

Neuralgia,"//What is it?// This is an episode of very intense pain, similar to a cut, shock or burn, that occurs in association with nerve damage. This can be located anywhere on the body, but is most common in the face and neck. The cause of the injury may be a disease, such as diabetes or multiple sclerosis, an infection or aging itself. Sometimes, the causes are not identifiable. The most common types of neuralgia are those that occur after an infection by the Herpes virus (post-herpetic), trigeminal neuralgia and glossopharyngeal neuralgia. //Symptoms// Symptoms depend on the affected nerve. In the case of postherpetic neuralgia, the nerve can be virtually any nerve. It usually occurs after the vesicle phase and can last for months or years. Trigeminal pain is associated with pain along the path of this nerve, which extends from the brain to one of the faces (very common in the elderly). In general, this case results from compression of the nerve by a blood vessel. In the glossopharyngeal region, which is in the throat region, the pain affects the neck and throat. This type of thing is not that common. In addition to pain, neuralgia may be accompanied by increased sensitivity of the skin along the path of the damaged nerve, so that any touch is felt as more painful. On the other hand, numbness may also occur along this path and the muscles that receive the impulse from the affected nerve may show signs of weakness or even total paralysis. //Causes// Each nerve is protected by a coating (myelin). If this protective layer is damaged, neuralgia occurs. The most common causes are infections, such as those caused by the Herpes virus, Lyme disease, HIV, and syphilis. Multiple sclerosis is a disease that results from the degradation of myelin and, for this reason, one of its multiple symptoms is neuralgia, often in the facial region. Pressure on a nerve is another common cause. It can be exerted by a bone, ligament, blood vessel or tumor. For example, the trigeminal nerve is often caused by pressure exerted on this nerve by a dilated blood vessel. Diabetes is another reason why excess sugar can damage the myelin sheath. Other possible causes are chronic kidney disease, porphyria, some medications, trauma, previous surgery, chemical irritation. //Diagnosis// Diagnosis involves a medical and neurological examination and an MRI scan to rule out multiple sclerosis. Whenever necessary, other tests are requested to help identify the location and cause of the problem. //Treatment// Once the cause has been identified, treatment involves addressing the triggering factor. In other cases, it is essential to achieve adequate pain control. Treatment may involve surgery to relieve nerve compression, blood sugar control in diabetes, physiotherapy or nerve blockage using an injection that “turns off” pain signals and reduces inflammation. Analgesics, anticonvulsants, antispasmodics or antidepressants may also be prescribed, depending on the doctor’s assessment. //Prevention// Treating the diseases that can cause it can prevent its development. In the case of Herpes virus infection, antiviral therapy can prevent nerve damage and subsequent neuralgia.

Nystagmus,"//What is it?// Nystagmus is a disorder of eye movements resulting in a succession of rhythmic, involuntary and combined movements of the eyeballs, consisting of alternating slow and fast phases. It is conventionally defined by the direction of the fast phase and its direction: horizontal, vertical, rotary, multidirectional (mixed). //Symptoms// Nystagmus is a condition characterized by rapid, uncontrollable eye movements. The movements may alternate between fast and slow. It usually occurs in both eyes and may occur in just one eye. Eye movements may worsen with certain directions of the eyes. It may be associated with balance disorders. In children, objects may appear blurry. In adults, there is a constant sensation of objects moving when they look around. Nystagmus can also affect vision. It may be difficult to see in the dark or there may be sensitivity to light. Problems with balance and dizziness are also associated, which worsen when the patient is tired or stressed. //Causes// Nystagmus can be a sign of another eye problem or medical condition. It can be present at birth or develop over the course of a lifetime. Some of the known causes are: Genetics;/ Other eye problems, such as cataracts, strabismus, and difficulty focusing;/ Stroke, multiple sclerosis or Ménière's disease;/ Albinism (lack of pigment in the skin);/ Inner ear problems;/ Certain medications, such as lithium or anticonvulsants;/ Alcohol or drugs;/ //Diagnosis// Diagnosis is made by observing eye movements and by additional diagnostic tests that include: Detailed eye examination to characterize eye movements;/ Ear examination;/ Neurological examination;/ Brain MRI;/ CT scan of the brain;/ //Treatment// Treatment for nystagmus varies depending on the underlying cause. If an individual developed the condition as an adult, small steps can be taken to lessen its effects. Sometimes, it is necessary to stop taking medication or avoid alcohol and drugs. Wearing contact lenses or glasses with the appropriate prescription can improve vision and prevent other eye problems, although it does not cure nystagmus. Surgery may be an option, as may anticonvulsant drugs, anticoagulants, muscle relaxants and Botox. For people who are very nearsighted, laser surgery can help improve vision. WebMD Myopia, astigmatism and hyperopia often lead to the use of glasses or contact lenses. LASIK surgery can restore good vision.

Solitary nodule of the lung,"//What is it?// A solitary lung nodule is a solid, rounded lesion with more or less well-defined contours, less than three centimeters in diameter and surrounded by normal lung. On the x-ray, it appears as a small, lighter spot in the surrounding lung field.  //Causes// Lung nodules can originate from different pathologies or diseases: Infections (bacterial, fungal);/ Scar lesions from old infections (sequelae lesions);/ Benign tumors or malignant tumors, in an early stage;/ //Diagnosis// Its importance and severity must be assessed with determination and persistence by your doctor. Sometimes very small nodules can go unnoticed on conventional x-rays, which makes it necessary to order a Computed Axial Tomography (CAT), which is much more sensitive for detecting lung nodules. The differential diagnosis of pulmonary nodules is a complex process that requires more sophisticated tests and procedures, which can sometimes take a long time. In most cases, there is no need to waste time in determining the origin of the nodule. A simple assessment such as age, sex, background and especially habits is very important. Active smokers or people exposed to smoke (passive smokers) have a higher risk of cancer and should be investigated in detail. A biopsy is the most important procedure in the investigation of a solitary lung nodule. There are several different procedures for obtaining a biopsy, which will be chosen based on the characteristics and location of the nodule. The aim of a biopsy is to determine the definitive diagnosis of a lung nodule, in order to decide on the most appropriate treatment. The greater the possibility of the nodule being malignant, the more important and urgent the biopsy becomes. In patients where this possibility is high (smokers and those with nodules with malignant or undetermined characteristics), we should proceed with a biopsy without delay. In those where the possibility of cancer is remote (young, non-smokers and not exposed to smoke or other carcinogens, with nodules that appear benign), close clinical monitoring is acceptable. In the rare cases where the characteristics of the nodule are clearly benign, there may be no need for further investigation, but monitoring should not be dispensed with.

Vocal cord nodules,"//What is it?// Vocal cord nodules are benign fibrous formations (calluses) that result from poor placement and excessive use of the voice during exertion. That is, they are small benign lesions that grow because the vocal cords rub against each other with too much force while vibrating. They usually develop on the free edge of the vocal cords in the transition from the anterior third to the posterior two thirds, and are usually bilateral. Women between 20 and 50 years old and children are more prone to these nodules - especially those who talk a lot and loudly - but men can also be affected. //Symptoms// Vocal cord injuries generally manifest as hoarseness, changes in vocal timbre, frequent interruptions in sounds, vocal fatigue and a reduction in the range of sounds. It is sometimes associated with dry cough, phlegm and tiredness. //Causes// The main cause of vocal cord nodules is inadequate vocal effort which can also cause polyps which are different entities. Voice misuse is often associated with certain activities such as strained singing, sports cheerleading, teachers and coaches, and other professionals who use their voices professionally. Tobacco and the abuse of alcohol and hot drinks also favor the appearance of nodules. //Diagnosis// Clinical history is decisive in characterizing hoarseness complaints: when and under what circumstances it began, whether it is permanent or associated with vocal efforts, how the voice is used and whether there are accompanying symptoms. The otolaryngologist evaluates the patient's vocal cords using a videolaryngoscope, which is a fiberoptic device with a camera built into the tip and allows direct visualization of the entire larynx, the movements of the vocal cords, and the detection of lesions. Additional tests and treatments are determined based on this initial examination. //Treatment// Speech therapy usually helps to correct harmful vocal habits. Most patients regress with this therapy, with surgery being reserved for specific cases. //Prevention// Quit smoking and avoid secondhand smoke;/ Undergo appropriate treatment in the presence of hypothyroidism, sinusitis, allergies or gastric reflux;/ Avoid excessive consumption of alcohol and caffeine;/ Drink lots of water;/ Sleep well;/ Avoid speaking excessively or loudly without adequate vocal rest;/ Use a microphone if necessary;/ Using a humidifier at home;/ Warm up your voice before singing or speaking for a long time;/ Rest your voice in anticipation of future speaking obligations;/ Avoid singing or talking excessively in the presence of an upper respiratory infection.;/ Wash your hands frequently;/ Use stress reduction techniques, cognitive therapies or yoga to reduce muscle tension;/ American Speech-Language-Hearing Association Cleveland Clinic Given the period we are living in and the request to stay at home, with our children collected and protected, we all have to play different roles.

Obesity,"//What is it?// In Portugal, almost 50% of the population is overweight and almost one million adults suffer from obesity. This disease, considered an epidemic by the World Health Organization, negatively affects our longevity and quality of life. It is important to control obesity, as it is itself a risk factor for the development and/or worsening of other pathologies, such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiovascular diseases, some types of cancer, among others. Obesity is defined by an excess of adipose tissue (fat) in relation to lean mass (muscle, bones and organs), in a proportion that can affect health. From the point of view of fat distribution, obesity is divided into two types: Gynoid: is characterized by a pear-shaped body, with greater accumulation of fat below the waist. It is more common in women, has a lower impact on cardiovascular risk than male obesity, and is more associated with the appearance of varicose veins and joint diseases.;/ Android: with fat located in the waist and upper region of the body, it is associated with an apple-shaped body. More common in men, it can favor the onset of diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases.;/ //Causes// This chronic disease - which therefore requires continuous care to keep under control - occurs when the number of calories ingested is greater than those expended. When this happens, the energy balance is said to be positive and, as a result, the body stores the extra calories in the form of fat mass. This is associated, for example, with the adoption of sedentary lifestyle habits and a diet rich in refined grains, sugars and saturated fats. Obesity has multifactorial causes (environmental, metabolic, genetic) and can have cultural, psychological and behavioral influences. //Diagnosis// Calculating the Body Mass Index (BMI) is the most widely used technique to assess the degree of obesity in adults. This index is obtained by dividing the weight (in kilograms) by the height (in meters) squared: overweight BMI= 25;/ pre-obesity BMI= 25 – 29.9;/ obesity BMI = 30 class 1 = 30 – 34.9 class 2 = 35 – 39.9 class 3 = 40;/ class 1 = 30 – 34.9;/ class 2 = 35 – 39.9;/ class 3 = 40;/ Waist circumference: an important measurement that can be used to assess nutritional status and the risk of cardiovascular events. Waist circumference measurements associated with significant risk: women: equal to or greater than 88 cm;/ men: equal to or greater than 102 cm;/ //Treatment// Obesity treatment always includes dietary re-education, lifestyle changes and control of complications, such as diabetes and hypertension. In more serious cases, it may be necessary to use surgical procedures such as bariatric surgery (sleeve, bypass, minibypass, duodenal switch or SADI-s) or the placement of a gastric balloon. The treatment of obesity must have a multidisciplinary approach: FGM doctor, endocrinologist, nutritionist, psychiatrist and eating behavior psychologist and general surgeon. //Prevention// One of the most important rules for avoiding overweight and obesity is to maintain calorie expenditure (the calories we spend on a daily basis) equal to or greater than the amount of calories ingested, adapting calorie intake to daily expenditure. Some recommendations must be followed for weight control: Follow the recommendations of the Food Wheel, adopting a balanced and varied diet, rich in vegetables, whole grains, fruit and fish and low in sugar and saturated fats - present, for example, in industrially processed fats (hydrogenated), red meat, butter, and full-fat dairy products.;/ Know your food: know what type of nutrients you are providing your body with and what your calorie profile is.;/ Eat every 3 to 4 hours: divide your meals throughout the day, in an amount that allows you to feel full, avoiding hunger at the next meal. A good trick is to start your main meals with vegetable soup without potatoes.;/ Stay active: do a physical activity that you enjoy regularly (if possible, daily). Choose to walk and go for walks outdoors.;/ Have a healthy weight: if you are overweight, you should seek the advice of a nutritionist and your doctor.;/ Brazilian Nutrition Association, March 2019 Fundação Paulista de Cardiologia, March 2019 SNS24, March 2019 Load more;/ Surgery can give people with obesity back the quality (and years) of life that they would otherwise be unable to achieve.

Childhood obesity,"//What is it?// Obesity is a chronic and complex disease, with increasing prevalence throughout the world and considered by the World Health Organization to be the global epidemic of the 21st century. The Cosi study, carried out in Portugal in 2008/2009, involving children in the 1st cycle of basic education, detected overweight in 32%, with 14% being obese. In 2012, the EPACI study, with children in the first three years of life, found around 32% of children overweight and 6.4% obese, already at 12 months of life. This high prevalence in Portugal and at such early ages has been the subject of attention from health, education and society professionals in general. //Symptoms// Unfortunately, the complications of obesity appear at a very early age, the most common being dyslipidemia (increased cholesterol and/or triglycerides), high blood pressure, glucose intolerance with subsequent progression to type 2 diabetes (previously this pathology was rare in pediatric age), sleep problems, orthopedic problems and very worrying psychosocial problems (these children are often victims of bullying). Many of these complications are important cardiovascular risk factors, with a negative impact on health and risk of premature death.  //Causes// It is known that obesity results from the excessive accumulation of fat due to successive positive energy balances, i.e. the amount of calories ingested is greater than the amount expended. This is due not only to genetic, metabolic and behavioural factors, but also to environmental (social and cultural) factors.  //Diagnosis// To know if a child/adolescent is obese, it is necessary to assess their weight and height to determine the Body Mass Index (BMI). With the BMI we can check whether there is excess weight or obesity, using tables appropriate for age and sex. //Treatment// When obesity sets in, resolving this situation has to involve dietary re-education and the practice of more physical exercise. Pharmacological or surgical therapy should only be considered in very specific cases. Children who are overweight/obese must first be identified and evaluated by a pediatrician or attending physician. However, if obesity persists, they should be referred to a Childhood Obesity Consultation or a Pediatric Endocrinology Consultation, where objectives (dietary, physical exercise) appropriate to each child are established, with the support of a multidisciplinary team (nutritionist, psychologist) .

Morbid obesity,"//What is it?// Obesity is a chronic disease that can cause multiple complications in people's health, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, dyslipidemia, osteoarticular and cardiovascular diseases, cancer, etc., but it can be prevented and is reversible. Morbid obesity is considered when there is an extreme amount of body fat and a body mass index (BMI) greater than 40. BMI (dividing the weight in kilograms by the square of the height in meters) is a very useful indicator in assessing weight versus height: BMI values: Normal: 19,0 – 24,9;/ Overweight: 25.0 – 29.9;/ Obesity stage 1: 30.0 – 34.9;/ Obesity stage 2: 35.0 – 39.9;/ Morbid obesity, stage 3: 40.0 or higher;/ //Symptoms// A patient with morbid obesity has extreme body fat, difficulty walking, difficulty breathing and a BMI greater than 40 kilos per square meter. //Causes// Being overweight means that calorie intake is much greater than the amount of calories burned, so the surplus is stored as fat. Anyone can become obese but there are certain conditions that make obesity easier: personal habits: lifestyle, choice of food type, level of physical activity;/ genetic factors: some families have a greater tendency;/ mental factors: stress, anxiety, depression;/ Sleep habits: lack of sleep can contribute to weight gain;/ female sex: related to hormonal factors such as menopause and pregnancy;/ some diseases and medications: corticosteroids, Cushing's disease, etc.;/ aging: decreased metabolism and more sedentary lifestyle;/ //Diagnosis// Objective assessment of the patient, eating habits, exercise practiced and assessment of BMI and abdominal perimeter. //Treatment// There are several treatment options for a person with morbid obesity that include: Diet and exercise;/ Medication;/ Surgery;/ For surgery to be performed, the patient must be in the following conditions: Having made several attempts to lose weight, duly guided by a doctor, without success;/ Absence of severe pathologies that condition the surgical procedure;/ Have a BMI greater than 40 kg/m2;/ Have a BMI between 35 and 40 kg/m2, if you already have associated illnesses related to your obesity;/ Some psychiatric pathologies may be a contraindication for surgery if they are not properly controlled and when the psychiatrist treating the patient does not agree. When indicated, it is a means by which obese individuals can lose weight and maintain the weight they have lost. There are several surgical techniques that are divided into restrictive, which limit calorie intake; malabsorptive, in which the absorption of ingested food is reduced; and mixed techniques that reduce intake and also reduce absorption. Before undergoing surgery, the patient must undergo tests, not only to try to find out if there is any reason for their obesity but also to check their health status and whether it is necessary to take measures to ensure that the surgery goes smoothly. Blood: Complete blood count, urea, glucose, creatinine, uric acid, sodium, potassium, platelets, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, AST, ALT, Alkaline Phosphatase, Gamma Gt, Total Cholesterol, HDL, LDL, Triglycerides, Hemoglobin A1C, T3, T4, TSH, FSH, LH, Estradiol, Insulin, Prolactin, Somatomedin C;/ Urine: 24 hours – cortisol;/ Heart: Two-dimensional M-mode electrocardiogram and echocardiogram;/ Abdominal ultrasound;/ Lung X-ray;/ If you have sleep apnea or a BMI greater than 50 kg/m2 you must undergo functional respiratory tests;/ Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy to evaluate the stomach;/ The patient must be followed by a multidisciplinary team, with mandatory consultations with psychology, nutrition, internal medicine and endocrinology. The patient does not always need to follow a pre-operative diet, but in those who have central obesity, in which the liver is enlarged, making the surgery more complex and even impossible to perform, it is mandatory to follow a low-calorie diet for at least a period of three weeks before the surgery, in which they must lose between 10 and 20 kilos. Normally, these interventions are performed laparoscopically, however, it should be borne in mind that when performing reintervention surgeries, the probability of using the classic method increases greatly, because there are already adhesions that increase surgical difficulty. Livers with enlarged volume, complications such as bleeding, perforation or others that could put the patient's life at risk cannot be performed by laparoscopy. //Prevention// The best way to prevent obesity is through diet and exercise. A healthy diet combined with regular exercise is ideal. The diet should include: Fresh fruit;/ Unprocessed foods;/ Green leafy vegetables;/ Limited amounts of sugar;/ Reduced number of calories;/ Smaller, more frequent meals;/ The exercise should be done for 30 minutes, up to five times a week: To walk;/ Run;/ Jump rope;/ Ride a bike;/ Nadar;/ Row;/ Yoga or other fitness practices;/ Medical News Today Load more;/ ""Obesity is a disease in its own right"" (WHO - World Health Organization).

Constipation,"//What is it?// Constipation is a difficulty in regulating the progression of stool or the total inability to have a bowel movement. In the presence of this condition, the stool becomes harder and drier. Its degree varies from person to person, and may last for a short time or be chronic, causing pain, discomfort and affecting quality of life. Normally, constipation is considered if there is persistent difficulty in evacuating, if the evacuation requires great effort, if it is necessary to resort to digital maneuvers to help the stool pass out, or if there are two or fewer bowel movements per week (or if there has been a recent reduction in usual number of evacuations). Constipation is a common problem that affects people of all ages, and is a symptom rather than a disease. Almost everyone experiences periods of constipation, with an unbalanced diet being the main cause. Most cases are temporary and not serious. It can affect babies, children and adults, with women being more affected than men. It is also more common in older people than in younger people, probably due to their diet, lack of exercise, use of medication and poor bowel habits. Around 40% of pregnant women report constipation during pregnancy. //Symptoms// In general, the stools are hard and fragmented, there is a persistent feeling of malaise and discomfort in the abdomen and there is often a need to resort to medications or enemas to help evacuation. Constipation, when not properly treated, can cause hemorrhoids, fecal incontinence or fecal impaction, which results in the accumulation of dry, hard feces in the rectum. //Causes// It is not always easy to identify its cause. The risk is greater when you eat little fiber (fruits, vegetables, cereals), change your routine, ignore or delay the stimulus for defecation, drink little fluid, if you have anxiety or depression or if you take some types of medication. Stools are made up of the unassimilated part of food, mainly composed of fiber that has the ability to absorb water from the intestine. The time they remain there determines their water content and, whenever there is a longer delay in intestinal functioning, they become harder, causing constipation. Its appearance may also be due to pathologies that affect the intestine, such as some neurological diseases (multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injuries) and metabolic diseases (diabetes, hypothyroidism, kidney failure). Constipation can also be caused by diseases of the intestine or anus, such as inflammation, narrowing areas, tightness in the intestine, tumors, anal fissure, among others. //Diagnosis// A detailed assessment of the complaints and a complete medical examination can provide important data to clarify the situation. An anorectal examination (proctological examination) is quick, painless and very informative. Blood tests, a barium enema or a colonoscopy may be necessary. //Treatment// It is very important to discipline your eating habits, eating foods with fiber and drinking plenty of fluids. These measures take some time to take effect. However, you should: Eat foods rich in fiber, such as: cereals (bran, flakes, whole-grain bread and crackers); fruit (plums, peaches, pulpy fruits, tropical fruits); vegetables (cabbage, beans, chickpeas, peas, broad beans);;/ Do regular physical activity (walking, gymnastics, swimming);;/ Review current medications to see if they are causing constipation.;/ Use laxatives, always with a medical prescription, in more prolonged situations;;/ More rarely, surgical intervention may be indicated.;/ //Prevention// Prevention essentially involves adopting a healthy lifestyle, eating a diet rich in fiber, drinking plenty of fluids and exercising regularly. Having time and privacy in the bathroom is very important, as is not ignoring the urge to evacuate.

Lacrimal duct obstruction,"//What is it?// After being produced, tears are drained from the inner portion of the eyelids into the nasal cavity. Sometimes this pathway can become obstructed, leading to persistent complaints of tearing (in these cases called epiphora). Excess tears may, however, be caused not by poor drainage but rather by an increase in tear production, associated, for example, with ocular surface pathology. Therefore, if you complain of excessive tearing or a sensation of “wet eyes”, it is important to have a detailed examination by an Ophthalmologist to identify the cause. //Types of obstruction// There are 2 types of tear duct obstruction Acquired – this is the most common form, it develops in adulthood and can have multiple causes (infections, inflammation, chronic use of eye drops, chemotherapy, degenerative tissue changes, etc.) Congenital – Affects children after birth and is secondary to incomplete development of the lacrimal system, usually due to the persistence of a membrane in the transition to the nasal cavity. //Symptoms// Variables. The most common symptom is persistent or intermittent tearing that can worsen in certain conditions (wind, air conditioning...), sensation of “wet eyes”, blurred vision, eye irritation. In some cases there is a history of several episodes of red eye and discharge, diagnosed as conjunctivitis, which medical treatment (drops) only temporarily relieves. In the case of chronic or recurrent conjunctivitis, it is therefore important to exclude an obstruction of the lacrimal pathway. One of the complications of permanent obstruction of the lower lacrimal duct is the development of a secondary infection of the lacrimal sac or dacryocystitis. It is identified by the appearance of a painful inflammatory swelling in the inner region of the lower eyelid and requires systemic antibiotic treatment. //Treatment// Congenital obstruction of the lacrimal duct resolves spontaneously in most cases during the first year of life. Massages in the region of the lacrimal sac are useful during this period. When this does not occur, a probing of the lacrimal duct (minimally invasive opening of the lacrimal duct) may be indicated, with other procedures being assessed on a case-by-case basis. In adults, after ruling out other causes of excessive tearing, treatment depends on the location/cause of the obstruction of the tear duct and may include: Punctoplasty: opening of the lacrimal points on the inner portion of the eyelids; Dacryocystorhinostomy: procedure that aims to restore the tear drainage circuit to the nasal cavity when there is a distal/low obstruction, located in the final portion of the lacrimal drainage system; Conjunctive-dacryocystorhinostomy: classically known as the placement of a “Jones Tube”, it consists of placing a device between the inner corner of the eyelids and the nasal cavity, and is used in situations of proximal/high obstruction, located in the initial portion of the lacrimal drainage system.   Myopia, astigmatism and hyperopia often lead to the use of glasses or contact lenses. LASIK surgery can restore good vision. Do you wear contact lenses?

Retinal vein occlusion,"//What is it?// Retinal vein occlusion consists of a total or partial obstruction of the retinal veins and is the second most common cause of retinal vascular disease. Obstruction of the retinal venous system leads to engorgement and dilation of the retinal veins, hemorrhages, optic disc swelling, edema and retinal ischemia. Retinal occlusions can be divided into central retinal vein occlusion and branch venous occlusion. Branch venous occlusion is more frequent (around 80% of cases) and has a better prognosis. //Symptoms// Symptoms depend on the affected location and the severity of the occlusion. Typically, as initial symptoms, patients report a unilateral, sudden and painless decrease in visual acuity accompanied by changes in the visual field. //Causes// The etiology of venous occlusion is multifactorial. Initially, a thrombus forms at the level of the central retinal vein or in one of its branches and then endothelial proliferation and an inflammatory reaction. Known risk factors are high blood pressure, advanced age, dyslipidemia, coagulation disorders, glaucoma, among others. It usually occurs in patients over 50 years of age with high blood pressure. When present in young patients without known risk factors, other causes should be investigated. //Treatment// The choice of treatment should be made taking into account visual acuity and the severity of the clinical condition. At present, we have several treatments available, namely intravitreal injections of antiangiogenic drugs, laser photocoagulation and corticosteroids. Considering the diversity of treatments available, each patient must be considered individually and the therapeutic orientation must be tailored to each clinical situation. It is important to highlight the importance of investigating systemic risk factors, according to the patient's age group and their control, thus preventing reocclusion and involvement of the contralateral eye.

Dry eye,"//What is it?// Dry eye or dry eye syndrome is a very common condition in which tears lose the ability to adequately lubricate the surface of the eye. It can happen when not enough tears are produced, when the tears produced are of poor quality, or both. Dry eye, in addition to reducing patients' quality of life, increases the risk of infections and injuries to the surface of the eye. //Symptoms// Symptoms usually affect both eyes and are diverse and non-specific. They can be confused with other diseases, which is why medical diagnosis by an ophthalmologist is essential. Feeling of sand in the eye;/ Itching;/ Red eye;/ Blurred vision;/ Light sensitivity;/ Teardrop;/ //Causes// Although dry eye results in most cases from multiple different causes, we can group them together: Causes that lead to a reduction in the amount of tears;/ Causes that lead to a reduction in tear quality;/  Causes that cause a reduction in the amount of tearsAgeDiseases such as diabetes; rheumatoid arthritis; lupus; sjogren's, thyroid disease, vitamin A deficiencyMedications such as antihistamines among othersInflammation or absence of the lacrimal gland;/ Age;/ Diseases such as diabetes; rheumatoid arthritis; lupus; sjogren's, thyroid disease, vitamin A deficiency;/ Medications such as antihistamines among others;/ Inflammation or absence of the lacrimal gland;/ Causes that lead to a reduction in tear qualityActivities that reduce blinking frequency: reading; working on a computer; drivingEnvironments with low humidity, wind or smokeInflammatory disease of the eyelids: blepharitis; rosaceaAnatomical problems of the eyelids;/ Activities that reduce blinking frequency: reading; computer work; driving;/ Environments with low humidity, wind or smoke;/ Inflammatory disease of the eyelids: blepharitis; rosacea;/ Anatomical problems of the eyelids;/  Risk Factors Age over 50 years;/ Female sex: associated with hormonal changes of pregnancy, menopause;/ Diet low in vitamin A and fatty acids;/ Use of contact lenses;/ //Diagnosis// The diagnosis is based on clinical observation of the ocular surface in conjunction with the patient's clinical history. Additional tests may be performed to directly or indirectly assess the quantity and quality of the tears. //Treatment// When it is possible to identify a condition that is causing dry eye, treatment consists first of all of the treatment to resolve that specific problem. For example, if the patient is taking a medication that has the side effect of reducing tear production, it may be necessary to consider replacing the medication. Dry eye treatment can be medical and/or surgical and aims to increase the available tears and/or their quality depending on what is causing the dry eye in each case. Most cases, however, are controlled only with the frequent application of artificial tears and modification of some lifestyle habits. //Prevention// Introduce breaks in long-term activities that require visual concentration and that reduce the frequency of blinking.;/ Avoid spaces with drafts and low humidity.;/ Place the computer at a lower eye level;/ Protect your eyes from aggressive external elements such as wind and sun.;/ Avoid smoking and/or frequenting smoky environments;/  It's a common problem with several possible causes, including excessive exposure to screens and air conditioners.

Red eye,"//What is it?// We use the term “red eye” when the conjunctiva, the membrane that covers the surface of the eye, takes on a red or pinkish hue. The majority of red eye conditions correspond to benign situations, however a persistent red eye should be observed by a doctor as soon as possible, especially if accompanied by other symptoms/signs, and referred to an Ophthalmologist specialist whenever necessary.  //Symptoms// Red eye may be accompanied by other symptoms, which, although they may vary according to the cause, are not always sufficient for a differential diagnosis. Some of these symptoms - such as pain or reduced vision - are more concerning and warrant close clinical observation. Other possible associated manifestations are the feeling of “grit”, secretions or a glued “eye”, burning, itching, or an abnormal sensitivity to light.  //Causes// The classic symptom of a non-painful red eye is subconjunctival hemorrhage. It is often spontaneous, with no other symptoms and no previous history of trauma, and may be noticed by others or by the person looking in the mirror. Possible triggers include physical exertion, vomiting, and a sudden rise in blood pressure. When recurrent, it may justify investigation of an unknown systemic vascular cause (high blood pressure, diabetes, coagulation disorders). Among the causes of red eyes, the following stand out: Infection (viral, bacterial) – develops relatively quickly, over a few days, and is accompanied by watery exudate (more indicative of a viral infection) or purulent exudate (bacterial infection). In most cases, it starts unilaterally but can become bilateral after a few days.;/ Allergy – usually bilateral, evolves over a few hours/days, itching (pruritus) and swelling of the eyelids are common.;/ Intraocular inflammation (uveitis) – most often unilateral, accompanied by severe pain, sensitivity to light, reduced vision (learn more) add link;/ Inflammation of the eyelids (blepharitis) – prolonged evolution (weeks/months), associated with a sensation of stinging, burning, tearing.(learn more) add link;/ Dry eye syndrome – a sensation of “sandy eyes”, burning, tearing is common, progresses over months/years (learn more) add link;/ Keratitis – inflammation in the most anterior region of the eye, generally associated with intense pain, sensitivity to light, reduced vision, an important cause of red eye in contact lens wearers;/ Trauma/foreign body – sudden onset (seconds) of red eye and pain due to injury caused by direct trauma, contact with chemical or entry of foreign body.;/ //Diagnosis// Diagnosis requires a detailed clinical history: type and progression of symptoms (sudden/indolent, unilateral/bilateral), history of trauma, previous ophthalmological surgeries, complaints of red eye in close people, use of contact lenses; associated with a thorough physical examination. The development of persistent red eye and/or accompanied by warning signs such as pain, reduced vision, sensitivity to light, should be evaluated promptly. //Treatment// Treatment depends on the cause. Most cases of red eye are treated with eye drops and regress after a few days. However, some cases require prolonged treatment, and incorrect and/or late diagnosis and treatment may result in significant vision impairment. For this reason, the initiation of any type of medication (antibiotic, anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic) should be preceded by careful clinical observation.

Thyroid orbitopathy,"//What is it?// Thyroid Orbitopathy, or Graves' Orbitopathy, manifests itself in the context of an autoimmune disease that develops against the thyroid gland (generally associated with a state of hyperthyroidism), but also against the tissues around the eye, especially muscles and fat. In most cases, manifestations are mild and improve spontaneously over several months. In some patients, however, manifestations can be serious, with a risk of irreversible vision loss. Smoking is directly related to the severity of the disease, and smoking cessation is essential. The disease progresses in two phases, and after an initial inflammatory period (which can last between a few months and 2 years), the disease enters a stable phase, where sequelae such as exophthalmos (protruding eyes), eyelid retraction (which gives an expression of astonishment), strabismus (deviation of the eyeball from its normal position) or fat pads in the upper and/or lower eyelids may remain. After thyroid function has stabilized and the inflammation has resolved, these changes can be corrected surgically.  //Symptoms// They depend on the phase of the disease: active inflammatory or late inactive. Complaints are variable and usually bilateral, but may be asymmetrical. The initial active phase is the most symptomatic; the patient notices that the eyes are red and the eyelids are swollen, especially upon waking. One or both eyes may become more prominent or “protruding” (exophthalmos), and one of the most characteristic signs may develop, retraction of the eyelids, which gives an air of “surprise”. Other possible symptoms are double vision or a sensation of pain or pressure that worsens with eye movements. It is common to feel eye irritation, sensitivity to light and, in the most severe cases, decreased vision. These cases should be monitored by an Ophthalmologist with experience in the area, together with an Endocrinologist. //Treatment// The treatment of Thyroid Orbitopathy depends on the phase (active/inactive) and severity. Smoking cessation is a fundamental aspect, and these cases are always observed in a multidisciplinary way in conjunction with Endocrinology, which monitors the normalization of thyroid function. Active orbital disease can be monitored in most (mild) cases, but more severe forms of the disease may require systemic anti-inflammatory therapy. Surgery may be indicated during the inflammatory phase if there is a risk of visual impairment, or later in the inactive phase to correct exophthalmos (protruding eyes), strabismus or eyelid retraction. These symptoms (protruding eyes, retracted eyelids, strabismus) can undoubtedly become emotionally distressing, and lead to self-esteem problems and social isolation. Several procedures are available to reverse these changes – orbital decompression (which aims to widen the space around the eyeball), eyelid surgery to correct the retraction, strabismus surgery. These are delicate surgeries, and should be performed by an ophthalmologist with experience in the field.  Myopia, astigmatism and hyperopia often lead to the use of glasses or contact lenses. LASIK surgery can restore good vision. Learn to recognize the symptoms of Thyroid Orbitopathy, a disease that can manifest itself in a similar way to viral or allergic conjunctivitis.

Ortopantomografia,"//What is it?// Orthopantomography is a type of panoramic radiography, in which low-level radiation is used, which allows the visualization of various structures of the face and oral cavity - such as teeth, both those present in the mouth and those that are included, jaws and joints. temporomandibular joint (the one that connects the jaw to the skull) - in just one image. This is a quick, comfortable and painless diagnostic method, being one of the most used complementary diagnostic tests in the practice of dentistry.  //What is orthopantomography for?// Orthopantomograms are x-rays used in diagnosis and planning dental treatments. Some concrete examples of its use include: Have an overview of the person's dental health - number of teeth, position of teeth, bone level, among others;/ Diagnosis of periodontal disease;/ Diagnosis and evaluation of the evolution of orthodontic treatments;/ Detection and evaluation of wisdom teeth growth and development;/ Monitoring the development and growth of teeth in children;/ Diagnosis of sialolithiasis (presence of stones in the salivary glands);/ Identifying the location of foreign bodies;/ Detection of lesions such as root cysts and other lesions affecting the bone structures of the jaws;/ Planning of dental extractions and implant placement surgeries;/ Use in Forensic Medicine as a method of age estimation;/  It is important to indicate that there are more specific cases, in which a more detailed image of the tooth is desired, in which oral health professionals resort to intraoral x-rays.  //Preparation// Preparation is similar to any other X-ray examination. Before the examination, the patient must remove all metal objects, such as jewelry (earrings, necklaces, piercings and hair accessories) and glasses.  //How is orthopantomography performed?// Orthopantomography is a short examination, taking only a few seconds. The patient must remain standing, biting on a support and with the head stabilized, to avoid movements during the examination. Movements can interfere with the quality of the image obtained, and the examination may need to be repeated. The device has two pieces at opposite ends - one that emits X-rays and the other that captures the images - that rotate around the person, starting at one side of the jaw, then passing across the front of the face and ending at the jaw on the opposite side.  //Potential risks// Like any other imaging test, orthopantomography uses ionizing radiation to detect and transform the structures of the mouth into images. However, the level of radiation to which the patient is exposed is low, so this is considered a safe test. In the case of pregnant women, for example, it is always recommended that they consider performing this type of examination, but it is not an absolute contraindication. The patient should inform the technician if she is pregnant or if there is such a possibility, in order to have additional protection.

Osteoarthritis,"//What is it?// Osteoarthrosis, or simply arthrosis, can be defined as a joint disease resulting from the failure of several repair processes in the face of multiple attacks and injuries suffered by the joint. In other words, it occurs when the cartilage that covers the ends of the bones wears out over time. This is a firm, lubricated tissue that allows smooth, frictionless movement of the joints. In osteoarthritis, this surface becomes irregular and rough, increasing friction, which can progress to the point where the bones themselves move in direct contact. Clinically there is joint pain, stiffness and limitation of function. Although it can affect any joint in the body, it most frequently affects the hands, knees, hips, shoulders and spine. The population at risk is made up, above all, of elderly people, especially females, with obesity, whose joints are subject to overload due to their profession or for sporting reasons, who have anatomical changes that affect normal joint biomechanics and those who suffer from other joint and bone diseases, including trauma. It is the most common form of arthritis, affecting millions of people worldwide. //Symptoms// Symptoms usually appear and develop slowly, progressively worsening. These include: Pain: with movement or after it ends;/ Joint tension: often due to effusion;/ Joint stiffness: more noticeable in the morning, after waking up;/ Loss of flexibility and mobility;/ Crackling;/ Growth of bone spurs (parrot beaks) around the joint, which may be palpable in areas of thinner skin (knee or fingers);/ //Causes// The exact cause is not known, but it appears to develop when the joint tissue is not repaired correctly. It usually affects older people, but can occur at any age. Genetic factors: some genetic characteristics increase the risk of developing osteoarthritis, which can occur in people under 20 years of age.;/ Trauma and overuse: sports, traumatic injuries or professions with repetitive impact movements.;/ //Diagnosis// The joint must be carefully assessed, particularly for movements that cause pain, relief maneuvers, visible or palpable deformities, as well as the presence of inflammatory signs. X-rays allow for diagnosis, and can be complemented by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. //Treatment// Once present, it gradually evolves and there is no true cure. Maintaining an active lifestyle, controlling body weight and some complementary treatments can slow its evolution, improve pain and joint function. In the initial phase, analgesics and anti-inflammatories may be prescribed which, together with an appropriate physiotherapy plan, allow for pain relief and improved joint function. Intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid (viscosupplementation) may alleviate symptoms. In cases where conservative treatment fails, surgery is indicated. Depending on the joint and the state of the disease, different options are available, such as osteotomy (bone section and realignment), arthrodesis (fusion or union of the joint surfaces, preventing movement) or prosthesis (joint replacement or arthroplasty). //Prevention// Exercise and weight control are essential to: Maintain mobility and range of motion;/ Improve strength and muscle tone;/ Prevent overweight and obesity;/ Increase muscle mass;/ Reduce stress;/ Reduce the risk of other conditions, such as cardiovascular disease;/ Current guidelines recommend practicing moderate-intensity sports for at least 150 minutes per week. Your doctor and physical therapist can help you develop an appropriate exercise program to prevent injuries. Swimming is a good option as it does not put additional pressure on your joints.

Osteodensitometria,"//What is it?// Osteodensitometry is an examination carried out using X-rays (low dose of radiation) that allows the assessment of bone density.  This test uses X-rays to measure the amount of calcium and other bone minerals in a given bone.  Osteodensitometry assessment is performed at the level of the femur and lumbar spine. Measurement at the forearm (radius) is only reserved for cases in which assessment in the anterior anatomical regions is not possible or reliable. //Advantages and benefits// It is still today one of the complementary means that best allows for the diagnosis, assessment of fracture risk and therapeutic control of osteoporosis.  However, osteodensitometry should not be seen as a universal screening method for use in all postmenopausal women. //Methodology//  On the day of the exam, fasting is not necessary, but it is important not to take calcium supplements in the 24 hours before.  After the age of 65, osteodensitometry of the proximal femur offers the greatest guarantee of accuracy and, as such, this is the preferred location.  During the examination, the patient lies comfortably on a table, while the device scans the area to be assessed.  As noted, exposure to X-rays during this exam is extremely low. However, as with all radiation procedures, a woman considering the possibility of being pregnant should inform her doctor.  After correct positioning, the examination itself should take between 1 and 4 minutes for each region studied. //Indications//  Identifying a reduction in bone density before a fracture occurs;/ Determining fracture risk;/ Confirmation of a diagnosis of osteoporosis after a fracture;/ Monitoring osteoporosis treatment;/ Cases in which there is a loss of height greater than 4cm;/ Spontaneous fractures or fractures after minor trauma;/ Use of medications that can cause osteoporosis (corticosteroids, for example);/ After a transplant (due to the medication used);/ When there is a decrease in hormone levels, such as in menopause or during some treatments (e.g. prostate cancer).;/  Osteodensitometry is also indicated for: Women over 65 years old and men over 70 years old;/ Postmenopausal women under 65 years of age;/ Men over 50 years of age if they have risk factors;/ Premenopausal women;/ Men under 50 years of age if there are known causes of osteoporosis or risk factors.;/ //Care to be taken//  Osteodensitometry is an easy, quick and painless examination that does not require special preparation.  If the patient has recently undergone an examination with injectable contrast material or barium, the doctor should be informed, as these materials may interfere with osteodensitometry.

Osteoporosis,"//What is it?// It is characterized by decreased bone mass and deterioration of bone architecture, leading to an increased risk of fracture. This definition is essentially based on the quantification of bone mineral density assessed by appropriate diagnostic means (DEXA). Osteoporotic fractures most frequently affect postmenopausal women and elderly individuals and represent a serious public health problem due to their high prevalence, the medical consequences they entail, the decreased quality of life and the economic and social costs they entail. These types of fractures result, as a rule, from low-energy trauma, most often caused by a fall in the same plane. In the case of vertebral fractures, there is usually no obvious trauma. In Portugal, it is estimated that osteoporosis affects around 500 thousand people. Postmenopausal women are the most affected. One in two women and one in four men will suffer one or more fractures as a result of osteoporosis. These fractures have a significant impact on the health and autonomy of affected patients, representing an enormous cost for the individual and society. //Symptoms// Osteoporosis is a ""silent"" disease, which can progress without any symptoms or discomfort over the years until the first fracture appears. In general, osteoporosis manifests itself through the occurrence of fractures with minor trauma (especially of the vertebrae, hip and wrist). In severe cases, even minor efforts are enough to fracture a bone weakened by osteoporosis. Symptoms only appear when the disease is very advanced, so early diagnosis is essential to prevent its progression. Some signs may be manifested by the appearance of changes in the body, such as the loss of height of more than 2.5 centimeters, the appearance of kyphosis (marked curvature of the back) or shoulders falling forward, making the waist wider and the abdomen more intense. prominent. Sudden, intense and unexplained back pain is also common. //Causes// Although it is more common in postmenopausal women and in older men and women (over 65 years old), there are risk factors that increase its likelihood. Some of these are related to unhealthy lifestyles and can be modified, while others cannot. Non-modifiable risk factors are the following: Feminine gender;/ Age over 65 years;/ Caucasian or Asian race;/ Family history;/ Small stature;/ Excessive thinness;/ Modifiable risk factors are: A diet low in calcium;/ Excessive alcohol consumption;/ Smoking;/ Sedentary life;/ Some diseases (hyperthyroidism);/ Drug use (cortisone);/ Prolonged immobilization;/ Premature menopause;/ //Diagnosis// All postmenopausal women and all men over the age of 50 should be questioned about the presence of risk factors. A medical examination is important and should be used to look for signs that may suggest the existence of causes for secondary osteoporosis or vertebral fractures. Tests include bone densitometry, the most important for your diagnosis, as it allows you to measure bone density, which is directly related to bone mass. This test is painless and quick, using radiation at a much lower dose than that used in a chest x-ray, and is very reliable. Densitometry is recommended for women after age 65 and for men after age 70, or in both cases after age 50 if there are risk factors. If the presence of the disease is confirmed, a laboratory evaluation is important to identify the most common causes of secondary osteoporosis or other causes of fracture, and an x-ray of the dorsal and lumbar spine to verify the existence of vertebral deformation. //Treatment// Its treatment involves regular physical exercise and the use of medications to increase bone mass, painkillers and calcium and vitamin D supplements. Drugs that increase your bone mass, that is, the amount of bone, are the most important, because they will reduce the risk of fracture. There are several drugs - such as anti-estrogens (SERMs), calcitonin, bisphosphonates, or strontium ranelate - that work in this way, and it is up to the doctor to select the most appropriate one in each case. Some of them slow down bone loss and others increase its formation. Calcium and vitamin D supplements are particularly useful if the diet does not contain the necessary amount of calcium. These can come in various forms (tablets, chewable tablets, powder to dissolve) and should be taken after meals. In the case of patients with kidney stones, it is important to drink plenty of water to prevent calcium in the urine from being harmful. //Prevention// Its prevention aims to obtain good levels of bone mass and must be done through the early identification and correction of modifiable risk factors, especially those related to lifestyle (eating habits and physical activity). Nutrition is essential and must ensure adequate dietary intake of calcium and vitamin D, maintain protein intake according to needs, and avoid excessive consumption of caffeine and alcohol.;/ Tobacco should also be avoided;/ Physical activity should be encouraged at different stages of life, and it is important to include high-impact exercises.;/ In postmenopausal women and the elderly, it is very important to ensure an adequate dietary intake of calcium and vitamin D.;/ For older people at higher risk of falling, individually adapted exercise programs should be designed that focus on walking, muscle strengthening, posture and balance.;/ National Association Against Osteoporosis Brazilian Society of Osteoporosis and Metabolic Bone Diseases Portuguese Society of Rheumatology Viviana Tavares et al., Recommendations for the Diagnosis and Therapy of Osteoporosis, Acta Reum Port. 2007;32:49-59 Portuguese Institute of Rheumatology National Osteoporosis Foundation, 2012 Load more;/ Also called premenopause, perimenopause is a period of transition to menopause and a phase in a woman's life that requires special health care.
