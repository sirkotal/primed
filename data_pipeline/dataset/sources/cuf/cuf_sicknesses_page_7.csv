Nocturnal enuresis,"//What is it?// Enuresis in children is defined as a dysfunction characterized by involuntary loss of urine, day or night, anomalous in relation to the child's age and which is not a consequence of lack of bladder control, neurological disease, epileptic seizure or any structural change in the urinary tract. It may have always been present or be related to emotional or behavioral changes. This condition is defined by repeated loss of urine, in bed or on clothes, at least twice a week, for three consecutive months, in children over five years of age. Nocturnal enuresis refers to the loss of urine during sleep and has a significant impact on the child or young person's behavior, well-being and social life, in addition to being a source of stress for the family. In a study carried out in Spain, nocturnal enuresis occurs in around 7.8% between the ages of six and 11, 70% of which are boys, and decreases significantly with age. Two Portuguese investigations revealed a prevalence of nocturnal enuresis between 6.1% and 15.6% in primary school children. This disorder is two to three times more common in boys than girls and has a spontaneous resolution rate of about 15% per year. This probability is lower the longer the enuresis lasts. //Symptoms// Generally, the only symptom is loss of urine during the night. The presence of other symptoms – loss during the day, feeling of frequency or urgency to urinate, burning during urination, changes in the characteristics of the urinary stream (intermittency, irregularity), cloudy urine, constipation or fecal incontinence – may suggest psychological, neurological or renal problems that should alert the family and doctor to the possibility of other associated disorders. //Causes// The causes of this condition are not well understood. Nocturnal enuresis can be a symptom resulting from a number of predisposing factors, of a social, psychological and anatomical nature. It is more common in children who urinate more often during the day, those who have difficulty sleeping or those who have bladder dysfunction. There also appears to be a genetic predisposition to this condition. It has not been shown that stressful social events or family changes are related to nocturnal enuresis. The psychological problems detected in these children seem to be more a consequence than a cause of nocturnal enuresis. And so it should not be considered an act of rebellion. //Diagnosis// In this case, the clinical history is essential, as is the medical examination. In this way, several factors can be detected that, alone or in combination, can cause this disorder. It is very important to rule out organic causes of the disease, such as spinal cord anomalies, urinary tract infections and other pathologies of the male and female urinary system. Constipation may be present in children with nocturnal enuresis. Urine tests should also be performed. In addition, a renal ultrasound may be useful in some cases. //Treatment// It is expected that a child will not wet the bed after the age of five, and treatment is generally only considered for children over the age of seven. Treatment includes a variety of pharmacological and behavioral approaches, the use of alarms, acupuncture, psychotherapy techniques, and training programs. The most commonly used medications are desmopressin and tricyclic antidepressants. In general, they should not be used in children under six years of age. Behavioral interventions range from simple reward methods to urinary retention training or behavioral methods that involve the entire family. The use of alarms of different types has proven to be effective and even superior to the use of medications. You should never blame or punish the child, but rather reward him for the successes achieved. //Prevention// Since it is a disorder of unknown cause, there is no specific way to prevent it. There are only rules to reduce its impact and occurrence.

Migraine,"//What is it?// Headache and migraine are different entities. Migraine is one of the most common and well characterized, but there are 14 broad categories that can be subdivided into more than 200 different forms. Migraine itself has about 20 different genres. In general, headaches are divided into two large groups: primary and secondary. The primary ones correspond to a disease, not reflecting other health problems and represent around 90% of the total. Secondary symptoms are symptoms of diseases of the nervous system or other organs of the human body. They can occur in cases of flu, alcohol poisoning or withdrawal, minor head trauma, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels) or a high blood pressure crisis. Migraine is a primary headache in which very intense episodes of pain occur interspersed with periods without symptoms. In general, it begins between the ages of 15 and 40, but it can appear in childhood or shortly after the first menstruation. If it appears for the first time after the age of 45, other causes must be excluded. Some of its characteristics are closely associated with the female reproductive cycle: higher prevalence after the first menstruation or during the menstrual period; occasional worsening due to taking birth control pills or hormone therapy; attenuation or disappearance during pregnancy or menopause. Before adolescence, migraines affect boys and girls equally. From then on, it is two to three times more common in females. It is estimated that 8% to 15% of individuals living in Western countries (including Portugal) suffer from this problem. The fact of reaching people in the productive phase implies large economic, social and family costs. //Symptoms// It appears recurrently, several times throughout life, but always with completely free intervals. If it occurs every day, it is probably overuse of painkillers or other medications. Drug abuse can convert a migraine into a chronic daily headache. There are people who preferably appear on the weekend. These crises can be precipitated by changes in sleep schedule, failure to eat breakfast, reduced stress or alcohol abuse. In these cases, it is important to consider a lifestyle change over the weekend. The symptoms are intense and often prevent work or study. The pain tends to be throbbing, worsening with physical exertion or head movements. In general, it affects only one side of the head, and is accompanied by nausea, vomiting, intolerance to light, noise and some smells. It is not mandatory that all of these elements are present simultaneously. And they can occur twice a week or just a few throughout a lifetime. During attacks, people seek a dark, quiet place to rest or fall asleep. An episode can last from a few hours to three days. Between attacks, there are usually no complaints. Some types of migraines may have more complex symptoms (with aura). These forms are less common, affecting around 15% of people with this problem, and include transient neurological symptoms, originating attributable to certain areas of the brain. The other signs are identical to those of migraine without aura. The most common auras are temporary vision disorders, in the form of loss of vision on one side of the visual field, blurred images, perception of bright points, geometric figures or bright zigzags. Other auras can be translated as tingling or numbness on one side of the face or one of the hands. There are people who have difficulty speaking or even temporary paralysis of their limbs, usually only on one side of the body. These changes last about 10 to 30 minutes and precede the pain. In children, migraines tend to be bilateral, less intense and of shorter duration. Vomiting and dark circles can be exuberant. Disturbances in sleep and meal schedules are common precipitating factors. Treating these crises is easier than in adults. Sleep usually gives good results. At these ages, the occipital location is not normal and, when present, requires a medical consultation. Likewise, the presence of headaches with morning vomiting or other unusual symptoms in very young children should be seen by a healthcare professional. //Causes// It is caused by a combination of brain processes: excitation/depression of cells, dilation of arteries and release of chemicals. People with migraine are more sensitive to certain stimuli, environmental or from their own body, that can trigger these brain processes. It is also thought that there is some genetic susceptibility. Some individuals can identify the signs of their attacks. The most common are cheese, chocolate, strawberries, seafood, wine, artificial sauces, changes in sleep patterns, stress, menstruation, fasting, physical exercise, and minor trauma. Others cannot identify them at all. People who drink coffee regularly may experience headaches when they stop this habit. //Diagnosis// The key to diagnosis lies in the clinical history, physical and neurological examination. Observation of the fundus is a very important part of these procedures. In some cases, it may be necessary to resort to computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to exclude other diseases. //Treatment// Migraines cannot be cured but can be controlled. There are medications and behaviors that can reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks. Symptomatic treatment, during acute periods, involves resting in a quiet, dark place. Pressure or cold can be applied to the area of ​​pain. At this stage, analgesics, anti-inflammatories, antiemetics and triptans are very useful. //Prevention// People with migraines should create calendars that allow them to identify their symptoms and assess their impact on their quality of life. The first step in prevention is to identify and eliminate precipitating factors, whenever possible. In some cases, it is necessary to use daily medication to reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks, but there are no drugs specifically developed for their prevention. However, there are some drugs used in other contexts that have proven to be effective, such as beta-blockers, antidepressants or antiepileptics, and these should always be prescribed by a doctor.

External epicondylitis,"//What is it?// Epicondylitis is the most common cause of elbow pain, which can affect the dominant or non-dominant arm. It is due to degeneration and inflammation of the extensor tendons of the forearm muscles at the level of their origin on the lateral surface of the elbow. It may also be referred to as ""tennis elbow"". This tendinitis is related to the repeated forearm exercises that occur in sports such as tennis. However, it can occur in any sport or activity that involves this type of movement. This tendinitis is related to the repeated forearm exercises that occur in sports such as tennis. However, it can occur in any sport or activity that involves this type of movement. Painters, joiners, carpenters are also some of the professionals most at risk of developing this specific type of tendonitis, as well as professional drivers, cooks and butchers. As a rule, tennis elbow is most common between the ages of 30 and 50. //Symptoms// Epicondylitis is associated with pain in the lateral aspect of the elbow, which can be aggravated by performing repeated movements, carrying weight or extending the wrist against resistance. Edema or ""clogging"" of the painful area may also be seen when palpated. Symptoms develop gradually and worsen over weeks or months, and there is no specific trauma associated with the onset of symptoms. In addition to the pain, swelling and a burning sensation may occur on the outside of the elbow, with loss of strength in the wrist. Symptoms worsen when holding a racket, turning a doorknob or shaking someone's hand. Although the dominant arm is the most affected, this entity can affect both arms. //Diagnosis// Clinical suspicion is confirmed by performing provocation tests that increase the patient's pain: palpation of the affected area and increased pain when extending the wrist against resistance. Calcification of the corresponding area can be seen on X-ray, but the diagnosis is usually carried out using Ultrasonography and/or Magnetic Resonance Imaging to visualize and evaluate the extent of the lesion at the level of the tendon. //Treatment// Treatment is carried out by modifying activities that are associated with increased pain in the patient, prescribing anti-inflammatories, applying protective orthoses and complementing them with physiotherapy programs. In cases refractory to treatment, and in a selected manner, infiltrations with corticosteroids or growth factors may be used as a complement. The duration of treatment will be shorter and its effectiveness greater the sooner the patient begins medical treatment. Surgical treatment, by excision of the degenerated segment of the tendon, should only be used exceptionally in individuals in whom previous therapeutic measures have failed. Complaints tend to improve with rest, ice, anti-inflammatories, ultrasound and physical therapy. Ultrasounds create small, controlled traumas that stimulate the normal healing process. Conservative treatment is effective in approximately 89 to 95% of cases. Sometimes, corticosteroid infiltration is used. Surgery will only be necessary in very serious cases and if conservative treatment is not effective after 6 to 12 months. After surgery, a period of immobilization followed by physiotherapy will be necessary. Sports activity, in general, can be resumed after 4 to 6 months American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 2013 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, Jan 2013 Marcio Cohen e col., Lateral Epicondylitis Of The Elbow, Rev Bras Ortop. 2012;47(4):414-20 U.S. National Library of Medicine, July 2013 MedicineNet, Inc., 2013 Rogério Teixeira da Silva, Upper limb injuries in sport, Rev Bras Ortop. 2010;45(2):122-31 Jeffrey R.

Epilepsy,"//What is it?// It is a neurological disease that involves the nervous system. Epilepsy is defined as the occurrence of at least two episodes of seizures that are not related to alcohol withdrawal, hypoglycemia, heart problems or other conditions. In some cases, one seizure is enough to diagnose epilepsy, provided there is a high risk of more occurring. Seizures result from a change in the electrical activity of the brain and can result from trauma, familial tendencies, or have no identifiable cause. This activity or discharge has an unpredictable onset and is, in general, of short duration (seconds to minutes, rarely exceeding 15 minutes) with normal brain functioning maintained between attacks. These tend to recur over time, with frequency varying between patients. Epilepsy affects several mental and physical functions and is a very common condition, occurring in around 65 million people worldwide. In the United States, it is the fourth most common neurological disease, surpassed only by migraine, stroke and Alzheimer's disease. In Portugal, it is estimated that it affects four to seven thousand inhabitants. However, the number of individuals who, although not epileptic, may have a seizure during their lifetime is approximately one in every 20. It is more common in very young or elderly people, but can occur at any age. Although treatment allows many patients to live with this condition, for others the seizures are uncontrollable and affect their quality of life in all its aspects. //Symptoms// Epilepsy does not manifest itself in the same way in all patients, and can occur in simple or complex seizures. Furthermore, they depend on the location of the discharge focus in the brain, and can affect gait, face, specific activities, or cause various types of alteration in the state of consciousness, often accompanied by automatic, unplanned movements (getting dressed or undressed, walking, chewing or swallowing). They can occur during sleep and the patient may be conscious or not remember anything after the seizure ends. Seizures themselves can be of different types, with muscles being relaxed, contracted or having spasmodic movements. Some exhibit signs that precede them (aura) while others occur without warning. //Causes// In a large number of cases it is not possible to determine a cause. But any injury that reaches the brain can leave a ""scar"" that is a potential starting point for epileptic seizures. //Diagnosis// Diagnosis is a complex process that involves several steps. The clinical history, neurological examination and laboratory tests are generally the first steps, as they allow the occurrence of seizures unrelated to the disease to be ruled out. Electroencephalogram, magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography scans allow the exploration of possible causes. Finding the origin of epilepsy is very important because it allows the selection of the most appropriate treatment. //Treatment// Treatment must be highly personalized, taking into account the patient's own risks and the dangers of further seizures. It is therefore important to consider the patient's age, the characteristics of the seizures, associated factors and the patient's social and professional context. Many antiepileptic drugs have significant side effects and this risk requires careful consideration. In some cases, one type of medication is sufficient, but for other patients, it may be necessary to combine several. As a rule, treatment is started with a reduced dose of the selected medication, with a gradual adjustment based on the clinical response. The goal is not to cure epilepsy but to control the occurrence of seizures. For this to be successful, good cooperation from the patient is essential, since in some cases, the patient may have to stop the treatment after a period of time without seizures. When medications are not effective, alternatives such as a ketogenic diet or surgery may be considered: The ketogenic diet uses a high percentage of fat, few proteins and carbohydrates and a total suppression of sugar. Creates a metabolic state called “ketosis”, which appears to reduce epilepsy seizures;;/ The surgery aims to remove the areas of the brain responsible for the electrical discharges or to interrupt the transmission of the electrical signal. Stimulation of the vagus nerve is performed using a small device surgically implanted under the skin, just below the collarbone, and allows the desynchronization of convulsive activity in the brain.;/ For each case, the neurologist decides which path to follow. //Prevention// Seizures are often associated with specific triggers or changes in daily routines, such as: Stress;/ Anxiety;/ Excessive alcohol consumption;/ Tobacco;/ Changes in sleep rhythm;/ Tiredness;/ Changes in ongoing medication;/ Very intense stimuli (bright lights, television, video, computer);/ Hormonal changes in women;/ Some of them can be avoided.

Epistaxis,"//What is it?// Epistaxis is the medical term for a nosebleed. Due to the nose's position in the middle of the face and the large number of blood vessels it contains, most people will experience a nosebleed at some point in their lives. Nosebleeds are often caused by local trauma, foreign bodies, infections, and inhalation of dry air. Spontaneous nosebleeds are quite common in children, as are people taking blood thinners, with high blood pressure, or with blood clotting disorders. Other, rarer causes of nosebleeds include tumors and vascular malformations. Although rarely a cause for alarm, epistaxis can be fatal in rare cases.  //Symptoms// Blood from the nose runs down the face, exiting one nostril (usually only one is affected) or runs down the throat if the nosebleed occurs while lying down. Serious nosebleeds require immediate medical attention and include: Heavy bleeding;/ Persistent or recurrent bleeding;/ Palpitations;/ Shortness of breathe;/ Paleness or fainting;/ //Causes// It may originate from inflammatory changes in the mucosa, nasal trauma, capillary fragility or hemorrhagic lesions. Nosebleeds can be classified as anterior or posterior. In anterior epistaxis, blood comes from the wall between the two nostrils, in the area of ​​the nose that contains many delicate blood vessels; It is the most common and can usually be treated easily at home. In posterior epistaxis, there is usually more severe blood loss that may require medical attention. //Diagnosis// The doctor observes the patient and characterizes the nosebleed, including: Duration of blood loss;/ Approximate amount of blood lost;/ How many times has the patient had nosebleeds?;/ If one or both nostrils are involved;/ It is important to know: the medications the patient is taking, including drugs to thin the blood (such as aspirin and other anticoagulants), treatment for colds or allergies, alcohol intake or any use of drugs, especially if they were inhaled through the nose (use of cocaine, for example). Medical observation to determine the origin of the bleeding and its cause may involve the use of a small speculum and a light or an endoscope to see inside the nose. Sometimes additional tests may be necessary - x-rays, CT scans or blood tests. //Treatment// The approach consists of identifying the source of the bleeding, controlling it by chemical or electrical cauterization and, if necessary, nasal packing. In extreme cases, arterial embolization is performed. //Prevention// Avoid traumatizing and scratching the inside of the nose, especially by inserting nails, pencils, etc.;/ Apply lubricating ointment, especially to children whose nosebleeds are attributed to crusts inside the nostrils.;/ Use a humidifier if you are staying at high altitudes or in dry climates.;/ Do not exert any effort after an episode of nosebleeds and consult your doctor in case of doubt or unexplained or persistent nosebleeds.;/ Medical News Today Cleveland Clinic The presence of blood in the stool is a sign of bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract and can have several different causes.

Epitrocleite,"//What is it?// This condition is also known as golfer's elbow or inner epicondylitis. It is a tendinitis that is associated with pain in the inner region of the elbow. This pain can radiate to the forearm and wrist. It is a disorder similar to tennis elbow but, unlike this tendonitis which affects the external region of the elbow, here its internal region is affected.  //Symptoms// The classic symptom is pain located on the inside of the elbow that worsens with physical activity and decreases with rest. This pain may extend along the inside of the forearm. There may be stiffness in the elbow, a feeling of numbness or tingling that may radiate to the fingers. This pain may have a sudden or gradual onset and is aggravated by swinging a racket or golf club, squeezing a ball or someone's hand, turning a doorknob, lifting weights, picking something up with the palm facing down, or flexing the wrist. The elbow's range of motion is maintained because the inside of the joint is not affected. If left untreated, golfer's elbow can cause chronic pain, reduced range of motion, or a fixed contracture of the elbow.  //Causes// It is important to note that tennis players and other athletes (baseball, gymnastics) who repeatedly use their wrist, clench their fingers, perform bending or weightlifting movements can also develop golfer's elbow. Activities such as painting, carpentry, computer use, and cooking can also cause golfer's elbow. This injury can be associated with other conditions such as carpal tunnel syndrome, tendinitis of other muscles and osteoarthritis. Age is also a risk factor, especially over 35 years of age. //Diagnosis// In addition to the medical examination, an X-ray study is important to detect possible changes in the bone or joint. The X-ray may show the presence of calcifications in the tendons, a sign that the process is already old. Ultrasound allows the tendons to be studied and, in some cases, it may be important to perform an MRI scan.  //Treatment// In most cases (90%), medical treatment and physiotherapy are sufficient. In the remaining cases, surgery is recommended, and it is advisable to wait 6 to 12 months before opting for this solution. Medical treatment involves the use of ice, anti-inflammatories, corticosteroids and rest. Surgery involves removing damaged tissue and any calcifications present, with post-operative rehabilitation being important to prevent stiffness and muscle atrophy.  //Prevention// Preventing this and other injuries involves a simple set of measures and a lot of common sense. It is essential not to start a sporting activity without proper guidance. In the case of older people, whose musculoskeletal system is more rigid, it is recommended to take a few classes with a properly qualified teacher. The choice of materials and equipment is very important and must be adjusted to the characteristics of each person. Warming up before starting a sporting activity should never be forgotten. Whenever any sign of tiredness occurs, rest breaks should be taken or the activity should even be interrupted. Training programs must be appropriate and tailored to age and general health status. In case of persistent complaints, a doctor should be consulted. Finally, in the event of an injury and after recovery, one should not rush to resume activity until the process is completely resolved.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,"//What is it?// Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a rare degenerative neurological disease that progresses progressively. In this disease, the motor neurons that conduct information from the brain to the muscles (passing through the spinal cord) die prematurely. As a consequence, the muscles, which allow the most varied movements (walking, talking, chewing, swallowing...), become progressively weaker. It is estimated that there are three to five cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis for every 100,000 people. Although it can appear between the ages of 40 and 75, most patients are over 60 years of age. However, this disease can manifest itself at any age. It is more common in men than women and more in Caucasians than blacks. //Symptoms// The main symptoms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are lack of strength, muscle atrophy, involuntary muscle spasms, cramps, fatigue, muscles that are stiff due to increased tone (spasticity) and increased saliva production. There are different forms of this disease. The medullary form, the most common, involves the muscles of the arms or legs, causing difficulty walking. If it involves weakness of the muscles of the hands, it may be difficult, for example, to button a coat. There are also problems with articulation of words, chewing and swallowing, as well as shortness of breath and coughing, among others. There is usually progressive involvement of the body's muscles in a diffuse manner, with its rate being very variable. When muscle weakness involves the muscles of the neck or back, we are dealing with the axial form of the disease. When complaints occur associated with several parts of the body, we speak of the diffuse form. This disease can be associated with a form of dementia, in which case there is a greater likelihood of there being a genetic basis, with several family members affected. //Causes// In most cases, the cause is unknown. However, it is thought that in around 10% of cases, it may have a genetic origin. The potential role of some environmental factors (toxic or infectious agents), physical trauma and behavioural or occupational factors has been evaluated, but there is currently no concrete data. //Diagnosis// There is no specific test for this disease. Therefore, the diagnosis requires a neurological examination as well as a series of analyzes that exclude other pathologies that can simulate amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. As a rule, electrophysiological studies are performed, such as electromyography, laboratory blood and urine tests, magnetic resonance imaging, myelogram and muscle and/or nerve biopsies. //Treatment// There is currently no cure for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A drug, Riluzole, was approved in the United States, which appears to reduce nerve damage, increasing patients' quality of life. However, this drug does not allow existing lesions to be reversed. It is equally important to resort to therapies that can alleviate symptoms such as fatigue, muscle cramps, spasticity, constipation, pain, depression and improve sleep quality. When breathing becomes difficult due to muscle weakness, it may be necessary to resort to ventilatory assistance at night and/or during the day. This approach requires the participation of multidisciplinary teams that include doctors, pharmacists, physiotherapists, nurses, nutritionists and, in some cases, social workers. In this way, it is possible to design individualized support plans tailored to the needs of each patient. //Prevention// There is currently no way to prevent this disease. With a progressive evolution and a strong impact on quality of life, understand better what amyotrophic lateral sclerosis consists of, a disease that affects the muscles.

Multiple sclerosis,"//What is multiple sclerosis?// Multiple sclerosis is an important and still poorly understood disease. According to a study carried out in our country, two thirds of Portuguese people do not know what multiple sclerosis is. It is estimated that, in Portugal, it affects around 60 individuals per 100 thousand inhabitants. On a global scale, data indicates that there are around 2,500,000 people with multiple sclerosis and in Portugal more than five thousand. It is a chronic neurological disease, more common in young adults, and which usually appears in the third decade of life, with twice the frequency in females. Most cases are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50, but can affect people aged between two and 75. Although it is not fatal, it is very disabling, significantly influencing all aspects of patients' lives. Multiple sclerosis affects the central nervous system. The nerve fibers of the cells of the nervous system are covered by a sheath called myelin, which is essential for the correct propagation of stimuli. In this pathology, the myelin is destroyed, preventing proper communication between the brain and the body. On the other hand, the inflammatory process that occurs in this disease damages the nerve cells themselves, causing permanent loss of various functions, depending on the areas affected. Its evolution is very variable and impossible to predict. As a rule, there are four types: The relapsing-remitting form, in which attacks occur lasting days to weeks, followed by recovery;;/ The secondarily progressive form, in which deficits accumulate after each crisis;;/ The primarily progressive form, which evolves from its beginning;;/ The relapsing-progressive form, in which the disease progresses clearly but there may be symptom-free periods.;/ The first is the most frequent. //Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis// The first symptoms are of a sensitive nature, such as loss of sensation or tingling that begins in one extremity and extends throughout the limb, over the course of three or four days. These signs can last from one to two weeks and then gradually disappear. Blurred or double vision, motor deficits, tremors, difficulty walking and speaking, balance changes, memory and concentration problems, fatigue, or even paralysis and complete loss of vision are also common. Symptoms always depend on the areas of the nervous system where there is loss of myelin and the consequent inability to transmit nervous stimuli. Progression to complete paralysis is rare, although many patients may require assistance in walking, given the presence of fatigue, weakness and imbalance. //Causes of Multiple Sclerosis// Its exact cause is unknown, but it is believed that there may be factors of a genetic, immunological, viral, bacterial, environmental nature (diet, industrial toxins present in soil or water), reduced levels of vitamin D, allergies, physical trauma, among others. Smoking has also been suggested as a potential cause. However, it is not a contagious disease nor is it hereditary. //Diagnosis of multiple sclerosis// In the early stages of multiple sclerosis, diagnosis is very difficult because symptoms can be very variable and tend to disappear over unpredictable periods of time. There is no laboratory test that is specific for multiple sclerosis and, as a rule, it is an MRI that confirms the presence of the disease. Some neurological examinations may also be useful. //Treatment of multiple sclerosis// Multiple sclerosis has no cure and the available medications can only “modify” or slow its progression, reduce the frequency and severity of flare-ups, reduce the accumulation of damaged areas in the nervous system and help patients deal with the symptoms. The most commonly used groups of drugs are corticosteroids, which help combat inflammation, and interferons, which reduce the risk of flare-ups, their severity and the damage they cause. In more severe cases, other types of medication may be used, such as cytostatics. All of these should be supplemented with other types of support, defined according to the difficulties experienced by each patient. //Prevention of multiple sclerosis// Considering the number and variety of possible causes of multiple sclerosis, it is difficult to prevent its occurrence. However, stopping smoking, increasing vitamin D levels and avoiding contact with environmental toxicants can be significant steps towards prevention.

Scoliosis,"//What is it?// The normal spine has curves that cause the highest area of ​​the trunk (thoracic region) to protrude slightly outward (kyphosis) and the lower back slightly inward (lordosis). However, there are people who have curves to the sides. These curves are unnatural and are called scoliosis. Unlike bad posture, these curves are not corrected just by straightening your shoulders or sitting up straight. Scoliosis is a complex disease characterized by the existence of a severe deformity, in several planes, and which involves several segments of the spinal column. This type of spinal deformity affects around two in every 100 people globally. However, there is a strong family trend: if any family member has scoliosis, this number increases to around 20%. //Symptoms// If scoliosis progresses over time, it can result in: Severe pain;/ Marked deformity;/ Difficulty breathing;/ Some of the signs that can be observed are: Asymmetrical or uneven shoulders;/ Prominence of one shoulder blade;/ Waist asymmetry;/ Uneven haunches;/ Tilting the trunk to the side;/ If any of these signs exist, a medical evaluation (by a family doctor, pediatrician or pediatric orthopedist) is advisable. //Causes// The causes of scoliosis can be of different nature, including postural. However, in most cases it is not possible to identify the causes or reasons for the disease, which is called idiopathic scoliosis. Typically, scoliosis develops around the beginning of puberty in healthy young people and is more common in girls than boys. However, it can appear at any age. Some known causes of this deformation include, for example: Paralisia cerebral;/ Congenital malformations of the vertebrae;/ Muscular dystrophy;/ Tumors;/ Scoliosis tends to get worse over the years, due to the bad postures we adopt in different aspects of our lives. //Diagnosis// Although it is not possible to prevent scoliosis, early detection is the best way to prevent an existing problem from getting worse. X-rays of the entire spine in different views and angles provide diagnosis and guide treatment. In certain situations, additional studies such as Computerized Axial Tomography or Magnetic Resonance Imaging may be necessary. //Treatment// Sometimes scoliosis is only detected in adults, but it can result from the progression of a curve that was not treated during growth, and what began as mild scoliosis continued to worsen in the absence of treatment. Although most curves remain very small and only need to be monitored by a pediatric orthopedist to detect signs of progression, there are cases in which treatment is necessary. There are several factors that must be taken into account when drawing up a scoliosis treatment plan, such as: Family history;/ Age at which the curve appeared;/ Location of the curve;/ Curve Gravity;/ As it progresses, braces may be used to try to control it. This type of treatment allows any child to maintain all types of normal physical and social activities. If the treatment with the brace is not effective, it may be necessary to resort to surgery, which, nowadays, is an extremely effective and safe method of correcting curves. This procedure promotes the fusion of the segments involved – instrumentation – and is performed under general anesthesia, involving a hospital stay of approximately four to seven days. Other methods, such as electrical stimulation, specific physical exercises, manual therapy methods and manipulations, have not been shown to be effective. //Prevention// Scoliosis cannot be prevented, however early detection is the ideal way to prevent an existing problem from worsening.

Juvenile idiopathic escoliosis,"//What is it?// Juvenile and adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is... A deviation in the coronal/frontal plane (lateral deviation) in relation to the center of gravity or natural position of the spine;;/ Measured in angles and can vary or remain stable throughout growth.;/  It is divided into two types: Postural: results from the action of elements external to the spine that promote curves that can be corrected through postural reeducation, physical activity, physiotherapy, ocular prisms, insoles, osteopathy, among others. It is therefore considered reversible.;/ Structural: presents fixed curvature, generally progressive. It can be divided into three subtypes: congenital, when it is related to the malformation of the vertebrae at birth; neuromuscular, if it results from a muscular imbalance in the spinal stabilizing muscles or some pathologies of the central nervous system; and idiopathic when the cause is unknown. Among children and adolescents, the most common type of structural scoliosis is idiopathic scoliosis.;/  According to the Scoliosis Research Society (SRS), it can be classified according to age at the time of initial diagnosis, developing with maturity: Children – up to 3 years old;;/ Juvenile – from 4 to 9 years old;;/ Adolescence – from 10 to 18 years old.;/ //Symptoms// If scoliosis progresses over time, it can result in severe pain, marked deformity, and difficulty breathing. Scoliosis cannot be prevented, however early detection is the ideal way to prevent an existing problem from worsening.  These are some of the signs that can be observed: Asymmetrical or uneven shoulders;/ Prominence of one shoulder blade;/ Waist asymmetry;/ Uneven haunches;/ Tilting the trunk to the side;/  Any of these signs recommends that a medical evaluation be carried out (by your family doctor, pediatrician or pediatric orthopedist) //Causes// The causes of idiopathic scoliosis are unknown, however, the literature states that it is a multifactorial pathology with genetic predisposition. //Diagnosis// At younger ages, it is the parents, physical education teachers or pediatricians who give the warning sign that something is wrong with the spine. And generally, the first signs of the presence of scoliosis are based on the asymmetry between the shoulders and pelvis and the length between the legs. When there is vertebral rotation, costal gibbosity may appear. However, the diagnosis is confirmed by the orthopedic doctor after performing an X-ray.  The progression of scoliosis normally occurs during the growth phase of children and adolescents, progressing until they reach the mature growth phase. The risk associated with curvature progression is greater in female children, when the curvature appears before menarche (first menstruation); when there is a double curvature or when its evolution is increasing. The longer it takes to finish growth, the greater the likelihood of scoliosis progressing.​ In general, scoliosis curvature can reach different degrees depending on the age at which it is diagnosed. Generally, curves that reach 40º/45º at the end of growth can continue to progress, while curvatures below this value tend to stagnate and not progress. //Treatment// Treatment with a brace/orthosis is one of the options in the treatment of idiopathic scoliosis and consists of applying an external force to the trunk, which in turn alters the rotation of the spine and prevents the progression of scoliosis. There are two basic types of orthoses: cervico-thoraco-lumbar-sacral (CTLSO) and thoraco-lumbar-sacral (TLSO). The first type of orthosis (CTLSO) is indicated for the treatment of thoracic curves with an apex at or around T8, double thoracic curves and other double curves with the apex of the thoracic component above T8. The Milwaukee brace is an example. As this type of orthosis immobilizes from the spine to the pelvis, it requires continuous and full-time use, which is why acceptance by adolescents is very low. In turn, the second type of orthosis (TLSO) is indicated for the treatment of lumbar and thoracolumbar curves, as well as thoracic curves with an apex at or below T8. Examples are the Boston, Lyon, Chêneau, or Charleston, Providence brace (these two for some thoracolumbar and lumbar curves), among others. Due to the fact that they are placed under clothing and do not immobilize the neck, and that their use is not continuous (18 to 23 hours depending on age and protocols), they are more widely accepted by teenagers. The Charleston or Providence vests are night orthoses (minimum 8 hours of daily use) which is why they are most preferred by teenagers, whenever possible. Indication for use of vest Curves between 25º and 30º, with progression greater than 5º;;/ Curves between 30 and 40º;;/ Patients with immature skeleton;;/ Risser score less than 3;;/ Motivated Patients/Caregivers;;/ Most common types of braces: Boston, Charleston and Providence  Care to be taken with the vest The vest must be well adapted to your body;;/ Skin care;;/  Warning signs that arise when wearing a vest Numbness in the arm;;/ Pain in the rib cage;;/ Pain in the anterior superior iliac spine;;/ Pressure zones caused by the use of the vest;;/ Itching.;/  The details of the surgery, which has evolved a lot in recent years and with excellent aesthetic results, are defined based on classifications that take into account the characteristics of the spine curvatures and the patient's age, among other factors, and which are necessary to define the surgery strategy. surgical treatment.  These strategies allow the restoration of spinal alignment and fixation, aiming to reduce curvature and prevent it from worsening. This type of surgery takes place over a long period of time and must be performed by a multidisciplinary team with the necessary resources.  Surgical approach It consists of correcting and fusing the vertebrae that are deviated, causing loss of movement in the operated segment of the spine. Spinal fusion or spinal arthrodesis is generally performed via the posterior approach (through the back). In very severe curves (greater than 70º) and other less common types of curves, surgery may be indicated via the anterior approach (through the thorax or abdomen) complemented by the posterior approach. Another surgical alternative for these severe curvatures consists of placing the young person in halo-gravitational traction for a few weeks (4 to 8 weeks). The scar is generally long and depends on the extent of the scoliosis (depending on the number of vertebrae affected). Complications associated with this type of surgery have decreased significantly in recent years. Currently, the most common complications involve nausea and vomiting and changes in respiratory flow (addressed with physiotherapy).  Use of implants Screws, bars, bands and hooks are applied to the spine in order to correct the deformity and fix the spine in the most correct position, allowing the vertebrae to fuse with the autologous bone graft taken from the ribs or the iliac bone (from the spine itself). In patients with idiopathic scoliosis, this type of fixation eliminates the need for any type of orthosis in the post-operative period, which is why some adolescents prefer this type of treatment without considering the risks of this type of surgery.  Post-operative follow-up - After hospital discharge The first post-discharge dressing is performed approximately 15 days after surgery.;/ First consultation is held approximately one month after surgery;/ Subsequent consultations are held monthly up to 6 months after surgery and from the 1st year onwards, annually up to 5 years. After this period, the patient is discharged from the hospital.;/  Scar care It is recommended to apply a greasy cream to the scar twice a day and massage in the direction of the suture;;/ It is recommended to use a sun protection cream (+50) on the scar site for the first 6 months after surgery.;/ It is recommended to use creams or bandages to prevent the formation of colloids (hyper scarring);/ It is recommended to contact the orthopedics unit in case of a sudden change in the appearance of the scar, namely: heat, pain and redness.;/ //Sources// Jorge Mineiro, Orthopedics Coordinator at CUF Descobertas Hospital In surgery, the O-arm allows you to view a 3D model of the spine.

Esophagitis,"//What is it?// When the inner lining (mucosa) of the esophagus - the muscular tube that transports food from the mouth to the stomach and which is located, for the most part, in the chest - is inflamed, there is a sensation of chest pain or difficulty in swallowing. This problem is called esophagitis. //Symptoms// The main symptoms are chest or throat pain that resembles a burn. It radiates towards the neck and usually appears less than an hour after meals, and may worsen when lying down or leaning forward. It can be constant or intermittent. Another common symptom is difficulty swallowing, with chest pain worsening when the patient swallows or a feeling that food is stuck in the chest after eating. Sometimes these complaints can be confused with heart problems. In cases of more intense esophagitis, there is the presence of bleeding, in the form of blood in the vomit (with a brighter color) or in the feces (with a dark color resulting from the presence of digested blood). Both can cause anemia. There is also regurgitation, in which food returns to the mouth, without the effort of vomiting. Other possible manifestations are coughing, shortness of breath, hoarseness, ear pain or gingivitis. In some situations, complications may arise, such as ulcers and strictures. //Causes// Esophagitis has several causes. The most common is the reflux of stomach acid into the esophagus (gastroesophageal reflux), which results in a chemical burn of the lining of the esophagus and can cause inflammation, heartburn and a burning sensation in the chest. This reflux is caused by an imbalance between the defense and aggression factors of the esophagus. Elements that can attack this mucosa are foods (tomato products, citrus juices, chocolate, caffeinated drinks), tobacco, alcohol, some medications (nitrates, estrogens, oral contraceptives, calcium channel blockers, alendronate, among others), and the acidic contents of the stomach and bile, when biliary backflow occurs. If there is a hiatal hernia, a situation in which a portion of the stomach passes through the diaphragm into the thoracic cavity, dysfunction of the lower esophageal sphincter occurs, increasing reflux. Increased intra-abdominal pressure (tight clothing, pregnancy, coughing, obesity, sudden physical exercise that increases intra-abdominal pressure, constipation) is another cause of reflux. Like acid reflux, frequent vomiting can cause acid burn of the esophagus. Some drugs may also be associated with esophagitis, such as aspirin, doxycycline, iron supplements, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen, naproxen, and others), and medications for the treatment of osteoporosis (alendronate, risedronate, and others). Chemotherapy and radiation therapy for cancer can, in some cases, damage the lining of the esophagus, causing esophagitis. Infections in the esophagus can also be the cause, and usually occur in people with a deficient immune system. This is common in patients with HIV, people who take corticosteroids for long periods of time, those who have undergone organ transplants or those who have undergone chemotherapy. //Diagnosis// Diagnosis is often made based on symptoms. It is confirmed by performing an endoscopy, which allows direct observation of the inside of the esophagus. Using an endoscope, the doctor can identify esophagitis and the presence of areas where erosion or ulceration has occurred. If necessary, this technique allows biopsies to be performed, which consist of collecting small samples of the mucosa through the end of the endoscope, which are subsequently studied. Since esophagitis is only one possible cause of symptoms of chest pain or difficulty swallowing, further tests may be needed to evaluate the heart, lungs, and rest of the digestive system to rule out other problems. //Treatment// Treatment depends on its cause. In the case of acid reflux, medications that block acid formation, such as proton pump inhibitors, may be used. In others, which are more difficult to treat (generally when symptoms do not improve with medication), surgical intervention on the stomach may be necessary to help prevent reflux. When esophagitis results from taking medication, drinking a full glass of water after taking the pill may be helpful. In fact, it is important to know that all over-the-counter and prescription medications should be taken while standing or sitting and swallowed with water. This is especially important for those that can cause esophagitis. However, in general, it is necessary to stop taking the drug, at least temporarily, until the mucosa heals. Since acid can aggravate medication-induced esophagitis, your doctor may also prescribe an acid blocker. In the case of infections, the choice of treatment depends on the infectious agent responsible for the esophagitis. Some situations are difficult to treat with oral tablets or liquids, and may require intravenous treatment in a hospital setting. //Prevention// Since acid reflux is the most common cause of esophagitis, there are some measures that can minimize its occurrence, such as: Avoid heavy meals, especially in the hours before bedtime.;/ Reduce tobacco and alcohol consumption;/ Avoid consuming large amounts of caffeine, chocolate, peppermint and foods with a high fat content.;/ Keep your weight under control or, if necessary, lose weight;/ Do not wear tight clothing;/ Raise the head of the bed about 15 centimeters while sleeping;/ Portuguese Society of Gastroenterology João Cláudio Barroso Pereira, Lung diseases and gastroesophageal reflux disease, Rev Port Pneumol 2009; XV (5): 899-921 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, Abril 2012 University of Maryland Medical Center, Outubro 2012 We don't all react to foods the same way, but some are more likely to cause heartburn.

Esophageal spasms,"//What is it?// When food is swallowed, it moves from the mouth to the pharynx. The upper esophageal sphincter opens, allowing it to enter the esophagus, where a series of muscle contractions, called peristaltic waves, propel the food downward. The food then passes through the lower esophageal sphincter and into the stomach. If these contractions are not harmonious and sequential, it does not progress into the stomach and pain and difficulty in swallowing occur. Spasms correspond to a disorder of the propulsive movements (peristalsis) of the esophagus, caused by a malfunction of the nerves. The normal contractions that move food through the esophagus are periodically replaced by non-propulsive contractions. In 30% of people with this problem, the lower esophageal sphincter opens and closes abnormally. It is estimated that, in the United States of America, esophageal spasms affect one in every 100,000 people per year. However, considering that many of these cases go unnoticed, because they are associated with mild symptoms or are confused with other disorders, the real incidence may be higher. Although this disease is rarely fatal, it is associated with weight loss and malnutrition resulting from the inability to swallow. On the other hand, esophageal spasms can be disabling, interfering with daily activities and causing psychological disorders. //Symptoms// Muscle spasms along the esophagus are generally felt as chest pain behind the breastbone, which coincides with difficulty swallowing liquids or solids. This can occur at night and be severe enough to interrupt sleep. Very hot, very cold or fizzy liquids can worsen this symptom. Eating quickly also tends to aggravate the symptoms. Some patients also report a sensation of an object stuck in the throat. Others experience regurgitation of food or heartburn. In some individuals, severe pain without difficulty swallowing occurs. This, often described as oppressive pain behind the breastbone, can accompany exercise or exertion, making it difficult to distinguish it from angina pectoris. Symptoms tend to be intermittent and variable throughout the day and can last from minutes to hours. Anxiety and depression are common in these patients. If not diagnosed and treated, this condition can evolve, after many years, into achalasia (dilation of the esophagus with loss of its contractile capacity). //Causes// Although the cause is not known, it is clear that esophageal spasms are more common in white people, in females and rare in childhood, increasing in incidence with age. Some theories attribute the cause of this disease to gastric reflux or a neuromuscular disorder, but there is still no scientific validation. //Diagnosis// The diagnosis is based on clinical evidence and can be confirmed by performing an X-ray study. X-rays taken while a contrast agent (barium) is ingested can reveal an abnormal downward movement and demonstrate that the contractions of the esophageal wall are occurring in a disorganized manner. Oesophageal gammagraphy (a highly sensitive imaging test that shows the movement of food through the oesophagus) is used to detect abnormal movements of food through the oesophagus. Measurements of oesophageal pressure (manometry) also allow detailed analysis of spasms. Endoscopy may be useful. If these studies are inconclusive, a manometry may be performed when the person eats food or administers a substance that triggers painful spasms. //Treatment// Spasms of the esophagus are difficult to treat. However, symptoms can be relieved with nitroglycerin, long-acting nitrates, dicyclomine, or calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine. Sometimes strong painkillers are needed to relieve pain. In some cases, a balloon is inflated into the esophagus or tubes (metal dilators) are inserted to enlarge the esophagus. If these therapeutic modalities are not effective, surgery is used, with a section being made in the muscular layer of the esophagus along its entire length, in order to reduce the occurrence of spasms. //Prevention// Since the cause is unknown, it is not possible to prevent the development of this condition.

Spina bifida,"//What is it?// Spina bifida is a congenital anomaly of the nervous system that develops in the first two months of pregnancy. It represents the defect in the formation of the neural tube (abnormalities that occur in the development of the spinal cord and brain of some babies) most common in the United States, with an estimated incidence of 1 in every 1000 newborns. However, there is still no statistical data on the incidence of spina bifida in Brazil. These defects are an important cause of infant mortality. In this condition, there is incomplete development of the brain, spinal cord and meninges. There are four types of spina bifida: Hidden: the most common and lightest.;/ Closed neural tube defects: intermediate severity.;/ Meningocele: like the previous one, it is of intermediate severity.;/ Myelomeningocele: is the most serious type, in which the spinal cord is exposed, resulting in partial or complete paralysis of the area of ​​the body located below the opening of the spinal cord. It is also associated with urinary and fecal incontinence.;/ //Symptoms// The symptoms of a person with spina bifida vary greatly, depending on the type of anomaly. Closed defects are identified earlier by the presence of a tuft of hair or a patch of skin at the site of the spinal malformation. In meningocele and myelomeningocele, a sac filled with fluid forms that protrudes through the skin near the spine. This sac may be covered by a thin layer of skin (meningocele) or, especially in cases of myelomeningocele, this lining layer is absent, leaving the anomalous tissue completely exposed.  //What impact can it have on the patient?// Spina bifida can be associated with various complications, from the mildest, such as some functional limitation, to the most serious with severe physical and mental disability. Most people with this condition have a normal level of intelligence. The impact of spina bifida depends on the location and size of the malformation, whether or not it is lined, and which nerves are involved. As a rule, all nerves that are located below the malformation will be affected to a greater or lesser extent. Therefore, the higher the location of the malformation, the greater the nerve damage and loss of motor and sensory function.  //What is the relationship between spina bifida and hydrocephalus?// One of the neurological complications associated with spina bifida is Chiari II malformation, especially in children with myelomeningocele. In this malformation, the brain stem and cerebellum protrude into the region of the spinal canal or neck, compressing the spinal cord and causing symptoms such as difficulty in eating, swallowing and controlling breathing, and changes in the function of the upper limbs (stiffness and weakness). In this case, the flow of cerebrospinal fluid may also be blocked, causing a condition called hydrocephalus, in which there is an abnormal accumulation of this fluid in and around the brain. This accumulation causes an increase in intracranial pressure, with damage to brain structures. Hydrocephalus is treated by placing a shunt in the brain, which allows excess fluid to drain into the abdominal cavity.  //Consequences in newborns and adulthood// Some newborns with myelomeningocele may develop meningitis, which can cause brain damage or be fatal. When myelomeningocele and hydrocephalus occur, children may have learning and attention difficulties. At a more advanced stage of life, these patients with spina bifida may develop latex allergies, skin or gastrointestinal problems and are more prone to depression. //Causes// The causes for the development of spina bifida are not known. It is thought that genetic, nutritional and environmental factors may contribute to this condition. Some studies suggest that insufficient maternal folic acid intake may be a key factor in the development of neural tube defects. For this reason, prenatal vitamins always contain folic acid. //Diagnosis// In most cases, the diagnosis of spina bifida is made prenatally. However, some milder cases may only be detected after birth. In the milder type (spina bifida occulta), where there are no symptoms, the diagnosis may never be made. Prenatal diagnosis is usually carried out in the second trimester of pregnancy through maternal serum alpha fetoprotein (MSAFP) measurement and ultrasound. Amniocentesis may also be helpful. Postnatal diagnosis of spina bifida is usually performed through an imaging test (x-ray, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging). //Treatment// There is no cure for spina bifida. Damaged nerve tissue cannot be repaired, nor can lost function be restored. Treatment will depend on the type and severity of the condition. In milder forms of spina bifida, no treatment is necessary, although in some cases surgery may be indicated when children are older. In cases of myelomeningocele, it is essential to prevent infection of exposed tissues and protect them from trauma. In addition to surgery, various devices can be used to facilitate movement and increase the autonomy of affected children. In the case of hydrocephalus, a shunt is implanted to drain the cerebrospinal fluid. Physiotherapy is an important complement to the treatment of this condition.  //Importance of surgery in children with spina bifida// As a rule, children with spina bifida will undergo surgery to close the defect and minimize the risk of infection and/or trauma. Some clinical centers perform prenatal surgery, even in the womb. The theoretical advantage is earlier correction of the defect and a better prognosis. However, this is still an experimental procedure. In about 20 to 50% of cases of myelomeningocele, there is a progressive blockage of the spinal cord, which becomes attached to other structures, such as the vertebrae, placing the spinal cord under tension as the child grows. This results in loss of muscle function in the legs and urinary and fecal incontinence. Surgery is essential to release this blockage and prevent further neurological deterioration in the person with spina bifida. //Prevention// Folic acid intake is an essential aspect of preventing the development of spina bifida. All women of childbearing age should ingest around 400 micrograms daily, either through their diet or through multivitamins. In the case of women with spina bifida or who have already had a child with spina bifida, a daily intake of a higher dose of folic acid is recommended before considering pregnancy.

Spondyloarthritis,"//What is it?// It is the name given to a family of rheumatic inflammatory diseases that cause arthritis. The most common form is ankylosing spondylitis, which mainly affects the spine. This group of pathologies includes reactive arthritis, psoriasis arthritis and arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel diseases (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease). They affect around 0.6% to 1.9% of the population and ankylosing spondylitis occurs in between 0.1% and 1.4% of people. In Portugal the prevalence is unknown. However, some data suggest that 2.5 to 3 million Portuguese people suffer from rheumatic disease, of which 60 thousand have spondyloarthritis. Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory disease that mainly affects young men, around the age of 20, affecting the sacroiliac joints, the spine and peripheral joints. The most affected region tends to be the sacrum and iliac region and in some cases it can progressively progress to ossification and ankylosis, in which the vertebrae fuse together. All of these pathologies have an important impact on quality of life and incapacity for work. In the population over 50 years of age, rheumatic diseases account for approximately half of chronic illnesses. //Symptoms// The main symptom is pain in the lower back and sometimes swelling in the legs and arms. Spondyloarthritis differs from other types of arthritis because it involves the ligaments and tendons, causing inflammation, pain and stiffness. When the inflammatory process continues without treatment, bone destruction occurs, with deformation of the spine and loss of mobility in the shoulders and hips. Many patients also have osteoporosis, which increases the risk of fractures. Eye inflammation (uveitis) is also common (with an incidence of 40%) and causes pain, blurred vision and redness. In some cases, there may be inflammation of the aortic valve, psoriasis or intestinal inflammation. //Causes// The causes are not well known. Ankylosing spondylitis is hereditary and is associated with several genes. Of these, the most common is HLA-B27, which is used in the diagnosis of this disease. In the case of inflammatory bowel diseases, their origin is not clear and may be related to the presence of bacteria that cause inflammation in this organ. Chlamydia is one of them. //Diagnosis// It essentially involves a medical examination, laboratory tests, imaging tests (such as radiographic studies or magnetic resonance imaging) and radiological studies, which are very relevant for the investigation of HLA-B27 when ankylosing spondylitis is suspected. //Treatment// Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can help relieve pain, stiffness, and swelling. In some cases, corticosteroid injections into the affected joints may be helpful. Sulfasalazine can also help reduce symptoms and prevent joint damage. Biological therapies are newer and are useful in patients who respond poorly to anti-inflammatory drugs. Exercise and physiotherapy are important as a complement to medical treatment. In more advanced cases, when joint destruction has occurred, surgery may be helpful. //Prevention// Although primary prevention is not possible, secondary prevention resulting from early or timely recognition of the disease allows a broad field of action in which it is possible to improve diagnostic sensitivity and adopt correct treatment strategies that may, in early stages, determine large differences in functional prognosis in the medium term.

Ankylosing spondylitis,"//What is it?// Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic rheumatic disease of an inflammatory nature. Its name is due to the fact that the vertebrae become inflamed and “weld” together, causing ankylosis (fusion) of the spine and sacroiliac joints (those that connect the lower part of the spine with the pelvis). The result ends up being limited mobility and loss of flexibility in the spine (it becomes more rigid). Worldwide, ankylosing spondylitis (AS) affects, on average, one in every 200 individuals. It usually appears between the ages of 20 and 30, and is rare after the age of 45. It is more prevalent in men than in women. When it occurs in women, it usually has a more favorable evolution. Although, in most cases, it appears in isolation, it can appear associated with other clinical conditions, such as psoriasis or inflammatory bowel diseases. //Symptoms// Ankylosing spondylitis manifests itself gradually with severe pain, difficult to define but mainly in the lumbar region, accompanied by difficulty in mobilizing, stiffness and muscle weakness. Stiffness: difficulty in moving the spine, more intense in the morning upon waking, lasting more than 30 minutes and can last for hours.;/ Inflammatory back pain: pain in the dorsal spine, more intense at night;/ Inflammatory low back pain: pain in the lower back, more intense in the morning and at night, in bed. Improves with movement and physical exercise.;/ Pseudo-sciatica: pain in the buttocks (gluteal pain) and sometimes in the back of the thighs, alternating between the right and left side (swaying pain).;/ Talalgia: pain in the heel region caused by inflammation of the Achilles tendon and plantar fascia.;/ Tendinitis: inflammation of the tendons, which causes swelling and pain in the Achilles tendon and patellar tendon (in front of the knee).;/ Peripheral arthritis: inflammation of the joints, which predominantly affects the lower limbs (hip, knee and ankle).;/ Red eye: inflammation of the eye (uveitis), which requires urgent treatment to avoid sequelae, such as decreased vision.;/ As it is a systemic disease, ankylosing spondylitis can affect other organs, such as the lungs and heart. Lung function may suffer a decrease, caused by reduced chest elasticity, which is an additional reason why those suffering from ankylosing spondylitis should not smoke. //Causes// The causes behind ankylosing spondylitis are still unknown; It is known, however, that there is an association between this disease and the HLA-B27 antigen (a genetic marker), which appears to trigger an abnormal response to the action of certain microorganisms. This is probably the process that triggers the disease. //Diagnosis// The diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis is made based on physical symptoms and observation of the patient. Blood tests may be necessary to rule out other pathologies and allow genetic typing to search for HLA-B27 can help to strengthen the diagnosis, although it can also be associated with other diseases. X-rays of the pelvis and spine allow us to check for changes in the sacroiliac joints and vertebrae, however, these changes are generally very late in relation to the onset of symptoms. When diagnosis and treatment of AS are early, most patients have a good quality of life and joint stiffness rarely becomes disabling. //Treatment// As a rheumatic, chronic and progressive disease, treatment objectives include relieving pain and stiffness, maintaining good joint function, avoiding deformities and enabling a good quality of life. Drugs: These include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, sometimes sulfasalazine or methotrexate. Recently, biological treatments have emerged that specifically target the components of the immune response involved in the disease and can be used when traditional medication is not effective.;/ Rehabilitation: One of the most important aspects of treatment is daily rehabilitation exercises for the spine and breathing, in order to strengthen the muscles and prevent stiffness and loss of mobility.;/ Surgery: It has a limited role in treatment, but prosthetics may be necessary when there is a very damaged joint (most common at the hip).;/  //Daily care:// When you wake up, take a long, hot shower to relieve morning stiffness.;/ Do exercises to mobilize your spine and do breathing training every day, preferably after bathing.;/ Maintain correct posture (standing or sitting).;/ Avoid sitting for hours, getting up frequently.;/ When sitting, keep your knees higher than your hips, avoid crossing your legs and sitting on the edge of the chair.;/ Don't smoke - doing so worsens the prognosis of the disease.;/ Avoid carrying excess weight, which puts strain on the spine. Carry your shopping in two bags, one in each hand.;/ Wear simple, practical clothing and shoes should not have high heels, which increase lordosis in the lumbar spine.;/ Adapt the home to your capabilities, to remain as autonomous and active as possible.;/ National Ankylosing Spondylitis Association, April 2019 Portuguese Institute of Rheumatology NARCISO, Lurdes.

Spondylolisthesis,"//What is it?// Spondylolisthesis occurs when one of the vertebrae in the spine slips from its normal position, usually moving forward over the vertebra immediately below it. It is most common in the lower back. Spondylolysis, an associated condition, corresponds to a defect in the pars interarticularis (small segment of bone that joins the facets of a vertebra) of a vertebra.  Spondylolisthesis is divided into types and degrees, based on its origin: Type I: In some cases, people are born with spondylolisthesis. A child may also develop the condition naturally during development. In both situations, there may not be any symptoms until later in life.;/ Type II:  The most common, occurs when there is a problem with a section of the vertebra called the pars interarticularis. Type II fractures only become spondylolisthesis if they force the vertebra to move forward. Type II includes: IIA, which involves microfractures caused by excessive use of the vertebrae and hyperextension; IIB, which includes many microfractures that heal with the formation of extra bone, causing stretching and misalignment; IIC corresponds to a complete fracture caused by trauma (sports injury or accident);;/ IIA which involves microfractures caused by overuse of the vertebrae and hyperextension;;/ IIB which includes many microfractures that heal with extra bone formation, causing stretching and misalignment;;/ IIC corresponds to a complete fracture caused by trauma (sports injury or accident);;/ Type III:  It is associated with aging and natural bone wear;;/ Type IV: This is a fracture that occurs in any area of ​​the vertebra, except in the pars interarticularis region;;/ Type V: Due to tumors in the vertebrae;;/ Type VI: This is a rare spondylolisthesis caused by weakening after surgery.;/  This pathology is also classified into degrees according to the percentage of anterior sliding of the vertebral body: Grau 1: 25%;/ Grade 2: Between 25% and 50%;/ Grade 3: Between 50% and 75%;/ Grade 4: Between 75% and 100%;/ Grade 5: The vertebral body appears completely disconnected;/ //Symptoms// In many people, spondylolisthesis has no symptoms. In reality, although this condition often develops early in adolescence, it is typically not detected until adulthood. Children and teenagers often endure low back pain for many years before being evaluated by a doctor. Some studies report that 2.3 to 10% of the population with spondylolysis is generally asymptomatic. However, around 25% of patients with this defect may experience low back pain. The pain usually spreads along the lumbar spine and may resemble a muscle spasm. Spondylolisthesis can cause spasms that cause stiffness in the spine and muscles, which is associated with changes in posture. If the slippage is significant, nerve compression and narrowing of the spinal canal can occur. Some of the most common signs of spondylolisthesis include: Difficulty walking or running:;/ Pain in the lower back or buttocks;/ Pain in the back of one or both legs;/ Weakness in one or both legs;/ Lower back and leg pain aggravated by movement;/ Increased inward curve of the spine (lordosis);/ //Causes// There may be a hereditary basis - it is possible to be born with thinner vertebral bone, which makes it more vulnerable, and periods of rapid growth can encourage slippage (spondylolisthesis). The risk decreases in middle age and increases again between the ages of 60 and 80. In addition to these factors, all activities that require hyper-extension or hyper-flexion of the lumbar spine increase the risk of these conditions occurring. Some sports, such as gymnastics, weightlifting or football, put a lot of pressure on the bones in the lumbar spine, which increases the risk of a fracture on one side of a vertebra. Typical causes include: Fractures;/ Joint injury;/ Degeneration (overuse of the vertebrae or aging);/ Congenital bone defect;/ Spondylosis, defect or fracture in the pars interarticularis region;;/ Tumors;/ Surgery;/ //Diagnosis// The radiographic study confirms the presence of spondylolisthesis, that is, a fracture at the level of the vertebra. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging provide more detail about the fractured vertebra, its potential for slippage and the possible presence of nerve compression. Sometimes the images on an X-ray appear normal and it is these tests that allow the correct diagnosis to be made. The tests should be repeated regularly to check whether the vertebra is changing position. //Treatment// Fusion (union) of the segments involved and their instrumentation (implants) are the surgical procedures indicated to correct the deformity and achieve stability. This procedure is performed under general anesthesia, in a two to three-day hospital stay. Surgical intervention should be considered when there is an associated neurological deficit and/or progression of listhesis or if low back pain does not respond to treatment and interferes with daily activities. However, most people respond well to conservative treatment, which consists of a period of rest, with possible trunk stabilization orthosis (placement of a joint stabilizing device), followed by physiotherapy with exercises that focus on flexion, abdominal muscle strengthening, tendon stretching and specific exercises for dynamic stabilization of the lumbar spine. In addition to rest, anti-inflammatories are very useful. //Prevention// This condition cannot be completely prevented. However, it is known that certain activities, such as gymnastics, weightlifting and football, increase stress on the vertebrae and therefore increase the risk of spondylolisthesis. They should therefore be avoided. If not properly treated, this condition is associated with chronic pain in the spine or legs, as well as tingling or weakness in the legs. More severe compression of the nerves can cause loss of control of the sphincters, but this complication is rare. The prognosis is generally good and most cases recover with conservative treatment.

Spondylosis osteoarthritis of the spine,"//What is it?// Spondylosis is a form of degenerative (aging) disease of the joints of the spine. It primarily affects the intervertebral discs, and also the interapophyseal joints and ligaments of the spine. //Symptoms// The typical symptom of spondylosis is lumbago, back pain of varying severity. Standing usually aggravates the complaints, which are relieved by lying down. Other symptoms include stiffness, limited mobility and deformity of the spine, as well as osteoarthritis involving other joints (hip and knees). Although the joint aging process is inevitable, the symptoms progress unpredictably and may even disappear temporarily or even permanently. //Diagnosis// X-rays may show arthritic changes in the spine, such as collapse of the disc space, bone spicules (“parrot beaks”), hypertrophy of the interapophyseal joints or slippage of one vertebra over another (spondylolisthesis), but the specificity of these changes is limited since they are present in most people, even if they are asymptomatic. Computed Axial Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) may be indicated in some cases. //Treatment// Conservative, non-surgical treatment is indicated in most cases and is effective. The modalities consist of physiotherapy, modification of daily activity, weight loss, orthotics, anti-inflammatories and analgesics, and oral corticosteroids. In selected cases, joint injections, nerve blocks or radiofrequency may provide lasting symptomatic relief. Surgery (fusion or arthroplasty) is only very rarely indicated in these cases.

Heel spur,"//What is it?// A heel spur is a small projection of bone that forms on the heel bone, the calcaneus. It results from intense pressure on the sole of the foot over long periods of time. During walking, each heel alternately supports the weight of the entire body. This load is relieved by layers of tissue located under the heel. When you practice sports without adequate warm-up, you can overload the calf muscles and the Achilles tendon, which is inserted into the heel bone. When this tendon is under stress, this pressure is transmitted to the sole of the foot, causing inflammation or small tears in the tissues. During rest, the muscles in the sole of the foot contract to try to protect the affected area and the pain gradually decreases, returning after walking or running again. To compensate for this repeated injury, the body will attempt a repair process similar to that which occurs after a fracture, creating bone tissue around the inflamed area. This is how the projection of bone called a “heel spur” is formed. The calcaneal spur itself does not cause pain and is just the result of a process of continued overload. The pain results from inflammation of adjacent structures. It is estimated that 11 to 27% of the population have radiographic evidence of a calcaneal spur, which is not always associated with pain. Women are more affected and calcaneal spurs are more common in older people, especially after 40 years of age, and overweight. //Symptoms// Heel spurs are characterized by intense pain in the lower or inner region of the heel. When the weight of the body is placed on the affected heel, the pain is severe enough to cause immediate immobilization of walking. This pain eases with rest, worsens with exertion and tends to be more pronounced in the morning. The nerves and capillaries adapt as you walk, which is why the pain is worse at the beginning of the walk. When you rest, the capillaries and nerves also rest. As soon as you start walking again, the level of demand on the blood vessels and nerves increases, causing the pain to return until these structures adapt to the spur again. Walking on hard surfaces or carrying heavy objects, such as a backpack, increases the pain. A jump makes the pain more intense. The pain may be more localized at first but tends to cover the entire heel. In extreme cases, this pain can interfere with daily activities. //Causes// Heel spurs are more common in older people, especially after 40 years of age, and in those who are overweight. Osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, circulatory failure and other degenerative diseases are also associated with an increased risk of heel spurs. There may be a genetic tendency for this condition. The presence of “flat feet” or a very pronounced plantar arch also increases the risk of developing heel spurs. When it comes to sport, long-distance running is an important factor. Running on the beach or on steep surfaces also makes it more likely to develop a heel spur. //Diagnosis// The diagnosis is based on a medical examination and is confirmed by X-ray or magnetic resonance imaging, which allows other causes of pain, such as gout or arthritis, to be ruled out. //Treatment// Calcaneal spurs can be difficult to treat. However, in many cases, the changes are discrete and recover over time. Treatment involves rest, use of ice, compression of the affected area and elevation of the lower limb. In some cases, heat is beneficial in relieving pain. Anti-inflammatories help control pain and inflammation. Sometimes a corticosteroid injection into the affected area can be helpful. The heel can be supported by using a special sole, which must be prescribed by the doctor. Some cases benefit from treatments such as diathermy or ultrasound. Surgery allows the spur to be removed and is indicated when more conservative measures are not effective. //Prevention// Warming up before starting any sporting activity is essential. It is equally important to maintain adequate levels of activity without overexertion or overload. Maintaining a healthy weight helps reduce pressure on your heels.

Schizophrenia,"//What is it?// Schizophrenia is a serious, chronic and disabling psychiatric illness, often incorrectly described as a ""personality split"". It profoundly affects a person's way of thinking, their emotional life and their behavior in general. In addition to the patient himself, everyone around him suffers from this pathology, given the difficulties in social, family and professional relationships that it causes. Schizophrenics are rarely violent, although delusions of persecution and drug use increase this risk. When violence does occur, it usually involves family members and occurs within the home. The risk of suicide is significant: around 10%, especially young male adults, die by suicide. There are several types, although a patient rarely fits into just one of them. In Portugal, in the 2001 Psychiatric Census, schizophrenia was, in all hospitalizations, consultations and emergencies, the most frequent illnesses (21.2%), being the main cause of hospitalization and the third in consultations. It affects around 1% of the population and tends to appear in late adolescence. Although it does not distinguish between sexes, races or cultures, the most affected populations are rural populations and social groups with low socioeconomic and cultural levels. The disease appears earlier in males (between 15 and 25 years of age) and later in females (between 25 and 30 years of age). It is a pathology that rarely occurs after the age of 45. //Symptoms// The symptoms of schizophrenia are very diverse and complex and, in general, reflect a loss of contact with reality. Hallucinations: auditory, visual or olfactory. The patient is often convinced that others can read his thoughts, control them, or that they wish to harm him. This conviction terrifies him, tending to move away or become very agitated.;/ Confused speech: Often makes no sense and may stop suddenly in the middle of a sentence. Thoughts tend to be very disorganized.;/ Movement changes: The patient may sit for hours without moving or speaking, or repeat certain movements over and over again. At other times, the patient may appear to be perfectly fine.;/  Some symptoms of schizophrenia are more vague: Absence of expression in the voice or face while the patient speaks;/ Lack of pleasure in daily activities;/ Inability to initiate and maintain planned tasks;/ Difficulty understanding information, making decisions, or staying focused;/ Inability to use information immediately after learning it;/ //Causes// Genetics are important in schizophrenia. Although the disease affects about 1% of the population, it affects 10% of people who have a first-degree relative with the condition. It is thought that in many cases, an interaction between genetics and the environment is necessary for the disease to develop, although these interactions are not well understood. Another possible origin is a chemical imbalance in the brain, with regard to the neurotransmitters dopamine and glutamate. These substances allow different areas of the brain to communicate with each other and, as such, their balance is fundamental. Differences in the brain structure of 52 patients with schizophrenia were also identified. These changes can occur during brain development and only manifest themselves at puberty. //Diagnosis// The occurrence of schizophrenia in younger age groups makes it difficult to diagnose, because many of the symptoms correspond to typical behavioral changes in young people (lower academic performance, change of friends, sleep disorders, irritability). However, some factors, when combined, make it possible to predict up to 80% of young people who are at risk of developing schizophrenia: isolation, withdrawal, increased number of thoughts and suspicions, and family history of psychosis. However, there are no specific tests that can diagnose schizophrenia. In addition to the medical evaluation and clinical history, the health professional requests some tests to exclude other diseases that can also cause the same symptoms. This assessment is essential because the manifestations of schizophrenia are complex, sometimes poorly defined and may be associated with facts that have nothing to do with the disease. Psychiatric evaluation is essential to assess whether sufficient criteria for a diagnosis of schizophrenia are present. //Treatment// Treatment for schizophrenia focuses on eliminating symptoms, using medication and psychotherapy. There are several antipsychotic drugs available, and the psychiatrist must select the most appropriate one for each case. Some of them have significant side effects and must be carefully monitored. Each patient responds differently to treatment, and it is often necessary to test different medications and doses. It is very important never to interrupt or stop treatment without medical advice. Psychotherapy is useful for patients who have already stabilized, helping them to reintegrate into their daily activities.  //What is the prognosis for schizophrenia?// Although there is no cure yet, its prognosis is improving. New therapies allow for a life with more quality and autonomy. The success of schizophrenia treatment depends on the involvement of family and loved ones, so that they can facilitate the patient's adaptation to their condition and so that everyone can learn more about the disease. //Prevention// Although there is no proven way to prevent it, there do appear to be ways to make it less likely by controlling the consequences of some important life events such as postpartum depression, traumatic childhood experiences and drug use.

Canal stenosis,"//What is it?// It is defined by a decrease in the size of the foramen (hole), which causes compression of the spinal cord, that is, of the nerves in the affected region. It is more common in the lumbar region and can cause a variety of symptoms, including pain, weakness and numbness, especially in the lower limbs. //Symptoms// People with this condition may experience the following symptoms in their legs or feet: Dor;/ Numbness;/ Muscle weakness;/ Changes in the sexual organs;/ Difficulty walking;/ These symptoms may start slowly and worsen over time. In severe cases, the person may experience partial or complete paralysis of the leg. This is a medical emergency and requires urgent hospital treatment. //Causes// It occurs when the spaces between the vertebrae, or bones of the spine, narrow, which compresses the spinal canal, causing disruption to the spinal cord and nerve roots. It can result from a narrow spinal canal, spinal injuries and trauma, tumors, bone diseases, previous spinal surgeries, and rheumatoid arthritis. //Diagnosis// The doctor or rheumatologist asks the patient about their symptoms and medical history. They then perform a physical examination, which may be supplemented by: Spinal X-ray to detect osteoarthritic changes;/ Magnetic resonance imaging;/ CT scan to check for changes in the tissues in and around the spinal canal;/ Myelogram in which an injection of dye into the spine differentiates various types of tissue;/ Electromyogram in which an electrode measures electrical activity in nerves and muscles;/ Your doctor may also order other tests, such as blood tests. //Treatment// Laminectomy is a surgical procedure that consists of the total or partial removal of the lamina (bony structure) with the aim of eliminating pressure on the nerve structures. Phomaninectomy consists of the total or partial removal of the foramen wall to relieve pressure on the nerve root. These procedures are performed under general anesthesia, with a hospital stay of two to three days. //Prevention// It is not really preventable but the risk can be reduced by: Regular exercise: Strengthens the muscles that support your lower back and helps keep your spine flexible.

Cervical stenosis,"//What is it?// Cervical canal stenosis is the tightening of neurological structures in the spinal (cervical) canal due to a decrease in the area available for these structures. These structures include the spinal cord as well as the nerve roots that exit the spine at each level from the base of the skull to the end of the spine. These nerves/roots will motor and sensory innervate not only the limbs but also the bladder and intestines. Compression of the spinal cord and cervical nerve roots will compromise some of the functions of the spinal cord, causing a variety of clinical symptoms including pain, stiffness, changes in sensitivity and even muscle strength in the upper and lower limbs. The spinal cord involvement can even compromise the functions of the bladder and intestines. It is a progressive disease that can have devastating consequences if not identified and treated promptly. Cervical stenosis consists of a narrowing of the spinal canal, compromising the spinal cord and/or nerve roots. In most cases, it occurs as a result of a natural aging process of the spine that leads to protrusion of the intervertebral discs, hypertrophy of the intervertebral joints and thickening of the ligaments, resulting in a decrease in the diameter of the spinal canal, which leads to deterioration of the spinal cord (myelopathy). //Symptoms// Symptoms of cervical myelopathy include loss of manual dexterity, balance and coordination, muscle weakness, spasticity and difficulty walking. Many people over 50 years of age have reduced cervical canal dimensions without having any complaints. The stenosed cervical canal only gives symptoms when there is compression of the spinal cord or cervical nerve roots but the symptoms usually appear slowly and gradually and are essentially: neck stiffness and pain with or without muscle weakness of the shoulder, arm, forearm or hand;/ changes in balance and motor coordination such as shuffling gait and frequent stumbling;/ loss of control of urine and feces (in more severe cases);/ Occasionally, and in the context of a diagnosed cervical stenotic canal, we may see a sudden worsening of the symptoms with a very exuberant picture of spinal ataxia and motor and balance incoordination that can set in within a few hours, only requiring urgent surgical intervention for decompression. //Causes// Cervical canal stenosis is generally caused by age-related changes, particularly in the shape/alignment and size of the spinal canal, most commonly in people over 50 years of age. The aging of the discs can cause diffuse disc protrusion as well as calcification of the ligamentous insertions (parrot's beak). This aging process of the intervertebral discs also affects the interapophyseal facets with the typical wear of osteoarthritis processes (without cartilage). All these degenerative changes contribute to the reduction of the free area within the spinal canal at this level, thus causing tightening and compression of the neurological structures. In rare cases the cervical canal is stenotic from birth, taking into account the dimensions of the vertebrae themselves. //Diagnosis// Once a compatible clinical condition has been diagnosed, the patient must undergo imaging tests – X-ray, Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Tomography. However, the doctor must order a series of blood tests to help exclude other diseases with similar symptoms, namely Multiple Sclerosis and Vitamin B12 deficiency. //Treatment// In less severe cases, symptoms can be controlled with the use of medication to relieve pain, physiotherapy to maintain muscle strength and flexibility, and moist heat to reduce muscle spasm. If the symptoms are severe enough, there is often a progressive decrease in muscle strength and in this circumstance we should consider surgical treatment to decompress the neurological structures. This type of surgery can be performed either in front of or behind the cervical spine, depending essentially on where the greatest compressive component is located. In selected cases, epidural injections (interlaminar or transforaminal) may provide lasting symptomatic relief. Due to the progressive nature of the disease, surgical decompression of the spinal cord is the indicated treatment. It can be performed via the anterior or posterior approach, depending on the characteristics of the disease, the patient, and the surgeon's preference. Options include microdiscectomy or corporectomy and anterior arthrodesis, laminoplasty, and laminectomy (with or without posterior fusion). Some surgical techniques to achieve decompression end up removing more movement from the cervical spine and thus making it an even more rigid spine (anterior cervical arthrodesis with or without corporectomy), but other techniques exist in which it is possible to widen the dimensions of the cervical canal while preserving the mobility of this segment of the spine (laminoplasty).

Carotid stenosis,"//What is it?// The carotid arteries are the two main arteries in the neck, which run from the heart and supply the brain with oxygen-rich blood. With age, atheroma plaques (accumulation of fat, a process called atherosclerosis) accumulate within the carotid arteries, which can lead to their narrowing and reduced ease with which blood circulates. This phenomenon - which can occur in one or both arteries - is called carotid stenosis. Typically, plaque buildup occurs in the area where the carotid artery bifurcates. Carotid stenosis increases the risk of stroke, depending on how narrow the artery is. Small clots can form next to atheroma plaques that break off and travel to the brain, causing a stroke. //Symptoms// Carotid stenosis often does not cause early symptoms and progresses silently, especially in situations where the blockage develops slowly over years. Therefore, this disease is often discovered in the course of routine diagnostic examinations. Sometimes, this problem can cause tinnitus or fainting, as a result of a reduced blood supply to the brain, which can be earlier signs, but difficult to interpret, which the patient himself does not know how to report accurately. The first signs of carotid stenosis may even be a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) - which occurs when a clot briefly blocks the artery that supplies blood to the brain - such as weakness or numbness on one side of the body, face lying on one side, difficulty speaking and sudden loss of vision in one eye. When faced with these symptoms, it is essential to contact an emergency medical service, as quick care can not only save the person's life, but increase the likelihood of full recovery. The side of the body that is affected by the symptoms gives the doctor very important information about the problem. When carotid stenosis is associated with the left-sided artery, vision loss should occur on the left side and weakness and numbness or drooping face should affect the right side of the body. When carotid stenosis occurs in the right artery, exactly the opposite happens, that is, it is contralateral. //Causes// Aging is a risk factor for carotid stenosis, and may be increased by other factors, such as: Smoking history;/ High blood pressure;/ High cholesterol and triglycerides;/ Heart disease;/ Diabetes;/ Obesity and sedentary lifestyle;/  Furthermore, the development of atherosclerosis may also be associated with a family history of this problem, as well as a high-fat diet. Those who suffer from coronary artery disease and atherosclerosis in other blood vessels also have a higher risk of carotid stenosis. People who have undergone radiation therapy to treat head and neck cancer may also develop carotid stenosis due to the effects of radiation. //Diagnosis// Because carotid stenosis may not cause early symptoms, it is important that individuals who are at higher risk are monitored regularly. It is common to diagnose carotid stenosis when trying to diagnose other diseases, such as through an X-ray of the cervical spine. It may also be associated with obstruction in the artery that supplies blood to the retina. The attending physician's assessment includes listening to the heart and some blood vessels with a stethoscope. Certain sounds emitted by the carotid artery may raise suspicions of obstruction due to plaque build-up inside it. In these cases, the patient should be referred to Vascular Surgery, who will conduct a detailed investigation of the symptoms and clinical history and perform the necessary additional assessment. Some tests that may be recommended in the diagnosis of carotid stenosis are: Non-invasive duplex ultrasound of the carotid arteries: this imaging test is the most common for diagnosing carotid stenosis and allows you to check whether there is any narrowing of the arteries (uni or bilateral).;/ Computed tomography (CT scan or CT scan): When it is suspected that the person may have had a stroke or TIA, a CT scan may be prescribed. This exam allows you to obtain 3D images and check for damage to the brain. It may be necessary to inject intravenous contrast.;/ Magnetic resonance angiography: is a type of magnetic resonance imaging that allows you to visualize the carotid arteries and assess the degree of stenosis.;/ Angiogram or angiography: is an invasive procedure that consists of introducing a catheter into the blood vessels through the leg or arm, guided with the help of X-ray equipment. It also includes the use of contrast, injected intravenously. This examination not only allows you to check whether there is narrowing of the arteries, but also to assess the risk of stroke and determine whether treatment is necessary.;/ //Treatment// Treatment for carotid stenosis aims to reduce the risk of stroke and is tailored to the severity of each case. It may include: Medication: Several drugs are usually combined to slow the progression of atheromatosis. These may include, for example, acetylsalicylic acid (or aspirin, which thins the blood) or medications to control blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides and blood sugar.;/ Smoking cessation: stopping smoking is essential in controlling carotid stenosis and preventing stroke and TIA.;/ Surgery: when the degree of narrowing of the artery is severe, in addition to taking medications, surgical treatment may be necessary. Surgical procedures include carotid endarterectomy (removes the plaque that accumulates in the arteries) or carotid angioplasty with stent (through catheterization through the leg or arm, a balloon is inserted that inflates and allows the placement of a flexible metal stent that maintains the open/unobstructed artery).;/  The basis of treatment should also be a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, regular physical exercise and limiting alcohol consumption. Regular monitoring of the patient is very important, allowing, for example, medication adjustments and assessment of disease progression, even after surgical treatment. //Prevention// There are several strategies that can be put into practice not only to prevent, but also to slow the progression of carotid stenosis, thus reducing the risk of stroke: No smoking.;/ Maintain a healthy weight. Being overweight contributes to other risk factors for carotid stenosis, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, sleep apnea, and cardiovascular disease.;/ Regularly exercising: increases HDL cholesterol levels (the ""good"" cholesterol), lowers blood pressure levels and improves cardiovascular health in general.;/ Eat fruits and vegetables: they are rich in nutrients such as potassium, antioxidants and folic acid, which reduce the risk of stroke and TIA.;/ Moderate your intake of saturated fat, thus helping to reduce the build-up of plaque in the arteries.;/ Limit salt to control blood pressure levels.;/ Limit alcohol consumption.;/ Keep chronic illnesses, such as diabetes and high blood pressure, under control.;/ American Association of Neurological Surgeons, janeiro de 2022 Cleveland Clinic, January 2022 Mayo Clinic, January 2022 Society for Vascular Surgery, janeiro de 2022 About us;/ Events;/ Clients and Companions;/ News;/ CUF Academic Center;/ Partnerships;/ Contacts;/ Frequently Asked Questions;/ Join us;/ Virtual Visit;/ English version;/ My CUF;/ Access Solutions and Health Plans;/ Facebook;/ Facebook Instagram;/ Instagram LinkedInCreated with Sketch.;/ LinkedIn Youtube;/ Youtube award4;/ award4 certification1;/ certification1 certification2;/ certification2 certification3;/ certification3 Complaints and compliments;/ Complaints and compliments Privacy and Cookies Policy;/ Terms and Conditions;/ Whistleblower Channel;/ © CUF 2024 All rights reserved Home;/ Health A-Z: Diseases, Symptoms and Treatments;/"
Lumbar stenosis,"//What is it?// Lumbar stenosis consists of a narrowing of the spinal canal, compromising the spinal cord and/or nerve roots. In most cases, it occurs as a result of a natural aging process of the spine that leads to bulging of the intervertebral discs, hypertrophy of the intervertebral joints and thickening of the ligaments, resulting in a decrease in the diameter of the spinal canal. //Symptoms// Lumbar stenosis is manifested by pain or decreased strength in the lower limbs that worsens when standing or walking and is relieved by sitting, leaning forward or lying down. Symptoms are typically more evident when descending than when ascending inclines. Unlike herniated discs, which can appear acutely, lumbar stenosis begins insidiously, worsening as the degenerative process progresses, and may only manifest itself when the narrowing is already particularly significant. //Diagnosis// X-ray allows an initial assessment of the spine and the definitive diagnosis is given by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and alternatively or complementary to Computerized Axial Tomography (CT). //Treatment// Conservative, non-surgical treatment is successful in some patients and may be attempted initially. Treatment options include anti-inflammatory and analgesic medications, oral corticosteroids, orthoses and physiotherapy. In selected cases, epidural injections (interlaminar or transforaminal) may provide lasting symptomatic relief. Due to the nature of the disease and the degree of spinal canal involvement, conservative treatment tends to be less successful than for disc herniation. Surgical treatment (laminectomy, laminotomy and/or foraminectomy) involves removing the bone, ligaments and intervertebral disc that contribute to the stenosis, decompressing the nerve structures. In cases of instability, it may be necessary to promote intervertebral fusion using bone grafts, screws and metal bars. These procedures can be performed using conventional or minimally invasive techniques. Back pain and injuries are complex and debilitating conditions. Less invasive surgical techniques allow for better treatment of the patient and facilitate recovery. When we use our cell phones, we tend to adopt a posture where we are looking down.

Urethral strictures,"//What is it?// Urethral strictures or squeezing are a narrowing of the caliber of the urethra. This problem can greatly affect men's quality of life. Patients complain of difficulty urinating, sometimes requiring straining, with a weak urinary stream. In the most serious cases, the patient is unable to completely empty the bladder or is even experiencing urinary retention requiring the placement of a probe or catheter (through the urethra or in the suprapubic region, below the navel). There is a small difference in nomenclature regarding this pathology. When the scar involves the neck of the bladder it is called neck contracture, in the prostatic and membranous urethra (sphincter) it is called urethral stricture. When it involves the remaining urethra, it is called urethral tightness. //Symptoms// These tightness are formed by a scar that replaces the normal tissue (urethra and corpus spongiosum, that is, a very vascularized tissue that surrounds most of the urethra). These scars result from attacks such as inflammation, infections (e.g. urethritis) or a disease called Lichen Sclerosus (formerly known as Xerotic Balanitis) or trauma such as severe pelvis fractures or local interventions or procedures (e.g. catheterizations, surgeries through the urethra or urethra surgeries). ). //Diagnosis// Your doctor/urologist will take a detailed history to try to determine what may have caused the urethra to tighten. During the physical exam, he or she will try to look for the urethra scar, if there are signs of urinary retention (full and palpable bladder) or if there are signs of tightness of the meatus (urine exit hole) or Lichen Sclerosus disease. The tests that can be performed are: Uroflowmetry (the patient urinates into a specific device, with a type of funnel, which evaluates the strength of the urinary stream and the time it takes the patient to urinate, allowing conclusions to be drawn about the existence of obstructions caused by the prostate/cervix bladder or tightness of the urethra);/ Urethrocystoscopy (endoscopic examination with a lens that enters the urethra and allows visualization of the site of the stricture and assessment of whether the stricture is partial or complete, but often does not allow correct assessment of the length or extent of this stricture);/ Retrograde and pervoiding urethrography (this is the most important examination, it consists of taking several x-rays of the urethra, with injection of a product through the urethra, and allows the length and degree of tightness of the urethra to be assessed).;/ //Treatment// There are no pills that can solve this problem. Traditionally, treatments involved dilating or cutting the urethra (internal urethrotomies). Although these treatments are still used today, in some cases the long-term success rate is low, ranging from 0-9% after 3 years. Currently, the recommended treatment for most of these problems is urethroplasty. Urethroplasty may consist of excision of the diseased urethral segment and primary anastomosis (i.e., joining the ends of the urethra with sutures) or urethroplasty using grafts or flaps. Urethroplasty techniques offer the greatest probability of long-term treatment effectiveness (85-90% for simple cases and 80% for complex cases). Urethroplasty with excision and primary anastomosis This technique is only used in the bulbar urethra and for tightness less than 2 cm in length. It is 86% effective at 15 years. This surgery has been practiced for many years but, more recently, some disadvantages that may arise with this technique have been highlighted, such as: ejaculation problems;/ decreased sensitivity of the glans or ""cold glans"";/ shortening of the penis or downward bending of the penis (cordé);/ impotence (1%);/ Therefore, many urologists argue that even in these cases, a urethroplasty with graft should be performed. Urethroplasty with grafts or flaps In these techniques, the diseased segment is not excised. Instead, local tissue or tissue taken from another part of the body is used to increase the caliber of the urethra. Flap urethroplasties involve the use of local skin (usually from the penis or foreskin) and are only used for urethral strictures. They are less commonly used today, mainly due to the disadvantage of frequently causing urethral bulges or pouches (urethral diverticula) in the urethra, which can be uncomfortable and cause other problems such as infections. The skin may also contain hairs that remain inside the ""new urethra"", causing discomfort or facilitating infections. Buccal mucosa urethroplasties have become the most widely used technique because they can be applied to almost all types of urethral strictures and locations without causing the problems that other techniques present. Buccal mucosa (tissue taken from the inner side of the cheek) is the body tissue that is best suited for plastic reconstructive surgeries for urethral strictures. Finally, most surgeries to repair tightness of the urethra can be performed in a single surgery (1 stage), however there are more complex situations in which it is necessary to perform the surgery in 2 stages. In the first surgery, the diseased urethra is left open (with or without replacement of the diseased tissue) and in a second surgery, a few months later, it is closed, that is, the urethra is transformed back into a normal-caliber tube. Many patients repeatedly undergo dilations or internal urethrotomies (internal cuts of the urethra). We currently know that this practice only temporarily alleviates the symptoms of urinary obstruction, because tightness often forms again with a greater degree of scarring and stenosis, thus worsening the results of urethral reconstructive surgery.

Electroacoustic stimulation,"//What is it?// Current hearing aids are very effective in rehabilitating individuals with mild to moderate deafness. By amplifying the sound and sending it through the ear canal, you obtain a good perception of sounds, especially sounds with low frequencies (frequencies essential in musical perception). In more severe deafness, the effectiveness of these devices is lower, especially at high frequencies, which are essential for discriminating the human voice. Cochlear implants through electrical stimulation of the cochlea obtain excellent results in patients with severe to profound deafness, providing auditory sensation even at high frequencies. We speak of electroacoustic stimulation when a hearing aid and a cochlear implant are used simultaneously in the same ear.  //How do they work?// Like cochlear implants, these devices consist of two components. The internal, implantable component is practically identical to that of a ""traditional"" cochlear implant, however the electrodes are softer and shorter so as not to traumatize the sensory cells of the cochlea, especially those at the apex, responsible for the perception of lower sounds.;/ The external component has an external microphone that captures ambient sound and provides it to two separate processors;/ One of the processors will process the lowest frequencies of sounds and amplify them, stimulating the auditory pathway, in a similar way to a conventional prosthesis. The second processor will process the higher frequency sounds and send this information to the internal component, just like in a cochlear implant.  //Indications// Individuals with severe to profound deafness in high frequencies, who do not benefit from the use of conventional hearing aids in discriminating human speech, but with mild to moderate deafness in lower frequencies, in which hearing aids are still quite effective.  //Contraindications// In addition to situations that contraindicate cochlear implant surgery (for example, significant malformation or calcification of the cochlea) and the use of hearing aids (for example, pathology of the outer ear), these devices are not indicated in situations of progressive deafness in which it is anticipated that there will be a loss in low frequencies that cannot be rehabilitated by sound amplification. //Surgery// The steps and duration of the surgery are identical to those described in cochlear implant surgery. The execution of a minimally traumatic surgical technique is essential in preserving hearing of low frequencies after the introduction of electrodes into the cochlea.  Listening to music too loudly can damage your ears, but the type of headphones and time spent using them can also affect your hearing. Find out how. The answer is no.

Muscle strains and tears,"//What is it?// Muscle injuries are among the most common in sports, affecting amateur and professional athletes. They often result from a process of muscle fatigue, especially in long-distance runners. Muscle injuries resulting from sports activities may depend on intrinsic factors, related to individual and biological characteristics, and extrinsic factors, related to the environment (running surface, sports equipment, weather conditions, etc.). Long-distance running tends to cause intrinsic injuries, such as tendinopathies, bursitis, fasciitis, stress fractures and muscle injuries. Muscle injuries affect runners mainly during sprint training. Competitive athletes may be more prone to this type of injury due to the high intensity of their training. Muscle strain is a common indirect injury among runners. It results from excessive stretching of muscle fibers beyond their normal working capacity, resulting from intense cycles of contraction and relaxation of the muscle involved. The hamstrings, calf muscles, inner thigh muscles and anterior thigh muscles are most susceptible to this injury, also known as a muscle strain. Strains tend to occur at the junction between the muscle and tendon, which is the area of ​​least resistance in the muscle, or at the insertion of the tendon into the bone. However, they can occur in other locations. The classification of muscle injuries has varied over time and is generally based on the severity of the injury, the amount of tissue affected and the functional loss. Thus, 3 categories are considered: grade 1, where there is no appreciable muscle injury; grade 2 with muscle injury and reduction in muscle strength; grade 3, with complete rupture and total loss of function of the affected muscle. As such, it makes sense to jointly address these different injuries that correspond to different degrees of the same traumatic process. //Symptoms// The most characteristic symptom is intense muscle pain, followed by impairment of muscle function to the point of requiring interruption of activity. As mentioned, strains can be classified according to the size of the injury, with symptoms being different in each case: Grade I – stretching of a small number of muscle fibers (<5% of the muscle). Pain occurs at a specific point, occurs during muscle contraction against resistance, and may be absent during rest. Swelling may be present but is generally not evident. There is minimal structural damage, bleeding is minor, resolution is rapid, and functional limitation is mild. The prognosis is good, and fiber restoration is relatively rapid.;/ Grade II – the number of injured fibers and the severity of the injury are greater (> 5 and < 50% of the muscle), with the same characteristics as the first-degree injury, but with greater intensity. It is accompanied by pain, moderate hemorrhage, a more pronounced local inflammatory process and reduced muscle function. Resolution is slower.;/ Grade III - complete rupture of the muscle or a large part of it (> 50% of the muscle) occurs, resulting in significant loss of function with the presence of a palpable defect. Pain can range from moderate to very intense, caused by passive muscle contraction. Swelling and bleeding are significant.;/ A complete rupture is very rare, with subtotal ruptures being more common. //Causes// Factors such as muscle fatigue and the presence of previous injuries must be considered in preventing muscle strains and tears. There are several risk factors for these injuries: flexibility deficiencies, strength imbalances between muscles with opposing actions (agonists and antagonists), old muscle injuries, nutritional and hormonal disorders, infections, factors related to training, poor coordination of movements, incorrect technique, muscle overload and fatigue, poor posture during training, discrepancy in the length of the lower limbs, decreased range of motion and insufficient initial warm-up before exercising. A proper warm-up is essential because it stimulates the production of synovial fluid by the synovial membranes (joint lining). This fluid lubricates and nourishes the joint cartilage. A 10-minute warm-up increases the production of this fluid by 13%. //Diagnosis// The diagnosis is essentially clinical, and is complemented by ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography. As a rule, it is recommended to begin the diagnosis with a detailed history of the occurrence, followed by a thorough medical observation. When muscle structure injury is suspected, magnetic resonance imaging is very important, as it allows us to observe the pattern and extent of the injury, as well as the degree of tendon involvement. //Treatment// Applying ice to the affected area for 10 to 15 minute cycles, using a bag wrapped in thin fabric to protect the skin, and applying compression to the affected area are important treatment measures. The limb should remain elevated and at rest, and the period of immobilization should be as short as possible to avoid loss of muscle strength and movement sensitivity. Analgesics are useful and anti-inflammatories should be used with caution because they can compromise the tissue repair mechanism. All of these gestures, which aim to reduce pain and control swelling, can be applied in the first 24-48 hours. After this period, physiotherapy is used, which may include the use of ultrasound to help tissue regeneration. Around the third week, exercises should be started to recover muscle strength and range of motion of the joints involved. Surgical intervention is necessary in patients with large intramuscular hematomas, injuries or complete ruptures (grade III) and partial injuries in which more than half of the muscle is ruptured. Surgical intervention may also be considered if the patient complains of persistent pain for more than four to six months, particularly if there is an extension deficit. After surgical repair, the muscle should be protected by an elastic band around the limb in order to promote relative immobility and compression. The duration of immobilization naturally depends on the severity of the trauma. If the muscle failure is very extensive, the denervated portion can generate permanent neurological deficit with consequent muscle atrophy. In these circumstances, surgery increases the chances of reinnervation and the development of thick scar tissue can be avoided. //Prevention// Prevention measures are important for both children and adults who engage in sports. In fact, children are at greater risk of injury but these injuries tend to be more serious in adults. As a general rule of thumb, warming up is crucial at any age, as is the use of appropriate equipment. The activity level should be increased gradually and the whole body should be exercised, which helps to avoid muscle injuries and improve endurance, strength and flexibility. Individual endurance limits must be respected, and it is dangerous to try to exceed them. It is important not to practice sports when you are ill or weak. Learning and correctly applying specific techniques for each sport helps to minimize the occurrence of injuries. Adopting healthy eating habits and maintaining a healthy weight are essential in this area as in all others.

Stomatitis,"//What is it?// Stomatitis is a general term used for situations in which inflammation occurs in the mouth - particularly in the mucous membranes (the skin that lines the inside of the mouth) -, possibly associated with pain, which can impair the normal ability to eat, speak and sleep. Stomatitis can occur anywhere in the mouth, including: Inside of the cheeks;/ Gums;/ Language;/ Lips;/ Palate (roof of the mouth);/  The lesions (or ulcers) that appear in stomatitis can be single or multiple.  There are several types of stomatitis, the two most common being: Aphthous stomatitis: A cold sore, also known as an aphthous ulcer, is a single pale or yellow lesion with a red border. It is possible to develop just one cold sore or a set of them. The most common places for its appearance are the inside of the lips or cheek and the tongue. These lesions usually disappear after 4-14 days. In more serious situations (corresponding to approximately one in ten cases of stomatitis), the lesions can last up to six weeks.;/ Herpetic stomatitis: cold sores correspond to small blisters filled with liquid, associated with pain and burning, that appear on the lips or in the surrounding region. Situations in which herpes forms on the gums or roof of the mouth are rare. Before the herpes goes from blisters to sores, with the formation of a crust, symptoms such as tingling, sensitivity or even burning appear. Cold sores are very contagious.;/  In addition to these two, there are other types of stomatitis, such as prosthetic stomatitis, a common problem in those who use removable dental prostheses.  //Symptoms of stomatitis// Symptoms of stomatitis may include: Dor;/ Stings;/ Mouth ulcers, with a white or yellow coating and a red rim, which may appear on the inside of the lips, cheeks or tongue;/ Bubbles;/ Swelling;/ Red spots;/ Oral dysesthesia (burning sensation in the mouth);/ Lesions that heal after 4-14 days and tend to recur;/  In the specific case of aphthous stomatitis, the lesions may be associated with pain, but rarely with fever, manifesting for 5-10 days. In herpetic stomatitis, the lesions usually cause pain and last an average of 7-10 days. They are sometimes associated with cold or flu-like symptoms.  //Causes// There are several factors that can cause stomatitis, and they can even overlap. Identifying the cause is important, as it will allow the disease to be treated more appropriately and effectively. The most common causes are: Infection;/ Injuries;/ Trauma resulting from the use of orthodontic prostheses or dental braces, from biting the inside of the cheek, tongue or lip, or from surgery;/ Allergies;/ Skin diseases;/ Fungal infection;/ Viral infection, such as herpes;/ Chemotherapy and radiotherapy;/ Any health problem associated with xerostomia or dry mouth;/ Smoking or chewing tobacco;/  There are, however, many other possible causes, such as: Stress;/ Burns caused by ingesting very hot food or drinks;/ Nutritional deficiencies;/ Bacterial infections;/ Immune system problems, such as immunosuppression or autoimmune diseases;/ Sexually transmitted infections;/ Irritation from harsh chemicals;/ Allergic reactions;/ Some diseases, such as lupus, Crohn's disease, and Behçet's disease;/ Some medications, such as certain types of antibiotics and antiepileptics;/ Eating certain foods - i.e. potatoes, citrus fruits, cheese, nuts, coffee and chocolate - can also promote the development of canker sores.  //Diagnosis// Clinical observation is the basis for diagnosing stomatitis. By examining the appearance and distribution of the lesions, the doctor is able to gather a lot of information about the stomatitis and the specific case he is dealing with. Collecting the patient's clinical history is another important step in diagnosing stomatitis and may include some questions about, for example, when the symptoms appeared, the severity of the pain, medications they have taken previously, sexual activity, whether they are a smoker, among others. Additionally, some tests that may be included in the diagnosis of stomatitis are: Collection of bacterial or viral exudate;/ Tissue samples or fungal infections;/ Biopsies;/ Blood tests;/ Allergy testing;/ There are other health problems that can cause stomatitis, hence the importance of making a correct diagnosis and consequently receiving appropriate treatment.  //Treatment of stomatitis// Normally, lesions caused by stomatitis disappear after about two weeks, even without treatment. The cause of stomatitis - whether an allergic reaction, infection, disease or even nutritional deficiency - will dictate the therapeutic strategy. If the attending physician is unable to identify the cause of stomatitis, treatment may be symptomatic, with the aim of relieving symptoms. Stomatitis can be treated topically, with direct application to the skin to relieve symptoms such as pain and to speed up recovery. Topical treatments may include, for example, corticosteroids (these aim to eliminate symptoms so that the person can eat and talk without feeling pain or discomfort); antibiotics (which combat the infection with anti-inflammatory and antibiotic properties); and anaesthetics (for temporary pain relief). Protective films may also be applied to the lesion. Other strategies that can help relieve pain and inflammation caused by injuries to the mouth involve: Avoid hot foods and drinks;/ Avoid salty, spicy and citrus-based foods;/ Taking painkillers, such as ibuprofen (it is an anti-inflammatory);/ Gargle with cold water if there is a burn in your mouth.;/  In the case of aphthous stomatitis, some gestures that can contribute to relieving symptoms are: Practice good dental care;/ Drink more water;/ Gargle with salt water;/  If canker sores appear frequently, their origin may be due to nutritional deficiencies, for example, of folic acid or vitamin B12. To rule out this cause, the attending physician may prescribe specific tests. In the case of herpetic stomatitis, applying ice to the lesion can help.  Attention! Not all injuries are harmless, so the patient should make an appointment with their doctor if the mouth sores do not heal after two weeks.  //Prevention// There are some measures that can be put into practice in order to prevent the reappearance of stomatitis, such as using a soft toothbrush, rinsing the mouth with an antiseptic and alcohol-free mouthwash, treating chronic dry mouth, adopting a healthy diet, maintaining Stay well hydrated and visit the dentist regularly.

Strabismus,"//What is it?// Strabismus is a condition in which the eyes do not align properly. One eye can be rotated in, up, down, or out, while the other focuses on another point. It can occur continuously or intermittently. Under normal conditions, the six muscles that control eye movement work together to point both eyes in the same direction. Patients with strabismus have problems controlling eye movements and cannot maintain normal eye alignment. As a result, both eyes cannot look at the same place at the same time. It may also be related to a disorder in the brain that means the eyes cannot coordinate properly. This condition makes binocular vision impossible, so it is difficult for the patient to have depth perception. Strabismus can be classified by the direction of the misaligned eye: Inward (esotropia);/ Outward (exotropia);/ For summit (hypertropia);/ Downward (hypotropia);/ //Symptoms// The eyes are misaligned, directed towards opposite directions, and this pathology is related to the contraction and relaxation of the muscles. Strabismus can be divergent or convergent. //Causes// Its origin may be: Congenital;/ Hereditary;/ Result of a disease;/ Due to cranial nerve injury;/ Other problems that can also lead to strabismus include: Myopia;/ Hyperopia;/ Astigmatism;/ Refractive error;/ Hydrocephalus;/ Some viral infections, such as measles;/ Noonan syndrome;/ Genetic conditions;/ //Diagnosis// All babies over four months of age who appear to have strabismus should have a complete exam with a pediatric ophthalmologist. This includes: Patient's medical history;/ Family history;/ General health problems;/ Medications in use;/ Visual acuity examination;/ Refraction exam;/ Alignment and focus tests;;/ Examination after dilation of the pupils to determine the health of the internal ocular structures;/ //Treatment// To correct the strabismus, a surgical technique is required, which is performed under general anesthesia and the patient must remain hospitalized for 24 hours. The surgery consists of changing the position of the muscles or shortening them depending on the type of strabismus. The average time for the procedure is 30 minutes for small deviations and 40 to 50 minutes for larger deviations. In general, there is no need to wear an occlusive dressing. //Prevention// There is no prevention for strabismus. Cleveland Clinic Medical News Today Amblyopia or ""lazy eye"" is a problem that affects children and can cause poor vision and compromise quality of life if left untreated.

Strabismus in children,"//What is it?// Strabismus is a visual defect that consists of the loss of ocular alignment or parallelism, so that each eye points in a different direction. In some cases, one eye is dominant and only the other deviates, but there may also be alternation, that is, when the right eye is fixed, the left eye is deviated, and when the left eye is fixed, the right eye is deviated. Strabismus can be horizontal, convergent if the deviation is inward and divergent if the deviation is outward, or vertical if the deviated eye is pointing up or down. There are more complex situations, with associated disorders, each with its own clinical characteristics, age of onset, treatment and prognosis. It is a situation that affects around 3 to 4% of children, and its exact incidence in Portugal is not known. Congenital or infantile strabismus appears before 6 months of age. There are other forms that appear later, including in adulthood.  //Symptoms// In children, there are often no symptoms and the deviation itself is the only sign present. One of the consequences of strabismus is diplopia or double image. To avoid seeing double, the child's brain eliminates the image of one of the eyes (suppression). When there is a deviated eye this is the least used which, over time, leads to lazy or amblyopic eye (see amblyopathy). We should suspect strabismus when the child closes one eye to the light or has a bad head posture, signs that indicate an adaptation of the brain to avoid the double image. Another characteristic is the loss of binocular vision, that is, the ability to see in 3 dimensions, notion of depth and distances between objects. It is also important to take into account the psychological and social impact that strabismus has, not only for the child but also for their parents. //Causes// ​​​​​​​Why does it arise? It is our brain that controls eye alignment. Its poor control can lead to the appearance of strabismus, which is often precipitated by several factors, in particular states of weakness, such as illness, tiredness or stress. Its onset is generally intermittent and in some cases becomes constant. Association with refractive errors, the most common being hyperopia.;/ Severe decrease in vision in one eye that leads to its deviation (cataract, retinal disease or other eye diseases).;/ Unknown causes as in the case of congenital or infantile endotropia.;/ //Treatment// A complete ophthalmological evaluation should be carried out for a child with strabismus. Once the diagnosis has been confirmed, the causes should first be treated. The primary objective is to restore visual function. Optical correction of associated refractive errors. Correct use of glasses;/ This alone can lead to ocular alignment and deviation control. Treatment of amblyopia when present, usually with occlusion of the good eye;/ or other method of penalty (see amblyopia). Treatment of other causes such as congenital cataract surgery.;/ These treatments may need to be combined, as in the case of congenital cataracts, which require surgery, optical correction and treatment of amblyopia. If the ocular deviation persists, surgical correction will be indicated. Surgery Strabismus surgery is based on intervention in the oculomotor muscles responsible for eyeball movements. It may be necessary to operate on 2 or more muscles, in one or both eyes. The techniques used consist of strengthening or weakening the muscles responsible for the deviation. It is performed under general anesthesia and may be performed on an outpatient basis or require an overnight hospital stay. //Prevention// Strabismus cannot be prevented, but some of its causes can. It is important to correct significant refractive errors, treat amblyopia and treat other causes that can lead to strabismus. All children should be evaluated at an initial ophthalmology consultation before from 3 years of age, or earlier if there are risk factors. If strabismus is suspected, its diagnosis must be confirmed as early as possible and treated as appropriate for each case. For many children, spending more time at home has meant spending more time in front of screens. Learn how to protect your child's eyes. In children, a vision problem can go unnoticed, so vigilance is important. Know when to take them for an Ophthalmology consultation.

Sleep study,"//What is it?//  The sleep trace, obtained during the polygraphic sleep study, consists of the simultaneous recording of several parameters during sleep using an appropriate device.  This study can be performed in the Sleep Laboratory where the patient sleeps or it can be performed at home to study sleep apnea and snoring. In this case, the examination is less uncomfortable and less expensive.  During this study, brain waves, blood oxygen levels, heart and breathing rate, eye and limb movements during sleep, and snoring are recorded. //Advantages and benefits// Sleep studies help diagnose sleep disorders and also allow the treatment plan to be adjusted in order to obtain the best results. //Methodology// In the afternoon and evening before obtaining the tracing, it is important not to consume alcohol or caffeinated drinks that can affect your sleep pattern.  On the day of the study, it is important not to sleep after 6:00 am. You should have dinner and take your medications as usual and bring comfortable clothes.  Various types of sensors will be placed on the scalp, in the lower chest, a cannula between the nose and mouth, a sensor on a finger to measure oxygen levels and sensors on the legs. These sensors are connected to a computer.  The data obtained will be processed electronically and interpreted by the doctor who will prepare the examination report.  The room where the study is performed is similar to a hotel room, quiet and private. It has a video and sound system so that technicians can monitor what is happening during the examination.  In general, it is important that the test is performed overnight to obtain reliable results. Although it is normal for the patient to take longer to fall asleep and not sleep as well, this will not affect the results. //Indications// Sleep tracing is indicated in cases of frequent daytime sleepiness, difficulty staying awake during important tasks such as driving, loud snoring, suspected respiratory arrest (apnea) or obesity associated with sleep difficulties.  It is also indicated for disorders with periodic movement of the lower limbs, narcolepsy (violent sleep attacks during the day), chronic insomnia or any anomalous behavior during sleep. //Care to be taken// This is a non-invasive and painless study, with no risks for the patient. Complications are very rare.  The most common side effect is skin irritation caused by the adhesive that holds the sensors.

Sports medical examination,"//What is it?// Medical examinations constitute an essential instrument for assessing contraindications and/or restrictions of sports practitioners for the performance of their practice, representing an important means of screening certain pathologies or clinical situations, especially in the young population. The sports medical examination should not be seen as a mere response to a bureaucratic-legal requirement, but rather as a medical act full of value and interest. In fact, the main objective of the sports medical examination is the detection of conditions that may pose a risk of sudden death and diseases that may worsen with exertion. Within this framework, the sports medical examination becomes mandatory, in all situations and for all sports practitioners, referees, judges and timekeepers affiliated or wishing to join federations with public sporting utility. //What does it consist of?// The sports medical examination consists of a medical assessment that must be carried out in compliance with the points contained in the form form published in the Official Gazette of the Union (DOU nº 238 of 13.12.2006 – 2nd Series). It incorporates a first information of bureaucratic data followed by a declaration of their antecedents which must be dated and signed by themselves if they are adults or by their legal representative if they are minors (As stated in articles 122 and 124 of the Civil Code, a minor is someone who is not has turned 18 years of age) The following items consist of a questionnaire carried out by the doctor about the athlete's family and personal history, an objective examination and notes on complementary diagnostic tests. (up to 35 years of age, chest x-ray (3/3 years) and ECG, from 35 years of age onwards, routine analyzes and stress tests are added) As stated above, it is reiterated that the athlete must be accompanied by his/her legal representative if he/she is a minor for a proper assessment of this background and for the proper completion of personal data with the signature of the legal representative.  //Frequency and deadlines// The frequency of the sports medical examination is annual, as determined by Order No. 11318/2009. “Under the provisions of no. 2 of article 1 of Decree-Law no. 169/2007, of May 3, I determine the following: 1 — Medical-sports exams are valid annually. 2 — Sports medical examinations must be carried out at the time of first registration of sports agents with sports federations. 3 — Without prejudice to the provisions of the following paragraph, medical and sports examinations must only be renewed in the month corresponding to the holder’s birthday.” //Other information// Exams for sports practitioners enrolled in the high-performance regime are carried out exclusively at Sports Medicine Centers, and are characterized by compliance with specific protocols applied to each sporting modality, namely in the organic repercussion of the effects of exercise and in the evaluation and control of training of performance. Whenever sports practitioners wish to compete in the level immediately higher than that corresponding to their age, they are observed in a general medical-sports assessment carried out at the Clinic (simple step up). If the practitioner is proposed to participate in 2 levels older than their real age (special level increase), they will have to take a superclassification exam, whose protocol includes determining bone age, sexual maturation, body composition, echocardiogram and blood tests, in addition to a medical consultation. This examination must be carried out at the Centro de Medicina Desportiva de Lisboa (CMDL) or at the Centro de Medicina Desportiva do Porto (CMDP), both from the Instituto Português do Desporto e da Juventude, IPDJ, IP, or by a specialist in Sports Medicine (having in this case, the exam that follows the protocol recommended by the CMDL/CMDP, being subsequently sent for approval by the director of the Lisbon Sports Medicine Center). Given the repercussion of sports practice at higher levels in the ages of puberty and adolescence, it is the It is of utmost importance that the parents, guardians or legal guardians of young athletes know the reasons for the simple or special level increase, and that they consent to it, in a written document.

Excision of kidney and ureteral stones,"//What is it?// Surgical treatment of stones can be by ""open"", endoscopic or percutaneous surgery. Stones are solid formations of mineral salts and other substances such as calcium oxalate and uric acid, commonly called “stones”. There are stones that pass spontaneously, without causing damage or infection, and therefore do not pose any threat to health. On the other hand, those that obstruct the urinary system, cause pain, compromise kidney function and predispose to infections, pose a threat to health and should therefore be treated immediately. Many people eliminate urinary stones without even knowing they exist.  //Symptoms// Stones can lodge in any part of the urinary tract, causing obstruction, infection and pain. Regardless of the type of stone, the consequences are essentially the same: pain, obstruction and tissue trauma with secondary bleeding and infection.  The most characteristic symptom of kidney and ureteral stones is intense or localized pain with sudden onset. Depending on the location of the stone, the pain may be called renal colic or ureteral colic. Renal colic originates deep in the lumbar region, radiating laterally and inferiorly towards the testicle in men and the bladder in women. Ureteral colic radiates to the thigh. When the pain is intense, nausea, vomiting, paleness, sweating, anxiety and urinary urgency generally occur.  The pain varies from minutes to days and can be quite resistant to analgesics. It may be intermittent, which means calculation migration. As the stone migrates and starts to occupy a new place of obstruction, the pain returns, disappearing when the stone reaches the bladder.  The pain caused by kidney stones is not always intense and cramp-like. It can also be an uncomfortable sensation like burning or heaviness.  //Causes// Many people eliminate urinary stones without even knowing they exist. Factors that contribute to the formation of urinary stones are: Infection;/ Presence of a foreign body;/ Inability to empty the bladder normally;/ Obstruction within the urinary tract;/ Load more;/ The kidney is a very important organ for the body's balance. Kidney diseases are usually silent, hence the importance of knowing the warning signs. A cause for alarm for anyone who encounters this problem, blood in the urine can be an indicator of several diseases, so it should not be ignored. Hypertension, stroke, dementia, osteoporosis, excess weight. Excess salt can increase the risk of several diseases. The key is moderation.

Exoftalmiaproptose,"//What is it?// There are situations in which the eye may gradually or suddenly become more prominent, protruding forward. One of the most common causes is Thyroid Orbitopathy or Graves' Orbitopathy (associated with a dysfunction of the thyroid gland), but proptosis can occur in association with other inflammatory processes, hemorrhage or orbital tumors (benign or malignant). //Symptoms// Depending on the cause, exophthalmos can be unilateral or bilateral and the symptoms are variable. The projection of the eyeball can be gradual and asymptomatic or be associated with complaints of pain, sensitivity to light, altered vision, swollen and/or retracted eyelids (leading to an expression of astonishment/surprise) or double vision (diplopia).  //Treatment// Variable, depending on the cause, treatment may be medical and/or surgical. Myopia, astigmatism and hyperopia often lead to the use of glasses or contact lenses. LASIK surgery can restore good vision. Whether for aesthetic reasons or to improve vision, blepharoplasty is a surgery that allows you to correct, for example, droopy eyelids, but not only that.

Fatigue,"//What is it?// Fatigue can be described as a lack of energy and motivation, both physical and mental. It can affect virtually anyone in a temporary way. In these cases, it is simple to identify the cause and treat or resolve it. Chronic fatigue tends to be long-lasting and deeper, in addition to affecting all aspects of people's lives, with an important impact on the emotional and psychological areas. It is important not to confuse fatigue with drowsiness, although the former may be accompanied by a desire to sleep. In the chronic case, in addition to sleep, there is a lack of motivation to do anything. This disorder is often a symptom of a medical problem that must be diagnosed and treated. In most cases, its origin lies in one or more habits or routines that can be identified and modified. Although it is difficult to assess how many people suffer from chronic fatigue or fibromyalgia, it is known to affect approximately 2% to 8% of the adult population. Among them, 80% to 90% are women aged between 30 and 50 years. //Symptoms// From a feeling of weakness to constant tiredness or lack of energy. If the cause is an organic disease (lung, heart, anemia), the characteristic symptoms of these diseases also appear, making the diagnosis easier. In fact, fatigue should always be considered and evaluated in the context of the patient as a whole. //Causes// It would be impossible to list all the potential causes of fatigue. However, identifying its origin is an essential step in addressing and treating it. It can be caused by lifestyle factors such as excessive alcohol or caffeine consumption, excessive physical activity or, conversely, inactivity, lack of sleep, certain medications (antihistamines, cough suppressants, blood pressure medications, antidepressants) and poor eating habits. It is also believed to result from a psychological condition such as anxiety, depression, grief or stress. With regard to organic diseases, some of those most associated with fatigue are liver failure, anemia, cancer, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary emphysema, thyroid disease, obesity, sleep apnea and diabetes. //Diagnosis// There is no standard diagnosis for fatigue. It is necessary to take a detailed clinical history of the patient and, whenever necessary, perform additional diagnostic tests depending on each case. //Treatment// As it is almost always a symptom of an underlying medical condition, its treatment involves diagnosing and addressing that underlying condition, whether physical, psychological or mixed. The time it takes to recover from fatigue after treatment of the underlying condition varies significantly. In some cases, it can be almost immediate, as is the case with anemia, while in others it can take weeks, as is the case with some viral infections. //Prevention// Its prevention is not generally applicable, given the multiple possible causes that can trigger it. It is worth highlighting that the earlier its origin is identified and addressed, the faster and more complete its control.
