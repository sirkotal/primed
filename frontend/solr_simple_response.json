It did make me a little drowsy, but what was more interesting is that my migraine went from a \"10\" to a \"4\" on the pain scale. Now when I start to get migraine symptoms, I take an Excedrin and a Dramamine. The combination works tremendously for me.",
                    "Works excellent. Went on. Whale watch with family. Took it 1 hour before boat trip and it worked awesome. I Even was able to have food on the boat with no nausea.",
                    "I take this for motion sickness, as well as occasional nausea. It works beautifully. I'm able to go on longer road trips and boats without being bothered by motion. And not only do I feel well physically, but my mind is at ease knowing that I don't really have to worry about it. I also appreciate the fact that it's widely available and relatively inexpensive. I usually buy the generic version, but I find that it works just as well.",
                    "Need Something over the counter now...This stuff works. Use as directed every 4 hours and promise you your nausea and vomiting will disappear.. I still think Zofran (Prescription ONLY) is the best stuff but this is a close second for over the counter.",

My only problem with it is that it makes me so drowsy! If it is a shortish flight or bus ride, I still get nauseous but don't always want to take a dramamine because I'll be so drowsy once arriving at my destination. A 4+ hour flight/bus/boat though, and dramamine is for sure the way to go, particularly if it is overnight travel and you will be wanting to sleep anyway.",
                    "I have been experiencing severe nausea and vomiting due to my long-term medications. So far, dimenhydrinate combined with ginger tea (ginger root soaked in hot water) has had the best results. I'm finally able to eat some food again.",
                    "For me it's a miracle medicine. I purchase it OTC and can't believe how well it relieves symptoms of vertigo. Wonderful success with this medication. In the past, I actually had to pull over when driving a vehicle because I couldn't focus on the road. I take 100mg and in a few minutes I'm back on the road. Amazing! I suffer from tinnitus and get \"off balanced\" very easily. It completely cures my motion sickness.",

I was desperate because of the nausea and dizziness on top of the unbelievable pain, and took a Dramamine. Not only did it stop the nausea and dizziness, it knocked out my migraine enough that I was able to get out aof bed and function - probably from a 10 on the pain scale to a 5. Huge difference!",

If I take this, I know in one hour exactly (it literally takes exactly 60 minutes for me) I will feel better and not even a little nauseous. I also get nasty random bouts of nausea (I have no idea why). Before knowing about Dramamine, I'd have to force myself to vomit just to feel a little bit of relief but after finding this stuff, I no longer suffer. I do not know what I will do if this medicine is ever discontinued. ",

I recently noticed yellowing of my skin and eyes. My doctor Ordered blood work and I was diagnosed with Hepatitis A. there is no reason I would have contracted hepatitis. Is there a correlation with Dramamine?",

I first used Dramamine for a 4 hour road trip in a large van. I was so nervous about getting motion sickness I almost did go. I took 2 pills about 30 minutes before and it completely kept the sickness away! It did make me tired and I ended up taking a little nap but thats better than nausea. I can do everything I couldn't do before in a car from reading to having a normal conversation.",

I took this on a 3 hour drive to San Diego and 3 hour drive back, and I was feeling better than ever! It seems to help with anxiety as well, I forgot how it felt to just be normal. I'm always nauseous, so its a refreshing feeling to not feel anything on the drive. I don't get sleepy that easily so the drowsiness doesn't kick in til later, but this is amazing I recommend. Its good to have trust with a medication because it'll ease your mind on the trip you're going to take, and thats what I have with dramamine.",

                    "During a migraine attack, I took a Dramamine to help me sleep (as, yes, it packs a wallop in the drowsy department). It did make me a little drowsy, but what was more interesting is that my migraine went from a \"10\" to a \"4\" on the pain scale. Now when I start to get migraine symptoms, I take an Excedrin and a Dramamine. The combination works tremendously for me.",
                    "Works excellent. Went on. Whale watch with family. Took it 1 hour before boat trip and it worked awesome. I Even was able to have food on the boat with no nausea.",
                    "I take this for motion sickness, as well as occasional nausea. It works beautifully. I'm able to go on longer road trips and boats without being bothered by motion. And not only do I feel well physically, but my mind is at ease knowing that I don't really have to worry about it. I also appreciate the fact that it's widely available and relatively inexpensive. I usually buy the generic version, but I find that it works just as well.",
                    "Need Something over the counter now...This stuff works. Use as directed every 4 hours and promise you your nausea and vomiting will disappear.. I still think Zofran (Prescription ONLY) is the best stuff but this is a close second for over the counter.",
                    "I have been taking dramamine for years (since I was a child) to prevent my terrible motion sickness. It works incredibly well at keeping me from getting nauseated. My only problem with it is that it makes me so drowsy! If it is a shortish flight or bus ride, I still get nauseous but don't always want to take a dramamine because I'll be so drowsy once arriving at my destination. A 4+ hour flight/bus/boat though, and dramamine is for sure the way to go, particularly if it is overnight travel and you will be wanting to sleep anyway.",
                    "I have been experiencing severe nausea and vomiting due to my long-term medications. So far, dimenhydrinate combined with ginger tea (ginger root soaked in hot water) has had the best results. I'm finally able to eat some food again.",
                    "For me it's a miracle medicine. I purchase it OTC and can't believe how well it relieves symptoms of vertigo. Wonderful success with this medication. In the past, I actually had to pull over when driving a vehicle because I couldn't focus on the road. I take 100mg and in a few minutes I'm back on the road. Amazing! I suffer from tinnitus and get \"off balanced\" very easily. It completely cures my motion sickness.",

I was desperate because of the nausea and dizziness on top of the unbelievable pain, and took a Dramamine. Not only did it stop the nausea and dizziness, it knocked out my migraine enough that I was able to get out aof bed and function - probably from a 10 on the pain scale to a 5. Huge difference!",

If I take this, I know in one hour exactly (it literally takes exactly 60 minutes for me) I will feel better and not even a little nauseous. I also get nasty random bouts of nausea (I have no idea why). Before knowing about Dramamine, I'd have to force myself to vomit just to feel a little bit of relief but after finding this stuff, I no longer suffer. I do not know what I will do if this medicine is ever discontinued. ",

I recently noticed yellowing of my skin and eyes. My doctor Ordered blood work and I was diagnosed with Hepatitis A. there is no reason I would have contracted hepatitis. Is there a correlation with Dramamine?",

                    "I am so glad I found this! I've been dealing with motion sickness for years. It was almost impossible for me to ride in the backseat of a car before this medication. I first used Dramamine for a 4 hour road trip in a large van. I was so nervous about getting motion sickness I almost did go. I took 2 pills about 30 minutes before and it completely kept the sickness away! It did make me tired and I ended up taking a little nap but thats better than nausea. I can do everything I couldn't do before in a car from reading to having a normal conversation.",
                    "This is amazing! I've been struggling with motion sickness, and its gotten worse as I got older. I took this on a 3 hour drive to San Diego and 3 hour drive back, and I was feeling better than ever! It seems to help with anxiety as well, I forgot how it felt to just be normal. I'm always nauseous, so its a refreshing feeling to not feel anything on the drive. I don't get sleepy that easily so the drowsiness doesn't kick in til later, but this is amazing I recommend. Its good to have trust with a medication because it'll ease your mind on the trip you're going to take, and thats what I have with dramamine.",
                    "We use Dramamine prior to fishing trips. However an old sea captain told me to take one pill the night before and then another the morning of the trip. This way it really gets in your system. It works!",

Please use with caution.",

                    "I have been taking 1/2 of a 50 mg tablet at bedtime for some time now; I get a better nights sleep when I do, also if I do wake up in the night to go to the bathroom I am always able to go right back to sleep. I am just wondering if there is any danger in taking this long term to help with insomnia?",
                    "Decades - yes, decades - of sleep problems (late onset, circadian problems, waking frequently to urinate, exhausted all the time and all but dysfunctional during the day ... Tried many types of \"sleeping pills\" (Zopiclone was hilarious: after 3 nights in a row - in repeated trials - it made me sooo depressed, and my memory was seriously disrupted ( another side effect) ...  Dramamine (25 or 50 mg, an hour before sleep time) has been a miracle drug for me. My sleep is still not perfect but so much improved that my life is coming back.",
                    "I am so glad I found this! I've been dealing with motion sickness for years. It was almost impossible for me to ride in the backseat of a car before this medication. I first used Dramamine for a 4 hour road trip in a large van. I was so nervous about getting motion sickness I almost did go. I took 2 pills about 30 minutes before and it completely kept the sickness away! It did make me tired and I ended up taking a little nap but thats better than nausea. I can do everything I couldn't do before in a car from reading to having a normal conversation.",
                    "This is amazing! I've been struggling with motion sickness, and its gotten worse as I got older. I took this on a 3 hour drive to San Diego and 3 hour drive back, and I was feeling better than ever! It seems to help with anxiety as well, I forgot how it felt to just be normal. I'm always nauseous, so its a refreshing feeling to not feel anything on the drive. I don't get sleepy that easily so the drowsiness doesn't kick in til later, but this is amazing I recommend. Its good to have trust with a medication because it'll ease your mind on the trip you're going to take, and thats what I have with dramamine.",
                    "We use Dramamine prior to fishing trips. However an old sea captain told me to take one pill the night before and then another the morning of the trip. This way it really gets in your system. It works!",
                    "I have been experiencing motion sickness every time I travel by plane and decided to give this a try. Not only did I not experience any nausea, but it knocked me out for my two hour flight! I fell asleep while people were still boarding and woke up when the plane hit the ground again. Amazing!",
                    "I've taking dramamine a couple of times with good results however the other day I took it and it was a disaster. I usually experience agitation and dizziness while being a passenger in a car and it usually dulls it but, this time... it made my symptoms substantially worst I developed sensitivity to light , sound , and even temperature felt more intense and that was in addition to the agitation and dizziness. Please use with caution.",
                    "For me, dramamine works better than phenergan. I have a lot of nausea due to rheumatoid medications I take. I also get vertigo or migraine on occasion that cause nausea. This med helps me a lot",
                    "Wow 50 mg of this everyday for insomnia put me right to sleep and the quality of sleep is so good :)",
                    "I have such a hard time with motion sickness, so I am always sure to bring Dramamine along with me for flights, cruises, etc. I do not recommend the non-drowsy formula, however because it does not work for me. I will take drowsiness over nausea any day!"

                    "//What are they?//Vertigo is not a disease but rather a symptom that can occur in various pathologies. The word vertigo comes from the Latin vertere, which means spinning or rotating movement. Vertigo, or vertigo syndrome, is defined as a distortion of the body's movement in space. To understand what causes vertigo, we must understand the entire mechanism involved in maintaining balance. There are several systems involved in the orientation of our body: the visual, the vestibular (inner ear) and the proprioceptive (these receptors are located in the muscles, tendons, joints and skin). Vertigo occurs when there is an anomaly in one of these systems and can also result from a problem in the brain, which is responsible for analysing and integrating information about the movement and position of the head and body. This condition can affect people of any age and is usually accompanied by other symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, headaches, paleness, increased heart rate and loss of consciousness. They correspond to an illusion of movement, with a sensation of movement of surrounding objects in relation to the individual or vice versa. They are most often rotatory (the environment seems to move around the patient), but they can also manifest as a sensation of sliding to one side or up and down. It is necessary to distinguish vertigo from dizziness: dizziness is a generic designation that encompasses all situations where there is a disturbance in the individual's relationships with space, and vertigo must be considered a particular form of dizziness. This distinction is not always easy, especially in cases of great anxiety or when dizziness occurs in the context of a psychiatric illness. In general, vertigo results from an injury to the inner ear, its peripheral receptors, the pathways that carry the information collected or the centers of the central nervous system that process this information. Vision disorders and a special type of sensitivity (proprioceptive) in the skin, bones, muscles and joints throughout the body can also cause dizziness, which can be very difficult to distinguish from vertigo. Vertigo is part of a broader set of disorders, known as vestibular disorders, which are very common. For example, in the United States, it is estimated that approximately 35% of the population over the age of 40 has had at least one episode of vestibular disease.//Symptoms//Vertigo, or vertigo syndrome, can be accompanied by dizziness, a feeling of lightheadedness or fainting, loss of balance or instability. The duration of episodes can vary from a few minutes to hours and are often accompanied by intense nausea and vomiting. In general, headaches, slurred speech, double vision, weakness of one of the upper or lower limbs, and uncoordinated movements are signs that the vertigo is caused by a neurological disorder in the brain and not a problem limited to the ear. Elderly people or those taking medications for heart disease or high blood pressure may experience dizziness or fainting when they stand up abruptly. This happens due to a momentary drop in blood pressure (orthostatic hypotension) that lasts just a few seconds. It can often be prevented by standing more slowly or wearing compression stockings.//Causes//There are many causes of vertigo. The body detects posture and controls balance through balance organs located in the inner ear. These have nerve connections with specific areas of the brain that allow balance to be maintained. Therefore, vertigo can be caused by disorders of the ear, the nerves that connect the ear to the brain or the brain itself - in more aggressive acute or chronic otitis, toxic substances can spread to the inner ear and interfere with its proper functioning for balance. It can also be related to visual problems or sudden changes in blood pressure, but also to labyrinthitis, neuritis, traumatic brain injury, auditory nerve or brain tumors, strokes, meningitis, ototoxicity from certain medications, barotrauma due to pressure changes, among others. Cardiac arrhythmia, hypoglycemia, a sudden drop in blood pressure, or anxiety that causes the patient to constantly take deep breaths can cause syncope that can be confused with vertigo. Changing the prescription of glasses lenses can also cause this condition. The most common cause is motion sickness, which can occur in anyone whose inner ear is sensitive to certain movements, such as rocking or sudden braking and acceleration. These people may feel particularly dizzy during car or boat journeys. This type tends to be more common in women and is more common in older people, and its exact cause is not always known. In some cases, the condition occurs after a head injury, reduced blood flow to certain areas of the brain, a viral infection, after ear surgery or prolonged breastfeeding. M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease causes episodic and abrupt attacks of vertigo, along with ringing in the ears and progressive deafness. They can also be caused by bacterial or viral infections, tumors, abnormal pressure, nerve inflammation or toxic substances that affect the aforementioned structures. At a cerebral level, they occur in the context of migraines, after a stroke, following transient episodes of ischemia or in multiple sclerosis.//Diagnosis//Diagnosis is based on clinical history and medical examination of the auditory system or nervous system. Some tests can provoke an episode of vertigo and thus help to understand its cause. Tests such as audiometry, impedance analysis, evoked potentials, electro or videonystagmography, posturography and imaging tests (computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) are frequently used.//Treatment//Some cases do not require treatment and disappear spontaneously. In others, certain maneuvers can be performed to control the condition. Depending on the cause, there are other treatment options, such as anti-inflammatory or antiemetic drugs (if there is significant vomiting), among others.//Prevention//Anyone can experience vertigo and there is no way to prevent a first episode. Since it causes a strong feeling of imbalance, it is important to avoid situations in which you could fall. American Academy of Family Physicians, 2014 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, 2013 MedicineNet, 2014 Vestibular Disorders Association, 2014 Load more;/ Vestibular neuritis is an inflammation of the vestibular nerve after an episode of acute vertigo, which can maintain the sensation of imbalance for weeks. Different from simple dizziness, vertigo can be a symptom of various illnesses and require medical advice. Discover some of the causes of vertigo.

                    "At 59 years of age have been suffering migraines since I was 21. Think I have tried every medication available in the UK. Maxalt is the only thing that has ever worked for me.Pain usually gone after 20 minutes, before I took Maxalt I could be in bed for 2 days rolling around in agony. Only side effects are tiredness and strangely It makes me sneeze just once as soon as I have taken it. Maxalt has completely changed my life. Fortunate to live in UK as I get it free on national health prescription.",
                    "I have had migraines since I was 12 yrs. Old, I am 67. As a child I just suffered all the time. When I was in my late 20's, fiorinal was the answer. It did help. There have been a couple of others (can't remember the name). Then imitrex came out. Didn't work. I did not find relief, even with addition of percocet until maxalt came out. Thank heavens. Mostly 20 days per month. I learned very quickly first sign for me is a slice of pain, then I immediately take the maxalt. Within a half hour, 99% gone. I have been so fortunate to have medicine coverage through private employer insurance with reasonable copay, otherwise it would affect my ability to support myself. I take over 12 meds per day..No interactions",
                    "Works within 2 hours but my migraine always returns the next day. I take the medication the next day - headache goes away within two hours - comes back the next day again. Medication works but I feel extremely tired and depressed for the three days. Insurance companies also limit me to 9 pills a month which adds to my stress.",
                    "This medication worked great for me to get rid of my headache. When I take it before I feel a bad migraine coming on, it alleviates it before it gets bad. My only complaint about this medication is I get really bad heart burn and I really do not sleep that well while I am on it. I guess you can%u2019t have everything.",
                    "I occasionally get migraine when I have been in stressful situations. It appears that my migraine are related to a deficit of serotonin. I also get migraines in stores that sell lots of cheap plastic items. This medication is 100% effective for me.",
                    "Puts me in nice restful deep sleep (normal 7hr night), walk up in morning migraine gone, with no hangover feeling that you would normally get if went to ER for a shot.",
                    "To me, this is the ONE medicine I can not live without. I have had to try others due to insurance, and none comes even close! Within 15-30 even the strongest, wanting to smash my head-in migraine will be totally gone! No side effects for me either. Never makes me tired, groggy or the medicated feeling. Taken on empty stomach while in college class and had no problems finishing the class and going home to play with the kids and not the mom who was hiding in a dark room with no noise allowed in the house.",
                    "Maxalt has worked wonders for me. When I have migraines I never feel like swallowing tablets, so the fact that I have the dissolving tablet is an absolute bonus. Before this medicine I was bedridden for days at a time, and after a migraine, my head always felt so heavy and like a bowling ball. Now however I am able to go to work the next day. I recommend it to every person I meet!",
                    "My daily headaches started after a ventricular assist device (VAD). Maxalt has worked beautifully in killing the pain. Occasionally I will wake up with a headache the following day, but not severe enough to warrant another dose. I am careful to avoid triggers so don't have to take this very often. I am grateful that I have this option since I am allergic to NSAIDs.",
                    "Very effective with no side effects (i.e. drowsiness). I've had mixed luck with other migraine medicines, but find Maxalt MLT to be consistently helpful.",
                    "I have suffered from migraines for at least 15 years and tried so many medications and therapies to help. Maxalt is the only thing that helps me. I have missed a day to three of work in a row from migraines and now do not have to miss any. It takes the pain away within an hour. I don't get any effects from the drug really, maybe a bit tired once and awhile. My only complaint is the wafer tastes pretty gnarly but it is worth it!",
                    "If taken at the start of a migraine this medicine works wonders . There are side effects such as dry mouth, tiredness, and joint aches. But as anyone who has migraines know that is a small price to pay for relief from the migraine itself.",
                    "I've suffered from Pure Menstrual Migraine for 4 years. Nothing I have tried to date has helped ease any of the migraine pain at all, which usually goes on for 3 days solid every month, le. Until now. I asked my dr if I could try Rizatriptan and he agreed. My warning sign that a migraine is on it's way is an ache down the left hand side of my face. Well, within the last hour I got that warning so took my first ever Rizatriptan dissove in the mouth tablet. Revolting! Utterly vile - like a really bad mint that went off years ago. However, rather than spit it out (since they are very expensive) I let it dissolve. Now 40 mins later I have no ache and no pain, and I hope that means that I will not get a mega-migraine! So far so good ..",
                    "I avoid drugs of all kinds and I'm a usually healthy person. After suffering years from horribly painful headaches that would leave me vomiting all day and totally out of it (I thought it was due to whiplash injury), my doctor prescribed Rizatriptan 10mg. It truly is a miracle drug for me. I use the melt-away tablets, and find the relief starts in about 15 minutes, and by 30 minutes, any headache is gone. I take them at the very beginning of symptoms. I do get sleepy, so I've learned that I can just take half a tablet, get the same result, and not feel so tired. I have had very slight jaw pain once or twice, and cutting back the dosage also alleviated that problem.",
                    "Since I was about 26 I have suffered from migraines (now 65) and tried everything from daily preventative meds, to expensive self injecting & very expensive medication, then cafegot suppositories with 3 aspro clear for the pain, I could spend hours and days feeling like dying and vomiting non stop, then there was a shortage of cafegot and that was hell, and finally they took it off the market, that is when my Dr. asked me to trial Maxalt wafers, at first I thought nothing could replace cafegot and I was very conscious of not taking ergotomine with rizatriptan. Maxalt is the best, it works within an hour, and so far after 4-5 years no side effects at all, and no more vomiting ever. Also I do not take any other drugs for anything, but Maxalt.",
                    "Maxalt is truly one of the most amazing migraine medications I have ever tried, and believe me, having migraines as a child and now at 52 years of age, there have been many. As a migrainer, we truly know what suffering is. Maxalt is the best, although, after losing my job 18 months ago and with no success of getting another, it is too expensive. From my understanding the patent expires in 2012. I truly hope the price goes down for those of us who cannot be without it.",
                    "43 yr old male.For me this is close to a miracle cure, it has given my life back. I have had stomach and esophagus lesions due to way too much aspirin/ ibuprofen/digesics/codeine trying to halt an attack. No more screaming in E.R rooms waiting for pethidine/morphine. No more thoughts off grabbing a drill to stop the throbbing pain. I actually have a life after 26 yrs of suffering 2-4 attacks a week each last up to 36 hrs each. Numerous preventive medicines didn%u2019t work. I am truly in debt to the manufacturers and the on call doctor who gave me to Maxalt. Takes about 40-90 minutes to work with a second dosage sometimes needed. My fear is the more i take it the less effective it will become as lately I need the second wafer.",
                    "Bad headaches. This medicine works like it says it should.",
                    "I am very greatful for Maxalt wafers as they help me get rid of my migraines, although the side effects of insane burning and jaw pain last and hour before, the wafer curing my migraine.  Half half if you can endure the pain, its wonderful",
                    "Wonder drug. I tried many others. Maxalt MLT works so quick and free of all the usual side effects. I can use Maxalt MLT and within 30-60 minutes return to normal activities free of the normal after migraine haziness. It has given me my life back. Many thanks to Dr. Z. for prescribing this.",
                    "This medication is labeled a wonder drug in my household. It is the last line of defense and treatment for migraine. However and very sadly I might add recently the copay my insurance company imposed is going to make it hard to take. Limited to 4 tablets per week (while they state all medicines are calculated at a monthly dose level) NOW a copay of $60 per script makes it $240 for each myself and my wife. We just can't afford this after paying $2400.00 monthly for the insurance coverage. We are being choked to death! If the medicine was covered properly under the contract we could handle the $60 copay per month but because they limit the medication to 3-4 tablets per week. ",
                    "I took it for the first time today. My migraine was gone within an hour; however, it made me really sleepy. Three hours later, I'm still very groggy. Next time, I think I'll stay home from work and sleep it off. But missing work is what I'm trying to avoid. I'm incredibly thrilled that my migraine is gone, though.",
                    "I have suffered from hormonal migraines since puberty and am now in my fifties. I tried every option the Doctor could offer but nothing helped until I found Maxalt Melt about ten years ago. I call them my magic pill as they can clear a migraine completely within an hour. Very occasionally I have to take a second dose. They work for me with minimal side effects and are worth every penny. I'm in the UK so can get them on prescription.",
                    "I use this medication to help my migraines. I used to take Relpax. I quit taking it because it was too expensive and the side effects were strong. I like this medication because my insurance covers most of it and it is very effective with little side effects. The only cons are the taste (a little minty but the end has a bitter taste), I seem to get different side effects each time I take it (very mild, includes some drowsiness and nausea), also in my experience you need to take this medication as soon as you feel the migraine coming on or you may find yourself taking two or three pills during the migraine every two hours to keep it gone. Overall I find it very cost friendly and effective. I will continue using this medication.",
                    "My Migraine did Not go away . It might have only marginally lessened it . I went to bed for two hours and have felt terrible all day . This medication made me very sleepy . I took a Second Wafer some hours later but there was Still No Improvement ! Now I cannot take any other migraine medication for a whole 24 hours. Which is far too long . I made the mistake of taking the second wafer when the first one wasn't helping. I already had Jaw Pain so reading that others get it as a side effect makes me wonder. It reminds me of Imigraine and I thought that useless. Sydney Australia 2015.05.18",
                    "I've had ever-worsening migraines since I was in my 40's (I'm now 73). When they started, all that was available were drugs like Fiorinal and other mind-scrambling drugs. Finally, the triptans came along and saved my life. I started with Imitrex and tried the various other triptans, but Maxalt was the most effective. I would like to share one important observation: When I first started taking triptans, I had very few side effects, and was able to function at a high-level job, run home with kids, etc. HOWEVER, as I got older, I realized that side-effects emerged which have only gotten stronger over time. e.g. fogginess, sleepiness, nausea, etc. -- so be aware that side-effects can increase with age. Still, Maxalt is a life-saver.",
                    "I have been taking Maxalt for a couple of years and it's the only migraine medicine that gets rid of the pain without making me sick. I have a couple of side effects: tingling in my jaw, neck, and spine and also it makes me have to pee a lot. ",
                    "I have suffered with cluster headaches since I was in my twenties. I am now 61 and still get them, sometimes every few months and sometimes I can go several years, but when they hit, the are debilitating and I never know how many days or weeks they will continue. My physician gave me a sample to try as I had been having these headaches almost everyday for 2 or more weeks. Within 30-45 minutes the pressure and pain were gone and my drooping, puffy eye looked normal again. I plan to ask my doctor if he can prescribe a larger quantity so I can take them during these lengthy episodes. I would love to be part of a study on the efficacy of this drug on cluster headache patients. Wish I had known about it sooner.",
                    "This Med is nothing short of a miracle. Quick acting and has broken the cycle this making frequency decrease. Wish my insurance wasn't so tight on filling. I've waited years fora generic & they finally covered 4 pills. Woo hoo! Cheaper than an ER visit that doesn't even work as quickly. I would recommend this product to everyone who mentions the word migraine.",
                    "I love Maxalt my doctor gave it to me about 4 months ago. After years of no relief my migraine was gone in 20 minutes! I admit I get extremely sleepy after I take it but a 1 hour nap and I'm back in business. Much better then four days of blinding pain that's for sure it is very expensive but I contacted my local clinic and they had me fill out some forms and received a free 6 month supply at which time I can reapply. You can also try contacting the company online they may help depending on your income.",
                    "I love how fast I get relief with this and how the melting form ones work when I'm nauseated.",
                    "I have headache for an unknown reason, but they are always in the left temple behind my eye. The pain is awful. I've tried every over the counter med and this is the only one that works. Hopefully the cause can be cured until then. This are doing the job",
                    "I had a migraine for 7 days. When I finally couldn't take the pain anymore, I went to my doctor and was prescribed this medication. Within 20 minutes my migraine was gone. Its heaven sent. You have to take it as soon as you feel a migraine coming on. Also it makes me very sleepy. But almost all medications do that to me. If you haven't taken it ...get it. It will solve your migraine problems.",
                    "OMG! This stuff is a life changer! I suffer from migraines at least once or twice a week. Makes me feel a little nauseated for a few minutes but within 20 minutes my headache and nausea is gone. Now I have to figure out how to get more then my insurance will allow me to get in a month.... They only allow 9 a month :-/ Way better than Imatrex!",
                    "Aside from a slight burning sensation where my migraine is located this drug works wonderfully. Better than any nasal spray or OTC drug I've ever tried.",
                    "I've had migraines since I was 11 and was first prescribed Maxalt when I was 17. It's wonderful. I take it as soon as I start to notice the signs of a migraine and about 70% of the time the first dose does the job, within an hour or less. Occasionally I take a second dose if the symptoms haven't gone after 2-3 hours. Very occasionally it doesn't work at all. It has improved my life enormously. I evangelize about it. My migraines used to last up to 3 days - now I get a unkillable one only once or twice a year. Side effects for me are (as someone else has mentioned) one sneeze within a few minutes of taking it, a little drowsiness and eventually a little euphoria (though maybe that's a rational response to knowing the migraine has gone).",
                    "I've had migraines for years and have been given everything for them. I also believe I've gone through every triptan that one could imagine. This medicine has been phenomenal in relieving really tough migraine pain. Within 30 minutes I can get relief. Also, I like that you can get it in sublingual form. Sometimes my migraines are so bad that I'm constantly throwing up everything. When I'm nauseous the sublingual form is wonderful, however, it also comes in a tiny tablet. I keep this with me at all times. It has saved me from multiple hospital visits in the past. Hope this helps!",
                    "I've had Migraine headaches since grade school. This is the only medication that I have tried that gives me relief in less than 15 minutes and has no side effect",
                    "Very effective migraine medicine. Take at first sign of migraine and did very well.",
                    "I have had migraines since I was a teenager (I'm now 42.) After trying almost everything, including OTC meds and other tryptans that didn't work, I am so glad my Dr gave me Maxalt .It works every time. Very rarely I need a second dose, but I know it will always work.This drug has saved me from calling in sick to work on many occasions, and I can even take it at work if I need it, as I don't experience any side effects from it. My only complaint is the expense. Even with insurance and using generic, my copay is still $31 for only 12 pills that are supposed to last me a month.If I refill the prescription before that month ,the copay goes up to $50. Sometimes I will get 3 or 4 migraines a week, so 12 pills is just not enough.This is a great drug though.",
                    "Maxalt, especially the melt aways are simply amazing. I've had to take them off and on for years. (Going quite awhile without migraines.) Then the generic was introduced. I've tried two different kinds. They are not the same! The generic makes my headache get worse right after I take it, then about 1/2 hour later it might work. I'm usually asleep soon after that. I searched for the 'real' deal again and it is as I remembered. Started working RIGHT away with very little side effects. Maybe sore throat. Such a miracle for me. It is expensive at times depending on whim of insurance coverage, but I will pay to have pain go away!",
                    "I've suffered from severe, debilitating migraines since I was 30 (I'm now 49). I've been prescribed everything under the sun but Maxalt is the ONLY medication that works for me. First of all, it dissolves under my tongue so I know that if I vomit, I won't throw it up. Secondly, and especially if I take it at the first sign of a migraine, it usually only takes about 30 minutes to kick in and fully eradicate my migraine. Imitrex and the others I've been on haven't worked or haven't worked as completely as Maxalt. I consider it a life saver.",
                    "Tried a sample of Maxalt that the doctor gave me for the first time today and could not believe the results. Within 1 hour the migraine was gone and within 2 hours I was back to normal and working. This is truly a miracle medicine for me. I also take 100 mg of Topamax daily so that has really cut down on the migraines but again the Maxalt was a lifesaver for me today. I am worried about my copay after reading some of the post on here but I do have to say that I think it will be worth it.",
                    "I live in the UK so I get Maxalt free on NHS. I suffer from migraines a lot, and before I started taking Maxalt I would get minimum of 4 migraines a month sometimes more. These would last a whole 7 days with the first 24 hrs being hell! Its hard to explain to non-sufferers how painful these are. All of you will know what I am on about. Couldn't believe how amazing Maxalt was, didn't even reach the painful stage but it was totally gone. Works every time straight away for me. I take it along with codeine also prescribed. Tiny side effect, cramps in tummy but goes away within 30 mins. Worth it though!",
                    "Works nearly every time on one dose. The second dose will make you fell washed out for the next 24 hours. Life is normal with this drug as it works in about an hour. I am in the UK so NHS covers the costs of the drug.",
                    "Maxalt has worked wonders for me! I've suffered from migraines for several years now and Maxalt has been the only thing that can stop them. When I feel a migraine coming on I take one of the 10 mg dissolvable tablets and it soon disappears. Occasionally I do end up with a full-blown migraine (because I'm forgetful and don't always have Maxalt on me) and taking two doses helps it go away much more quickly than it would otherwise. Miracle!",
                    "Works about 75% of the time. So far this is the best medication I've been prescribed.",
                    "This is the only medicine that tackles my migraines. They can make me sleepy and stupid, but I'll take that over a migraine pain any day.",
                    "I've had migraines since I was about 9 years old because of a life long battle with insomnia. When I was a kid and I had my first migraine...I thought I was dying. I didn't understand what I had, what set it off or why I had it. And the pain and all of the vomiting. EVERYTHING hurt. Any light, the slightest noise and any movement I made while in bed made the migraine worse and I'd start vomiting NON-STOP. The doctor prescribed Maxalt to me. I didn't even know they MADE medicines for migraines and I have to say I cannot be without it. But as the directions state, take AS SOON as you feel a migraine (not just a headache) coming on. Your body usually gives you signs, for me it's excessive yawning every few seconds and irritability.",
                    "I had migraines for nearly 35 years after working in a building that had been \"bug bombed\" overnight. About 10 years ago I realized they only came from neck pain and chiropractic did not help. After an exceptionally bad reaction 3 years ago to Cafergot, I was prescribed Maxalt and it became my wonder medicine. I have not had a migraine now in nearly 18 months (something in my neck has moved to relieve the pressure) but I still take Maxalt when nothing else will get rid of a bad headache after all night pain last night, it was gone in 10 minutes when I finally took it this morning. I wish I had known about it decades ago, none of the other triptans worked for me.",
                    "Life changing, I love this medicine.",
                    "This is an amazing medicine that I can not live without. No side effects and completely knocks put the pain. Only once or twice did I need a second dose. It's a life saver. My insurance still covers it so I am lucky.",
                    "I have had migraines for about 12 years. Maxalt is the only drug that works and it works fast. Only problem is my insurance will only pay for 10 a month and when my cluster headaches come I eat through them like candy.",
                    "I have been taking Maxalt for migraines for the past five years. This medication is the only one I have found that really takes care of the migraine and any residual headache. The generic ones don't work for me. ",
                    "My migraines started on April 2 2016, I have had a constant headache since then, with the 13 migraines, after a CT scan in my neck, I have a long which needs to be removed, which could be the root cause for this ongoing headache however finally I was prescribed maxalt today after almost 4 months of suffering headaches and migraines,and taking other pain relief, icing it, quiet rooms, limiting bright light stimulation ,msiisng out on family and friend events and I cannot believe the difference it's made. I don't like taking medications, I try to do things naturally, think this really really helped, and I have so much relief. Kudos to the angel who told me about it from Medicare, while we were trying to sort out my card going missing",
                    "Maxalt was a wonderful medication for two years, then its effectiveness rapidly diminished. My unforeshadowed migraines feature very mild headaches; instead, I first lost my sense of balance, then my lunch, and then the desire to live for the next three hours. Although I was on a migraine-suppressing tricyclic and metroprolol, migraines would punch through two to eight times a month. Maxalt shutdown such migraines within 20 minutes-no side effects. (NOTE: Maxalt did not suppress the rare aura). After further adjustment of my daily medicines, my rescue medicine became Relpax  2 Aleve.",
                    "Tried some samples of Maxalt and while it got rid of my (minor in this case) migraine, I did experience a side effect that made me more than a bit nervous. I experienced numbness in my left hand and arm. My doctor told me to immediately stop using it. I'm a bit saddened that I can't continue on Maxalt as it did get rid of my migraine and definitely worked better than Imitrex, but not worth the risk of the side effect I experienced.",
                    "I had no luck with this medicine. I have tried a few different migraine medicines: Maxalt, Imitrex, Treximet, Fiortal, Indocin, Vicodin, and Percocet. I have suffered from migraines for 4 years, however I am able to recognize the signs before an attack. I attempted to take the Maxalt at the first sign of the migraine and nothing happened. On the other hand, I tried Treximet and had WONDERFUL results. Treximet is expensive, but if you have a healthcare plan that covers it, it works wonders (assuming you catch the migraine early). I am now on a daily dose of Topamax that has drastically cut the number of severe migraines per month .",
                    "I get hormonal migraines, about 3 a month. Just got the dissolvable tablet and tried it twice. Worked both times in about 30 minutes. I get pretty drowsy, but I get drowsy when taking Excedrin and Midol. Both times I used it, I had already taken an OTC and it hadn't worked. Next time I'll skip the OTC and just take this. ",
                    "Fantastic drug! Works every time within half an hour. Feel a little strange for around 30 minutes after taking it, but no other side effects. Highly recommend it as it's the only thing that works for my migraines",
                    "Maxalt almost always gets rid of my migraine with one pill. It does make me sleepy so I take it near bedtime. When I wake up, I am groggy for up to 6 hours. That is the only side effect I have experienced. If I am having what I call a migraine marathon (up to five days) I alternate taking Maxalt and Imitrex.",
                    "I have had migraines since my teenage years and am currently 49 years old. I sometimes go for long periods of time with no migraines, but then I can have migraine and accompanying neck pain that goes on for 2 days or more.  I've been on Fiorinal, then Fioricet, and just recently, Maxalt. Recently, I asked my Dr about having a different medication that would be legal to take to Europe, as Fioricet is banned in at least some, if not all, countries in Europe. Since another Dr had previously tried prescribing Maxalt, he had me try this. It WORKS. I find it works better and faster than other meds, and I don't feel woozy when taking it.  Tricare allows 18 pills per 45 day period before another refill.",
                    "I have used Maxalt for the past 7 years and I swear by it. If I feel a migraine coming on I put my melt into my mouth and I am free and clear in less then 15 minutes. Some people call this medicine Migraine Gold. To me it is a lifesaver.",
                    "I have had migraines for over 20 years. They were always debilitating and would last for days. I would literally pull my hair to relieve some of the pain. I went to all kinds of doctors to find out the cause, none took me seriously. Finally one doctor did and prescribed Maxalt as needed. She is my hero! When I feel a migraine coming on, I let a Maxalt melt in my mouth and in a few minutes, the migraine is forgotten. I have not had ANY side effects!",
                    "Have had migraine for 33 years. Experienced first one after giving birth for the first time. Migraines are very severe and symptoms include non stop vomiting, lack of balance, loss of sensation, sensitivity to light, sound, etc. Rizatriptan works for a migraine attack which is not so severe. It has to be taken immediately. I usually lie down quietly for 20 minutes after taking it and then it works. It does not completely get rid of the headache, but suppresses it. This allows you to get on with your day. It makes me very tired, and makes my body feel heavy. Reactions are sometimes slower, so don't drive. If it does not work within 20-30 minutes, then it won't. ",
                    "I used to take the Maxalt in pill form and these work 2x as fast. I took one today at the first sign of a headache and it stopped it in it's tracks in just under 15 minutes. The pill used to take 30 and often the headache had time to bloom and get bad by then. They didn't immediately get rid of the nausea I get, but it went away in about 20 min after it stopped the bloom. I rated these as a 9 because of the taste. They taste a bit like a peppermint candy that's gone bad, but it's bearable and only lasts for about 5 seconds. I usually wash the flavor away with coffee - I like to back up anything I take for a headache with a good dose of caffeine. These will be replacing my Maxalt pills even if they do taste awful.",
                    "Rizatriptan has enabled me to control my headaches and continue a near normal life.",
                    "I have suffered with migraine since I was 12 yr old, and I'm now in my 50's. I've had every head exam and test possible as well as tried a myriad of medications over the years for treatment. From taking preventive type things daily to treating the pain only during the headache. Nothing has given me the swift relief as this drug. It seems to give me complete relief within 30-40 minutes, without any side effects (that I've noticed). I took immitrex for years with little relief and horrible side effects. It would make me feel dizzy, weird and always made me nauseous. So I stopped taking it. Now with the Maxalt, I'm thrilled to know I can take it without worry of unwanted side effect. Thank you Maxalt! Finally migraine relief! ",
                    "Migraines since I was 15, now in my 40's. Identified as menstrual migraines in my early 30's after 1st child, up to 5 days of migraines every 26 days. Nothing worked before, but started taking rizatriptan 9 months ago. It works every time, no side effects. I have my life back. Amazing. Recommend making a mentrual and migraine diary before going to the doctor.",
                    "Maxalt has less side effects, for me, than other Migraine Medication. Previously I have been on the Maxalt 5 but needed to go up to the Maxalt 10 which helps relieve the pain more completely. I tried many other medicines, and this has been the best for me, I believe it is different for every person. My nausea does increase on this medication, but no chest heaviness as with other medicines.",
                    "For me Maxalt is a miracle drug. I have tried almost everything OTC, and nothing worked. Excedrin worked for awhile, then after a few weeks, it stopped working. I can always count on Maxalt to get rid of my migraines. I usually feel relief within an hour of taking it. That being said ,this drug is very expensive. Even with insurance and taking the generic version, I am still out of pocket about $50 a box, and they only give you 12 pills. Sometimes I have 3 or 4 migraines in a week, so this can get really expensive. It works wonders for me though, so unfortunately it's a necessary expense.",
                    "Didn't work for me. I had serious allergic reaction. My tongue swelled up, my cheeks were going numb and had to take Benadryl within 30 minutes of taking this medicine.",
                    "I took it when I was felt a migraine coming on and I experienced dizziness, memory loss, shakiness and a fever. I had used it before with no problems.",
                    "Good relief without being too wiped out",
                    "I have suffered from migraines since I was 15 , and am now 42. Maxalt has changed my life ! I used to be in agony for up to 3 days , but now at the first sign of an attack I take one , very rarely I have had to take another one a few hours after that if it started to come back . It can sometimes make me drowsy, but other times I have no side effects , just relief that there is something that actually works . I'm in Australia, so a pack of 4 costs me $25 .",
                    "Maxalt saved my life! It is the only medicine that works for me when have a migraine attack, I swear by it and carry it with me always just in case. It literally gave me back my life, I was ill for days that ran into weeks that went into months. It was shocking, I felt suicidal with having no life and one day was sitting in my doctors room sobbing begging him to help me, and he prescribed me rizatriptan (maxalt). I love it!!",
                    "Usually the migraine wakes me up at night with the pain beginning at the base of my head. I keep the rizatriptan on my bedside table and I take it immediately. When I wake in the morning the pain is gone. Before I would wake with the pain, and it would linger for days with hardly no relief. I works great for me.",
                    "I have had no side effects to date, and the medicine quickly relieves symptoms. Best medication I have taken for treatment of migraines.",
                    "It works rather well but puts me to sleep for about 3 hours. I am still trying to find a migraine drug that does not put me to sleep. ",
                    "I have had migraines for over 30 years. Have tried everything. This works the best almost every time. I'd say 9 out of 10 times it cures the migraine and is a winner in my book.",
                    "I take Maxalt 10mg ODT when my Imitrex fails. Maxalt rarely fails and is actually my back up plan but has lately been my go to since Imitrex has stopped working completely. Maxalt is great! It works within an hour of taking it and I have little to no side effects. I give it a 9 because it does make me shake and if I take two, it will make me feel washed out the next day. Of course, all of this is an even trade for killing a migraine. Overall, great and effective drug!",
                    "Maxalt has really changed how I felt about my migraines. Before I was prescribed Maxalt, I would suffer terribly, taking only OTC medications which \"never\" helped much. Now when I feel those tell-tale signs of a migraine coming on (I do not experience any \"aura\"), I take a Maxalt (and sometimes some ibuprofen, too) and I know my migraine will be gone within the hour! And I'm not sleepy.",
                    "Maxalt is great. Once I can tell my headache is starting I take the pill. Usually in less than 30-60 minutes I forget that my head was hurting and I am able to work for 8-12 hours, smometimes longer. I agree with another comment: it gives no side effects like a rapid heart rate or chest pain. After having surgery I got spinal meningitis which started my migranes when I was 34 years old. Now at 48 I am thankful for Maxalt.",
                    "When I took a 10 mg dose it made me nauseous and super high, and now three days later I am still nauseaous and have had to call out of work because ive been feeling like im going to vomit if i stand up. I look to try and function as normal when i take abortive migraine medication, this one has made me feel worse. At least I can actually go to work when I have just a migraine.",
                    "I have had migraines since I was 9 so for 22 years now. I tried Imitrex nasals with no results. My hero of a doctor prescribed Maxalt 8 years ago and I can manage my life now. I don't have any side effects from it although it wouldn't matter since I now get relief! I have found migraine medicines are hit or miss for many so I'm beyond pleased I found a hit. I recommend Maxalt to anyone that will listen.",
                    "I am 34 years old and have suffered migraines on and off since I was about 10 years old. This is the first medication that has helped me. It great that it is a wafer and easy to take as vomiting is perhaps what stops other medications from working? Thank you maxalt, I love you!",
                    "When I was about 23, I started getting horrific migraines out of nowhere that would incapacitate me for days at a time. My neurologist couldn't find anything wrong and I tried several medications (some would take at least 12 hours to have an effect). The only medication that ever successfully treated my migraines was Maxalt and it pretty much gave me my life back. It would still take at least an hour to work but it was really a life changer. Ultimately, I sought an ENT and after I had sinus surgery (and corrected my deviated septum) in 2011, my migraines never returned. But if they ever did come back, I would be running to Maxalt as my savior again!",

I get pain in my Left scapula that eventually radiates into the base of my skull through to my Left eye. If taken right away, I get almost total relief in 20-40 minutes. If I wait longer, it may take over an hour to work. Works over 90 percent of the time averaging 12 headaches per month. Side effects for me are a tightening sensation in my neck (where the arteries are on either side) then a \"floaty\" sensation. The pain goes away and I'm left tired, yawning frequently and a little fuzzy minded, but able to function much better than with the migraine. I've tried imitrex, zomig, midrin, and rx pain relievers. Maxalt has worked by far the best for me.",
                    "I went to see a headache specialist yesterday, and she recommended I take this for my migraines, which occur about 2-3 times a month. Of course, I woke up this morning with one. The tabs taste pretty bitter but when your head hurts, you don't really care. Just wash it down with water once it's done dissolving. Within half an hour it had subsided. As somebody who is used to suffering through them for 2 days, this is truly amazing.",

This is also a plus at night as I could not sleep with migraines. The pounding and the pain would keep me up all night. Highly recommend this to anyone suffering from migraines. The drowsiness is not so bad that if I needed to stay awake I would be unable to.",

My grandma, mom, sisters and brothers all have them they did not even skip a generation.. my daughter and nieces as well get them. My physician calls mine sinus migraines. I get stomach pain, vomiting, an aura, light sensitivity. They had me on demerol, Percocet, phenergan, imitrex, nothing helped. I have been on maxalt a few years and the one thing I have noticed is that i get pain around the upper jaw area just under the ear...then all of a sudden like the snap of a finger all pain is gone 15 to 25 min. It makes me drowsey. I wake up from my nap feeling great but real thirsty.",
                    "Yesterday was my first time when I took Maxalt-MLT to cure my migraine. My doctor prescribed this drug six months ago but all those months I had no incidence of a migraine. Yesterday was again after my weight lifting workout. I only get migraines after a workout the last years. I always get aura for about 20 minutes before a headache begin. That is good the doctor said because I can take Maxalt faster before the pain begins. My first impression is that the aura lasted about 15 minutes and the pain was bearable in a scale of ten I would say 6.5 compared to other times that reaches 9 -10. The first 10 minutes, I was feeling a little bit weird and little dizzy. After 90 minutes the migraine got away, I think it needs about 90 minutes to act",
                    "I have suffered with severe menstrual migraines for 25+ years to the point where I fantasize about amputating my head. I was on Imitrex (made me very sleepy), Relpax (worthless) , generic (even worse). Maxalt is my go to medicine. Unfortunately its a fight with the insurance company to get regular refills. They are trying to force me to take a generic. I used to get 12 tablets and they changed it to 9- which 9 is not enough. When I run out I cannot help but pray for the day I get a refill fearing I will get a migraine before that time. When the refill day comes, I stalk my pharmacy on the phone until it is ready. Ugh...talk about \"drug-seeking\" !",

                    "Tried Imitrex and Relpax first, but had bad heart-squeezing and neck-squeezing side effects. Tried Maxalt and did not have that problem. It usually takes away the migraines, but can take 1-2 hours to get relief. I'm also very fatigued after the pain goes away, which makes daytime onset of migraines a hassle. Also for the 1-2 hours I am waiting for it to work, the pain actually intensifies until suddenly it lets go and the blood vessels in my head feel cold. Strange, but true.",
                    "Within half an hour, the headache has totally subsided. sometimes need a second dose. It does cause my skin to feel sensitive to heat and my throat feels tight for about 2 hours but the headache and all symptoms are totally gone. Brilliant",
                    "Today was my first time taking Rizatriptan and the fact that I am able to write this review just hours after the onset of a migraine is amazing because normally I would be completely down for the count for at least a whole day with a migraine. So here is my experience: I have taken countless meds before including Imitrex with terrible side effects and zero relief so naturally I was skeptical about this new med. I took it as soon as I knew that this was going to be a particularly bad migraine. The only side effect I had was sleepiness, no \"heart attack\" feeling as I had experienced with Imitrex. I fell asleep within 15 min of taking Rizatriptan and woke up 2 hours later completely migraine free.",
                    "This pill is like a magic. I just noticed that the pill works in minutes for me and I feel a bit dizziness and like a burning head and then the pain is gone. Today I got a early migraine and I was able to use the MLT and work kind of slowly but it stopped the pain in time. But I still feel very sensitive to light. Great medication ask your doctor for Maxalt or Maxalt-MLT.",
                    "As you may know, migraines are extremely debilitating even when trying to perform most menial tasks let alone professional responsibilities. I tried Maxalt for the first time today approximately 20 minutes after my first aura and it actually works. I am happily surprised! I have yet to experience any side effects. However, lets be honest, I'd be tolerant of almost anything besides a migraine - which feels like a freight train chugging through my head.",
                    "Must take within 20 minutes of onset. The longer you wait, the longer it takes to work. Keep it in your pocket/wallet at all times. For me, it is a lifesaver.",
                    "My experience was mixed. I took Maxalt MLT as soon as I had my usual \"Aura\". It worked within 30 minutes. The aura was gone and I never did get a migraine. However, within an hour I had a severe angina attack and had to take my nitro twice to relieve the pain. Nitro glycerin gives you a headache, so I think I'd rather have the migraine than the chest pain! My daughter took it and had a wonderful experience, took the pain away within 30 minutes and no side effects at all. I guess I won't be taking it again. Too bad, it worked on the migraine.",
                    "Maxalt has helped me so much. My migraines get so intense and the minute I take Maxalt I start to feel relief.",
                    "Maxalt is a very good migraine medicine for me. No side effects but only a little tired but that's good.",
                    "1 Maxalt malt usually starts working in 30 to 45 minutes for me. Within an hour I'm able to continue my day. I have very frequent migraines and have used Maxalt for many years. No real side effects except a bit of drowsiness. And it is very expensive. Insurance does not cover the whole cost.",
                    "I suffer with cluster headaches. Extreme pain of the highest order. I found Rizatriptan melt in the mouth tablets to be superb.",
                    "This medication worked well to keep my cluster headache pain to a minimum. I found it did not work well when the cluster lasted longer than 2 weeks.",
                    "I've always had 3 day migraines. MaxAlt will take it away in about 35 minutes. Sometimes I would have to take another one (dissolved in my mouth) the next day. I cannot stress enough how much I love this medicine. I come from days when Darvon's were given for migraines, they didn't do anything but zombie you with the pain. I thank the scientist who figured out how to control whatever it is that is being controlled. Of course, it IS too expensive. Without insurance, I would have to suffer, as they are about $32 per pill!",
                    "I've had chronic migraines for around 12 years. I take 5mg and it usually takes care of my headache. It makes my neck ache a little but the relief from the horrible symptoms of a migraine are well worth it. I've tried other triptans but this one works best. The generic is very inexpensive.",
                    "I have just started experiencing migraines and thought my life was over at first. Nothing was working and I couldn't be a wife to my husband or mom to my five year old daughter. Since starting this miracle drug as we call it, I am myself again. The only side effect I am experiencing is having to pee a lot. I don't know if I am alone in that matter, but I would gladly substitute spending sometime in the potty then spending a whole day in the ER or in the bedroom in the dark.",
                    "The Maxalt-MLT self-dissolving tab worked wonders for me. At a time when my doctor was trying to determine the most-effective treatment form my migraine headaches, this medicine was a God-send. My doc gave me samples of various triptan meds and I was to try one out at the onset of every migraine. Of the 5-6 different samples I was given, Maxalt-MLT worked the fastest & had the least amount of side-effects. I was amazed. Unfortunately, my insurance would not cover it and I had to settle with sumatriptan. Sumatriptan worked, but it took about an hour and I just remember feeling really weird after taking it. Anyway, if/when my migraines start again- Maxalt is what I want.",
                    "Have just been prescribed Maxalt Melt after a lifetime of pain and feel I have discovered gold! My only disappointment is having only three pills when I need a truckload!",
                    "Upon 1st using this approximately 6 or so years ago I too labeled this as a miracle, unfortunately my last 3 migraines they have had no effect. ",
                    "It is the only med that has helped my migraines!",
                    "Relieved my headache quickly! The best I've tried in the last 5 years! Been through pain medicines and imitrex, Maxalt works best hands down.",
                    "I have suffered from migraines since I was a kid. I'm 49 now. In my mid 30s I started taking imitrex and it completely derailed me. I then started trying a bunch of preventative drugs, beta blocker, calcium blockers and ssri drugs. Finally found one that works fairly well, but along with that I use maxalt as a rescue drug which I still take 6+ times a month. It's a good drug and is effective. I have always noticed the migraines redoubles its efforts before leaving after I take it. I also notice it makes me very sleepy and foggy. I don't like to take it at work because of that. 9 times out of 10 it works, but there are still times it does nothing for me. Some is better than none in my world though. I take a generic due to cost.",
                    "I have suffered from migraines Since An Auto accident in 2009, sometime as many as 15 a month. I was prescribed Maxalt this past year (after trying a whole bag of other medicines). It has given me my life back... within thirty minutes after taking Maxalt the symptoms decrease by 50% and are gone within an hour. Several side effects, very drowsy and increased nausea but after several hours of sleep all is good.",
                    "I have tried OTC migraine medicines, and three other prescriptions. Maxalt is by far the best, and MLT makes it nearly perfect. The only bad side effect I have is that the back of my neck gets sore. Maxalt does this far less than Zomig, and taking Advil Liquigels or Vicodin with the Maxalt MLT helps quite a bit. My ideal treatment for a migraine is to take Maxalt MLT and Advil Liquigels, then lay down with something cold on my forehead. Once I am able to doze, I sleep until I wake up on my own. I can't believe how much better I feel after the nap. At work, I just take the two medicines. It takes me longer to feel better, but makes my headache much more bearable.",
                    "Works well, Headaches gone in about 2 hours of taking it.",
                    "99% of the time my migraine symptoms fade within an hour. I have had to take a second tablet only twice in ten years. I can function as normal. The only drawback is feeling tired and increased urination, but compared to going through a 36 hour migraine, that's nothing!",
                    "I would definitely try this for migraines if you haven't already. I had used Imitrex pills for a few years and suddenly they stopped working. I tried a couple different pills and then found Maxalt. The only problem with the pills is that I have to take them right away. Once the migraine has started they don't take away all the pain, only like 60% for me. I was on Maxalt for a few years, then put on Cymblata and didn't have migraines for 2 years on that, but then they came back and Maxalt didn't help me... Now I use Imitrex Statdose because I never catch my migraine until it's terrible but the injections get rid of the pain fast!",
                    "Miracle drug for me! Migraine gone within the hour of taking Maxalt. It made me groggy but I will take that over hours of pain",
                    "Miracle medicine! Only thing that helps my migraines and within minutes. Insurance wont cover so will have to find an alternative. If your insurance covers it, it is well worth it!",
                    "I am 56 and I've suffered with migraines since I was 5 years old. Maxalt is the only migraine medication that has worked wonders for me!! I take one as soon as I get the slightest beginning of a migraine and it is gone in 20 minutes! Not only that, but I've been taking it for 3 years now and I used to get 2 or 3 migraines a month, and now I only get about 1 every 2 months! Maxalt has been like a miracle for me...I no longer have to suffer with horrible headaches!! Additionally, I have not experienced any side effects!",
                    "One Maxalt-MLT usually gets rid of the migraine in an hour or less. Occasionally, I need another one 2 hours later to really get rid of it for good. Rarely, even the second one did not quite do it for me. But this is still the most effective medicine that's worked for me, after trying 8-10 other medicines (over-the-counter and prescription).",
                    "This is a miracle drug! I've tried all sorts of medicines over the past 30 some years and this drug is the only one that has ever stopped my migraines. If you are like me and have migraines often, then you got to try this drug, of course not all people have the same experience with medicines, but it is well worth trying.",
                    "I am a 35yo female and had my first migraine at 16yo just after giving birth to my firstborn. Over the years, particularly after each baby, the symptoms have become worse and are always experienced during menstruation. Recently codeine products that would normally help are not even touching the sides of the pain, and I have been experiencing increasing levels of sickness that anti-nausea tablets don't have any impact on. But yesterday a friend gave me a maxalt wafer because I couldn't function under the intensity of the sickness and pain. At first it didn't seem to do anything. But after maybe an hour to 90 minutes and I was no longer sick, nor was I in pain!! It was like a miracle!! How ever vision was slightly more blurred than usual.",
                    "Took this for the first time last night. Worked as well as Relpax (which my insurance no longer covers). I could actually get a good night's sleep!",
                    "Works well for my migraines. For me, I start feeling better in 20 minutes or so, and am completely back to normal within two hours.",
                    "Maxalt does work. Usually Fioricet works but when my migraine becomes worse Fioricet doesn't do anything and Maxalt does the trick!",
                    "This is the best sos pill for migraines, I barely have side-effects from it and if I melt it in my mouth it acts much faster killing my migraine in less than 20 minutes. I cannot imagine my life without Rizatriptan !! It gave me my life back!",
                    "I've been using maxalt for about 6 years (give or take) and it's about the only medication I've found that really gets rid of my migraines. The MLT version is great when your stomach's so upset you can't keep down a pill, too. The only side effect I've ever had is a tingling feeling in my shoulders. Well worth the co-pay!",
                    "I started taking Maxalt after horrible experiences with Imitrex. I had almost all the same side effects: extreme nausea, dizziness, falling asleep, and a general out of it feeling the rest of the day. But the worst part is that it did absolutely nothing for my migraine. I am just glad that I had samples so I didn't get stuck paying for a prescription I would not use. ",
                    "I have suffered migraines since childhood 2-5 migraines a year. Then at about 38 I started getting these horrible severely debilitating headaches 1-3 times a year and the headaches would last up to weeks with intermittent increase in severity. I was finally diagnosed with cluster headaches and prescribed Rizatriptan. If I feel the onset it diminishes the intensity and duration. I have been using it for 2 years and very grateful.",
                    "My first time taking it. I have complex partial seizures and my aura has changed to where I now have migraine headaches afterwards. We are doing test to rule out other problems but this medicine helped me more than anything so far. Still have that groggy feeling afterwards but I can deal with that. Just do not know how I can take it should I have to at work since I work in a call center 10 hours a day with constant calls.",
                    "I have used maxalt four times in the last three months. The first time it worked fine and it was gone in a few hours but had heart racing.  The second migraine I was concerned about the side effects but gave a second chance. I had severe throbbing in my head like it was going to explode and then suddenly the migraine broke.  My third attempt my migraine was so severe that I had to take a second dose for relief! I find that if I take it on the onset it works but still light headache and felt numbing sensation.  My fourth today no relief after 2nd dose. Took 3rd after 4 hours but still feeling migraine. Had slight heart racing and throbbing pain. I may continue to see if this is right meds. If not, then I think there's no hope for me!",
                    "Works fast limited side effects.",
                    "This is the only migraine medicine that consistently gets rid of my migraines. I've tried Zomig, Imitrex, and many others - but Maxalt gets it gone in 15-30 minutes and I'm back, up and ready to get back into life. I can even take one at work and just rest my eyes at my desk until it kicks in. Never could do that before.",
                    "This medicine is a miracle drug. I have migraines that last for 3 days and until my doctor prescribed maxalt I could not get rid of them or function properly. Now I take a pill and within 30 min it is gone. My life is so much nicer I am up moving around exercising and actually living my life like a normal person.",
                    "I call this my \"miracle drug\". I had been suffering from constant migraines since I was 9 years old. I am now 64. They used to tell my parents I was \"high-strung\" and had \"tension headaches\". I was never diagnosed with migraine until I was about 48 years old. This is the ONLY drug that has ever stopped my migraine (of course...you have to take it immediately at the onset, as with all migraine meds). I had lost so many days of my life to the extreme pain/nausea and impaired vision/speech/general functionality before I discovered rizatriptan. Quite literally, I thank God for leading someone to develop this and for someone prescribing it for me.",
                    "I am a 42 yr old male and I have been susceptible to migraines since I was very little. My worst childhood memories are of me moaning and rocking back and forth in agony on my bed when suffering from my very first migraines as an 8 or 9 yr old child. I too have not had any luck with Imitrex and some of the other medicines mentioned in this post. My insurance gives me terrible problems when I am trying to get a migraine prescription filled. As it is right now I have figured out that Axert and Maxalt are the only two medicines that I know will work for certain when I am afflicted and totally incapacitated by migraine headaches. The problem with Axert is that my insurance will only allow a monthly script of 6 tablets at $10/tablet. Maxalt does it for less dollars.",
                    "Migraine, the word can't convey the impact on life. For me, a typical one lasted about 36 hours, followed by another 24 hours of \"hangover\". Somewhere during the 36 hour duration, would be 12 hours of hell. I've used Maxalt MLT about 10-12 times over the last 6 months. It has worked every time; I take one when I sense a migraine is starting, and it just doesn't \"blossom\". I have no side effects, no nausea, and no drowsiness. Sometime in the next 20-30 minutes I'll realize the apprehension, tension and other precursors to the migraine have just disappeared. Migraines took too much of my life, and at their worst, pushed depression to the edge of suicide; it's good to have a normal life back.",
                    "Maxalt is the only migraine medicine I have tried, and it works well for me. When I take it early (before it becomes a full-bloomed migraine), it works within maybe 30 minutes, completely getting rid of the pain. I do have some side effects: most of the time, I feel a tightening of the throat for about 15 minutes after taking it (my doctor had warned me about that), and if I happen to be a bit tired when taking it, I feel a bit dizzy for a couple of hours. But it sure beats a 24-hour migraine.",
                    "I have tried different medicines for migraines, all just calmed it down a little, it just had to run its 3 day duration. Am seeing another Dr & she put me on Maxalt yesterday, my migraine was gone within an hour of taking it. I just want to go back and hug her because after 5 yrs of trying I just accepted my pain. It made me drowsy, but I will take drowsy over pain any day.",
                    "Amazing! I took Imitrex for years and it didn't really help. Maxalt is the only medication that works for me to continue my busy life. I have had hormonal migraines since I was 12. Tried everything from pain medicines (temporary fix) to nasal to shots. I love Maxalt!",
                    "I had my doubts that this would work -- it was fantastic! within 15-20 minutes the pain that felt like my skull was in a vise disappeared. I am a horse trainer and I work full time on my own farm, and I can't function when I have a migraine, ( 4-5 attacks a month, 24-48 hours each time) Maxalt 10-mg was a miracle for me. I don't have to put all the work on my daughter, and my temper has become much more even. The anxiety of worrying about a migraine attack has helped enormously, for my emotional state, too. **side note** I had a Mirena IUD and had it removed, I believe this contributed to the attacks, so hopefully in 4-6 weeks I won't need the Maxalt, either.",
                    "This works wonders for me, but makes me a little nutty for awhile. Better than migraines by a long shot. They try and make it taste minty, but still a little foul tasting.",
                    "Works within minutes usually. Have not noted any side effects with it although I do not care for taste. After it melts and is gone, I drink water to get taste out of my mouth.",
                    "Maxalt relieves my migraine in 1 hour however it does make me sleepy. I love the fast dissolve feature. I will have to stop using it however due to the rising cost not covered by my insurance company. I am now hoping Imitrex will work as well.",
                    "I have used this medication for over 3 years now. Just recently I was told to take 2 instead of one since my migraines seem to be getting worse each time (I blame it on MS). Nothing else works for me. I can deal with the kids bickering. I carry this drug with me always! ",
                    "This medication always takes my migraine away. It is the only medicine that has done that for me. Sometimes I do get rebound headaches from the medicine, but I am pleased that I have finally found something to take the migraine away. I just wish I could find something to alleviate my migraines altogether because I get them way too often."

                    "//What is it?//Headache and migraine are different entities. Migraine is one of the most common and well characterized, but there are 14 broad categories that can be subdivided into more than 200 different forms. Migraine itself has about 20 different genres. In general, headaches are divided into two large groups: primary and secondary. Primary illnesses correspond to a disease, not reflecting other health problems and represent around 90% of the total. Secondary symptoms are symptoms of diseases of the nervous system or other organs of the human body. They can occur in cases of flu, alcohol poisoning or withdrawal, minor head trauma, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels) or a high blood pressure crisis. Migraine is a primary headache in which very intense episodes of pain occur interspersed with periods without symptoms. In general, it begins between the ages of 15 and 40, but it can appear in childhood or shortly after the first menstruation. If it appears for the first time after the age of 45, other causes must be excluded. Some of its characteristics are closely associated with the female reproductive cycle: higher prevalence after the first menstruation or during the menstrual period; occasional worsening due to taking birth control pills or hormone therapy; attenuation or disappearance during pregnancy or menopause. Before adolescence, migraines affect boys and girls equally. From then on, it is two to three times more common in females. It is estimated that 8% to 15% of individuals living in Western countries (including Portugal) suffer from this problem. The fact of reaching people in the productive phase implies large economic, social and family costs.//Symptoms//It appears recurrently, several times throughout life, but always with completely free intervals. If it occurs every day, it is probably overuse of painkillers or other medications. Drug abuse can convert a migraine into a chronic daily headache. There are people who preferably appear on the weekend. These crises can be precipitated by changes in sleep schedule, failure to eat breakfast, reduced stress or alcohol abuse. In these cases, it is important to consider a lifestyle change over the weekend. The symptoms are intense and often prevent work or study. The pain tends to be throbbing, worsening with physical exertion or head movements. In general, it affects only one side of the head, and is accompanied by nausea, vomiting, intolerance to light, noise and some smells. It is not mandatory that all of these elements are present simultaneously. And they can occur twice a week or just a few throughout a lifetime. During attacks, people seek a dark, quiet place to rest or fall asleep. An episode can last from a few hours to three days. Between attacks, there are usually no complaints. Some types of migraines may have more complex symptoms (with aura). These forms are less common, affecting around 15% of people with this problem, and include transient neurological symptoms, originating attributable to certain areas of the brain. The other signs are identical to those of migraine without aura. The most common auras are temporary vision disorders, in the form of loss of vision on one side of the visual field, blurred images, perception of bright points, geometric figures or bright zigzags. Other auras can be translated as tingling or numbness on one side of the face or one of the hands. There are people who have difficulty speaking or even temporary paralysis of their limbs, usually only on one side of the body. These changes last about 10 to 30 minutes and precede the pain. In children, migraines tend to be bilateral, less intense and of shorter duration. Vomiting and dark circles can be exuberant. Disturbances in sleep and meal schedules are common precipitating factors. Treating these crises is easier than in adults. Sleep usually gives good results. At these ages, the occipital location is not normal and, when present, requires a medical consultation. Likewise, the presence of headaches with morning vomiting or other unusual symptoms in very young children should be seen by a healthcare professional.//Causes//It is caused by a combination of brain processes: excitation/depression of cells, dilation of arteries and release of chemicals. People with migraine are more sensitive to certain stimuli, environmental or from their own body, that can trigger these brain processes. It is also thought that there is some genetic susceptibility. Some individuals can identify the signs of their attacks. The most common are cheese, chocolate, strawberries, seafood, wine, artificial sauces, changes in sleep patterns, stress, menstruation, fasting, physical exercise, and minor trauma. Others cannot identify them at all. People who drink coffee regularly may experience headaches when they stop this habit.//Diagnosis//The key to diagnosis lies in the clinical history, physical and neurological examination. Observation of the fundus is a very important part of these procedures. In some cases, it may be necessary to resort to computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to exclude other diseases.//Treatment//Migraines have no cure but can be controlled. There are medications and behaviors that can reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks. Symptomatic treatment, during acute periods, involves resting in a quiet, dark place. Pressure or cold can be applied to the area of \u200b\u200bpain. At this stage, analgesics, anti-inflammatories, antiemetics and triptans are very useful.//Prevention//People with migraines should create calendars that allow them to identify their symptoms and assess their impact on their quality of life. The first step in prevention is to identify and eliminate precipitating factors, whenever possible. In some cases, it is necessary to use daily medication to reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks, but there are no drugs specifically developed for their prevention. However, there are some drugs used in other contexts that have proven to be effective, such as beta-blockers, antidepressants or antiepileptics, and these should always be prescribed by a doctor.

Only side effects are tiredness and strangely It makes me sneeze just once as soon as I have taken it. Maxalt has completely changed my life. Fortunate to live in UK as I get it free on national health prescription.",
                    "I have had migraines since I was 12 yrs. Old, I am 67. As a child I just suffered all the time. When I was in my late 20's, fiorinal was the answer. It did help. There have been a couple of others (can't remember the name). Then imitrex came out. Didn't work. I did not find relief, even with addition of percocet until maxalt came out. Thank heavens. Mostly 20 days per month. I learned very quickly first sign for me is a slice of pain, then I immediately take the maxalt. Within a half hour, 99% gone. I have been so fortunate to have medicine coverage through private employer insurance with reasonable copay, otherwise it would affect my ability to support myself. I take over 12 meds per day..No interactions",
                    "Works within 2 hours but my migraine always returns the next day. I take the medication the next day - headache goes away within two hours - comes back the next day again. Medication works but I feel extremely tired and depressed for the three days. Insurance companies also limit me to 9 pills a month which adds to my stress.",
                    "This medication worked great for me to get rid of my headache. When I take it before I feel a bad migraine coming on, it alleviates it before it gets bad. My only complaint about this medication is I get really bad heart burn and I really do not sleep that well while I am on it. I guess you can%u2019t have everything.",
                    "I occasionally get migraine when I have been in stressful situations. It appears that my migraine are related to a deficit of serotonin. I also get migraines in stores that sell lots of cheap plastic items. This medication is 100% effective for me.",

                    "To me, this is the ONE medicine I can not live without. I have had to try others due to insurance, and none comes even close! Within 15-30 even the strongest, wanting to smash my head-in migraine will be totally gone! No side effects for me either. Never makes me tired, groggy or the medicated feeling. Taken on empty stomach while in college class and had no problems finishing the class and going home to play with the kids and not the mom who was hiding in a dark room with no noise allowed in the house.",
                    "Maxalt has worked wonders for me. When I have migraines I never feel like swallowing tablets, so the fact that I have the dissolving tablet is an absolute bonus. Before this medicine I was bedridden for days at a time, and after a migraine, my head always felt so heavy and like a bowling ball. Now however I am able to go to work the next day. I recommend it to every person I meet!",
                    "My daily headaches started after a ventricular assist device (VAD). Maxalt has worked beautifully in killing the pain. Occasionally I will wake up with a headache the following day, but not severe enough to warrant another dose. I am careful to avoid triggers so don't have to take this very often. I am grateful that I have this option since I am allergic to NSAIDs.",
                    "Very effective with no side effects (i.e. drowsiness). I've had mixed luck with other migraine medicines, but find Maxalt MLT to be consistently helpful.",
                    "I have suffered from migraines for at least 15 years and tried so many medications and therapies to help. Maxalt is the only thing that helps me. I have missed a day to three of work in a row from migraines and now do not have to miss any. It takes the pain away within an hour. I don't get any effects from the drug really, maybe a bit tired once and awhile. My only complaint is the wafer tastes pretty gnarly but it is worth it!",
                    "If taken at the start of a migraine this medicine works wonders . There are side effects such as dry mouth, tiredness, and joint aches. But as anyone who has migraines know that is a small price to pay for relief from the migraine itself.",
                    "I've suffered from Pure Menstrual Migraine for 4 years. Nothing I have tried to date has helped ease any of the migraine pain at all, which usually goes on for 3 days solid every month, le. Until now. I asked my dr if I could try Rizatriptan and he agreed. My warning sign that a migraine is on it's way is an ache down the left hand side of my face. Well, within the last hour I got that warning so took my first ever Rizatriptan dissove in the mouth tablet. Revolting! Utterly vile - like a really bad mint that went off years ago. However, rather than spit it out (since they are very expensive) I let it dissolve. Now 40 mins later I have no ache and no pain, and I hope that means that I will not get a mega-migraine! So far so good ..",
                    "I avoid drugs of all kinds and I'm a usually healthy person. After suffering years from horribly painful headaches that would leave me vomiting all day and totally out of it (I thought it was due to whiplash injury), my doctor prescribed Rizatriptan 10mg. It truly is a miracle drug for me. I use the melt-away tablets, and find the relief starts in about 15 minutes, and by 30 minutes, any headache is gone. I take them at the very beginning of symptoms. I do get sleepy, so I've learned that I can just take half a tablet, get the same result, and not feel so tired. I have had very slight jaw pain once or twice, and cutting back the dosage also alleviated that problem.",
                    "Since I was about 26 I have suffered from migraines (now 65) and tried everything from daily preventative meds, to expensive self injecting & very expensive medication, then cafegot suppositories with 3 aspro clear for the pain, I could spend hours and days feeling like dying and vomiting non stop, then there was a shortage of cafegot and that was hell, and finally they took it off the market, that is when my Dr. asked me to trial Maxalt wafers, at first I thought nothing could replace cafegot and I was very conscious of not taking ergotomine with rizatriptan. Maxalt is the best, it works within an hour, and so far after 4-5 years no side effects at all, and no more vomiting ever. Also I do not take any other drugs for anything, but Maxalt.",
                    "Maxalt is truly one of the most amazing migraine medications I have ever tried, and believe me, having migraines as a child and now at 52 years of age, there have been many. As a migrainer, we truly know what suffering is. Maxalt is the best, although, after losing my job 18 months ago and with no success of getting another, it is too expensive. From my understanding the patent expires in 2012. I truly hope the price goes down for those of us who cannot be without it.",
                    "43 yr old male.For me this is close to a miracle cure, it has given my life back. I have had stomach and esophagus lesions due to way too much aspirin/ ibuprofen/digesics/codeine trying to halt an attack. No more screaming in E.R rooms waiting for pethidine/morphine. No more thoughts off grabbing a drill to stop the throbbing pain. I actually have a life after 26 yrs of suffering 2-4 attacks a week each last up to 36 hrs each. Numerous preventive medicines didn%u2019t work. I am truly in debt to the manufacturers and the on call doctor who gave me to Maxalt. Takes about 40-90 minutes to work with a second dosage sometimes needed. My fear is the more i take it the less effective it will become as lately I need the second wafer.",

                    "Wonder drug. I tried many others. Maxalt MLT works so quick and free of all the usual side effects. I can use Maxalt MLT and within 30-60 minutes return to normal activities free of the normal after migraine haziness. It has given me my life back. Many thanks to Dr. Z. for prescribing this.",
                    "This medication is labeled a wonder drug in my household. It is the last line of defense and treatment for migraine. However and very sadly I might add recently the copay my insurance company imposed is going to make it hard to take. Limited to 4 tablets per week (while they state all medicines are calculated at a monthly dose level) NOW a copay of $60 per script makes it $240 for each myself and my wife. We just can't afford this after paying $2400.00 monthly for the insurance coverage. We are being choked to death! If the medicine was covered properly under the contract we could handle the $60 copay per month but because they limit the medication to 3-4 tablets per week. ",
                    "I took it for the first time today. My migraine was gone within an hour; however, it made me really sleepy. Three hours later, I'm still very groggy. Next time, I think I'll stay home from work and sleep it off. But missing work is what I'm trying to avoid. I'm incredibly thrilled that my migraine is gone, though.",
                    "I have suffered from hormonal migraines since puberty and am now in my fifties. I tried every option the Doctor could offer but nothing helped until I found Maxalt Melt about ten years ago. I call them my magic pill as they can clear a migraine completely within an hour. Very occasionally I have to take a second dose. They work for me with minimal side effects and are worth every penny. I'm in the UK so can get them on prescription.",
                    "I use this medication to help my migraines. I used to take Relpax. I quit taking it because it was too expensive and the side effects were strong. I like this medication because my insurance covers most of it and it is very effective with little side effects. The only cons are the taste (a little minty but the end has a bitter taste), I seem to get different side effects each time I take it (very mild, includes some drowsiness and nausea), also in my experience you need to take this medication as soon as you feel the migraine coming on or you may find yourself taking two or three pills during the migraine every two hours to keep it gone. Overall I find it very cost friendly and effective. I will continue using this medication.",
                    "My Migraine did Not go away . It might have only marginally lessened it . I went to bed for two hours and have felt terrible all day . This medication made me very sleepy . I took a Second Wafer some hours later but there was Still No Improvement ! Now I cannot take any other migraine medication for a whole 24 hours. Which is far too long . I made the mistake of taking the second wafer when the first one wasn't helping. I already had Jaw Pain so reading that others get it as a side effect makes me wonder.

                    "I've had ever-worsening migraines since I was in my 40's (I'm now 73). When they started, all that was available were drugs like Fiorinal and other mind-scrambling drugs. Finally, the triptans came along and saved my life. I started with Imitrex and tried the various other triptans, but Maxalt was the most effective. I would like to share one important observation: When I first started taking triptans, I had very few side effects, and was able to function at a high-level job, run home with kids, etc. HOWEVER, as I got older, I realized that side-effects emerged which have only gotten stronger over time. e.g. fogginess, sleepiness, nausea, etc. -- so be aware that side-effects can increase with age. Still, Maxalt is a life-saver.",

I am now 61 and still get them, sometimes every few months and sometimes I can go several years, but when they hit, the are debilitating and I never know how many days or weeks they will continue. My physician gave me a sample to try as I had been having these headaches almost everyday for 2 or more weeks. Within 30-45 minutes the pressure and pain were gone and my drooping, puffy eye looked normal again. I plan to ask my doctor if he can prescribe a larger quantity so I can take them during these lengthy episodes. I would love to be part of a study on the efficacy of this drug on cluster headache patients. Wish I had known about it sooner.",

I would recommend this product to everyone who mentions the word migraine.",

I admit I get extremely sleepy after I take it but a 1 hour nap and I'm back in business. Much better then four days of blinding pain that's for sure it is very expensive but I contacted my local clinic and they had me fill out some forms and received a free 6 month supply at which time I can reapply. You can also try contacting the company online they may help depending on your income.",

It will solve your migraine problems.",

They only allow 9 a month :-/ Way better than Imatrex!",

I take it as soon as I start to notice the signs of a migraine and about 70% of the time the first dose does the job, within an hour or less. Occasionally I take a second dose if the symptoms haven't gone after 2-3 hours. Very occasionally it doesn't work at all. It has improved my life enormously. I evangelize about it. My migraines used to last up to 3 days - now I get a unkillable one only once or twice a year. Side effects for me are (as someone else has mentioned) one sneeze within a few minutes of taking it, a little drowsiness and eventually a little euphoria (though maybe that's a rational response to knowing the migraine has gone).",

This medicine has been phenomenal in relieving really tough migraine pain. Within 30 minutes I can get relief. Also, I like that you can get it in sublingual form. Sometimes my migraines are so bad that I'm constantly throwing up everything. When I'm nauseous the sublingual form is wonderful, however, it also comes in a tiny tablet. I keep this with me at all times. It has saved me from multiple hospital visits in the past. Hope this helps!",

After trying almost everything, including OTC meds and other tryptans that didn't work, I am so glad my Dr gave me Maxalt .It works every time. Very rarely I need a second dose, but I know it will always work.This drug has saved me from calling in sick to work on many occasions, and I can even take it at work if I need it, as I don't experience any side effects from it. My only complaint is the expense. Even with insurance and using generic, my copay is still $31 for only 12 pills that are supposed to last me a month.If I refill the prescription before that month ,the copay goes up to $50. Sometimes I will get 3 or 4 migraines a week, so 12 pills is just not enough.This is a great drug though.",

I've tried two different kinds. They are not the same! The generic makes my headache get worse right after I take it, then about 1/2 hour later it might work. I'm usually asleep soon after that. I searched for the 'real' deal again and it is as I remembered. Started working RIGHT away with very little side effects. Maybe sore throat. Such a miracle for me. It is expensive at times depending on whim of insurance coverage, but I will pay to have pain go away!",

First of all, it dissolves under my tongue so I know that if I vomit, I won't throw it up. Secondly, and especially if I take it at the first sign of a migraine, it usually only takes about 30 minutes to kick in and fully eradicate my migraine. Imitrex and the others I've been on haven't worked or haven't worked as completely as Maxalt. I consider it a life saver.",

Within 1 hour the migraine was gone and within 2 hours I was back to normal and working. This is truly a miracle medicine for me. I also take 100 mg of Topamax daily so that has really cut down on the migraines but again the Maxalt was a lifesaver for me today. I am worried about my copay after reading some of the post on here but I do have to say that I think it will be worth it.",

These would last a whole 7 days with the first 24 hrs being hell! Its hard to explain to non-sufferers how painful these are. All of you will know what I am on about. Couldn't believe how amazing Maxalt was, didn't even reach the painful stage but it was totally gone. Works every time straight away for me. I take it along with codeine also prescribed. Tiny side effect, cramps in tummy but goes away within 30 mins. Worth it though!",

When I feel a migraine coming on I take one of the 10 mg dissolvable tablets and it soon disappears. Occasionally I do end up with a full-blown migraine (because I'm forgetful and don't always have Maxalt on me) and taking two doses helps it go away much more quickly than it would otherwise.

I didn't understand what I had, what set it off or why I had it. And the pain and all of the vomiting. EVERYTHING hurt. Any light, the slightest noise and any movement I made while in bed made the migraine worse and I'd start vomiting NON-STOP. The doctor prescribed Maxalt to me. I didn't even know they MADE medicines for migraines and I have to say I cannot be without it. But as the directions state, take AS SOON as you feel a migraine (not just a headache) coming on. Your body usually gives you signs, for me it's excessive yawning every few seconds and irritability.",

After an exceptionally bad reaction 3 years ago to Cafergot, I was prescribed Maxalt and it became my wonder medicine. I have not had a migraine now in nearly 18 months (something in my neck has moved to relieve the pressure) but I still take Maxalt when nothing else will get rid of a bad headache after all night pain last night, it was gone in 10 minutes when I finally took it this morning.

I don't like taking medications, I try to do things naturally, think this really really helped, and I have so much relief.

My unforeshadowed migraines feature very mild headaches; instead, I first lost my sense of balance, then my lunch, and then the desire to live for the next three hours. Although I was on a migraine-suppressing tricyclic and metroprolol, migraines would punch through two to eight times a month. Maxalt shutdown such migraines within 20 minutes-no side effects. (NOTE: Maxalt did not suppress the rare aura). After further adjustment of my daily medicines, my rescue medicine became Relpax  2 Aleve.",

I experienced numbness in my left hand and arm. My doctor told me to immediately stop using it. I'm a bit saddened that I can't continue on Maxalt as it did get rid of my migraine and definitely worked better than Imitrex, but not worth the risk of the side effect I experienced.",
                    "I had no luck with this medicine. I have tried a few different migraine medicines: Maxalt, Imitrex, Treximet, Fiortal, Indocin, Vicodin, and Percocet. I have suffered from migraines for 4 years, however I am able to recognize the signs before an attack. I attempted to take the Maxalt at the first sign of the migraine and nothing happened. On the other hand, I tried Treximet and had WONDERFUL results. Treximet is expensive, but if you have a healthcare plan that covers it, it works wonders (assuming you catch the migraine early). I am now on a daily dose of Topamax that has drastically cut the number of severe migraines per month .",

I sometimes go for long periods of time with no migraines, but then I can have migraine and accompanying neck pain that goes on for 2 days or more.  I've been on Fiorinal, then Fioricet, and just recently, Maxalt. Recently, I asked my Dr about having a different medication that would be legal to take to Europe, as Fioricet is banned in at least some, if not all, countries in Europe. Since another Dr had previously tried prescribing Maxalt, he had me try this. It WORKS. I find it works better and faster than other meds, and I don't feel woozy when taking it.

Migraines are very severe and symptoms include non stop vomiting, lack of balance, loss of sensation, sensitivity to light, sound, etc. Rizatriptan works for a migraine attack which is not so severe. It has to be taken immediately. I usually lie down quietly for 20 minutes after taking it and then it works. It does not completely get rid of the headache, but suppresses it. This allows you to get on with your day. It makes me very tired, and makes my body feel heavy. Reactions are sometimes slower, so don't drive. If it does not work within 20-30 minutes, then it won't.

The pill used to take 30 and often the headache had time to bloom and get bad by then. They didn't immediately get rid of the nausea I get, but it went away in about 20 min after it stopped the bloom. I rated these as a 9 because of the taste. They taste a bit like a peppermint candy that's gone bad, but it's bearable and only lasts for about 5 seconds. I usually wash the flavor away with coffee - I like to back up anything I take for a headache with a good dose of caffeine. These will be replacing my Maxalt pills even if they do taste awful.",
                    "Rizatriptan has enabled me to control my headaches and continue a near normal life.",
                    "I have suffered with migraine since I was 12 yr old, and I'm now in my 50's. I've had every head exam and test possible as well as tried a myriad of medications over the years for treatment. From taking preventive type things daily to treating the pain only during the headache. Nothing has given me the swift relief as this drug. It seems to give me complete relief within 30-40 minutes, without any side effects (that I've noticed). I took immitrex for years with little relief and horrible side effects. It would make me feel dizzy, weird and always made me nauseous. So I stopped taking it. Now with the Maxalt, I'm thrilled to know I can take it without worry of unwanted side effect. Thank you Maxalt! Finally migraine relief! ",
                    "Migraines since I was 15, now in my 40's. Identified as menstrual migraines in my early 30's after 1st child, up to 5 days of migraines every 26 days. Nothing worked before, but started taking rizatriptan 9 months ago. It works every time, no side effects. I have my life back. Amazing. Recommend making a mentrual and migraine diary before going to the doctor.",
                    "Maxalt has less side effects, for me, than other Migraine Medication. Previously I have been on the Maxalt 5 but needed to go up to the Maxalt 10 which helps relieve the pain more completely. I tried many other medicines, and this has been the best for me, I believe it is different for every person. My nausea does increase on this medication, but no chest heaviness as with other medicines.",
                    "For me Maxalt is a miracle drug. I have tried almost everything OTC, and nothing worked. Excedrin worked for awhile, then after a few weeks, it stopped working. I can always count on Maxalt to get rid of my migraines. I usually feel relief within an hour of taking it. That being said ,this drug is very expensive. Even with insurance and taking the generic version, I am still out of pocket about $50 a box, and they only give you 12 pills. Sometimes I have 3 or 4 migraines in a week, so this can get really expensive. It works wonders for me though, so unfortunately it's a necessary expense.",
                    "Didn't work for me. I had serious allergic reaction. My tongue swelled up, my cheeks were going numb and had to take Benadryl within 30 minutes of taking this medicine.",
                    "I took it when I was felt a migraine coming on and I experienced dizziness, memory loss, shakiness and a fever. I had used it before with no problems.",
                    "Good relief without being too wiped out",
                    "I have suffered from migraines since I was 15 , and am now 42. Maxalt has changed my life ! I used to be in agony for up to 3 days , but now at the first sign of an attack I take one , very rarely I have had to take another one a few hours after that if it started to come back . It can sometimes make me drowsy, but other times I have no side effects , just relief that there is something that actually works . I'm in Australia, so a pack of 4 costs me $25 .",
                    "Maxalt saved my life! It is the only medicine that works for me when have a migraine attack, I swear by it and carry it with me always just in case. It literally gave me back my life, I was ill for days that ran into weeks that went into months. It was shocking, I felt suicidal with having no life and one day was sitting in my doctors room sobbing begging him to help me, and he prescribed me rizatriptan (maxalt). I love it!!",
                    "Usually the migraine wakes me up at night with the pain beginning at the base of my head. I keep the rizatriptan on my bedside table and I take it immediately. When I wake in the morning the pain is gone. Before I would wake with the pain, and it would linger for days with hardly no relief. I works great for me.",
                    "I have had no side effects to date, and the medicine quickly relieves symptoms. Best medication I have taken for treatment of migraines.",
                    "It works rather well but puts me to sleep for about 3 hours. I am still trying to find a migraine drug that does not put me to sleep. ",
                    "I have had migraines for over 30 years. Have tried everything. This works the best almost every time. I'd say 9 out of 10 times it cures the migraine and is a winner in my book.",
                    "I take Maxalt 10mg ODT when my Imitrex fails. Maxalt rarely fails and is actually my back up plan but has lately been my go to since Imitrex has stopped working completely. Maxalt is great! It works within an hour of taking it and I have little to no side effects. I give it a 9 because it does make me shake and if I take two, it will make me feel washed out the next day. Of course, all of this is an even trade for killing a migraine. Overall, great and effective drug!",
                    "Maxalt has really changed how I felt about my migraines. Before I was prescribed Maxalt, I would suffer terribly, taking only OTC medications which \"never\" helped much. Now when I feel those tell-tale signs of a migraine coming on (I do not experience any \"aura\"), I take a Maxalt (and sometimes some ibuprofen, too) and I know my migraine will be gone within the hour! And I'm not sleepy.",
                    "Maxalt is great. Once I can tell my headache is starting I take the pill. Usually in less than 30-60 minutes I forget that my head was hurting and I am able to work for 8-12 hours, smometimes longer. I agree with another comment: it gives no side effects like a rapid heart rate or chest pain. After having surgery I got spinal meningitis which started my migranes when I was 34 years old. Now at 48 I am thankful for Maxalt.",
                    "When I took a 10 mg dose it made me nauseous and super high, and now three days later I am still nauseaous and have had to call out of work because ive been feeling like im going to vomit if i stand up. I look to try and function as normal when i take abortive migraine medication, this one has made me feel worse. At least I can actually go to work when I have just a migraine.",
                    "I have had migraines since I was 9 so for 22 years now. I tried Imitrex nasals with no results. My hero of a doctor prescribed Maxalt 8 years ago and I can manage my life now. I don't have any side effects from it although it wouldn't matter since I now get relief! I have found migraine medicines are hit or miss for many so I'm beyond pleased I found a hit. I recommend Maxalt to anyone that will listen.",
                    "I am 34 years old and have suffered migraines on and off since I was about 10 years old. This is the first medication that has helped me. It great that it is a wafer and easy to take as vomiting is perhaps what stops other medications from working? Thank you maxalt, I love you!",
                    "When I was about 23, I started getting horrific migraines out of nowhere that would incapacitate me for days at a time. My neurologist couldn't find anything wrong and I tried several medications (some would take at least 12 hours to have an effect). The only medication that ever successfully treated my migraines was Maxalt and it pretty much gave me my life back. It would still take at least an hour to work but it was really a life changer. Ultimately, I sought an ENT and after I had sinus surgery (and corrected my deviated septum) in 2011, my migraines never returned. But if they ever did come back, I would be running to Maxalt as my savior again!",
                    "43 yo female migraines since 2nd grade. Some are with aura most are without. I get pain in my Left scapula that eventually radiates into the base of my skull through to my Left eye. If taken right away, I get almost total relief in 20-40 minutes. If I wait longer, it may take over an hour to work. Works over 90 percent of the time averaging 12 headaches per month. Side effects for me are a tightening sensation in my neck (where the arteries are on either side) then a \"floaty\" sensation. The pain goes away and I'm left tired, yawning frequently and a little fuzzy minded, but able to function much better than with the migraine. I've tried imitrex, zomig, midrin, and rx pain relievers. Maxalt has worked by far the best for me.",
                    "I went to see a headache specialist yesterday, and she recommended I take this for my migraines, which occur about 2-3 times a month. Of course, I woke up this morning with one. The tabs taste pretty bitter but when your head hurts, you don't really care. Just wash it down with water once it's done dissolving. Within half an hour it had subsided. As somebody who is used to suffering through them for 2 days, this is truly amazing.",
                    "Just took some for the first time 10 minutes ago and my migraine is ALREADY subsiding. Helps a lot more to put it under your tongue so it'll go into your blood stream quicker. ",
                    "Maxalt has saved me from migraines. It tends to make me a little drowsy, but that is a plus for me. I just lay down to take a nap, and when I wake up, the migraine is gone. This is also a plus at night as I could not sleep with migraines. The pounding and the pain would keep me up all night. Highly recommend this to anyone suffering from migraines. The drowsiness is not so bad that if I needed to stay awake I would be unable to.",
                    "Usually works well for me and don't make me drowsy.",
                    "I have had migraines since I was 11. When people say they are not hereditary...they are wrong. My grandma, mom, sisters and brothers all have them they did not even skip a generation.. my daughter and nieces as well get them. My physician calls mine sinus migraines. I get stomach pain, vomiting, an aura, light sensitivity. They had me on demerol, Percocet, phenergan, imitrex, nothing helped. I have been on maxalt a few years and the one thing I have noticed is that i get pain around the upper jaw area just under the ear...then all of a sudden like the snap of a finger all pain is gone 15 to 25 min. It makes me drowsey. I wake up from my nap feeling great but real thirsty.",
                    "Yesterday was my first time when I took Maxalt-MLT to cure my migraine. My doctor prescribed this drug six months ago but all those months I had no incidence of a migraine. Yesterday was again after my weight lifting workout. I only get migraines after a workout the last years. I always get aura for about 20 minutes before a headache begin. That is good the doctor said because I can take Maxalt faster before the pain begins. My first impression is that the aura lasted about 15 minutes and the pain was bearable in a scale of ten I would say 6.5 compared to other times that reaches 9 -10. The first 10 minutes, I was feeling a little bit weird and little dizzy. After 90 minutes the migraine got away, I think it needs about 90 minutes to act",
                    "I have suffered with severe menstrual migraines for 25+ years to the point where I fantasize about amputating my head. I was on Imitrex (made me very sleepy), Relpax (worthless) , generic (even worse). Maxalt is my go to medicine. Unfortunately its a fight with the insurance company to get regular refills. They are trying to force me to take a generic. I used to get 12 tablets and they changed it to 9- which 9 is not enough. When I run out I cannot help but pray for the day I get a refill fearing I will get a migraine before that time. When the refill day comes, I stalk my pharmacy on the phone until it is ready. Ugh...talk about \"drug-seeking\" !",
                    "This Migraine Med is a must have if you expereince regular Migraines..no side effects!",
                    "I find Maxalt Wafers amazing. I get a little tightness in my throat but apart from that no side effects and they work within I/2 an hour. In fact it feels like a huge weight has been lifted off me. They are expensive but worth it.",
                    "Tried Imitrex and Relpax first, but had bad heart-squeezing and neck-squeezing side effects. Tried Maxalt and did not have that problem. It usually takes away the migraines, but can take 1-2 hours to get relief. I'm also very fatigued after the pain goes away, which makes daytime onset of migraines a hassle. Also for the 1-2 hours I am waiting for it to work, the pain actually intensifies until suddenly it lets go and the blood vessels in my head feel cold. Strange, but true.",
                    "Within half an hour, the headache has totally subsided. sometimes need a second dose. It does cause my skin to feel sensitive to heat and my throat feels tight for about 2 hours but the headache and all symptoms are totally gone. Brilliant",
                    "Today was my first time taking Rizatriptan and the fact that I am able to write this review just hours after the onset of a migraine is amazing because normally I would be completely down for the count for at least a whole day with a migraine. So here is my experience: I have taken countless meds before including Imitrex with terrible side effects and zero relief so naturally I was skeptical about this new med. I took it as soon as I knew that this was going to be a particularly bad migraine. The only side effect I had was sleepiness, no \"heart attack\" feeling as I had experienced with Imitrex. I fell asleep within 15 min of taking Rizatriptan and woke up 2 hours later completely migraine free.",
                    "This pill is like a magic. I just noticed that the pill works in minutes for me and I feel a bit dizziness and like a burning head and then the pain is gone. Today I got a early migraine and I was able to use the MLT and work kind of slowly but it stopped the pain in time. But I still feel very sensitive to light. Great medication ask your doctor for Maxalt or Maxalt-MLT.",
                    "As you may know, migraines are extremely debilitating even when trying to perform most menial tasks let alone professional responsibilities. I tried Maxalt for the first time today approximately 20 minutes after my first aura and it actually works. I am happily surprised! I have yet to experience any side effects. However, lets be honest, I'd be tolerant of almost anything besides a migraine - which feels like a freight train chugging through my head.",
                    "Must take within 20 minutes of onset. The longer you wait, the longer it takes to work. Keep it in your pocket/wallet at all times. For me, it is a lifesaver.",
                    "My experience was mixed. I took Maxalt MLT as soon as I had my usual \"Aura\". It worked within 30 minutes. The aura was gone and I never did get a migraine. However, within an hour I had a severe angina attack and had to take my nitro twice to relieve the pain. Nitro glycerin gives you a headache, so I think I'd rather have the migraine than the chest pain! My daughter took it and had a wonderful experience, took the pain away within 30 minutes and no side effects at all. I guess I won't be taking it again. Too bad, it worked on the migraine.",
                    "Maxalt has helped me so much. My migraines get so intense and the minute I take Maxalt I start to feel relief.",
                    "Maxalt is a very good migraine medicine for me. No side effects but only a little tired but that's good.",
                    "1 Maxalt malt usually starts working in 30 to 45 minutes for me. Within an hour I'm able to continue my day. I have very frequent migraines and have used Maxalt for many years. No real side effects except a bit of drowsiness. And it is very expensive. Insurance does not cover the whole cost.",
                    "I suffer with cluster headaches. Extreme pain of the highest order. I found Rizatriptan melt in the mouth tablets to be superb.",
                    "This medication worked well to keep my cluster headache pain to a minimum. I found it did not work well when the cluster lasted longer than 2 weeks.",
                    "I've always had 3 day migraines. MaxAlt will take it away in about 35 minutes. Sometimes I would have to take another one (dissolved in my mouth) the next day. I cannot stress enough how much I love this medicine. I come from days when Darvon's were given for migraines, they didn't do anything but zombie you with the pain. I thank the scientist who figured out how to control whatever it is that is being controlled. Of course, it IS too expensive. Without insurance, I would have to suffer, as they are about $32 per pill!",
                    "I've had chronic migraines for around 12 years. I take 5mg and it usually takes care of my headache. It makes my neck ache a little but the relief from the horrible symptoms of a migraine are well worth it. I've tried other triptans but this one works best. The generic is very inexpensive.",
                    "I have just started experiencing migraines and thought my life was over at first. Nothing was working and I couldn't be a wife to my husband or mom to my five year old daughter. Since starting this miracle drug as we call it, I am myself again. The only side effect I am experiencing is having to pee a lot. I don't know if I am alone in that matter, but I would gladly substitute spending sometime in the potty then spending a whole day in the ER or in the bedroom in the dark.",
                    "The Maxalt-MLT self-dissolving tab worked wonders for me. At a time when my doctor was trying to determine the most-effective treatment form my migraine headaches, this medicine was a God-send. My doc gave me samples of various triptan meds and I was to try one out at the onset of every migraine. Of the 5-6 different samples I was given, Maxalt-MLT worked the fastest & had the least amount of side-effects. I was amazed. Unfortunately, my insurance would not cover it and I had to settle with sumatriptan. Sumatriptan worked, but it took about an hour and I just remember feeling really weird after taking it. Anyway, if/when my migraines start again- Maxalt is what I want.",
                    "Have just been prescribed Maxalt Melt after a lifetime of pain and feel I have discovered gold! My only disappointment is having only three pills when I need a truckload!",

                    "I have suffered from migraines since I was a kid. I'm 49 now. In my mid 30s I started taking imitrex and it completely derailed me. I then started trying a bunch of preventative drugs, beta blocker, calcium blockers and ssri drugs. Finally found one that works fairly well, but along with that I use maxalt as a rescue drug which I still take 6+ times a month. It's a good drug and is effective. I have always noticed the migraines redoubles its efforts before leaving after I take it. I also notice it makes me very sleepy and foggy. I don't like to take it at work because of that. 9 times out of 10 it works, but there are still times it does nothing for me. Some is better than none in my world though. I take a generic due to cost.",
                    "I have suffered from migraines Since An Auto accident in 2009, sometime as many as 15 a month. I was prescribed Maxalt this past year (after trying a whole bag of other medicines). It has given me my life back... within thirty minutes after taking Maxalt the symptoms decrease by 50% and are gone within an hour. Several side effects, very drowsy and increased nausea but after several hours of sleep all is good.",
                    "I have tried OTC migraine medicines, and three other prescriptions. Maxalt is by far the best, and MLT makes it nearly perfect. The only bad side effect I have is that the back of my neck gets sore. Maxalt does this far less than Zomig, and taking Advil Liquigels or Vicodin with the Maxalt MLT helps quite a bit. My ideal treatment for a migraine is to take Maxalt MLT and Advil Liquigels, then lay down with something cold on my forehead. Once I am able to doze, I sleep until I wake up on my own. I can't believe how much better I feel after the nap. At work, I just take the two medicines. It takes me longer to feel better, but makes my headache much more bearable.",

                    "99% of the time my migraine symptoms fade within an hour. I have had to take a second tablet only twice in ten years. I can function as normal. The only drawback is feeling tired and increased urination, but compared to going through a 36 hour migraine, that's nothing!",
                    "I would definitely try this for migraines if you haven't already. I had used Imitrex pills for a few years and suddenly they stopped working. I tried a couple different pills and then found Maxalt. The only problem with the pills is that I have to take them right away. Once the migraine has started they don't take away all the pain, only like 60% for me. I was on Maxalt for a few years, then put on Cymblata and didn't have migraines for 2 years on that, but then they came back and Maxalt didn't help me... Now I use Imitrex Statdose because I never catch my migraine until it's terrible but the injections get rid of the pain fast!",
                    "Miracle drug for me! Migraine gone within the hour of taking Maxalt. It made me groggy but I will take that over hours of pain",

I take one as soon as I get the slightest beginning of a migraine and it is gone in 20 minutes! Not only that, but I've been taking it for 3 years now and I used to get 2 or 3 migraines a month, and now I only get about 1 every 2 months! Maxalt has been like a miracle for me...I no longer have to suffer with horrible headaches!! Additionally, I have not experienced any side effects!",
                    "One Maxalt-MLT usually gets rid of the migraine in an hour or less. Occasionally, I need another one 2 hours later to really get rid of it for good. Rarely, even the second one did not quite do it for me. But this is still the most effective medicine that's worked for me, after trying 8-10 other medicines (over-the-counter and prescription).",
                    "This is a miracle drug! I've tried all sorts of medicines over the past 30 some years and this drug is the only one that has ever stopped my migraines.

                    "I am a 35yo female and had my first migraine at 16yo just after giving birth to my firstborn. Over the years, particularly after each baby, the symptoms have become worse and are always experienced during menstruation. Recently codeine products that would normally help are not even touching the sides of the pain, and I have been experiencing increasing levels of sickness that anti-nausea tablets don't have any impact on. But yesterday a friend gave me a maxalt wafer because I couldn't function under the intensity of the sickness and pain. At first it didn't seem to do anything. But after maybe an hour to 90 minutes and I was no longer sick, nor was I in pain!! It was like a miracle!! How ever vision was slightly more blurred than usual.",

                    "This is the best sos pill for migraines, I barely have side-effects from it and if I melt it in my mouth it acts much faster killing my migraine in less than 20 minutes. I cannot imagine my life without Rizatriptan !! It gave me my life back!",
                    "I've been using maxalt for about 6 years (give or take) and it's about the only medication I've found that really gets rid of my migraines. The MLT version is great when your stomach's so upset you can't keep down a pill, too. The only side effect I've ever had is a tingling feeling in my shoulders. Well worth the co-pay!",
                    "I started taking Maxalt after horrible experiences with Imitrex. I had almost all the same side effects: extreme nausea, dizziness, falling asleep, and a general out of it feeling the rest of the day. But the worst part is that it did absolutely nothing for my migraine. I am just glad that I had samples so I didn't get stuck paying for a prescription I would not use. ",

Then at about 38 I started getting these horrible severely debilitating headaches 1-3 times a year and the headaches would last up to weeks with intermittent increase in severity. I was finally diagnosed with cluster headaches and prescribed Rizatriptan. If I feel the onset it diminishes the intensity and duration. I have been using it for 2 years and very grateful.",
                    "My first time taking it. I have complex partial seizures and my aura has changed to where I now have migraine headaches afterwards. We are doing test to rule out other problems but this medicine helped me more than anything so far. Still have that groggy feeling afterwards but I can deal with that. Just do not know how I can take it should I have to at work since I work in a call center 10 hours a day with constant calls.",
                    "I have used maxalt four times in the last three months. The first time it worked fine and it was gone in a few hours but had heart racing.  The second migraine I was concerned about the side effects but gave a second chance. I had severe throbbing in my head like it was going to explode and then suddenly the migraine broke.  My third attempt my migraine was so severe that I had to take a second dose for relief! I find that if I take it on the onset it works but still light headache and felt numbing sensation.  My fourth today no relief after 2nd dose. Took 3rd after 4 hours but still feeling migraine. Had slight heart racing and throbbing pain. I may continue to see if this is right meds. If not, then I think there's no hope for me!",

I've tried Zomig, Imitrex, and many others - but Maxalt gets it gone in 15-30 minutes and I'm back, up and ready to get back into life. I can even take one at work and just rest my eyes at my desk until it kicks in. Never could do that before.",
                    "This medicine is a miracle drug. I have migraines that last for 3 days and until my doctor prescribed maxalt I could not get rid of them or function properly. Now I take a pill and within 30 min it is gone. My life is so much nicer I am up moving around exercising and actually living my life like a normal person.",
                    "I call this my \"miracle drug\". I had been suffering from constant migraines since I was 9 years old. I am now 64. They used to tell my parents I was \"high-strung\" and had \"tension headaches\". I was never diagnosed with migraine until I was about 48 years old. This is the ONLY drug that has ever stopped my migraine (of course...you have to take it immediately at the onset, as with all migraine meds). I had lost so many days of my life to the extreme pain/nausea and impaired vision/speech/general functionality before I discovered rizatriptan. Quite literally, I thank God for leading someone to develop this and for someone prescribing it for me.",
                    "I am a 42 yr old male and I have been susceptible to migraines since I was very little. My worst childhood memories are of me moaning and rocking back and forth in agony on my bed when suffering from my very first migraines as an 8 or 9 yr old child. I too have not had any luck with Imitrex and some of the other medicines mentioned in this post. My insurance gives me terrible problems when I am trying to get a migraine prescription filled. As it is right now I have figured out that Axert and Maxalt are the only two medicines that I know will work for certain when I am afflicted and totally incapacitated by migraine headaches. The problem with Axert is that my insurance will only allow a monthly script of 6 tablets at $10/tablet. Maxalt does it for less dollars.",
                    "Migraine, the word can't convey the impact on life. For me, a typical one lasted about 36 hours, followed by another 24 hours of \"hangover\". Somewhere during the 36 hour duration, would be 12 hours of hell. I've used Maxalt MLT about 10-12 times over the last 6 months. It has worked every time; I take one when I sense a migraine is starting, and it just doesn't \"blossom\". I have no side effects, no nausea, and no drowsiness. Sometime in the next 20-30 minutes I'll realize the apprehension, tension and other precursors to the migraine have just disappeared. Migraines took too much of my life, and at their worst, pushed depression to the edge of suicide; it's good to have a normal life back.",
                    "Maxalt is the only migraine medicine I have tried, and it works well for me. When I take it early (before it becomes a full-bloomed migraine), it works within maybe 30 minutes, completely getting rid of the pain. I do have some side effects: most of the time, I feel a tightening of the throat for about 15 minutes after taking it (my doctor had warned me about that), and if I happen to be a bit tired when taking it, I feel a bit dizzy for a couple of hours. But it sure beats a 24-hour migraine.",
                    "I have tried different medicines for migraines, all just calmed it down a little, it just had to run its 3 day duration. Am seeing another Dr & she put me on Maxalt yesterday, my migraine was gone within an hour of taking it. I just want to go back and hug her because after 5 yrs of trying I just accepted my pain. It made me drowsy, but I will take drowsy over pain any day.",
                    "Amazing! I took Imitrex for years and it didn't really help. Maxalt is the only medication that works for me to continue my busy life. I have had hormonal migraines since I was 12. Tried everything from pain medicines (temporary fix) to nasal to shots. I love Maxalt!",
                    "I had my doubts that this would work -- it was fantastic! within 15-20 minutes the pain that felt like my skull was in a vise disappeared. I am a horse trainer and I work full time on my own farm, and I can't function when I have a migraine, ( 4-5 attacks a month, 24-48 hours each time) Maxalt 10-mg was a miracle for me. I don't have to put all the work on my daughter, and my temper has become much more even. The anxiety of worrying about a migraine attack has helped enormously, for my emotional state, too. **side note** I had a Mirena IUD and had it removed, I believe this contributed to the attacks, so hopefully in 4-6 weeks I won't need the Maxalt, either.",
                    "This works wonders for me, but makes me a little nutty for awhile. Better than migraines by a long shot. They try and make it taste minty, but still a little foul tasting.",
                    "Works within minutes usually. Have not noted any side effects with it although I do not care for taste. After it melts and is gone, I drink water to get taste out of my mouth.",
                    "Maxalt relieves my migraine in 1 hour however it does make me sleepy. I love the fast dissolve feature. I will have to stop using it however due to the rising cost not covered by my insurance company. I am now hoping Imitrex will work as well.",
                    "I have used this medication for over 3 years now. Just recently I was told to take 2 instead of one since my migraines seem to be getting worse each time (I blame it on MS). Nothing else works for me. I can deal with the kids bickering. I carry this drug with me always! ",
                    "This medication always takes my migraine away. It is the only medicine that has done that for me. Sometimes I do get rebound headaches from the medicine, but I am pleased that I have finally found something to take the migraine away. I just wish I could find something to alleviate my migraines altogether because I get them way too often."

                    "//What is it?//Headache and migraine are different entities. Migraine is one of the most common and well characterized, but there are 14 broad categories that can be subdivided into more than 200 different forms. Migraine itself has about 20 different genres. In general, headaches are divided into two large groups: primary and secondary. Primary illnesses correspond to a disease, not reflecting other health problems and represent around 90% of the total. Secondary symptoms are symptoms of diseases of the nervous system or other organs of the human body. They can occur in cases of flu, alcohol poisoning or withdrawal, minor head trauma, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels) or a high blood pressure crisis. Migraine is a primary headache in which very intense episodes of pain occur interspersed with periods without symptoms. In general, it begins between the ages of 15 and 40, but it can appear in childhood or shortly after the first menstruation. If it appears for the first time after the age of 45, other causes must be excluded. Some of its characteristics are closely associated with the female reproductive cycle: higher prevalence after the first menstruation or during the menstrual period; occasional worsening due to taking birth control pills or hormone therapy; attenuation or disappearance during pregnancy or menopause. Before adolescence, migraines affect boys and girls equally. From then on, it is two to three times more common in females. It is estimated that 8% to 15% of individuals living in Western countries (including Portugal) suffer from this problem. The fact of reaching people in the productive phase implies large economic, social and family costs.//Symptoms//It appears recurrently, several times throughout life, but always with completely free intervals. If it occurs every day, it is probably overuse of painkillers or other medications. Drug abuse can convert a migraine into a chronic daily headache. There are people who preferably appear on the weekend. These crises can be precipitated by changes in sleep schedule, failure to eat breakfast, reduced stress or alcohol abuse. In these cases, it is important to consider a lifestyle change over the weekend. The symptoms are intense and often prevent work or study. The pain tends to be throbbing, worsening with physical exertion or head movements. In general, it affects only one side of the head, and is accompanied by nausea, vomiting, intolerance to light, noise and some smells. It is not mandatory that all of these elements are present simultaneously. And they can occur twice a week or just a few throughout a lifetime. During attacks, people seek a dark, quiet place to rest or fall asleep. An episode can last from a few hours to three days. Between attacks, there are usually no complaints. Some types of migraines may have more complex symptoms (with aura). These forms are less common, affecting around 15% of people with this problem, and include transient neurological symptoms, originating attributable to certain areas of the brain. The other signs are identical to those of migraine without aura. The most common auras are temporary vision disorders, in the form of loss of vision on one side of the visual field, blurred images, perception of bright points, geometric figures or bright zigzags. Other auras can be translated as tingling or numbness on one side of the face or one of the hands. There are people who have difficulty speaking or even temporary paralysis of their limbs, usually only on one side of the body. These changes last about 10 to 30 minutes and precede the pain. In children, migraines tend to be bilateral, less intense and of shorter duration. Vomiting and dark circles can be exuberant. Disturbances in sleep and meal schedules are common precipitating factors. Treating these crises is easier than in adults. Sleep usually gives good results. At these ages, the occipital location is not normal and, when present, requires a medical consultation. Likewise, the presence of headaches with morning vomiting or other unusual symptoms in very young children should be seen by a healthcare professional.//Causes//It is caused by a combination of brain processes: excitation/depression of cells, dilation of arteries and release of chemicals. People with migraine are more sensitive to certain stimuli, environmental or from their own body, that can trigger these brain processes. It is also thought that there is some genetic susceptibility. Some individuals can identify the signs of their attacks. The most common are cheese, chocolate, strawberries, seafood, wine, artificial sauces, changes in sleep patterns, stress, menstruation, fasting, physical exercise, and minor trauma. Others cannot identify them at all. People who drink coffee regularly may experience headaches when they stop this habit.//Diagnosis//The key to diagnosis lies in the clinical history, physical and neurological examination. Observation of the fundus is a very important part of these procedures. In some cases, it may be necessary to resort to computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to exclude other diseases.//Treatment//Migraines have no cure but can be controlled. There are medications and behaviors that can reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks. Symptomatic treatment, during acute periods, involves resting in a quiet, dark place. Pressure or cold can be applied to the area of \u200b\u200bpain. At this stage, analgesics, anti-inflammatories, antiemetics and triptans are very useful.//Prevention//People with migraines should create calendars that allow them to identify their symptoms and assess their impact on their quality of life. The first step in prevention is to identify and eliminate precipitating factors, whenever possible. In some cases, it is necessary to use daily medication to reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks, but there are no drugs specifically developed for their prevention. However, there are some drugs used in other contexts that have proven to be effective, such as beta-blockers, antidepressants or antiepileptics, and these should always be prescribed by a doctor.

                    "At 59 years of age have been suffering migraines since I was 21. Think I have tried every medication available in the UK. Maxalt is the only thing that has ever worked for me.Pain usually gone after 20 minutes, before I took Maxalt I could be in bed for 2 days rolling around in agony. Only side effects are tiredness and strangely It makes me sneeze just once as soon as I have taken it. Maxalt has completely changed my life. Fortunate to live in UK as I get it free on national health prescription.",
                    "I have had migraines since I was 12 yrs. Old, I am 67. As a child I just suffered all the time. When I was in my late 20's, fiorinal was the answer. It did help. There have been a couple of others (can't remember the name). Then imitrex came out. Didn't work. I did not find relief, even with addition of percocet until maxalt came out. Thank heavens. Mostly 20 days per month. I learned very quickly first sign for me is a slice of pain, then I immediately take the maxalt. Within a half hour, 99% gone. I have been so fortunate to have medicine coverage through private employer insurance with reasonable copay, otherwise it would affect my ability to support myself. I take over 12 meds per day..No interactions",
                    "Works within 2 hours but my migraine always returns the next day. I take the medication the next day - headache goes away within two hours - comes back the next day again. Medication works but I feel extremely tired and depressed for the three days. Insurance companies also limit me to 9 pills a month which adds to my stress.",
                    "This medication worked great for me to get rid of my headache. When I take it before I feel a bad migraine coming on, it alleviates it before it gets bad. My only complaint about this medication is I get really bad heart burn and I really do not sleep that well while I am on it. I guess you can%u2019t have everything.",
                    "I occasionally get migraine when I have been in stressful situations. It appears that my migraine are related to a deficit of serotonin. I also get migraines in stores that sell lots of cheap plastic items. This medication is 100% effective for me.",
                    "Puts me in nice restful deep sleep (normal 7hr night), walk up in morning migraine gone, with no hangover feeling that you would normally get if went to ER for a shot.",
                    "To me, this is the ONE medicine I can not live without. I have had to try others due to insurance, and none comes even close! Within 15-30 even the strongest, wanting to smash my head-in migraine will be totally gone! No side effects for me either. Never makes me tired, groggy or the medicated feeling. Taken on empty stomach while in college class and had no problems finishing the class and going home to play with the kids and not the mom who was hiding in a dark room with no noise allowed in the house.",
                    "Maxalt has worked wonders for me. When I have migraines I never feel like swallowing tablets, so the fact that I have the dissolving tablet is an absolute bonus. Before this medicine I was bedridden for days at a time, and after a migraine, my head always felt so heavy and like a bowling ball. Now however I am able to go to work the next day. I recommend it to every person I meet!",
                    "My daily headaches started after a ventricular assist device (VAD). Maxalt has worked beautifully in killing the pain. Occasionally I will wake up with a headache the following day, but not severe enough to warrant another dose. I am careful to avoid triggers so don't have to take this very often. I am grateful that I have this option since I am allergic to NSAIDs.",
                    "Very effective with no side effects (i.e. drowsiness). I've had mixed luck with other migraine medicines, but find Maxalt MLT to be consistently helpful.",
                    "I have suffered from migraines for at least 15 years and tried so many medications and therapies to help. Maxalt is the only thing that helps me. I have missed a day to three of work in a row from migraines and now do not have to miss any. It takes the pain away within an hour. I don't get any effects from the drug really, maybe a bit tired once and awhile. My only complaint is the wafer tastes pretty gnarly but it is worth it!",
                    "If taken at the start of a migraine this medicine works wonders . There are side effects such as dry mouth, tiredness, and joint aches. But as anyone who has migraines know that is a small price to pay for relief from the migraine itself.",
                    "I've suffered from Pure Menstrual Migraine for 4 years. Nothing I have tried to date has helped ease any of the migraine pain at all, which usually goes on for 3 days solid every month, le. Until now. I asked my dr if I could try Rizatriptan and he agreed. My warning sign that a migraine is on it's way is an ache down the left hand side of my face. Well, within the last hour I got that warning so took my first ever Rizatriptan dissove in the mouth tablet. Revolting! Utterly vile - like a really bad mint that went off years ago. However, rather than spit it out (since they are very expensive) I let it dissolve. Now 40 mins later I have no ache and no pain, and I hope that means that I will not get a mega-migraine! So far so good ..",
                    "I avoid drugs of all kinds and I'm a usually healthy person. After suffering years from horribly painful headaches that would leave me vomiting all day and totally out of it (I thought it was due to whiplash injury), my doctor prescribed Rizatriptan 10mg. It truly is a miracle drug for me. I use the melt-away tablets, and find the relief starts in about 15 minutes, and by 30 minutes, any headache is gone. I take them at the very beginning of symptoms. I do get sleepy, so I've learned that I can just take half a tablet, get the same result, and not feel so tired. I have had very slight jaw pain once or twice, and cutting back the dosage also alleviated that problem.",
                    "Since I was about 26 I have suffered from migraines (now 65) and tried everything from daily preventative meds, to expensive self injecting & very expensive medication, then cafegot suppositories with 3 aspro clear for the pain, I could spend hours and days feeling like dying and vomiting non stop, then there was a shortage of cafegot and that was hell, and finally they took it off the market, that is when my Dr. asked me to trial Maxalt wafers, at first I thought nothing could replace cafegot and I was very conscious of not taking ergotomine with rizatriptan. Maxalt is the best, it works within an hour, and so far after 4-5 years no side effects at all, and no more vomiting ever. Also I do not take any other drugs for anything, but Maxalt.",
                    "Maxalt is truly one of the most amazing migraine medications I have ever tried, and believe me, having migraines as a child and now at 52 years of age, there have been many. As a migrainer, we truly know what suffering is. Maxalt is the best, although, after losing my job 18 months ago and with no success of getting another, it is too expensive. From my understanding the patent expires in 2012. I truly hope the price goes down for those of us who cannot be without it.",
                    "43 yr old male.For me this is close to a miracle cure, it has given my life back. I have had stomach and esophagus lesions due to way too much aspirin/ ibuprofen/digesics/codeine trying to halt an attack. No more screaming in E.R rooms waiting for pethidine/morphine. No more thoughts off grabbing a drill to stop the throbbing pain. I actually have a life after 26 yrs of suffering 2-4 attacks a week each last up to 36 hrs each. Numerous preventive medicines didn%u2019t work. I am truly in debt to the manufacturers and the on call doctor who gave me to Maxalt. Takes about 40-90 minutes to work with a second dosage sometimes needed. My fear is the more i take it the less effective it will become as lately I need the second wafer.",
                    "Bad headaches. This medicine works like it says it should.",
                    "I am very greatful for Maxalt wafers as they help me get rid of my migraines, although the side effects of insane burning and jaw pain last and hour before, the wafer curing my migraine.  Half half if you can endure the pain, its wonderful",
                    "Wonder drug. I tried many others. Maxalt MLT works so quick and free of all the usual side effects. I can use Maxalt MLT and within 30-60 minutes return to normal activities free of the normal after migraine haziness. It has given me my life back. Many thanks to Dr. Z. for prescribing this.",
                    "This medication is labeled a wonder drug in my household. It is the last line of defense and treatment for migraine. However and very sadly I might add recently the copay my insurance company imposed is going to make it hard to take. Limited to 4 tablets per week (while they state all medicines are calculated at a monthly dose level) NOW a copay of $60 per script makes it $240 for each myself and my wife. We just can't afford this after paying $2400.00 monthly for the insurance coverage. We are being choked to death! If the medicine was covered properly under the contract we could handle the $60 copay per month but because they limit the medication to 3-4 tablets per week. ",
                    "I took it for the first time today. My migraine was gone within an hour; however, it made me really sleepy. Three hours later, I'm still very groggy. Next time, I think I'll stay home from work and sleep it off. But missing work is what I'm trying to avoid. I'm incredibly thrilled that my migraine is gone, though.",
                    "I have suffered from hormonal migraines since puberty and am now in my fifties. I tried every option the Doctor could offer but nothing helped until I found Maxalt Melt about ten years ago. I call them my magic pill as they can clear a migraine completely within an hour. Very occasionally I have to take a second dose. They work for me with minimal side effects and are worth every penny. I'm in the UK so can get them on prescription.",
                    "I use this medication to help my migraines. I used to take Relpax. I quit taking it because it was too expensive and the side effects were strong. I like this medication because my insurance covers most of it and it is very effective with little side effects. The only cons are the taste (a little minty but the end has a bitter taste), I seem to get different side effects each time I take it (very mild, includes some drowsiness and nausea), also in my experience you need to take this medication as soon as you feel the migraine coming on or you may find yourself taking two or three pills during the migraine every two hours to keep it gone. Overall I find it very cost friendly and effective. I will continue using this medication.",
                    "My Migraine did Not go away . It might have only marginally lessened it . I went to bed for two hours and have felt terrible all day . This medication made me very sleepy . I took a Second Wafer some hours later but there was Still No Improvement ! Now I cannot take any other migraine medication for a whole 24 hours. Which is far too long . I made the mistake of taking the second wafer when the first one wasn't helping. I already had Jaw Pain so reading that others get it as a side effect makes me wonder. It reminds me of Imigraine and I thought that useless. Sydney Australia 2015.05.18",
                    "I've had ever-worsening migraines since I was in my 40's (I'm now 73). When they started, all that was available were drugs like Fiorinal and other mind-scrambling drugs. Finally, the triptans came along and saved my life. I started with Imitrex and tried the various other triptans, but Maxalt was the most effective. I would like to share one important observation: When I first started taking triptans, I had very few side effects, and was able to function at a high-level job, run home with kids, etc. HOWEVER, as I got older, I realized that side-effects emerged which have only gotten stronger over time. e.g. fogginess, sleepiness, nausea, etc. -- so be aware that side-effects can increase with age. Still, Maxalt is a life-saver.",
                    "I have been taking Maxalt for a couple of years and it's the only migraine medicine that gets rid of the pain without making me sick. I have a couple of side effects: tingling in my jaw, neck, and spine and also it makes me have to pee a lot. ",
                    "I have suffered with cluster headaches since I was in my twenties. I am now 61 and still get them, sometimes every few months and sometimes I can go several years, but when they hit, the are debilitating and I never know how many days or weeks they will continue. My physician gave me a sample to try as I had been having these headaches almost everyday for 2 or more weeks. Within 30-45 minutes the pressure and pain were gone and my drooping, puffy eye looked normal again. I plan to ask my doctor if he can prescribe a larger quantity so I can take them during these lengthy episodes. I would love to be part of a study on the efficacy of this drug on cluster headache patients. Wish I had known about it sooner.",
                    "This Med is nothing short of a miracle. Quick acting and has broken the cycle this making frequency decrease. Wish my insurance wasn't so tight on filling. I've waited years fora generic & they finally covered 4 pills. Woo hoo! Cheaper than an ER visit that doesn't even work as quickly. I would recommend this product to everyone who mentions the word migraine.",
                    "I love Maxalt my doctor gave it to me about 4 months ago. After years of no relief my migraine was gone in 20 minutes! I admit I get extremely sleepy after I take it but a 1 hour nap and I'm back in business. Much better then four days of blinding pain that's for sure it is very expensive but I contacted my local clinic and they had me fill out some forms and received a free 6 month supply at which time I can reapply. You can also try contacting the company online they may help depending on your income.",
                    "I love how fast I get relief with this and how the melting form ones work when I'm nauseated.",
                    "I have headache for an unknown reason, but they are always in the left temple behind my eye. The pain is awful. I've tried every over the counter med and this is the only one that works. Hopefully the cause can be cured until then. This are doing the job",
                    "I had a migraine for 7 days. When I finally couldn't take the pain anymore, I went to my doctor and was prescribed this medication. Within 20 minutes my migraine was gone. Its heaven sent. You have to take it as soon as you feel a migraine coming on. Also it makes me very sleepy. But almost all medications do that to me. If you haven't taken it ...get it. It will solve your migraine problems.",
                    "OMG! This stuff is a life changer! I suffer from migraines at least once or twice a week. Makes me feel a little nauseated for a few minutes but within 20 minutes my headache and nausea is gone. Now I have to figure out how to get more then my insurance will allow me to get in a month.... They only allow 9 a month :-/ Way better than Imatrex!",
                    "Aside from a slight burning sensation where my migraine is located this drug works wonderfully. Better than any nasal spray or OTC drug I've ever tried.",
                    "I've had migraines since I was 11 and was first prescribed Maxalt when I was 17. It's wonderful. I take it as soon as I start to notice the signs of a migraine and about 70% of the time the first dose does the job, within an hour or less. Occasionally I take a second dose if the symptoms haven't gone after 2-3 hours. Very occasionally it doesn't work at all. It has improved my life enormously. I evangelize about it. My migraines used to last up to 3 days - now I get a unkillable one only once or twice a year. Side effects for me are (as someone else has mentioned) one sneeze within a few minutes of taking it, a little drowsiness and eventually a little euphoria (though maybe that's a rational response to knowing the migraine has gone).",
                    "I've had migraines for years and have been given everything for them. I also believe I've gone through every triptan that one could imagine. This medicine has been phenomenal in relieving really tough migraine pain. Within 30 minutes I can get relief. Also, I like that you can get it in sublingual form. Sometimes my migraines are so bad that I'm constantly throwing up everything. When I'm nauseous the sublingual form is wonderful, however, it also comes in a tiny tablet. I keep this with me at all times. It has saved me from multiple hospital visits in the past. Hope this helps!",
                    "I've had Migraine headaches since grade school. This is the only medication that I have tried that gives me relief in less than 15 minutes and has no side effect",
                    "Very effective migraine medicine. Take at first sign of migraine and did very well.",
                    "I have had migraines since I was a teenager (I'm now 42.) After trying almost everything, including OTC meds and other tryptans that didn't work, I am so glad my Dr gave me Maxalt .It works every time. Very rarely I need a second dose, but I know it will always work.This drug has saved me from calling in sick to work on many occasions, and I can even take it at work if I need it, as I don't experience any side effects from it. My only complaint is the expense. Even with insurance and using generic, my copay is still $31 for only 12 pills that are supposed to last me a month.If I refill the prescription before that month ,the copay goes up to $50. Sometimes I will get 3 or 4 migraines a week, so 12 pills is just not enough.This is a great drug though.",
                    "Maxalt, especially the melt aways are simply amazing. I've had to take them off and on for years. (Going quite awhile without migraines.) Then the generic was introduced. I've tried two different kinds. They are not the same! The generic makes my headache get worse right after I take it, then about 1/2 hour later it might work. I'm usually asleep soon after that. I searched for the 'real' deal again and it is as I remembered. Started working RIGHT away with very little side effects. Maybe sore throat. Such a miracle for me. It is expensive at times depending on whim of insurance coverage, but I will pay to have pain go away!",
                    "I've suffered from severe, debilitating migraines since I was 30 (I'm now 49). I've been prescribed everything under the sun but Maxalt is the ONLY medication that works for me. First of all, it dissolves under my tongue so I know that if I vomit, I won't throw it up. Secondly, and especially if I take it at the first sign of a migraine, it usually only takes about 30 minutes to kick in and fully eradicate my migraine. Imitrex and the others I've been on haven't worked or haven't worked as completely as Maxalt. I consider it a life saver.",
                    "Tried a sample of Maxalt that the doctor gave me for the first time today and could not believe the results. Within 1 hour the migraine was gone and within 2 hours I was back to normal and working. This is truly a miracle medicine for me. I also take 100 mg of Topamax daily so that has really cut down on the migraines but again the Maxalt was a lifesaver for me today. I am worried about my copay after reading some of the post on here but I do have to say that I think it will be worth it.",
                    "I live in the UK so I get Maxalt free on NHS. I suffer from migraines a lot, and before I started taking Maxalt I would get minimum of 4 migraines a month sometimes more. These would last a whole 7 days with the first 24 hrs being hell! Its hard to explain to non-sufferers how painful these are. All of you will know what I am on about. Couldn't believe how amazing Maxalt was, didn't even reach the painful stage but it was totally gone. Works every time straight away for me. I take it along with codeine also prescribed. Tiny side effect, cramps in tummy but goes away within 30 mins. Worth it though!",
                    "Works nearly every time on one dose. The second dose will make you fell washed out for the next 24 hours. Life is normal with this drug as it works in about an hour. I am in the UK so NHS covers the costs of the drug.",
                    "Maxalt has worked wonders for me! I've suffered from migraines for several years now and Maxalt has been the only thing that can stop them. When I feel a migraine coming on I take one of the 10 mg dissolvable tablets and it soon disappears. Occasionally I do end up with a full-blown migraine (because I'm forgetful and don't always have Maxalt on me) and taking two doses helps it go away much more quickly than it would otherwise. Miracle!",
                    "Works about 75% of the time. So far this is the best medication I've been prescribed.",
                    "This is the only medicine that tackles my migraines. They can make me sleepy and stupid, but I'll take that over a migraine pain any day.",
                    "I've had migraines since I was about 9 years old because of a life long battle with insomnia. When I was a kid and I had my first migraine...I thought I was dying. I didn't understand what I had, what set it off or why I had it. And the pain and all of the vomiting. EVERYTHING hurt. Any light, the slightest noise and any movement I made while in bed made the migraine worse and I'd start vomiting NON-STOP. The doctor prescribed Maxalt to me. I didn't even know they MADE medicines for migraines and I have to say I cannot be without it. But as the directions state, take AS SOON as you feel a migraine (not just a headache) coming on. Your body usually gives you signs, for me it's excessive yawning every few seconds and irritability.",
                    "I had migraines for nearly 35 years after working in a building that had been \"bug bombed\" overnight. About 10 years ago I realized they only came from neck pain and chiropractic did not help. After an exceptionally bad reaction 3 years ago to Cafergot, I was prescribed Maxalt and it became my wonder medicine. I have not had a migraine now in nearly 18 months (something in my neck has moved to relieve the pressure) but I still take Maxalt when nothing else will get rid of a bad headache after all night pain last night, it was gone in 10 minutes when I finally took it this morning. I wish I had known about it decades ago, none of the other triptans worked for me.",
                    "Life changing, I love this medicine.",
                    "This is an amazing medicine that I can not live without. No side effects and completely knocks put the pain. Only once or twice did I need a second dose. It's a life saver. My insurance still covers it so I am lucky.",
                    "I have had migraines for about 12 years. Maxalt is the only drug that works and it works fast. Only problem is my insurance will only pay for 10 a month and when my cluster headaches come I eat through them like candy.",
                    "I have been taking Maxalt for migraines for the past five years. This medication is the only one I have found that really takes care of the migraine and any residual headache. The generic ones don't work for me. ",
                    "My migraines started on April 2 2016, I have had a constant headache since then, with the 13 migraines, after a CT scan in my neck, I have a long which needs to be removed, which could be the root cause for this ongoing headache however finally I was prescribed maxalt today after almost 4 months of suffering headaches and migraines,and taking other pain relief, icing it, quiet rooms, limiting bright light stimulation ,msiisng out on family and friend events and I cannot believe the difference it's made. I don't like taking medications, I try to do things naturally, think this really really helped, and I have so much relief. Kudos to the angel who told me about it from Medicare, while we were trying to sort out my card going missing",
                    "Maxalt was a wonderful medication for two years, then its effectiveness rapidly diminished. My unforeshadowed migraines feature very mild headaches; instead, I first lost my sense of balance, then my lunch, and then the desire to live for the next three hours. Although I was on a migraine-suppressing tricyclic and metroprolol, migraines would punch through two to eight times a month. Maxalt shutdown such migraines within 20 minutes-no side effects. (NOTE: Maxalt did not suppress the rare aura). After further adjustment of my daily medicines, my rescue medicine became Relpax  2 Aleve.",
                    "Tried some samples of Maxalt and while it got rid of my (minor in this case) migraine, I did experience a side effect that made me more than a bit nervous. I experienced numbness in my left hand and arm. My doctor told me to immediately stop using it. I'm a bit saddened that I can't continue on Maxalt as it did get rid of my migraine and definitely worked better than Imitrex, but not worth the risk of the side effect I experienced.",
                    "I had no luck with this medicine. I have tried a few different migraine medicines: Maxalt, Imitrex, Treximet, Fiortal, Indocin, Vicodin, and Percocet. I have suffered from migraines for 4 years, however I am able to recognize the signs before an attack. I attempted to take the Maxalt at the first sign of the migraine and nothing happened. On the other hand, I tried Treximet and had WONDERFUL results. Treximet is expensive, but if you have a healthcare plan that covers it, it works wonders (assuming you catch the migraine early). I am now on a daily dose of Topamax that has drastically cut the number of severe migraines per month .",
                    "I get hormonal migraines, about 3 a month. Just got the dissolvable tablet and tried it twice. Worked both times in about 30 minutes. I get pretty drowsy, but I get drowsy when taking Excedrin and Midol. Both times I used it, I had already taken an OTC and it hadn't worked. Next time I'll skip the OTC and just take this. ",
                    "Fantastic drug! Works every time within half an hour. Feel a little strange for around 30 minutes after taking it, but no other side effects. Highly recommend it as it's the only thing that works for my migraines",
                    "Maxalt almost always gets rid of my migraine with one pill. It does make me sleepy so I take it near bedtime. When I wake up, I am groggy for up to 6 hours. That is the only side effect I have experienced. If I am having what I call a migraine marathon (up to five days) I alternate taking Maxalt and Imitrex.",
                    "I have had migraines since my teenage years and am currently 49 years old. I sometimes go for long periods of time with no migraines, but then I can have migraine and accompanying neck pain that goes on for 2 days or more.  I've been on Fiorinal, then Fioricet, and just recently, Maxalt. Recently, I asked my Dr about having a different medication that would be legal to take to Europe, as Fioricet is banned in at least some, if not all, countries in Europe. Since another Dr had previously tried prescribing Maxalt, he had me try this. It WORKS. I find it works better and faster than other meds, and I don't feel woozy when taking it.  Tricare allows 18 pills per 45 day period before another refill.",
                    "I have used Maxalt for the past 7 years and I swear by it. If I feel a migraine coming on I put my melt into my mouth and I am free and clear in less then 15 minutes. Some people call this medicine Migraine Gold. To me it is a lifesaver.",
                    "I have had migraines for over 20 years. They were always debilitating and would last for days. I would literally pull my hair to relieve some of the pain. I went to all kinds of doctors to find out the cause, none took me seriously. Finally one doctor did and prescribed Maxalt as needed. She is my hero! When I feel a migraine coming on, I let a Maxalt melt in my mouth and in a few minutes, the migraine is forgotten. I have not had ANY side effects!",
                    "Have had migraine for 33 years. Experienced first one after giving birth for the first time. Migraines are very severe and symptoms include non stop vomiting, lack of balance, loss of sensation, sensitivity to light, sound, etc. Rizatriptan works for a migraine attack which is not so severe. It has to be taken immediately. I usually lie down quietly for 20 minutes after taking it and then it works. It does not completely get rid of the headache, but suppresses it. This allows you to get on with your day. It makes me very tired, and makes my body feel heavy. Reactions are sometimes slower, so don't drive. If it does not work within 20-30 minutes, then it won't. ",
                    "I used to take the Maxalt in pill form and these work 2x as fast. I took one today at the first sign of a headache and it stopped it in it's tracks in just under 15 minutes. The pill used to take 30 and often the headache had time to bloom and get bad by then. They didn't immediately get rid of the nausea I get, but it went away in about 20 min after it stopped the bloom. I rated these as a 9 because of the taste. They taste a bit like a peppermint candy that's gone bad, but it's bearable and only lasts for about 5 seconds. I usually wash the flavor away with coffee - I like to back up anything I take for a headache with a good dose of caffeine. These will be replacing my Maxalt pills even if they do taste awful.",

                    "I have suffered with migraine since I was 12 yr old, and I'm now in my 50's. I've had every head exam and test possible as well as tried a myriad of medications over the years for treatment. From taking preventive type things daily to treating the pain only during the headache. Nothing has given me the swift relief as this drug. It seems to give me complete relief within 30-40 minutes, without any side effects (that I've noticed). I took immitrex for years with little relief and horrible side effects. It would make me feel dizzy, weird and always made me nauseous. So I stopped taking it. Now with the Maxalt, I'm thrilled to know I can take it without worry of unwanted side effect. Thank you Maxalt! Finally migraine relief! ",

Nothing worked before, but started taking rizatriptan 9 months ago. It works every time, no side effects. I have my life back. Amazing. Recommend making a mentrual and migraine diary before going to the doctor.",
                    "Maxalt has less side effects, for me, than other Migraine Medication. Previously I have been on the Maxalt 5 but needed to go up to the Maxalt 10 which helps relieve the pain more completely. I tried many other medicines, and this has been the best for me, I believe it is different for every person. My nausea does increase on this medication, but no chest heaviness as with other medicines.",
                    "For me Maxalt is a miracle drug. I have tried almost everything OTC, and nothing worked. Excedrin worked for awhile, then after a few weeks, it stopped working. I can always count on Maxalt to get rid of my migraines. I usually feel relief within an hour of taking it. That being said ,this drug is very expensive. Even with insurance and taking the generic version, I am still out of pocket about $50 a box, and they only give you 12 pills. Sometimes I have 3 or 4 migraines in a week, so this can get really expensive. It works wonders for me though, so unfortunately it's a necessary expense.",

I used to be in agony for up to 3 days , but now at the first sign of an attack I take one , very rarely I have had to take another one a few hours after that if it started to come back . It can sometimes make me drowsy, but other times I have no side effects , just relief that there is something that actually works . I'm in Australia, so a pack of 4 costs me $25 .",

It literally gave me back my life, I was ill for days that ran into weeks that went into months. It was shocking, I felt suicidal with having no life and one day was sitting in my doctors room sobbing begging him to help me, and he prescribed me rizatriptan (maxalt). I love it!!",
                    "Usually the migraine wakes me up at night with the pain beginning at the base of my head. I keep the rizatriptan on my bedside table and I take it immediately. When I wake in the morning the pain is gone. Before I would wake with the pain, and it would linger for days with hardly no relief. I works great for me.",

                    "I take Maxalt 10mg ODT when my Imitrex fails. Maxalt rarely fails and is actually my back up plan but has lately been my go to since Imitrex has stopped working completely. Maxalt is great! It works within an hour of taking it and I have little to no side effects. I give it a 9 because it does make me shake and if I take two, it will make me feel washed out the next day. Of course, all of this is an even trade for killing a migraine. Overall, great and effective drug!",
                    "Maxalt has really changed how I felt about my migraines. Before I was prescribed Maxalt, I would suffer terribly, taking only OTC medications which \"never\" helped much.

And I'm not sleepy.",

Usually in less than 30-60 minutes I forget that my head was hurting and I am able to work for 8-12 hours, smometimes longer. I agree with another comment: it gives no side effects like a rapid heart rate or chest pain. After having surgery I got spinal meningitis which started my migranes when I was 34 years old. Now at 48 I am thankful for Maxalt.",

I look to try and function as normal when i take abortive migraine medication, this one has made me feel worse. At least I can actually go to work when I have just a migraine.",

I don't have any side effects from it although it wouldn't matter since I now get relief! I have found migraine medicines are hit or miss for many so I'm beyond pleased I found a hit. I recommend Maxalt to anyone that will listen.",

My neurologist couldn't find anything wrong and I tried several medications (some would take at least 12 hours to have an effect). The only medication that ever successfully treated my migraines was Maxalt and it pretty much gave me my life back. It would still take at least an hour to work but it was really a life changer. Ultimately, I sought an ENT and after I had sinus surgery (and corrected my deviated septum) in 2011, my migraines never returned. But if they ever did come back, I would be running to Maxalt as my savior again!",

I get pain in my Left scapula that eventually radiates into the base of my skull through to my Left eye. If taken right away, I get almost total relief in 20-40 minutes. If I wait longer, it may take over an hour to work. Works over 90 percent of the time averaging 12 headaches per month. Side effects for me are a tightening sensation in my neck (where the arteries are on either side) then a \"floaty\" sensation. The pain goes away and I'm left tired, yawning frequently and a little fuzzy minded, but able to function much better than with the migraine. I've tried imitrex, zomig, midrin, and rx pain relievers. Maxalt has worked by far the best for me.",

As somebody who is used to suffering through them for 2 days, this is truly amazing.",

This is also a plus at night as I could not sleep with migraines. The pounding and the pain would keep me up all night. Highly recommend this to anyone suffering from migraines.

I get stomach pain, vomiting, an aura, light sensitivity. They had me on demerol, Percocet, phenergan, imitrex, nothing helped. I have been on maxalt a few years and the one thing I have noticed is that i get pain around the upper jaw area just under the ear...then all of a sudden like the snap of a finger all pain is gone 15 to 25 min. It makes me drowsey. I wake up from my nap feeling great but real thirsty.",

Yesterday was again after my weight lifting workout. I only get migraines after a workout the last years. I always get aura for about 20 minutes before a headache begin. That is good the doctor said because I can take Maxalt faster before the pain begins. My first impression is that the aura lasted about 15 minutes and the pain was bearable in a scale of ten I would say 6.5 compared to other times that reaches 9 -10. The first 10 minutes, I was feeling a little bit weird and little dizzy. After 90 minutes the migraine got away, I think it needs about 90 minutes to act",

They are trying to force me to take a generic. I used to get 12 tablets and they changed it to 9- which 9 is not enough. When I run out I cannot help but pray for the day I get a refill fearing I will get a migraine before that time. When the refill day comes, I stalk my pharmacy on the phone until it is ready. Ugh...talk about \"drug-seeking\" !",

                    "I find Maxalt Wafers amazing. I get a little tightness in my throat but apart from that no side effects and they work within I/2 an hour. In fact it feels like a huge weight has been lifted off me. They are expensive but worth it.",
                    "Tried Imitrex and Relpax first, but had bad heart-squeezing and neck-squeezing side effects. Tried Maxalt and did not have that problem. It usually takes away the migraines, but can take 1-2 hours to get relief. I'm also very fatigued after the pain goes away, which makes daytime onset of migraines a hassle. Also for the 1-2 hours I am waiting for it to work, the pain actually intensifies until suddenly it lets go and the blood vessels in my head feel cold. Strange, but true.",
                    "Within half an hour, the headache has totally subsided. sometimes need a second dose. It does cause my skin to feel sensitive to heat and my throat feels tight for about 2 hours but the headache and all symptoms are totally gone. Brilliant",
                    "Today was my first time taking Rizatriptan and the fact that I am able to write this review just hours after the onset of a migraine is amazing because normally I would be completely down for the count for at least a whole day with a migraine. So here is my experience: I have taken countless meds before including Imitrex with terrible side effects and zero relief so naturally I was skeptical about this new med. I took it as soon as I knew that this was going to be a particularly bad migraine. The only side effect I had was sleepiness, no \"heart attack\" feeling as I had experienced with Imitrex. I fell asleep within 15 min of taking Rizatriptan and woke up 2 hours later completely migraine free.",
                    "This pill is like a magic. I just noticed that the pill works in minutes for me and I feel a bit dizziness and like a burning head and then the pain is gone. Today I got a early migraine and I was able to use the MLT and work kind of slowly but it stopped the pain in time. But I still feel very sensitive to light. Great medication ask your doctor for Maxalt or Maxalt-MLT.",
                    "As you may know, migraines are extremely debilitating even when trying to perform most menial tasks let alone professional responsibilities. I tried Maxalt for the first time today approximately 20 minutes after my first aura and it actually works. I am happily surprised! I have yet to experience any side effects. However, lets be honest, I'd be tolerant of almost anything besides a migraine - which feels like a freight train chugging through my head.",
                    "Must take within 20 minutes of onset. The longer you wait, the longer it takes to work. Keep it in your pocket/wallet at all times. For me, it is a lifesaver.",
                    "My experience was mixed. I took Maxalt MLT as soon as I had my usual \"Aura\". It worked within 30 minutes. The aura was gone and I never did get a migraine. However, within an hour I had a severe angina attack and had to take my nitro twice to relieve the pain. Nitro glycerin gives you a headache, so I think I'd rather have the migraine than the chest pain! My daughter took it and had a wonderful experience, took the pain away within 30 minutes and no side effects at all. I guess I won't be taking it again. Too bad, it worked on the migraine.",
                    "Maxalt has helped me so much. My migraines get so intense and the minute I take Maxalt I start to feel relief.",
                    "Maxalt is a very good migraine medicine for me. No side effects but only a little tired but that's good.",
                    "1 Maxalt malt usually starts working in 30 to 45 minutes for me. Within an hour I'm able to continue my day. I have very frequent migraines and have used Maxalt for many years. No real side effects except a bit of drowsiness. And it is very expensive. Insurance does not cover the whole cost.",
                    "I suffer with cluster headaches. Extreme pain of the highest order. I found Rizatriptan melt in the mouth tablets to be superb.",
                    "This medication worked well to keep my cluster headache pain to a minimum. I found it did not work well when the cluster lasted longer than 2 weeks.",
                    "I've always had 3 day migraines. MaxAlt will take it away in about 35 minutes. Sometimes I would have to take another one (dissolved in my mouth) the next day. I cannot stress enough how much I love this medicine. I come from days when Darvon's were given for migraines, they didn't do anything but zombie you with the pain. I thank the scientist who figured out how to control whatever it is that is being controlled. Of course, it IS too expensive. Without insurance, I would have to suffer, as they are about $32 per pill!",
                    "I've had chronic migraines for around 12 years. I take 5mg and it usually takes care of my headache. It makes my neck ache a little but the relief from the horrible symptoms of a migraine are well worth it. I've tried other triptans but this one works best. The generic is very inexpensive.",
                    "I have just started experiencing migraines and thought my life was over at first. Nothing was working and I couldn't be a wife to my husband or mom to my five year old daughter. Since starting this miracle drug as we call it, I am myself again. The only side effect I am experiencing is having to pee a lot. I don't know if I am alone in that matter, but I would gladly substitute spending sometime in the potty then spending a whole day in the ER or in the bedroom in the dark.",
                    "The Maxalt-MLT self-dissolving tab worked wonders for me. At a time when my doctor was trying to determine the most-effective treatment form my migraine headaches, this medicine was a God-send. My doc gave me samples of various triptan meds and I was to try one out at the onset of every migraine. Of the 5-6 different samples I was given, Maxalt-MLT worked the fastest & had the least amount of side-effects. I was amazed. Unfortunately, my insurance would not cover it and I had to settle with sumatriptan. Sumatriptan worked, but it took about an hour and I just remember feeling really weird after taking it. Anyway, if/when my migraines start again- Maxalt is what I want.",
                    "Have just been prescribed Maxalt Melt after a lifetime of pain and feel I have discovered gold! My only disappointment is having only three pills when I need a truckload!",
                    "Upon 1st using this approximately 6 or so years ago I too labeled this as a miracle, unfortunately my last 3 migraines they have had no effect. ",
                    "It is the only med that has helped my migraines!",
                    "Relieved my headache quickly! The best I've tried in the last 5 years! Been through pain medicines and imitrex, Maxalt works best hands down.",
                    "I have suffered from migraines since I was a kid. I'm 49 now. In my mid 30s I started taking imitrex and it completely derailed me. I then started trying a bunch of preventative drugs, beta blocker, calcium blockers and ssri drugs. Finally found one that works fairly well, but along with that I use maxalt as a rescue drug which I still take 6+ times a month. It's a good drug and is effective. I have always noticed the migraines redoubles its efforts before leaving after I take it. I also notice it makes me very sleepy and foggy. I don't like to take it at work because of that. 9 times out of 10 it works, but there are still times it does nothing for me. Some is better than none in my world though. I take a generic due to cost.",
                    "I have suffered from migraines Since An Auto accident in 2009, sometime as many as 15 a month. I was prescribed Maxalt this past year (after trying a whole bag of other medicines). It has given me my life back... within thirty minutes after taking Maxalt the symptoms decrease by 50% and are gone within an hour. Several side effects, very drowsy and increased nausea but after several hours of sleep all is good.",
                    "I have tried OTC migraine medicines, and three other prescriptions. Maxalt is by far the best, and MLT makes it nearly perfect. The only bad side effect I have is that the back of my neck gets sore. Maxalt does this far less than Zomig, and taking Advil Liquigels or Vicodin with the Maxalt MLT helps quite a bit. My ideal treatment for a migraine is to take Maxalt MLT and Advil Liquigels, then lay down with something cold on my forehead. Once I am able to doze, I sleep until I wake up on my own. I can't believe how much better I feel after the nap. At work, I just take the two medicines. It takes me longer to feel better, but makes my headache much more bearable.",
                    "Works well, Headaches gone in about 2 hours of taking it.",
                    "99% of the time my migraine symptoms fade within an hour. I have had to take a second tablet only twice in ten years. I can function as normal. The only drawback is feeling tired and increased urination, but compared to going through a 36 hour migraine, that's nothing!",
                    "I would definitely try this for migraines if you haven't already. I had used Imitrex pills for a few years and suddenly they stopped working. I tried a couple different pills and then found Maxalt. The only problem with the pills is that I have to take them right away. Once the migraine has started they don't take away all the pain, only like 60% for me. I was on Maxalt for a few years, then put on Cymblata and didn't have migraines for 2 years on that, but then they came back and Maxalt didn't help me... Now I use Imitrex Statdose because I never catch my migraine until it's terrible but the injections get rid of the pain fast!",
                    "Miracle drug for me! Migraine gone within the hour of taking Maxalt. It made me groggy but I will take that over hours of pain",
                    "Miracle medicine! Only thing that helps my migraines and within minutes. Insurance wont cover so will have to find an alternative. If your insurance covers it, it is well worth it!",
                    "I am 56 and I've suffered with migraines since I was 5 years old. Maxalt is the only migraine medication that has worked wonders for me!! I take one as soon as I get the slightest beginning of a migraine and it is gone in 20 minutes! Not only that, but I've been taking it for 3 years now and I used to get 2 or 3 migraines a month, and now I only get about 1 every 2 months! Maxalt has been like a miracle for me...I no longer have to suffer with horrible headaches!! Additionally, I have not experienced any side effects!",
                    "One Maxalt-MLT usually gets rid of the migraine in an hour or less. Occasionally, I need another one 2 hours later to really get rid of it for good. Rarely, even the second one did not quite do it for me. But this is still the most effective medicine that's worked for me, after trying 8-10 other medicines (over-the-counter and prescription).",
                    "This is a miracle drug! I've tried all sorts of medicines over the past 30 some years and this drug is the only one that has ever stopped my migraines. If you are like me and have migraines often, then you got to try this drug, of course not all people have the same experience with medicines, but it is well worth trying.",
                    "I am a 35yo female and had my first migraine at 16yo just after giving birth to my firstborn. Over the years, particularly after each baby, the symptoms have become worse and are always experienced during menstruation. Recently codeine products that would normally help are not even touching the sides of the pain, and I have been experiencing increasing levels of sickness that anti-nausea tablets don't have any impact on. But yesterday a friend gave me a maxalt wafer because I couldn't function under the intensity of the sickness and pain. At first it didn't seem to do anything. But after maybe an hour to 90 minutes and I was no longer sick, nor was I in pain!! It was like a miracle!! How ever vision was slightly more blurred than usual.",
                    "Took this for the first time last night. Worked as well as Relpax (which my insurance no longer covers). I could actually get a good night's sleep!",
                    "Works well for my migraines. For me, I start feeling better in 20 minutes or so, and am completely back to normal within two hours.",
                    "Maxalt does work. Usually Fioricet works but when my migraine becomes worse Fioricet doesn't do anything and Maxalt does the trick!",
                    "This is the best sos pill for migraines, I barely have side-effects from it and if I melt it in my mouth it acts much faster killing my migraine in less than 20 minutes. I cannot imagine my life without Rizatriptan !! It gave me my life back!",
                    "I've been using maxalt for about 6 years (give or take) and it's about the only medication I've found that really gets rid of my migraines. The MLT version is great when your stomach's so upset you can't keep down a pill, too. The only side effect I've ever had is a tingling feeling in my shoulders. Well worth the co-pay!",
                    "I started taking Maxalt after horrible experiences with Imitrex. I had almost all the same side effects: extreme nausea, dizziness, falling asleep, and a general out of it feeling the rest of the day. But the worst part is that it did absolutely nothing for my migraine. I am just glad that I had samples so I didn't get stuck paying for a prescription I would not use. ",
                    "I have suffered migraines since childhood 2-5 migraines a year. Then at about 38 I started getting these horrible severely debilitating headaches 1-3 times a year and the headaches would last up to weeks with intermittent increase in severity. I was finally diagnosed with cluster headaches and prescribed Rizatriptan. If I feel the onset it diminishes the intensity and duration. I have been using it for 2 years and very grateful.",
                    "My first time taking it. I have complex partial seizures and my aura has changed to where I now have migraine headaches afterwards. We are doing test to rule out other problems but this medicine helped me more than anything so far. Still have that groggy feeling afterwards but I can deal with that. Just do not know how I can take it should I have to at work since I work in a call center 10 hours a day with constant calls.",
                    "I have used maxalt four times in the last three months. The first time it worked fine and it was gone in a few hours but had heart racing.  The second migraine I was concerned about the side effects but gave a second chance. I had severe throbbing in my head like it was going to explode and then suddenly the migraine broke.  My third attempt my migraine was so severe that I had to take a second dose for relief! I find that if I take it on the onset it works but still light headache and felt numbing sensation.  My fourth today no relief after 2nd dose. Took 3rd after 4 hours but still feeling migraine. Had slight heart racing and throbbing pain. I may continue to see if this is right meds. If not, then I think there's no hope for me!",
                    "Works fast limited side effects.",
                    "This is the only migraine medicine that consistently gets rid of my migraines. I've tried Zomig, Imitrex, and many others - but Maxalt gets it gone in 15-30 minutes and I'm back, up and ready to get back into life. I can even take one at work and just rest my eyes at my desk until it kicks in. Never could do that before.",
                    "This medicine is a miracle drug. I have migraines that last for 3 days and until my doctor prescribed maxalt I could not get rid of them or function properly. Now I take a pill and within 30 min it is gone. My life is so much nicer I am up moving around exercising and actually living my life like a normal person.",
                    "I call this my \"miracle drug\". I had been suffering from constant migraines since I was 9 years old. I am now 64. They used to tell my parents I was \"high-strung\" and had \"tension headaches\". I was never diagnosed with migraine until I was about 48 years old. This is the ONLY drug that has ever stopped my migraine (of course...you have to take it immediately at the onset, as with all migraine meds). I had lost so many days of my life to the extreme pain/nausea and impaired vision/speech/general functionality before I discovered rizatriptan. Quite literally, I thank God for leading someone to develop this and for someone prescribing it for me.",
                    "I am a 42 yr old male and I have been susceptible to migraines since I was very little. My worst childhood memories are of me moaning and rocking back and forth in agony on my bed when suffering from my very first migraines as an 8 or 9 yr old child. I too have not had any luck with Imitrex and some of the other medicines mentioned in this post. My insurance gives me terrible problems when I am trying to get a migraine prescription filled. As it is right now I have figured out that Axert and Maxalt are the only two medicines that I know will work for certain when I am afflicted and totally incapacitated by migraine headaches. The problem with Axert is that my insurance will only allow a monthly script of 6 tablets at $10/tablet. Maxalt does it for less dollars.",
                    "Migraine, the word can't convey the impact on life. For me, a typical one lasted about 36 hours, followed by another 24 hours of \"hangover\". Somewhere during the 36 hour duration, would be 12 hours of hell. I've used Maxalt MLT about 10-12 times over the last 6 months. It has worked every time; I take one when I sense a migraine is starting, and it just doesn't \"blossom\". I have no side effects, no nausea, and no drowsiness. Sometime in the next 20-30 minutes I'll realize the apprehension, tension and other precursors to the migraine have just disappeared. Migraines took too much of my life, and at their worst, pushed depression to the edge of suicide; it's good to have a normal life back.",
                    "Maxalt is the only migraine medicine I have tried, and it works well for me. When I take it early (before it becomes a full-bloomed migraine), it works within maybe 30 minutes, completely getting rid of the pain. I do have some side effects: most of the time, I feel a tightening of the throat for about 15 minutes after taking it (my doctor had warned me about that), and if I happen to be a bit tired when taking it, I feel a bit dizzy for a couple of hours. But it sure beats a 24-hour migraine.",
                    "I have tried different medicines for migraines, all just calmed it down a little, it just had to run its 3 day duration. Am seeing another Dr & she put me on Maxalt yesterday, my migraine was gone within an hour of taking it. I just want to go back and hug her because after 5 yrs of trying I just accepted my pain. It made me drowsy, but I will take drowsy over pain any day.",
                    "Amazing! I took Imitrex for years and it didn't really help. Maxalt is the only medication that works for me to continue my busy life. I have had hormonal migraines since I was 12. Tried everything from pain medicines (temporary fix) to nasal to shots. I love Maxalt!",
                    "I had my doubts that this would work -- it was fantastic! within 15-20 minutes the pain that felt like my skull was in a vise disappeared. I am a horse trainer and I work full time on my own farm, and I can't function when I have a migraine, ( 4-5 attacks a month, 24-48 hours each time) Maxalt 10-mg was a miracle for me. I don't have to put all the work on my daughter, and my temper has become much more even. The anxiety of worrying about a migraine attack has helped enormously, for my emotional state, too. **side note** I had a Mirena IUD and had it removed, I believe this contributed to the attacks, so hopefully in 4-6 weeks I won't need the Maxalt, either.",
                    "This works wonders for me, but makes me a little nutty for awhile. Better than migraines by a long shot. They try and make it taste minty, but still a little foul tasting.",
                    "Works within minutes usually. Have not noted any side effects with it although I do not care for taste. After it melts and is gone, I drink water to get taste out of my mouth.",
                    "Maxalt relieves my migraine in 1 hour however it does make me sleepy. I love the fast dissolve feature. I will have to stop using it however due to the rising cost not covered by my insurance company. I am now hoping Imitrex will work as well.",
                    "I have used this medication for over 3 years now. Just recently I was told to take 2 instead of one since my migraines seem to be getting worse each time (I blame it on MS). Nothing else works for me. I can deal with the kids bickering. I carry this drug with me always! ",
                    "This medication always takes my migraine away. It is the only medicine that has done that for me. Sometimes I do get rebound headaches from the medicine, but I am pleased that I have finally found something to take the migraine away. I just wish I could find something to alleviate my migraines altogether because I get them way too often."

                    "//What is it?//Headache and migraine are different entities. Migraine is one of the most common and well characterized, but there are 14 broad categories that can be subdivided into more than 200 different forms. Migraine itself has about 20 different genres. In general, headaches are divided into two large groups: primary and secondary. Primary illnesses correspond to a disease, not reflecting other health problems and represent around 90% of the total. Secondary symptoms are symptoms of diseases of the nervous system or other organs of the human body. They can occur in cases of flu, alcohol poisoning or withdrawal, minor head trauma, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels) or a high blood pressure crisis. Migraine is a primary headache in which very intense episodes of pain occur interspersed with periods without symptoms. In general, it begins between the ages of 15 and 40, but it can appear in childhood or shortly after the first menstruation. If it appears for the first time after the age of 45, other causes must be excluded. Some of its characteristics are closely associated with the female reproductive cycle: higher prevalence after the first menstruation or during the menstrual period; occasional worsening due to taking birth control pills or hormone therapy; attenuation or disappearance during pregnancy or menopause. Before adolescence, migraines affect boys and girls equally. From then on, it is two to three times more common in females. It is estimated that 8% to 15% of individuals living in Western countries (including Portugal) suffer from this problem. The fact of reaching people in the productive phase implies large economic, social and family costs.//Symptoms//It appears recurrently, several times throughout life, but always with completely free intervals. If it occurs every day, it is probably overuse of painkillers or other medications. Drug abuse can convert a migraine into a chronic daily headache. There are people who preferably appear on the weekend. These crises can be precipitated by changes in sleep schedule, failure to eat breakfast, reduced stress or alcohol abuse. In these cases, it is important to consider a lifestyle change over the weekend. The symptoms are intense and often prevent work or study. The pain tends to be throbbing, worsening with physical exertion or head movements. In general, it affects only one side of the head, and is accompanied by nausea, vomiting, intolerance to light, noise and some smells. It is not mandatory that all of these elements are present simultaneously. And they can occur twice a week or just a few throughout a lifetime. During attacks, people seek a dark, quiet place to rest or fall asleep. An episode can last from a few hours to three days. Between attacks, there are usually no complaints. Some types of migraines may have more complex symptoms (with aura). These forms are less common, affecting around 15% of people with this problem, and include transient neurological symptoms, originating attributable to certain areas of the brain. The other signs are identical to those of migraine without aura. The most common auras are temporary vision disorders, in the form of loss of vision on one side of the visual field, blurred images, perception of bright points, geometric figures or bright zigzags. Other auras can be translated as tingling or numbness on one side of the face or one of the hands. There are people who have difficulty speaking or even temporary paralysis of their limbs, usually only on one side of the body. These changes last about 10 to 30 minutes and precede the pain. In children, migraines tend to be bilateral, less intense and of shorter duration. Vomiting and dark circles can be exuberant. Disturbances in sleep and meal schedules are common precipitating factors. Treating these crises is easier than in adults. Sleep usually gives good results. At these ages, the occipital location is not normal and, when present, requires a medical consultation. Likewise, the presence of headaches with morning vomiting or other unusual symptoms in very young children should be seen by a healthcare professional.//Causes//It is caused by a combination of brain processes: excitation/depression of cells, dilation of arteries and release of chemicals. People with migraine are more sensitive to certain stimuli, environmental or from their own body, that can trigger these brain processes. It is also thought that there is some genetic susceptibility. Some individuals can identify the signs of their attacks. The most common are cheese, chocolate, strawberries, seafood, wine, artificial sauces, changes in sleep patterns, stress, menstruation, fasting, physical exercise, and minor trauma. Others cannot identify them at all. People who drink coffee regularly may experience headaches when they stop this habit.//Diagnosis//The key to diagnosis lies in the clinical history, physical and neurological examination. Observation of the fundus is a very important part of these procedures. In some cases, it may be necessary to resort to computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to exclude other diseases.//Treatment//Migraines have no cure but can be controlled. There are medications and behaviors that can reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks. Symptomatic treatment, during acute periods, involves resting in a quiet, dark place. Pressure or cold can be applied to the area of \u200b\u200bpain. At this stage, analgesics, anti-inflammatories, antiemetics and triptans are very useful.//Prevention//People with migraines should create calendars that allow them to identify their symptoms and assess their impact on their quality of life. The first step in prevention is to identify and eliminate precipitating factors, whenever possible. In some cases, it is necessary to use daily medication to reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks, but there are no drugs specifically developed for their prevention. However, there are some drugs used in other contexts that have proven to be effective, such as beta-blockers, antidepressants or antiepileptics, and these should always be prescribed by a doctor.

                    "At 59 years of age have been suffering migraines since I was 21. Think I have tried every medication available in the UK. Maxalt is the only thing that has ever worked for me.Pain usually gone after 20 minutes, before I took Maxalt I could be in bed for 2 days rolling around in agony. Only side effects are tiredness and strangely It makes me sneeze just once as soon as I have taken it. Maxalt has completely changed my life. Fortunate to live in UK as I get it free on national health prescription.",
                    "I have had migraines since I was 12 yrs. Old, I am 67. As a child I just suffered all the time. When I was in my late 20's, fiorinal was the answer. It did help. There have been a couple of others (can't remember the name). Then imitrex came out. Didn't work. I did not find relief, even with addition of percocet until maxalt came out. Thank heavens. Mostly 20 days per month. I learned very quickly first sign for me is a slice of pain, then I immediately take the maxalt. Within a half hour, 99% gone. I have been so fortunate to have medicine coverage through private employer insurance with reasonable copay, otherwise it would affect my ability to support myself. I take over 12 meds per day..No interactions",
                    "Works within 2 hours but my migraine always returns the next day. I take the medication the next day - headache goes away within two hours - comes back the next day again. Medication works but I feel extremely tired and depressed for the three days. Insurance companies also limit me to 9 pills a month which adds to my stress.",
                    "This medication worked great for me to get rid of my headache. When I take it before I feel a bad migraine coming on, it alleviates it before it gets bad. My only complaint about this medication is I get really bad heart burn and I really do not sleep that well while I am on it. I guess you can%u2019t have everything.",
                    "I occasionally get migraine when I have been in stressful situations. It appears that my migraine are related to a deficit of serotonin. I also get migraines in stores that sell lots of cheap plastic items. This medication is 100% effective for me.",
                    "Puts me in nice restful deep sleep (normal 7hr night), walk up in morning migraine gone, with no hangover feeling that you would normally get if went to ER for a shot.",
                    "To me, this is the ONE medicine I can not live without. I have had to try others due to insurance, and none comes even close! Within 15-30 even the strongest, wanting to smash my head-in migraine will be totally gone! No side effects for me either. Never makes me tired, groggy or the medicated feeling. Taken on empty stomach while in college class and had no problems finishing the class and going home to play with the kids and not the mom who was hiding in a dark room with no noise allowed in the house.",
                    "Maxalt has worked wonders for me. When I have migraines I never feel like swallowing tablets, so the fact that I have the dissolving tablet is an absolute bonus. Before this medicine I was bedridden for days at a time, and after a migraine, my head always felt so heavy and like a bowling ball. Now however I am able to go to work the next day. I recommend it to every person I meet!",
                    "My daily headaches started after a ventricular assist device (VAD). Maxalt has worked beautifully in killing the pain. Occasionally I will wake up with a headache the following day, but not severe enough to warrant another dose. I am careful to avoid triggers so don't have to take this very often. I am grateful that I have this option since I am allergic to NSAIDs.",
                    "Very effective with no side effects (i.e. drowsiness). I've had mixed luck with other migraine medicines, but find Maxalt MLT to be consistently helpful.",
                    "I have suffered from migraines for at least 15 years and tried so many medications and therapies to help. Maxalt is the only thing that helps me. I have missed a day to three of work in a row from migraines and now do not have to miss any. It takes the pain away within an hour. I don't get any effects from the drug really, maybe a bit tired once and awhile. My only complaint is the wafer tastes pretty gnarly but it is worth it!",
                    "If taken at the start of a migraine this medicine works wonders . There are side effects such as dry mouth, tiredness, and joint aches. But as anyone who has migraines know that is a small price to pay for relief from the migraine itself.",
                    "I've suffered from Pure Menstrual Migraine for 4 years. Nothing I have tried to date has helped ease any of the migraine pain at all, which usually goes on for 3 days solid every month, le. Until now. I asked my dr if I could try Rizatriptan and he agreed. My warning sign that a migraine is on it's way is an ache down the left hand side of my face. Well, within the last hour I got that warning so took my first ever Rizatriptan dissove in the mouth tablet. Revolting! Utterly vile - like a really bad mint that went off years ago. However, rather than spit it out (since they are very expensive) I let it dissolve. Now 40 mins later I have no ache and no pain, and I hope that means that I will not get a mega-migraine! So far so good ..",
                    "I avoid drugs of all kinds and I'm a usually healthy person. After suffering years from horribly painful headaches that would leave me vomiting all day and totally out of it (I thought it was due to whiplash injury), my doctor prescribed Rizatriptan 10mg. It truly is a miracle drug for me. I use the melt-away tablets, and find the relief starts in about 15 minutes, and by 30 minutes, any headache is gone. I take them at the very beginning of symptoms. I do get sleepy, so I've learned that I can just take half a tablet, get the same result, and not feel so tired. I have had very slight jaw pain once or twice, and cutting back the dosage also alleviated that problem.",
                    "Since I was about 26 I have suffered from migraines (now 65) and tried everything from daily preventative meds, to expensive self injecting & very expensive medication, then cafegot suppositories with 3 aspro clear for the pain, I could spend hours and days feeling like dying and vomiting non stop, then there was a shortage of cafegot and that was hell, and finally they took it off the market, that is when my Dr. asked me to trial Maxalt wafers, at first I thought nothing could replace cafegot and I was very conscious of not taking ergotomine with rizatriptan. Maxalt is the best, it works within an hour, and so far after 4-5 years no side effects at all, and no more vomiting ever. Also I do not take any other drugs for anything, but Maxalt.",
                    "Maxalt is truly one of the most amazing migraine medications I have ever tried, and believe me, having migraines as a child and now at 52 years of age, there have been many. As a migrainer, we truly know what suffering is. Maxalt is the best, although, after losing my job 18 months ago and with no success of getting another, it is too expensive. From my understanding the patent expires in 2012. I truly hope the price goes down for those of us who cannot be without it.",
                    "43 yr old male.For me this is close to a miracle cure, it has given my life back. I have had stomach and esophagus lesions due to way too much aspirin/ ibuprofen/digesics/codeine trying to halt an attack. No more screaming in E.R rooms waiting for pethidine/morphine. No more thoughts off grabbing a drill to stop the throbbing pain. I actually have a life after 26 yrs of suffering 2-4 attacks a week each last up to 36 hrs each. Numerous preventive medicines didn%u2019t work. I am truly in debt to the manufacturers and the on call doctor who gave me to Maxalt. Takes about 40-90 minutes to work with a second dosage sometimes needed. My fear is the more i take it the less effective it will become as lately I need the second wafer.",
                    "Bad headaches. This medicine works like it says it should.",
                    "I am very greatful for Maxalt wafers as they help me get rid of my migraines, although the side effects of insane burning and jaw pain last and hour before, the wafer curing my migraine.  Half half if you can endure the pain, its wonderful",
                    "Wonder drug. I tried many others. Maxalt MLT works so quick and free of all the usual side effects. I can use Maxalt MLT and within 30-60 minutes return to normal activities free of the normal after migraine haziness. It has given me my life back. Many thanks to Dr. Z. for prescribing this.",
                    "This medication is labeled a wonder drug in my household. It is the last line of defense and treatment for migraine. However and very sadly I might add recently the copay my insurance company imposed is going to make it hard to take. Limited to 4 tablets per week (while they state all medicines are calculated at a monthly dose level) NOW a copay of $60 per script makes it $240 for each myself and my wife. We just can't afford this after paying $2400.00 monthly for the insurance coverage. We are being choked to death! If the medicine was covered properly under the contract we could handle the $60 copay per month but because they limit the medication to 3-4 tablets per week. ",
                    "I took it for the first time today. My migraine was gone within an hour; however, it made me really sleepy. Three hours later, I'm still very groggy. Next time, I think I'll stay home from work and sleep it off. But missing work is what I'm trying to avoid. I'm incredibly thrilled that my migraine is gone, though.",
                    "I have suffered from hormonal migraines since puberty and am now in my fifties. I tried every option the Doctor could offer but nothing helped until I found Maxalt Melt about ten years ago. I call them my magic pill as they can clear a migraine completely within an hour. Very occasionally I have to take a second dose. They work for me with minimal side effects and are worth every penny. I'm in the UK so can get them on prescription.",
                    "I use this medication to help my migraines. I used to take Relpax. I quit taking it because it was too expensive and the side effects were strong. I like this medication because my insurance covers most of it and it is very effective with little side effects. The only cons are the taste (a little minty but the end has a bitter taste), I seem to get different side effects each time I take it (very mild, includes some drowsiness and nausea), also in my experience you need to take this medication as soon as you feel the migraine coming on or you may find yourself taking two or three pills during the migraine every two hours to keep it gone. Overall I find it very cost friendly and effective. I will continue using this medication.",
                    "My Migraine did Not go away . It might have only marginally lessened it . I went to bed for two hours and have felt terrible all day . This medication made me very sleepy . I took a Second Wafer some hours later but there was Still No Improvement ! Now I cannot take any other migraine medication for a whole 24 hours. Which is far too long . I made the mistake of taking the second wafer when the first one wasn't helping. I already had Jaw Pain so reading that others get it as a side effect makes me wonder. It reminds me of Imigraine and I thought that useless. Sydney Australia 2015.05.18",
                    "I've had ever-worsening migraines since I was in my 40's (I'm now 73). When they started, all that was available were drugs like Fiorinal and other mind-scrambling drugs. Finally, the triptans came along and saved my life. I started with Imitrex and tried the various other triptans, but Maxalt was the most effective. I would like to share one important observation: When I first started taking triptans, I had very few side effects, and was able to function at a high-level job, run home with kids, etc. HOWEVER, as I got older, I realized that side-effects emerged which have only gotten stronger over time. e.g. fogginess, sleepiness, nausea, etc. -- so be aware that side-effects can increase with age. Still, Maxalt is a life-saver.",
                    "I have been taking Maxalt for a couple of years and it's the only migraine medicine that gets rid of the pain without making me sick. I have a couple of side effects: tingling in my jaw, neck, and spine and also it makes me have to pee a lot. ",
                    "I have suffered with cluster headaches since I was in my twenties. I am now 61 and still get them, sometimes every few months and sometimes I can go several years, but when they hit, the are debilitating and I never know how many days or weeks they will continue. My physician gave me a sample to try as I had been having these headaches almost everyday for 2 or more weeks. Within 30-45 minutes the pressure and pain were gone and my drooping, puffy eye looked normal again. I plan to ask my doctor if he can prescribe a larger quantity so I can take them during these lengthy episodes. I would love to be part of a study on the efficacy of this drug on cluster headache patients. Wish I had known about it sooner.",
                    "This Med is nothing short of a miracle. Quick acting and has broken the cycle this making frequency decrease. Wish my insurance wasn't so tight on filling. I've waited years fora generic & they finally covered 4 pills. Woo hoo! Cheaper than an ER visit that doesn't even work as quickly. I would recommend this product to everyone who mentions the word migraine.",
                    "I love Maxalt my doctor gave it to me about 4 months ago. After years of no relief my migraine was gone in 20 minutes! I admit I get extremely sleepy after I take it but a 1 hour nap and I'm back in business. Much better then four days of blinding pain that's for sure it is very expensive but I contacted my local clinic and they had me fill out some forms and received a free 6 month supply at which time I can reapply. You can also try contacting the company online they may help depending on your income.",
                    "I love how fast I get relief with this and how the melting form ones work when I'm nauseated.",
                    "I have headache for an unknown reason, but they are always in the left temple behind my eye. The pain is awful. I've tried every over the counter med and this is the only one that works. Hopefully the cause can be cured until then. This are doing the job",
                    "I had a migraine for 7 days. When I finally couldn't take the pain anymore, I went to my doctor and was prescribed this medication. Within 20 minutes my migraine was gone. Its heaven sent. You have to take it as soon as you feel a migraine coming on. Also it makes me very sleepy. But almost all medications do that to me. If you haven't taken it ...get it. It will solve your migraine problems.",
                    "OMG! This stuff is a life changer! I suffer from migraines at least once or twice a week. Makes me feel a little nauseated for a few minutes but within 20 minutes my headache and nausea is gone. Now I have to figure out how to get more then my insurance will allow me to get in a month.... They only allow 9 a month :-/ Way better than Imatrex!",
                    "Aside from a slight burning sensation where my migraine is located this drug works wonderfully. Better than any nasal spray or OTC drug I've ever tried.",
                    "I've had migraines since I was 11 and was first prescribed Maxalt when I was 17. It's wonderful. I take it as soon as I start to notice the signs of a migraine and about 70% of the time the first dose does the job, within an hour or less. Occasionally I take a second dose if the symptoms haven't gone after 2-3 hours. Very occasionally it doesn't work at all. It has improved my life enormously. I evangelize about it. My migraines used to last up to 3 days - now I get a unkillable one only once or twice a year. Side effects for me are (as someone else has mentioned) one sneeze within a few minutes of taking it, a little drowsiness and eventually a little euphoria (though maybe that's a rational response to knowing the migraine has gone).",
                    "I've had migraines for years and have been given everything for them. I also believe I've gone through every triptan that one could imagine. This medicine has been phenomenal in relieving really tough migraine pain. Within 30 minutes I can get relief. Also, I like that you can get it in sublingual form. Sometimes my migraines are so bad that I'm constantly throwing up everything. When I'm nauseous the sublingual form is wonderful, however, it also comes in a tiny tablet. I keep this with me at all times. It has saved me from multiple hospital visits in the past. Hope this helps!",
                    "I've had Migraine headaches since grade school. This is the only medication that I have tried that gives me relief in less than 15 minutes and has no side effect",
                    "Very effective migraine medicine. Take at first sign of migraine and did very well.",
                    "I have had migraines since I was a teenager (I'm now 42.) After trying almost everything, including OTC meds and other tryptans that didn't work, I am so glad my Dr gave me Maxalt .It works every time. Very rarely I need a second dose, but I know it will always work.This drug has saved me from calling in sick to work on many occasions, and I can even take it at work if I need it, as I don't experience any side effects from it. My only complaint is the expense. Even with insurance and using generic, my copay is still $31 for only 12 pills that are supposed to last me a month.If I refill the prescription before that month ,the copay goes up to $50. Sometimes I will get 3 or 4 migraines a week, so 12 pills is just not enough.This is a great drug though.",
                    "Maxalt, especially the melt aways are simply amazing. I've had to take them off and on for years. (Going quite awhile without migraines.) Then the generic was introduced. I've tried two different kinds. They are not the same! The generic makes my headache get worse right after I take it, then about 1/2 hour later it might work. I'm usually asleep soon after that. I searched for the 'real' deal again and it is as I remembered. Started working RIGHT away with very little side effects. Maybe sore throat. Such a miracle for me. It is expensive at times depending on whim of insurance coverage, but I will pay to have pain go away!",
                    "I've suffered from severe, debilitating migraines since I was 30 (I'm now 49). I've been prescribed everything under the sun but Maxalt is the ONLY medication that works for me. First of all, it dissolves under my tongue so I know that if I vomit, I won't throw it up. Secondly, and especially if I take it at the first sign of a migraine, it usually only takes about 30 minutes to kick in and fully eradicate my migraine. Imitrex and the others I've been on haven't worked or haven't worked as completely as Maxalt. I consider it a life saver.",
                    "Tried a sample of Maxalt that the doctor gave me for the first time today and could not believe the results. Within 1 hour the migraine was gone and within 2 hours I was back to normal and working. This is truly a miracle medicine for me. I also take 100 mg of Topamax daily so that has really cut down on the migraines but again the Maxalt was a lifesaver for me today. I am worried about my copay after reading some of the post on here but I do have to say that I think it will be worth it.",
                    "I live in the UK so I get Maxalt free on NHS. I suffer from migraines a lot, and before I started taking Maxalt I would get minimum of 4 migraines a month sometimes more. These would last a whole 7 days with the first 24 hrs being hell! Its hard to explain to non-sufferers how painful these are. All of you will know what I am on about. Couldn't believe how amazing Maxalt was, didn't even reach the painful stage but it was totally gone. Works every time straight away for me. I take it along with codeine also prescribed. Tiny side effect, cramps in tummy but goes away within 30 mins. Worth it though!",
                    "Works nearly every time on one dose. The second dose will make you fell washed out for the next 24 hours. Life is normal with this drug as it works in about an hour. I am in the UK so NHS covers the costs of the drug.",
                    "Maxalt has worked wonders for me! I've suffered from migraines for several years now and Maxalt has been the only thing that can stop them. When I feel a migraine coming on I take one of the 10 mg dissolvable tablets and it soon disappears. Occasionally I do end up with a full-blown migraine (because I'm forgetful and don't always have Maxalt on me) and taking two doses helps it go away much more quickly than it would otherwise. Miracle!",
                    "Works about 75% of the time. So far this is the best medication I've been prescribed.",
                    "This is the only medicine that tackles my migraines. They can make me sleepy and stupid, but I'll take that over a migraine pain any day.",
                    "I've had migraines since I was about 9 years old because of a life long battle with insomnia. When I was a kid and I had my first migraine...I thought I was dying. I didn't understand what I had, what set it off or why I had it. And the pain and all of the vomiting. EVERYTHING hurt. Any light, the slightest noise and any movement I made while in bed made the migraine worse and I'd start vomiting NON-STOP. The doctor prescribed Maxalt to me. I didn't even know they MADE medicines for migraines and I have to say I cannot be without it. But as the directions state, take AS SOON as you feel a migraine (not just a headache) coming on. Your body usually gives you signs, for me it's excessive yawning every few seconds and irritability.",
                    "I had migraines for nearly 35 years after working in a building that had been \"bug bombed\" overnight. About 10 years ago I realized they only came from neck pain and chiropractic did not help. After an exceptionally bad reaction 3 years ago to Cafergot, I was prescribed Maxalt and it became my wonder medicine. I have not had a migraine now in nearly 18 months (something in my neck has moved to relieve the pressure) but I still take Maxalt when nothing else will get rid of a bad headache after all night pain last night, it was gone in 10 minutes when I finally took it this morning. I wish I had known about it decades ago, none of the other triptans worked for me.",
                    "Life changing, I love this medicine.",
                    "This is an amazing medicine that I can not live without. No side effects and completely knocks put the pain. Only once or twice did I need a second dose. It's a life saver. My insurance still covers it so I am lucky.",
                    "I have had migraines for about 12 years. Maxalt is the only drug that works and it works fast. Only problem is my insurance will only pay for 10 a month and when my cluster headaches come I eat through them like candy.",
                    "I have been taking Maxalt for migraines for the past five years. This medication is the only one I have found that really takes care of the migraine and any residual headache. The generic ones don't work for me. ",
                    "My migraines started on April 2 2016, I have had a constant headache since then, with the 13 migraines, after a CT scan in my neck, I have a long which needs to be removed, which could be the root cause for this ongoing headache however finally I was prescribed maxalt today after almost 4 months of suffering headaches and migraines,and taking other pain relief, icing it, quiet rooms, limiting bright light stimulation ,msiisng out on family and friend events and I cannot believe the difference it's made. I don't like taking medications, I try to do things naturally, think this really really helped, and I have so much relief. Kudos to the angel who told me about it from Medicare, while we were trying to sort out my card going missing",
                    "Maxalt was a wonderful medication for two years, then its effectiveness rapidly diminished. My unforeshadowed migraines feature very mild headaches; instead, I first lost my sense of balance, then my lunch, and then the desire to live for the next three hours. Although I was on a migraine-suppressing tricyclic and metroprolol, migraines would punch through two to eight times a month. Maxalt shutdown such migraines within 20 minutes-no side effects. (NOTE: Maxalt did not suppress the rare aura). After further adjustment of my daily medicines, my rescue medicine became Relpax  2 Aleve.",
                    "Tried some samples of Maxalt and while it got rid of my (minor in this case) migraine, I did experience a side effect that made me more than a bit nervous. I experienced numbness in my left hand and arm. My doctor told me to immediately stop using it. I'm a bit saddened that I can't continue on Maxalt as it did get rid of my migraine and definitely worked better than Imitrex, but not worth the risk of the side effect I experienced.",
                    "I had no luck with this medicine. I have tried a few different migraine medicines: Maxalt, Imitrex, Treximet, Fiortal, Indocin, Vicodin, and Percocet. I have suffered from migraines for 4 years, however I am able to recognize the signs before an attack. I attempted to take the Maxalt at the first sign of the migraine and nothing happened. On the other hand, I tried Treximet and had WONDERFUL results. Treximet is expensive, but if you have a healthcare plan that covers it, it works wonders (assuming you catch the migraine early). I am now on a daily dose of Topamax that has drastically cut the number of severe migraines per month .",
                    "I get hormonal migraines, about 3 a month. Just got the dissolvable tablet and tried it twice. Worked both times in about 30 minutes. I get pretty drowsy, but I get drowsy when taking Excedrin and Midol. Both times I used it, I had already taken an OTC and it hadn't worked. Next time I'll skip the OTC and just take this. ",
                    "Fantastic drug! Works every time within half an hour. Feel a little strange for around 30 minutes after taking it, but no other side effects. Highly recommend it as it's the only thing that works for my migraines",
                    "Maxalt almost always gets rid of my migraine with one pill. It does make me sleepy so I take it near bedtime. When I wake up, I am groggy for up to 6 hours. That is the only side effect I have experienced. If I am having what I call a migraine marathon (up to five days) I alternate taking Maxalt and Imitrex.",
                    "I have had migraines since my teenage years and am currently 49 years old. I sometimes go for long periods of time with no migraines, but then I can have migraine and accompanying neck pain that goes on for 2 days or more.  I've been on Fiorinal, then Fioricet, and just recently, Maxalt. Recently, I asked my Dr about having a different medication that would be legal to take to Europe, as Fioricet is banned in at least some, if not all, countries in Europe. Since another Dr had previously tried prescribing Maxalt, he had me try this. It WORKS. I find it works better and faster than other meds, and I don't feel woozy when taking it.  Tricare allows 18 pills per 45 day period before another refill.",
                    "I have used Maxalt for the past 7 years and I swear by it. If I feel a migraine coming on I put my melt into my mouth and I am free and clear in less then 15 minutes. Some people call this medicine Migraine Gold. To me it is a lifesaver.",
                    "I have had migraines for over 20 years. They were always debilitating and would last for days. I would literally pull my hair to relieve some of the pain. I went to all kinds of doctors to find out the cause, none took me seriously. Finally one doctor did and prescribed Maxalt as needed. She is my hero! When I feel a migraine coming on, I let a Maxalt melt in my mouth and in a few minutes, the migraine is forgotten. I have not had ANY side effects!",
                    "Have had migraine for 33 years. Experienced first one after giving birth for the first time. Migraines are very severe and symptoms include non stop vomiting, lack of balance, loss of sensation, sensitivity to light, sound, etc. Rizatriptan works for a migraine attack which is not so severe. It has to be taken immediately. I usually lie down quietly for 20 minutes after taking it and then it works. It does not completely get rid of the headache, but suppresses it. This allows you to get on with your day. It makes me very tired, and makes my body feel heavy. Reactions are sometimes slower, so don't drive. If it does not work within 20-30 minutes, then it won't. ",
                    "I used to take the Maxalt in pill form and these work 2x as fast. I took one today at the first sign of a headache and it stopped it in it's tracks in just under 15 minutes. The pill used to take 30 and often the headache had time to bloom and get bad by then. They didn't immediately get rid of the nausea I get, but it went away in about 20 min after it stopped the bloom. I rated these as a 9 because of the taste. They taste a bit like a peppermint candy that's gone bad, but it's bearable and only lasts for about 5 seconds. I usually wash the flavor away with coffee - I like to back up anything I take for a headache with a good dose of caffeine. These will be replacing my Maxalt pills even if they do taste awful.",
                    "Rizatriptan has enabled me to control my headaches and continue a near normal life.",
                    "I have suffered with migraine since I was 12 yr old, and I'm now in my 50's. I've had every head exam and test possible as well as tried a myriad of medications over the years for treatment. From taking preventive type things daily to treating the pain only during the headache. Nothing has given me the swift relief as this drug. It seems to give me complete relief within 30-40 minutes, without any side effects (that I've noticed). I took immitrex for years with little relief and horrible side effects. It would make me feel dizzy, weird and always made me nauseous. So I stopped taking it. Now with the Maxalt, I'm thrilled to know I can take it without worry of unwanted side effect. Thank you Maxalt! Finally migraine relief! ",
                    "Migraines since I was 15, now in my 40's. Identified as menstrual migraines in my early 30's after 1st child, up to 5 days of migraines every 26 days. Nothing worked before, but started taking rizatriptan 9 months ago. It works every time, no side effects. I have my life back. Amazing. Recommend making a mentrual and migraine diary before going to the doctor.",
                    "Maxalt has less side effects, for me, than other Migraine Medication. Previously I have been on the Maxalt 5 but needed to go up to the Maxalt 10 which helps relieve the pain more completely. I tried many other medicines, and this has been the best for me, I believe it is different for every person. My nausea does increase on this medication, but no chest heaviness as with other medicines.",
                    "For me Maxalt is a miracle drug. I have tried almost everything OTC, and nothing worked. Excedrin worked for awhile, then after a few weeks, it stopped working. I can always count on Maxalt to get rid of my migraines. I usually feel relief within an hour of taking it. That being said ,this drug is very expensive. Even with insurance and taking the generic version, I am still out of pocket about $50 a box, and they only give you 12 pills. Sometimes I have 3 or 4 migraines in a week, so this can get really expensive. It works wonders for me though, so unfortunately it's a necessary expense.",
                    "Didn't work for me. I had serious allergic reaction. My tongue swelled up, my cheeks were going numb and had to take Benadryl within 30 minutes of taking this medicine.",
                    "I took it when I was felt a migraine coming on and I experienced dizziness, memory loss, shakiness and a fever. I had used it before with no problems.",
                    "Good relief without being too wiped out",
                    "I have suffered from migraines since I was 15 , and am now 42. Maxalt has changed my life ! I used to be in agony for up to 3 days , but now at the first sign of an attack I take one , very rarely I have had to take another one a few hours after that if it started to come back . It can sometimes make me drowsy, but other times I have no side effects , just relief that there is something that actually works . I'm in Australia, so a pack of 4 costs me $25 .",
                    "Maxalt saved my life! It is the only medicine that works for me when have a migraine attack, I swear by it and carry it with me always just in case. It literally gave me back my life, I was ill for days that ran into weeks that went into months. It was shocking, I felt suicidal with having no life and one day was sitting in my doctors room sobbing begging him to help me, and he prescribed me rizatriptan (maxalt). I love it!!",
                    "Usually the migraine wakes me up at night with the pain beginning at the base of my head. I keep the rizatriptan on my bedside table and I take it immediately. When I wake in the morning the pain is gone. Before I would wake with the pain, and it would linger for days with hardly no relief. I works great for me.",
                    "I have had no side effects to date, and the medicine quickly relieves symptoms. Best medication I have taken for treatment of migraines.",
                    "It works rather well but puts me to sleep for about 3 hours. I am still trying to find a migraine drug that does not put me to sleep. ",
                    "I have had migraines for over 30 years. Have tried everything. This works the best almost every time. I'd say 9 out of 10 times it cures the migraine and is a winner in my book.",
                    "I take Maxalt 10mg ODT when my Imitrex fails. Maxalt rarely fails and is actually my back up plan but has lately been my go to since Imitrex has stopped working completely. Maxalt is great! It works within an hour of taking it and I have little to no side effects. I give it a 9 because it does make me shake and if I take two, it will make me feel washed out the next day. Of course, all of this is an even trade for killing a migraine. Overall, great and effective drug!",
                    "Maxalt has really changed how I felt about my migraines. Before I was prescribed Maxalt, I would suffer terribly, taking only OTC medications which \"never\" helped much. Now when I feel those tell-tale signs of a migraine coming on (I do not experience any \"aura\"), I take a Maxalt (and sometimes some ibuprofen, too) and I know my migraine will be gone within the hour! And I'm not sleepy.",
                    "Maxalt is great. Once I can tell my headache is starting I take the pill. Usually in less than 30-60 minutes I forget that my head was hurting and I am able to work for 8-12 hours, smometimes longer. I agree with another comment: it gives no side effects like a rapid heart rate or chest pain. After having surgery I got spinal meningitis which started my migranes when I was 34 years old. Now at 48 I am thankful for Maxalt.",
                    "When I took a 10 mg dose it made me nauseous and super high, and now three days later I am still nauseaous and have had to call out of work because ive been feeling like im going to vomit if i stand up. I look to try and function as normal when i take abortive migraine medication, this one has made me feel worse. At least I can actually go to work when I have just a migraine.",
                    "I have had migraines since I was 9 so for 22 years now. I tried Imitrex nasals with no results. My hero of a doctor prescribed Maxalt 8 years ago and I can manage my life now. I don't have any side effects from it although it wouldn't matter since I now get relief! I have found migraine medicines are hit or miss for many so I'm beyond pleased I found a hit. I recommend Maxalt to anyone that will listen.",
                    "I am 34 years old and have suffered migraines on and off since I was about 10 years old. This is the first medication that has helped me. It great that it is a wafer and easy to take as vomiting is perhaps what stops other medications from working? Thank you maxalt, I love you!",
                    "When I was about 23, I started getting horrific migraines out of nowhere that would incapacitate me for days at a time. My neurologist couldn't find anything wrong and I tried several medications (some would take at least 12 hours to have an effect). The only medication that ever successfully treated my migraines was Maxalt and it pretty much gave me my life back. It would still take at least an hour to work but it was really a life changer. Ultimately, I sought an ENT and after I had sinus surgery (and corrected my deviated septum) in 2011, my migraines never returned. But if they ever did come back, I would be running to Maxalt as my savior again!",
                    "43 yo female migraines since 2nd grade. Some are with aura most are without. I get pain in my Left scapula that eventually radiates into the base of my skull through to my Left eye. If taken right away, I get almost total relief in 20-40 minutes. If I wait longer, it may take over an hour to work. Works over 90 percent of the time averaging 12 headaches per month. Side effects for me are a tightening sensation in my neck (where the arteries are on either side) then a \"floaty\" sensation. The pain goes away and I'm left tired, yawning frequently and a little fuzzy minded, but able to function much better than with the migraine. I've tried imitrex, zomig, midrin, and rx pain relievers. Maxalt has worked by far the best for me.",
                    "I went to see a headache specialist yesterday, and she recommended I take this for my migraines, which occur about 2-3 times a month. Of course, I woke up this morning with one. The tabs taste pretty bitter but when your head hurts, you don't really care. Just wash it down with water once it's done dissolving. Within half an hour it had subsided. As somebody who is used to suffering through them for 2 days, this is truly amazing.",
                    "Just took some for the first time 10 minutes ago and my migraine is ALREADY subsiding. Helps a lot more to put it under your tongue so it'll go into your blood stream quicker. ",
                    "Maxalt has saved me from migraines. It tends to make me a little drowsy, but that is a plus for me. I just lay down to take a nap, and when I wake up, the migraine is gone. This is also a plus at night as I could not sleep with migraines. The pounding and the pain would keep me up all night. Highly recommend this to anyone suffering from migraines. The drowsiness is not so bad that if I needed to stay awake I would be unable to.",

                    "I have had migraines since I was 11. When people say they are not hereditary...they are wrong. My grandma, mom, sisters and brothers all have them they did not even skip a generation.. my daughter and nieces as well get them. My physician calls mine sinus migraines. I get stomach pain, vomiting, an aura, light sensitivity. They had me on demerol, Percocet, phenergan, imitrex, nothing helped. I have been on maxalt a few years and the one thing I have noticed is that i get pain around the upper jaw area just under the ear...then all of a sudden like the snap of a finger all pain is gone 15 to 25 min. It makes me drowsey. I wake up from my nap feeling great but real thirsty.",
                    "Yesterday was my first time when I took Maxalt-MLT to cure my migraine. My doctor prescribed this drug six months ago but all those months I had no incidence of a migraine. Yesterday was again after my weight lifting workout. I only get migraines after a workout the last years. I always get aura for about 20 minutes before a headache begin. That is good the doctor said because I can take Maxalt faster before the pain begins. My first impression is that the aura lasted about 15 minutes and the pain was bearable in a scale of ten I would say 6.5 compared to other times that reaches 9 -10. The first 10 minutes, I was feeling a little bit weird and little dizzy. After 90 minutes the migraine got away, I think it needs about 90 minutes to act",
                    "I have suffered with severe menstrual migraines for 25+ years to the point where I fantasize about amputating my head. I was on Imitrex (made me very sleepy), Relpax (worthless) , generic (even worse). Maxalt is my go to medicine. Unfortunately its a fight with the insurance company to get regular refills. They are trying to force me to take a generic. I used to get 12 tablets and they changed it to 9- which 9 is not enough. When I run out I cannot help but pray for the day I get a refill fearing I will get a migraine before that time. When the refill day comes, I stalk my pharmacy on the phone until it is ready. Ugh...talk about \"drug-seeking\" !",

                    "I find Maxalt Wafers amazing. I get a little tightness in my throat but apart from that no side effects and they work within I/2 an hour. In fact it feels like a huge weight has been lifted off me. They are expensive but worth it.",
                    "Tried Imitrex and Relpax first, but had bad heart-squeezing and neck-squeezing side effects. Tried Maxalt and did not have that problem. It usually takes away the migraines, but can take 1-2 hours to get relief. I'm also very fatigued after the pain goes away, which makes daytime onset of migraines a hassle. Also for the 1-2 hours I am waiting for it to work, the pain actually intensifies until suddenly it lets go and the blood vessels in my head feel cold. Strange, but true.",
                    "Within half an hour, the headache has totally subsided. sometimes need a second dose. It does cause my skin to feel sensitive to heat and my throat feels tight for about 2 hours but the headache and all symptoms are totally gone. Brilliant",
                    "Today was my first time taking Rizatriptan and the fact that I am able to write this review just hours after the onset of a migraine is amazing because normally I would be completely down for the count for at least a whole day with a migraine. So here is my experience: I have taken countless meds before including Imitrex with terrible side effects and zero relief so naturally I was skeptical about this new med. I took it as soon as I knew that this was going to be a particularly bad migraine. The only side effect I had was sleepiness, no \"heart attack\" feeling as I had experienced with Imitrex. I fell asleep within 15 min of taking Rizatriptan and woke up 2 hours later completely migraine free.",
                    "This pill is like a magic. I just noticed that the pill works in minutes for me and I feel a bit dizziness and like a burning head and then the pain is gone. Today I got a early migraine and I was able to use the MLT and work kind of slowly but it stopped the pain in time. But I still feel very sensitive to light. Great medication ask your doctor for Maxalt or Maxalt-MLT.",
                    "As you may know, migraines are extremely debilitating even when trying to perform most menial tasks let alone professional responsibilities. I tried Maxalt for the first time today approximately 20 minutes after my first aura and it actually works. I am happily surprised! I have yet to experience any side effects. However, lets be honest, I'd be tolerant of almost anything besides a migraine - which feels like a freight train chugging through my head.",
                    "Must take within 20 minutes of onset. The longer you wait, the longer it takes to work. Keep it in your pocket/wallet at all times. For me, it is a lifesaver.",
                    "My experience was mixed. I took Maxalt MLT as soon as I had my usual \"Aura\". It worked within 30 minutes. The aura was gone and I never did get a migraine. However, within an hour I had a severe angina attack and had to take my nitro twice to relieve the pain. Nitro glycerin gives you a headache, so I think I'd rather have the migraine than the chest pain! My daughter took it and had a wonderful experience, took the pain away within 30 minutes and no side effects at all. I guess I won't be taking it again. Too bad, it worked on the migraine.",
                    "Maxalt has helped me so much. My migraines get so intense and the minute I take Maxalt I start to feel relief.",

                    "1 Maxalt malt usually starts working in 30 to 45 minutes for me. Within an hour I'm able to continue my day. I have very frequent migraines and have used Maxalt for many years. No real side effects except a bit of drowsiness. And it is very expensive. Insurance does not cover the whole cost.",

                    "I've always had 3 day migraines. MaxAlt will take it away in about 35 minutes. Sometimes I would have to take another one (dissolved in my mouth) the next day. I cannot stress enough how much I love this medicine. I come from days when Darvon's were given for migraines, they didn't do anything but zombie you with the pain. I thank the scientist who figured out how to control whatever it is that is being controlled. Of course, it IS too expensive. Without insurance, I would have to suffer, as they are about $32 per pill!",
                    "I've had chronic migraines for around 12 years. I take 5mg and it usually takes care of my headache. It makes my neck ache a little but the relief from the horrible symptoms of a migraine are well worth it. I've tried other triptans but this one works best. The generic is very inexpensive.",
                    "I have just started experiencing migraines and thought my life was over at first. Nothing was working and I couldn't be a wife to my husband or mom to my five year old daughter. Since starting this miracle drug as we call it, I am myself again. The only side effect I am experiencing is having to pee a lot. I don't know if I am alone in that matter, but I would gladly substitute spending sometime in the potty then spending a whole day in the ER or in the bedroom in the dark.",
                    "The Maxalt-MLT self-dissolving tab worked wonders for me. At a time when my doctor was trying to determine the most-effective treatment form my migraine headaches, this medicine was a God-send. My doc gave me samples of various triptan meds and I was to try one out at the onset of every migraine. Of the 5-6 different samples I was given, Maxalt-MLT worked the fastest & had the least amount of side-effects. I was amazed. Unfortunately, my insurance would not cover it and I had to settle with sumatriptan. Sumatriptan worked, but it took about an hour and I just remember feeling really weird after taking it. Anyway, if/when my migraines start again- Maxalt is what I want.",

I then started trying a bunch of preventative drugs, beta blocker, calcium blockers and ssri drugs. Finally found one that works fairly well, but along with that I use maxalt as a rescue drug which I still take 6+ times a month. It's a good drug and is effective. I have always noticed the migraines redoubles its efforts before leaving after I take it. I also notice it makes me very sleepy and foggy. I don't like to take it at work because of that. 9 times out of 10 it works, but there are still times it does nothing for me. Some is better than none in my world though. I take a generic due to cost.",
                    "I have suffered from migraines Since An Auto accident in 2009, sometime as many as 15 a month. I was prescribed Maxalt this past year (after trying a whole bag of other medicines). It has given me my life back... within thirty minutes after taking Maxalt the symptoms decrease by 50% and are gone within an hour. Several side effects, very drowsy and increased nausea but after several hours of sleep all is good.",
                    "I have tried OTC migraine medicines, and three other prescriptions. Maxalt is by far the best, and MLT makes it nearly perfect. The only bad side effect I have is that the back of my neck gets sore. Maxalt does this far less than Zomig, and taking Advil Liquigels or Vicodin with the Maxalt MLT helps quite a bit. My ideal treatment for a migraine is to take Maxalt MLT and Advil Liquigels, then lay down with something cold on my forehead. Once I am able to doze, I sleep until I wake up on my own. I can't believe how much better I feel after the nap. At work, I just take the two medicines. It takes me longer to feel better, but makes my headache much more bearable.",

                    "I would definitely try this for migraines if you haven't already. I had used Imitrex pills for a few years and suddenly they stopped working. I tried a couple different pills and then found Maxalt. The only problem with the pills is that I have to take them right away. Once the migraine has started they don't take away all the pain, only like 60% for me. I was on Maxalt for a few years, then put on Cymblata and didn't have migraines for 2 years on that, but then they came back and Maxalt didn't help me... Now I use Imitrex Statdose because I never catch my migraine until it's terrible but the injections get rid of the pain fast!",

Not only that, but I've been taking it for 3 years now and I used to get 2 or 3 migraines a month, and now I only get about 1 every 2 months! Maxalt has been like a miracle for me...I no longer have to suffer with horrible headaches!! Additionally, I have not experienced any side effects!",
                    "One Maxalt-MLT usually gets rid of the migraine in an hour or less. Occasionally, I need another one 2 hours later to really get rid of it for good. Rarely, even the second one did not quite do it for me. But this is still the most effective medicine that's worked for me, after trying 8-10 other medicines (over-the-counter and prescription).",

                    "I am a 35yo female and had my first migraine at 16yo just after giving birth to my firstborn. Over the years, particularly after each baby, the symptoms have become worse and are always experienced during menstruation. Recently codeine products that would normally help are not even touching the sides of the pain, and I have been experiencing increasing levels of sickness that anti-nausea tablets don't have any impact on. But yesterday a friend gave me a maxalt wafer because I couldn't function under the intensity of the sickness and pain. At first it didn't seem to do anything. But after maybe an hour to 90 minutes and I was no longer sick, nor was I in pain!! It was like a miracle!! How ever vision was slightly more blurred than usual.",
                    "Took this for the first time last night. Worked as well as Relpax (which my insurance no longer covers). I could actually get a good night's sleep!",
                    "Works well for my migraines. For me, I start feeling better in 20 minutes or so, and am completely back to normal within two hours.",
                    "Maxalt does work. Usually Fioricet works but when my migraine becomes worse Fioricet doesn't do anything and Maxalt does the trick!",
                    "This is the best sos pill for migraines, I barely have side-effects from it and if I melt it in my mouth it acts much faster killing my migraine in less than 20 minutes. I cannot imagine my life without Rizatriptan !! It gave me my life back!",
                    "I've been using maxalt for about 6 years (give or take) and it's about the only medication I've found that really gets rid of my migraines. The MLT version is great when your stomach's so upset you can't keep down a pill, too. The only side effect I've ever had is a tingling feeling in my shoulders. Well worth the co-pay!",
                    "I started taking Maxalt after horrible experiences with Imitrex. I had almost all the same side effects: extreme nausea, dizziness, falling asleep, and a general out of it feeling the rest of the day. But the worst part is that it did absolutely nothing for my migraine. I am just glad that I had samples so I didn't get stuck paying for a prescription I would not use. ",
                    "I have suffered migraines since childhood 2-5 migraines a year. Then at about 38 I started getting these horrible severely debilitating headaches 1-3 times a year and the headaches would last up to weeks with intermittent increase in severity. I was finally diagnosed with cluster headaches and prescribed Rizatriptan. If I feel the onset it diminishes the intensity and duration. I have been using it for 2 years and very grateful.",
                    "My first time taking it. I have complex partial seizures and my aura has changed to where I now have migraine headaches afterwards. We are doing test to rule out other problems but this medicine helped me more than anything so far. Still have that groggy feeling afterwards but I can deal with that. Just do not know how I can take it should I have to at work since I work in a call center 10 hours a day with constant calls.",
                    "I have used maxalt four times in the last three months. The first time it worked fine and it was gone in a few hours but had heart racing.  The second migraine I was concerned about the side effects but gave a second chance. I had severe throbbing in my head like it was going to explode and then suddenly the migraine broke.  My third attempt my migraine was so severe that I had to take a second dose for relief! I find that if I take it on the onset it works but still light headache and felt numbing sensation.  My fourth today no relief after 2nd dose. Took 3rd after 4 hours but still feeling migraine. Had slight heart racing and throbbing pain. I may continue to see if this is right meds. If not, then I think there's no hope for me!",
                    "Works fast limited side effects.",
                    "This is the only migraine medicine that consistently gets rid of my migraines. I've tried Zomig, Imitrex, and many others - but Maxalt gets it gone in 15-30 minutes and I'm back, up and ready to get back into life. I can even take one at work and just rest my eyes at my desk until it kicks in. Never could do that before.",
                    "This medicine is a miracle drug. I have migraines that last for 3 days and until my doctor prescribed maxalt I could not get rid of them or function properly. Now I take a pill and within 30 min it is gone. My life is so much nicer I am up moving around exercising and actually living my life like a normal person.",
                    "I call this my \"miracle drug\". I had been suffering from constant migraines since I was 9 years old. I am now 64. They used to tell my parents I was \"high-strung\" and had \"tension headaches\". I was never diagnosed with migraine until I was about 48 years old. This is the ONLY drug that has ever stopped my migraine (of course...you have to take it immediately at the onset, as with all migraine meds). I had lost so many days of my life to the extreme pain/nausea and impaired vision/speech/general functionality before I discovered rizatriptan. Quite literally, I thank God for leading someone to develop this and for someone prescribing it for me.",
                    "I am a 42 yr old male and I have been susceptible to migraines since I was very little. My worst childhood memories are of me moaning and rocking back and forth in agony on my bed when suffering from my very first migraines as an 8 or 9 yr old child. I too have not had any luck with Imitrex and some of the other medicines mentioned in this post. My insurance gives me terrible problems when I am trying to get a migraine prescription filled. As it is right now I have figured out that Axert and Maxalt are the only two medicines that I know will work for certain when I am afflicted and totally incapacitated by migraine headaches. The problem with Axert is that my insurance will only allow a monthly script of 6 tablets at $10/tablet. Maxalt does it for less dollars.",
                    "Migraine, the word can't convey the impact on life. For me, a typical one lasted about 36 hours, followed by another 24 hours of \"hangover\". Somewhere during the 36 hour duration, would be 12 hours of hell. I've used Maxalt MLT about 10-12 times over the last 6 months. It has worked every time; I take one when I sense a migraine is starting, and it just doesn't \"blossom\". I have no side effects, no nausea, and no drowsiness. Sometime in the next 20-30 minutes I'll realize the apprehension, tension and other precursors to the migraine have just disappeared. Migraines took too much of my life, and at their worst, pushed depression to the edge of suicide; it's good to have a normal life back.",
                    "Maxalt is the only migraine medicine I have tried, and it works well for me. When I take it early (before it becomes a full-bloomed migraine), it works within maybe 30 minutes, completely getting rid of the pain. I do have some side effects: most of the time, I feel a tightening of the throat for about 15 minutes after taking it (my doctor had warned me about that), and if I happen to be a bit tired when taking it, I feel a bit dizzy for a couple of hours. But it sure beats a 24-hour migraine.",
                    "I have tried different medicines for migraines, all just calmed it down a little, it just had to run its 3 day duration. Am seeing another Dr & she put me on Maxalt yesterday, my migraine was gone within an hour of taking it. I just want to go back and hug her because after 5 yrs of trying I just accepted my pain. It made me drowsy, but I will take drowsy over pain any day.",
                    "Amazing! I took Imitrex for years and it didn't really help. Maxalt is the only medication that works for me to continue my busy life. I have had hormonal migraines since I was 12. Tried everything from pain medicines (temporary fix) to nasal to shots. I love Maxalt!",
                    "I had my doubts that this would work -- it was fantastic! within 15-20 minutes the pain that felt like my skull was in a vise disappeared. I am a horse trainer and I work full time on my own farm, and I can't function when I have a migraine, ( 4-5 attacks a month, 24-48 hours each time) Maxalt 10-mg was a miracle for me. I don't have to put all the work on my daughter, and my temper has become much more even. The anxiety of worrying about a migraine attack has helped enormously, for my emotional state, too. **side note** I had a Mirena IUD and had it removed, I believe this contributed to the attacks, so hopefully in 4-6 weeks I won't need the Maxalt, either.",
                    "This works wonders for me, but makes me a little nutty for awhile. Better than migraines by a long shot. They try and make it taste minty, but still a little foul tasting.",
                    "Works within minutes usually. Have not noted any side effects with it although I do not care for taste. After it melts and is gone, I drink water to get taste out of my mouth.",
                    "Maxalt relieves my migraine in 1 hour however it does make me sleepy. I love the fast dissolve feature. I will have to stop using it however due to the rising cost not covered by my insurance company. I am now hoping Imitrex will work as well.",
                    "I have used this medication for over 3 years now. Just recently I was told to take 2 instead of one since my migraines seem to be getting worse each time (I blame it on MS). Nothing else works for me. I can deal with the kids bickering. I carry this drug with me always! ",
                    "This medication always takes my migraine away. It is the only medicine that has done that for me. Sometimes I do get rebound headaches from the medicine, but I am pleased that I have finally found something to take the migraine away. I just wish I could find something to alleviate my migraines altogether because I get them way too often."

                    "//What is it?//Headache and migraine are different entities. Migraine is one of the most common and well characterized, but there are 14 broad categories that can be subdivided into more than 200 different forms. Migraine itself has about 20 different genres. In general, headaches are divided into two large groups: primary and secondary. Primary illnesses correspond to a disease, not reflecting other health problems and represent around 90% of the total. Secondary symptoms are symptoms of diseases of the nervous system or other organs of the human body. They can occur in cases of flu, alcohol poisoning or withdrawal, minor head trauma, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels) or a high blood pressure crisis. Migraine is a primary headache in which very intense episodes of pain occur interspersed with periods without symptoms. In general, it begins between the ages of 15 and 40, but it can appear in childhood or shortly after the first menstruation. If it appears for the first time after the age of 45, other causes must be excluded. Some of its characteristics are closely associated with the female reproductive cycle: higher prevalence after the first menstruation or during the menstrual period; occasional worsening due to taking birth control pills or hormone therapy; attenuation or disappearance during pregnancy or menopause. Before adolescence, migraines affect boys and girls equally. From then on, it is two to three times more common in females. It is estimated that 8% to 15% of individuals living in Western countries (including Portugal) suffer from this problem. The fact of reaching people in the productive phase implies large economic, social and family costs.//Symptoms//It appears recurrently, several times throughout life, but always with completely free intervals. If it occurs every day, it is probably overuse of painkillers or other medications. Drug abuse can convert a migraine into a chronic daily headache. There are people who preferably appear on the weekend. These crises can be precipitated by changes in sleep schedule, failure to eat breakfast, reduced stress or alcohol abuse. In these cases, it is important to consider a lifestyle change over the weekend. The symptoms are intense and often prevent work or study. The pain tends to be throbbing, worsening with physical exertion or head movements. In general, it affects only one side of the head, and is accompanied by nausea, vomiting, intolerance to light, noise and some smells. It is not mandatory that all of these elements are present simultaneously. And they can occur twice a week or just a few throughout a lifetime. During attacks, people seek a dark, quiet place to rest or fall asleep. An episode can last from a few hours to three days. Between attacks, there are usually no complaints. Some types of migraines may have more complex symptoms (with aura). These forms are less common, affecting around 15% of people with this problem, and include transient neurological symptoms, originating attributable to certain areas of the brain. The other signs are identical to those of migraine without aura. The most common auras are temporary vision disorders, in the form of loss of vision on one side of the visual field, blurred images, perception of bright points, geometric figures or bright zigzags. Other auras can be translated as tingling or numbness on one side of the face or one of the hands. There are people who have difficulty speaking or even temporary paralysis of their limbs, usually only on one side of the body. These changes last about 10 to 30 minutes and precede the pain. In children, migraines tend to be bilateral, less intense and of shorter duration. Vomiting and dark circles can be exuberant. Disturbances in sleep and meal schedules are common precipitating factors. Treating these crises is easier than in adults. Sleep usually gives good results. At these ages, the occipital location is not normal and, when present, requires a medical consultation. Likewise, the presence of headaches with morning vomiting or other unusual symptoms in very young children should be seen by a healthcare professional.//Causes//It is caused by a combination of brain processes: excitation/depression of cells, dilation of arteries and release of chemicals. People with migraine are more sensitive to certain stimuli, environmental or from their own body, that can trigger these brain processes. It is also thought that there is some genetic susceptibility. Some individuals can identify the signs of their attacks. The most common are cheese, chocolate, strawberries, seafood, wine, artificial sauces, changes in sleep patterns, stress, menstruation, fasting, physical exercise, and minor trauma. Others cannot identify them at all. People who drink coffee regularly may experience headaches when they stop this habit.//Diagnosis//The key to diagnosis lies in the clinical history, physical and neurological examination. Observation of the fundus is a very important part of these procedures. In some cases, it may be necessary to resort to computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to exclude other diseases.//Treatment//Migraines have no cure but can be controlled. There are medications and behaviors that can reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks. Symptomatic treatment, during acute periods, involves resting in a quiet, dark place. Pressure or cold can be applied to the area of \u200b\u200bpain. At this stage, analgesics, anti-inflammatories, antiemetics and triptans are very useful.//Prevention//People with migraines should create calendars that allow them to identify their symptoms and assess their impact on their quality of life. The first step in prevention is to identify and eliminate precipitating factors, whenever possible. In some cases, it is necessary to use daily medication to reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks, but there are no drugs specifically developed for their prevention. However, there are some drugs used in other contexts that have proven to be effective, such as beta-blockers, antidepressants or antiepileptics, and these should always be prescribed by a doctor.

                    "At 59 years of age have been suffering migraines since I was 21. Think I have tried every medication available in the UK. Maxalt is the only thing that has ever worked for me.Pain usually gone after 20 minutes, before I took Maxalt I could be in bed for 2 days rolling around in agony. Only side effects are tiredness and strangely It makes me sneeze just once as soon as I have taken it. Maxalt has completely changed my life. Fortunate to live in UK as I get it free on national health prescription.",
                    "I have had migraines since I was 12 yrs. Old, I am 67. As a child I just suffered all the time. When I was in my late 20's, fiorinal was the answer. It did help. There have been a couple of others (can't remember the name). Then imitrex came out. Didn't work. I did not find relief, even with addition of percocet until maxalt came out. Thank heavens. Mostly 20 days per month. I learned very quickly first sign for me is a slice of pain, then I immediately take the maxalt. Within a half hour, 99% gone. I have been so fortunate to have medicine coverage through private employer insurance with reasonable copay, otherwise it would affect my ability to support myself. I take over 12 meds per day..No interactions",
                    "Works within 2 hours but my migraine always returns the next day. I take the medication the next day - headache goes away within two hours - comes back the next day again. Medication works but I feel extremely tired and depressed for the three days. Insurance companies also limit me to 9 pills a month which adds to my stress.",
                    "This medication worked great for me to get rid of my headache. When I take it before I feel a bad migraine coming on, it alleviates it before it gets bad. My only complaint about this medication is I get really bad heart burn and I really do not sleep that well while I am on it. I guess you can%u2019t have everything.",
                    "I occasionally get migraine when I have been in stressful situations. It appears that my migraine are related to a deficit of serotonin. I also get migraines in stores that sell lots of cheap plastic items. This medication is 100% effective for me.",
                    "Puts me in nice restful deep sleep (normal 7hr night), walk up in morning migraine gone, with no hangover feeling that you would normally get if went to ER for a shot.",
                    "To me, this is the ONE medicine I can not live without. I have had to try others due to insurance, and none comes even close! Within 15-30 even the strongest, wanting to smash my head-in migraine will be totally gone! No side effects for me either. Never makes me tired, groggy or the medicated feeling. Taken on empty stomach while in college class and had no problems finishing the class and going home to play with the kids and not the mom who was hiding in a dark room with no noise allowed in the house.",
                    "Maxalt has worked wonders for me. When I have migraines I never feel like swallowing tablets, so the fact that I have the dissolving tablet is an absolute bonus. Before this medicine I was bedridden for days at a time, and after a migraine, my head always felt so heavy and like a bowling ball. Now however I am able to go to work the next day. I recommend it to every person I meet!",
                    "My daily headaches started after a ventricular assist device (VAD). Maxalt has worked beautifully in killing the pain. Occasionally I will wake up with a headache the following day, but not severe enough to warrant another dose. I am careful to avoid triggers so don't have to take this very often. I am grateful that I have this option since I am allergic to NSAIDs.",
                    "Very effective with no side effects (i.e. drowsiness). I've had mixed luck with other migraine medicines, but find Maxalt MLT to be consistently helpful.",
                    "I have suffered from migraines for at least 15 years and tried so many medications and therapies to help. Maxalt is the only thing that helps me. I have missed a day to three of work in a row from migraines and now do not have to miss any. It takes the pain away within an hour. I don't get any effects from the drug really, maybe a bit tired once and awhile. My only complaint is the wafer tastes pretty gnarly but it is worth it!",
                    "If taken at the start of a migraine this medicine works wonders . There are side effects such as dry mouth, tiredness, and joint aches. But as anyone who has migraines know that is a small price to pay for relief from the migraine itself.",
                    "I've suffered from Pure Menstrual Migraine for 4 years. Nothing I have tried to date has helped ease any of the migraine pain at all, which usually goes on for 3 days solid every month, le. Until now. I asked my dr if I could try Rizatriptan and he agreed. My warning sign that a migraine is on it's way is an ache down the left hand side of my face. Well, within the last hour I got that warning so took my first ever Rizatriptan dissove in the mouth tablet. Revolting! Utterly vile - like a really bad mint that went off years ago. However, rather than spit it out (since they are very expensive) I let it dissolve. Now 40 mins later I have no ache and no pain, and I hope that means that I will not get a mega-migraine! So far so good ..",
                    "I avoid drugs of all kinds and I'm a usually healthy person. After suffering years from horribly painful headaches that would leave me vomiting all day and totally out of it (I thought it was due to whiplash injury), my doctor prescribed Rizatriptan 10mg. It truly is a miracle drug for me. I use the melt-away tablets, and find the relief starts in about 15 minutes, and by 30 minutes, any headache is gone. I take them at the very beginning of symptoms. I do get sleepy, so I've learned that I can just take half a tablet, get the same result, and not feel so tired. I have had very slight jaw pain once or twice, and cutting back the dosage also alleviated that problem.",
                    "Since I was about 26 I have suffered from migraines (now 65) and tried everything from daily preventative meds, to expensive self injecting & very expensive medication, then cafegot suppositories with 3 aspro clear for the pain, I could spend hours and days feeling like dying and vomiting non stop, then there was a shortage of cafegot and that was hell, and finally they took it off the market, that is when my Dr. asked me to trial Maxalt wafers, at first I thought nothing could replace cafegot and I was very conscious of not taking ergotomine with rizatriptan. Maxalt is the best, it works within an hour, and so far after 4-5 years no side effects at all, and no more vomiting ever. Also I do not take any other drugs for anything, but Maxalt.",
                    "Maxalt is truly one of the most amazing migraine medications I have ever tried, and believe me, having migraines as a child and now at 52 years of age, there have been many. As a migrainer, we truly know what suffering is. Maxalt is the best, although, after losing my job 18 months ago and with no success of getting another, it is too expensive. From my understanding the patent expires in 2012. I truly hope the price goes down for those of us who cannot be without it.",
                    "43 yr old male.For me this is close to a miracle cure, it has given my life back. I have had stomach and esophagus lesions due to way too much aspirin/ ibuprofen/digesics/codeine trying to halt an attack. No more screaming in E.R rooms waiting for pethidine/morphine. No more thoughts off grabbing a drill to stop the throbbing pain. I actually have a life after 26 yrs of suffering 2-4 attacks a week each last up to 36 hrs each. Numerous preventive medicines didn%u2019t work. I am truly in debt to the manufacturers and the on call doctor who gave me to Maxalt. Takes about 40-90 minutes to work with a second dosage sometimes needed. My fear is the more i take it the less effective it will become as lately I need the second wafer.",
                    "Bad headaches. This medicine works like it says it should.",
                    "I am very greatful for Maxalt wafers as they help me get rid of my migraines, although the side effects of insane burning and jaw pain last and hour before, the wafer curing my migraine.  Half half if you can endure the pain, its wonderful",
                    "Wonder drug. I tried many others. Maxalt MLT works so quick and free of all the usual side effects. I can use Maxalt MLT and within 30-60 minutes return to normal activities free of the normal after migraine haziness. It has given me my life back. Many thanks to Dr. Z. for prescribing this.",
                    "This medication is labeled a wonder drug in my household. It is the last line of defense and treatment for migraine. However and very sadly I might add recently the copay my insurance company imposed is going to make it hard to take. Limited to 4 tablets per week (while they state all medicines are calculated at a monthly dose level) NOW a copay of $60 per script makes it $240 for each myself and my wife. We just can't afford this after paying $2400.00 monthly for the insurance coverage. We are being choked to death! If the medicine was covered properly under the contract we could handle the $60 copay per month but because they limit the medication to 3-4 tablets per week. ",
                    "I took it for the first time today. My migraine was gone within an hour; however, it made me really sleepy. Three hours later, I'm still very groggy. Next time, I think I'll stay home from work and sleep it off. But missing work is what I'm trying to avoid. I'm incredibly thrilled that my migraine is gone, though.",
                    "I have suffered from hormonal migraines since puberty and am now in my fifties. I tried every option the Doctor could offer but nothing helped until I found Maxalt Melt about ten years ago. I call them my magic pill as they can clear a migraine completely within an hour. Very occasionally I have to take a second dose. They work for me with minimal side effects and are worth every penny. I'm in the UK so can get them on prescription.",
                    "I use this medication to help my migraines. I used to take Relpax. I quit taking it because it was too expensive and the side effects were strong. I like this medication because my insurance covers most of it and it is very effective with little side effects. The only cons are the taste (a little minty but the end has a bitter taste), I seem to get different side effects each time I take it (very mild, includes some drowsiness and nausea), also in my experience you need to take this medication as soon as you feel the migraine coming on or you may find yourself taking two or three pills during the migraine every two hours to keep it gone. Overall I find it very cost friendly and effective. I will continue using this medication.",
                    "My Migraine did Not go away . It might have only marginally lessened it . I went to bed for two hours and have felt terrible all day . This medication made me very sleepy . I took a Second Wafer some hours later but there was Still No Improvement ! Now I cannot take any other migraine medication for a whole 24 hours. Which is far too long . I made the mistake of taking the second wafer when the first one wasn't helping. I already had Jaw Pain so reading that others get it as a side effect makes me wonder. It reminds me of Imigraine and I thought that useless. Sydney Australia 2015.05.18",
                    "I've had ever-worsening migraines since I was in my 40's (I'm now 73). When they started, all that was available were drugs like Fiorinal and other mind-scrambling drugs. Finally, the triptans came along and saved my life. I started with Imitrex and tried the various other triptans, but Maxalt was the most effective. I would like to share one important observation: When I first started taking triptans, I had very few side effects, and was able to function at a high-level job, run home with kids, etc. HOWEVER, as I got older, I realized that side-effects emerged which have only gotten stronger over time. e.g. fogginess, sleepiness, nausea, etc. -- so be aware that side-effects can increase with age. Still, Maxalt is a life-saver.",
                    "I have been taking Maxalt for a couple of years and it's the only migraine medicine that gets rid of the pain without making me sick. I have a couple of side effects: tingling in my jaw, neck, and spine and also it makes me have to pee a lot. ",
                    "I have suffered with cluster headaches since I was in my twenties. I am now 61 and still get them, sometimes every few months and sometimes I can go several years, but when they hit, the are debilitating and I never know how many days or weeks they will continue. My physician gave me a sample to try as I had been having these headaches almost everyday for 2 or more weeks. Within 30-45 minutes the pressure and pain were gone and my drooping, puffy eye looked normal again. I plan to ask my doctor if he can prescribe a larger quantity so I can take them during these lengthy episodes. I would love to be part of a study on the efficacy of this drug on cluster headache patients. Wish I had known about it sooner.",
                    "This Med is nothing short of a miracle. Quick acting and has broken the cycle this making frequency decrease. Wish my insurance wasn't so tight on filling. I've waited years fora generic & they finally covered 4 pills. Woo hoo! Cheaper than an ER visit that doesn't even work as quickly. I would recommend this product to everyone who mentions the word migraine.",
                    "I love Maxalt my doctor gave it to me about 4 months ago. After years of no relief my migraine was gone in 20 minutes! I admit I get extremely sleepy after I take it but a 1 hour nap and I'm back in business. Much better then four days of blinding pain that's for sure it is very expensive but I contacted my local clinic and they had me fill out some forms and received a free 6 month supply at which time I can reapply. You can also try contacting the company online they may help depending on your income.",

                    "I had a migraine for 7 days. When I finally couldn't take the pain anymore, I went to my doctor and was prescribed this medication. Within 20 minutes my migraine was gone. Its heaven sent. You have to take it as soon as you feel a migraine coming on. Also it makes me very sleepy. But almost all medications do that to me. If you haven't taken it ...get it. It will solve your migraine problems.",
                    "OMG! This stuff is a life changer! I suffer from migraines at least once or twice a week. Makes me feel a little nauseated for a few minutes but within 20 minutes my headache and nausea is gone. Now I have to figure out how to get more then my insurance will allow me to get in a month.... They only allow 9 a month :-/ Way better than Imatrex!",
                    "Aside from a slight burning sensation where my migraine is located this drug works wonderfully. Better than any nasal spray or OTC drug I've ever tried.",
                    "I've had migraines since I was 11 and was first prescribed Maxalt when I was 17. It's wonderful. I take it as soon as I start to notice the signs of a migraine and about 70% of the time the first dose does the job, within an hour or less. Occasionally I take a second dose if the symptoms haven't gone after 2-3 hours. Very occasionally it doesn't work at all. It has improved my life enormously. I evangelize about it. My migraines used to last up to 3 days - now I get a unkillable one only once or twice a year. Side effects for me are (as someone else has mentioned) one sneeze within a few minutes of taking it, a little drowsiness and eventually a little euphoria (though maybe that's a rational response to knowing the migraine has gone).",
                    "I've had migraines for years and have been given everything for them. I also believe I've gone through every triptan that one could imagine. This medicine has been phenomenal in relieving really tough migraine pain. Within 30 minutes I can get relief. Also, I like that you can get it in sublingual form. Sometimes my migraines are so bad that I'm constantly throwing up everything. When I'm nauseous the sublingual form is wonderful, however, it also comes in a tiny tablet. I keep this with me at all times. It has saved me from multiple hospital visits in the past. Hope this helps!",

                    "I have had migraines since I was a teenager (I'm now 42.) After trying almost everything, including OTC meds and other tryptans that didn't work, I am so glad my Dr gave me Maxalt .It works every time. Very rarely I need a second dose, but I know it will always work.This drug has saved me from calling in sick to work on many occasions, and I can even take it at work if I need it, as I don't experience any side effects from it. My only complaint is the expense. Even with insurance and using generic, my copay is still $31 for only 12 pills that are supposed to last me a month.If I refill the prescription before that month ,the copay goes up to $50. Sometimes I will get 3 or 4 migraines a week, so 12 pills is just not enough.This is a great drug though.",
                    "Maxalt, especially the melt aways are simply amazing. I've had to take them off and on for years. (Going quite awhile without migraines.) Then the generic was introduced. I've tried two different kinds. They are not the same! The generic makes my headache get worse right after I take it, then about 1/2 hour later it might work. I'm usually asleep soon after that. I searched for the 'real' deal again and it is as I remembered. Started working RIGHT away with very little side effects. Maybe sore throat. Such a miracle for me. It is expensive at times depending on whim of insurance coverage, but I will pay to have pain go away!",
                    "I've suffered from severe, debilitating migraines since I was 30 (I'm now 49). I've been prescribed everything under the sun but Maxalt is the ONLY medication that works for me. First of all, it dissolves under my tongue so I know that if I vomit, I won't throw it up. Secondly, and especially if I take it at the first sign of a migraine, it usually only takes about 30 minutes to kick in and fully eradicate my migraine. Imitrex and the others I've been on haven't worked or haven't worked as completely as Maxalt. I consider it a life saver.",
                    "Tried a sample of Maxalt that the doctor gave me for the first time today and could not believe the results. Within 1 hour the migraine was gone and within 2 hours I was back to normal and working. This is truly a miracle medicine for me. I also take 100 mg of Topamax daily so that has really cut down on the migraines but again the Maxalt was a lifesaver for me today. I am worried about my copay after reading some of the post on here but I do have to say that I think it will be worth it.",
                    "I live in the UK so I get Maxalt free on NHS. I suffer from migraines a lot, and before I started taking Maxalt I would get minimum of 4 migraines a month sometimes more. These would last a whole 7 days with the first 24 hrs being hell! Its hard to explain to non-sufferers how painful these are. All of you will know what I am on about. Couldn't believe how amazing Maxalt was, didn't even reach the painful stage but it was totally gone. Works every time straight away for me. I take it along with codeine also prescribed. Tiny side effect, cramps in tummy but goes away within 30 mins. Worth it though!",
                    "Works nearly every time on one dose. The second dose will make you fell washed out for the next 24 hours. Life is normal with this drug as it works in about an hour. I am in the UK so NHS covers the costs of the drug.",
                    "Maxalt has worked wonders for me! I've suffered from migraines for several years now and Maxalt has been the only thing that can stop them. When I feel a migraine coming on I take one of the 10 mg dissolvable tablets and it soon disappears. Occasionally I do end up with a full-blown migraine (because I'm forgetful and don't always have Maxalt on me) and taking two doses helps it go away much more quickly than it would otherwise. Miracle!",

I didn't understand what I had, what set it off or why I had it. And the pain and all of the vomiting. EVERYTHING hurt. Any light, the slightest noise and any movement I made while in bed made the migraine worse and I'd start vomiting NON-STOP. The doctor prescribed Maxalt to me. I didn't even know they MADE medicines for migraines and I have to say I cannot be without it. But as the directions state, take AS SOON as you feel a migraine (not just a headache) coming on. Your body usually gives you signs, for me it's excessive yawning every few seconds and irritability.",

About 10 years ago I realized they only came from neck pain and chiropractic did not help. After an exceptionally bad reaction 3 years ago to Cafergot, I was prescribed Maxalt and it became my wonder medicine. I have not had a migraine now in nearly 18 months (something in my neck has moved to relieve the pressure) but I still take Maxalt when nothing else will get rid of a bad headache after all night pain last night, it was gone in 10 minutes when I finally took it this morning. I wish I had known about it decades ago, none of the other triptans worked for me.",

I don't like taking medications, I try to do things naturally, think this really really helped, and I have so much relief. Kudos to the angel who told me about it from Medicare, while we were trying to sort out my card going missing",
                    "Maxalt was a wonderful medication for two years, then its effectiveness rapidly diminished. My unforeshadowed migraines feature very mild headaches; instead, I first lost my sense of balance, then my lunch, and then the desire to live for the next three hours. Although I was on a migraine-suppressing tricyclic and metroprolol, migraines would punch through two to eight times a month. Maxalt shutdown such migraines within 20 minutes-no side effects. (NOTE: Maxalt did not suppress the rare aura). After further adjustment of my daily medicines, my rescue medicine became Relpax  2 Aleve.",
                    "Tried some samples of Maxalt and while it got rid of my (minor in this case) migraine, I did experience a side effect that made me more than a bit nervous. I experienced numbness in my left hand and arm. My doctor told me to immediately stop using it. I'm a bit saddened that I can't continue on Maxalt as it did get rid of my migraine and definitely worked better than Imitrex, but not worth the risk of the side effect I experienced.",
                    "I had no luck with this medicine. I have tried a few different migraine medicines: Maxalt, Imitrex, Treximet, Fiortal, Indocin, Vicodin, and Percocet. I have suffered from migraines for 4 years, however I am able to recognize the signs before an attack. I attempted to take the Maxalt at the first sign of the migraine and nothing happened. On the other hand, I tried Treximet and had WONDERFUL results. Treximet is expensive, but if you have a healthcare plan that covers it, it works wonders (assuming you catch the migraine early). I am now on a daily dose of Topamax that has drastically cut the number of severe migraines per month .",
                    "I get hormonal migraines, about 3 a month. Just got the dissolvable tablet and tried it twice. Worked both times in about 30 minutes. I get pretty drowsy, but I get drowsy when taking Excedrin and Midol. Both times I used it, I had already taken an OTC and it hadn't worked. Next time I'll skip the OTC and just take this. ",
                    "Fantastic drug! Works every time within half an hour. Feel a little strange for around 30 minutes after taking it, but no other side effects. Highly recommend it as it's the only thing that works for my migraines",
                    "Maxalt almost always gets rid of my migraine with one pill. It does make me sleepy so I take it near bedtime. When I wake up, I am groggy for up to 6 hours. That is the only side effect I have experienced. If I am having what I call a migraine marathon (up to five days) I alternate taking Maxalt and Imitrex.",

I sometimes go for long periods of time with no migraines, but then I can have migraine and accompanying neck pain that goes on for 2 days or more.  I've been on Fiorinal, then Fioricet, and just recently, Maxalt. Recently, I asked my Dr about having a different medication that would be legal to take to Europe, as Fioricet is banned in at least some, if not all, countries in Europe. Since another Dr had previously tried prescribing Maxalt, he had me try this. It WORKS. I find it works better and faster than other meds, and I don't feel woozy when taking it.  Tricare allows 18 pills per 45 day period before another refill.",

                    "I have had migraines for over 20 years. They were always debilitating and would last for days. I would literally pull my hair to relieve some of the pain. I went to all kinds of doctors to find out the cause, none took me seriously. Finally one doctor did and prescribed Maxalt as needed. She is my hero! When I feel a migraine coming on, I let a Maxalt melt in my mouth and in a few minutes, the migraine is forgotten. I have not had ANY side effects!",

Migraines are very severe and symptoms include non stop vomiting, lack of balance, loss of sensation, sensitivity to light, sound, etc. Rizatriptan works for a migraine attack which is not so severe. It has to be taken immediately. I usually lie down quietly for 20 minutes after taking it and then it works. It does not completely get rid of the headache, but suppresses it. This allows you to get on with your day. It makes me very tired, and makes my body feel heavy. Reactions are sometimes slower, so don't drive. If it does not work within 20-30 minutes, then it won't. ",
                    "I used to take the Maxalt in pill form and these work 2x as fast. I took one today at the first sign of a headache and it stopped it in it's tracks in just under 15 minutes. The pill used to take 30 and often the headache had time to bloom and get bad by then. They didn't immediately get rid of the nausea I get, but it went away in about 20 min after it stopped the bloom. I rated these as a 9 because of the taste. They taste a bit like a peppermint candy that's gone bad, but it's bearable and only lasts for about 5 seconds. I usually wash the flavor away with coffee - I like to back up anything I take for a headache with a good dose of caffeine. These will be replacing my Maxalt pills even if they do taste awful.",

I've had every head exam and test possible as well as tried a myriad of medications over the years for treatment. From taking preventive type things daily to treating the pain only during the headache. Nothing has given me the swift relief as this drug. It seems to give me complete relief within 30-40 minutes, without any side effects (that I've noticed). I took immitrex for years with little relief and horrible side effects. It would make me feel dizzy, weird and always made me nauseous. So I stopped taking it. Now with the Maxalt, I'm thrilled to know I can take it without worry of unwanted side effect. Thank you Maxalt! Finally migraine relief! ",

Nothing worked before, but started taking rizatriptan 9 months ago. It works every time, no side effects. I have my life back. Amazing. Recommend making a mentrual and migraine diary before going to the doctor.",

Previously I have been on the Maxalt 5 but needed to go up to the Maxalt 10 which helps relieve the pain more completely. I tried many other medicines, and this has been the best for me, I believe it is different for every person. My nausea does increase on this medication, but no chest heaviness as with other medicines.",

I can always count on Maxalt to get rid of my migraines. I usually feel relief within an hour of taking it. That being said ,this drug is very expensive. Even with insurance and taking the generic version, I am still out of pocket about $50 a box, and they only give you 12 pills. Sometimes I have 3 or 4 migraines in a week, so this can get really expensive. It works wonders for me though, so unfortunately it's a necessary expense.",

I used to be in agony for up to 3 days , but now at the first sign of an attack I take one , very rarely I have had to take another one a few hours after that if it started to come back . It can sometimes make me drowsy, but other times I have no side effects , just relief that there is something that actually works . I'm in Australia, so a pack of 4 costs me $25 .",

It literally gave me back my life, I was ill for days that ran into weeks that went into months. It was shocking, I felt suicidal with having no life and one day was sitting in my doctors room sobbing begging him to help me, and he prescribed me rizatriptan (maxalt). I love it!!",

Maxalt is great! It works within an hour of taking it and I have little to no side effects. I give it a 9 because it does make me shake and if I take two, it will make me feel washed out the next day. Of course, all of this is an even trade for killing a migraine. Overall, great and effective drug!",

And I'm not sleepy.",

Usually in less than 30-60 minutes I forget that my head was hurting and I am able to work for 8-12 hours, smometimes longer. I agree with another comment: it gives no side effects like a rapid heart rate or chest pain. After having surgery I got spinal meningitis which started my migranes when I was 34 years old. Now at 48 I am thankful for Maxalt.",

I don't have any side effects from it although it wouldn't matter since I now get relief! I have found migraine medicines are hit or miss for many so I'm beyond pleased I found a hit. I recommend Maxalt to anyone that will listen.",

My neurologist couldn't find anything wrong and I tried several medications (some would take at least 12 hours to have an effect). The only medication that ever successfully treated my migraines was Maxalt and it pretty much gave me my life back. It would still take at least an hour to work but it was really a life changer. Ultimately, I sought an ENT and after I had sinus surgery (and corrected my deviated septum) in 2011, my migraines never returned.

Side effects for me are a tightening sensation in my neck (where the arteries are on either side) then a \"floaty\" sensation. The pain goes away and I'm left tired, yawning frequently and a little fuzzy minded, but able to function much better than with the migraine. I've tried imitrex, zomig, midrin, and rx pain relievers. Maxalt has worked by far the best for me.",
                    "I went to see a headache specialist yesterday, and she recommended I take this for my migraines, which occur about 2-3 times a month. Of course, I woke up this morning with one. The tabs taste pretty bitter but when your head hurts, you don't really care. Just wash it down with water once it's done dissolving. Within half an hour it had subsided. As somebody who is used to suffering through them for 2 days, this is truly amazing.",
                    "Just took some for the first time 10 minutes ago and my migraine is ALREADY subsiding. Helps a lot more to put it under your tongue so it'll go into your blood stream quicker. ",
                    "Maxalt has saved me from migraines. It tends to make me a little drowsy, but that is a plus for me. I just lay down to take a nap, and when I wake up, the migraine is gone. This is also a plus at night as I could not sleep with migraines. The pounding and the pain would keep me up all night. Highly recommend this to anyone suffering from migraines. The drowsiness is not so bad that if I needed to stay awake I would be unable to.",
                    "Usually works well for me and don't make me drowsy.",
                    "I have had migraines since I was 11. When people say they are not hereditary...they are wrong. My grandma, mom, sisters and brothers all have them they did not even skip a generation.. my daughter and nieces as well get them. My physician calls mine sinus migraines. I get stomach pain, vomiting, an aura, light sensitivity. They had me on demerol, Percocet, phenergan, imitrex, nothing helped. I have been on maxalt a few years and the one thing I have noticed is that i get pain around the upper jaw area just under the ear...then all of a sudden like the snap of a finger all pain is gone 15 to 25 min. It makes me drowsey. I wake up from my nap feeling great but real thirsty.",
                    "Yesterday was my first time when I took Maxalt-MLT to cure my migraine. My doctor prescribed this drug six months ago but all those months I had no incidence of a migraine. Yesterday was again after my weight lifting workout. I only get migraines after a workout the last years. I always get aura for about 20 minutes before a headache begin. That is good the doctor said because I can take Maxalt faster before the pain begins. My first impression is that the aura lasted about 15 minutes and the pain was bearable in a scale of ten I would say 6.5 compared to other times that reaches 9 -10. The first 10 minutes, I was feeling a little bit weird and little dizzy. After 90 minutes the migraine got away, I think it needs about 90 minutes to act",
                    "I have suffered with severe menstrual migraines for 25+ years to the point where I fantasize about amputating my head. I was on Imitrex (made me very sleepy), Relpax (worthless) , generic (even worse). Maxalt is my go to medicine. Unfortunately its a fight with the insurance company to get regular refills. They are trying to force me to take a generic. I used to get 12 tablets and they changed it to 9- which 9 is not enough. When I run out I cannot help but pray for the day I get a refill fearing I will get a migraine before that time. When the refill day comes, I stalk my pharmacy on the phone until it is ready. Ugh...talk about \"drug-seeking\" !",
                    "This Migraine Med is a must have if you expereince regular Migraines..no side effects!",
                    "I find Maxalt Wafers amazing. I get a little tightness in my throat but apart from that no side effects and they work within I/2 an hour. In fact it feels like a huge weight has been lifted off me. They are expensive but worth it.",
                    "Tried Imitrex and Relpax first, but had bad heart-squeezing and neck-squeezing side effects. Tried Maxalt and did not have that problem. It usually takes away the migraines, but can take 1-2 hours to get relief. I'm also very fatigued after the pain goes away, which makes daytime onset of migraines a hassle. Also for the 1-2 hours I am waiting for it to work, the pain actually intensifies until suddenly it lets go and the blood vessels in my head feel cold. Strange, but true.",
                    "Within half an hour, the headache has totally subsided. sometimes need a second dose. It does cause my skin to feel sensitive to heat and my throat feels tight for about 2 hours but the headache and all symptoms are totally gone. Brilliant",
                    "Today was my first time taking Rizatriptan and the fact that I am able to write this review just hours after the onset of a migraine is amazing because normally I would be completely down for the count for at least a whole day with a migraine. So here is my experience: I have taken countless meds before including Imitrex with terrible side effects and zero relief so naturally I was skeptical about this new med. I took it as soon as I knew that this was going to be a particularly bad migraine. The only side effect I had was sleepiness, no \"heart attack\" feeling as I had experienced with Imitrex. I fell asleep within 15 min of taking Rizatriptan and woke up 2 hours later completely migraine free.",
                    "This pill is like a magic. I just noticed that the pill works in minutes for me and I feel a bit dizziness and like a burning head and then the pain is gone. Today I got a early migraine and I was able to use the MLT and work kind of slowly but it stopped the pain in time. But I still feel very sensitive to light. Great medication ask your doctor for Maxalt or Maxalt-MLT.",
                    "As you may know, migraines are extremely debilitating even when trying to perform most menial tasks let alone professional responsibilities. I tried Maxalt for the first time today approximately 20 minutes after my first aura and it actually works. I am happily surprised! I have yet to experience any side effects. However, lets be honest, I'd be tolerant of almost anything besides a migraine - which feels like a freight train chugging through my head.",
                    "Must take within 20 minutes of onset. The longer you wait, the longer it takes to work. Keep it in your pocket/wallet at all times. For me, it is a lifesaver.",
                    "My experience was mixed. I took Maxalt MLT as soon as I had my usual \"Aura\". It worked within 30 minutes. The aura was gone and I never did get a migraine. However, within an hour I had a severe angina attack and had to take my nitro twice to relieve the pain. Nitro glycerin gives you a headache, so I think I'd rather have the migraine than the chest pain! My daughter took it and had a wonderful experience, took the pain away within 30 minutes and no side effects at all. I guess I won't be taking it again. Too bad, it worked on the migraine.",
                    "Maxalt has helped me so much. My migraines get so intense and the minute I take Maxalt I start to feel relief.",
                    "Maxalt is a very good migraine medicine for me. No side effects but only a little tired but that's good.",
                    "1 Maxalt malt usually starts working in 30 to 45 minutes for me. Within an hour I'm able to continue my day. I have very frequent migraines and have used Maxalt for many years. No real side effects except a bit of drowsiness. And it is very expensive. Insurance does not cover the whole cost.",
                    "I suffer with cluster headaches. Extreme pain of the highest order. I found Rizatriptan melt in the mouth tablets to be superb.",
                    "This medication worked well to keep my cluster headache pain to a minimum. I found it did not work well when the cluster lasted longer than 2 weeks.",
                    "I've always had 3 day migraines. MaxAlt will take it away in about 35 minutes. Sometimes I would have to take another one (dissolved in my mouth) the next day. I cannot stress enough how much I love this medicine. I come from days when Darvon's were given for migraines, they didn't do anything but zombie you with the pain. I thank the scientist who figured out how to control whatever it is that is being controlled. Of course, it IS too expensive. Without insurance, I would have to suffer, as they are about $32 per pill!",
                    "I've had chronic migraines for around 12 years. I take 5mg and it usually takes care of my headache. It makes my neck ache a little but the relief from the horrible symptoms of a migraine are well worth it. I've tried other triptans but this one works best. The generic is very inexpensive.",
                    "I have just started experiencing migraines and thought my life was over at first. Nothing was working and I couldn't be a wife to my husband or mom to my five year old daughter. Since starting this miracle drug as we call it, I am myself again. The only side effect I am experiencing is having to pee a lot. I don't know if I am alone in that matter, but I would gladly substitute spending sometime in the potty then spending a whole day in the ER or in the bedroom in the dark.",
                    "The Maxalt-MLT self-dissolving tab worked wonders for me. At a time when my doctor was trying to determine the most-effective treatment form my migraine headaches, this medicine was a God-send. My doc gave me samples of various triptan meds and I was to try one out at the onset of every migraine. Of the 5-6 different samples I was given, Maxalt-MLT worked the fastest & had the least amount of side-effects. I was amazed. Unfortunately, my insurance would not cover it and I had to settle with sumatriptan. Sumatriptan worked, but it took about an hour and I just remember feeling really weird after taking it. Anyway, if/when my migraines start again- Maxalt is what I want.",
                    "Have just been prescribed Maxalt Melt after a lifetime of pain and feel I have discovered gold! My only disappointment is having only three pills when I need a truckload!",
                    "Upon 1st using this approximately 6 or so years ago I too labeled this as a miracle, unfortunately my last 3 migraines they have had no effect. ",
                    "It is the only med that has helped my migraines!",
                    "Relieved my headache quickly! The best I've tried in the last 5 years! Been through pain medicines and imitrex, Maxalt works best hands down.",
                    "I have suffered from migraines since I was a kid. I'm 49 now. In my mid 30s I started taking imitrex and it completely derailed me. I then started trying a bunch of preventative drugs, beta blocker, calcium blockers and ssri drugs. Finally found one that works fairly well, but along with that I use maxalt as a rescue drug which I still take 6+ times a month. It's a good drug and is effective. I have always noticed the migraines redoubles its efforts before leaving after I take it. I also notice it makes me very sleepy and foggy. I don't like to take it at work because of that. 9 times out of 10 it works, but there are still times it does nothing for me. Some is better than none in my world though. I take a generic due to cost.",
                    "I have suffered from migraines Since An Auto accident in 2009, sometime as many as 15 a month. I was prescribed Maxalt this past year (after trying a whole bag of other medicines). It has given me my life back... within thirty minutes after taking Maxalt the symptoms decrease by 50% and are gone within an hour. Several side effects, very drowsy and increased nausea but after several hours of sleep all is good.",
                    "I have tried OTC migraine medicines, and three other prescriptions. Maxalt is by far the best, and MLT makes it nearly perfect. The only bad side effect I have is that the back of my neck gets sore. Maxalt does this far less than Zomig, and taking Advil Liquigels or Vicodin with the Maxalt MLT helps quite a bit. My ideal treatment for a migraine is to take Maxalt MLT and Advil Liquigels, then lay down with something cold on my forehead. Once I am able to doze, I sleep until I wake up on my own. I can't believe how much better I feel after the nap. At work, I just take the two medicines. It takes me longer to feel better, but makes my headache much more bearable.",
                    "Works well, Headaches gone in about 2 hours of taking it.",
                    "99% of the time my migraine symptoms fade within an hour. I have had to take a second tablet only twice in ten years. I can function as normal. The only drawback is feeling tired and increased urination, but compared to going through a 36 hour migraine, that's nothing!",
                    "I would definitely try this for migraines if you haven't already. I had used Imitrex pills for a few years and suddenly they stopped working. I tried a couple different pills and then found Maxalt. The only problem with the pills is that I have to take them right away. Once the migraine has started they don't take away all the pain, only like 60% for me. I was on Maxalt for a few years, then put on Cymblata and didn't have migraines for 2 years on that, but then they came back and Maxalt didn't help me... Now I use Imitrex Statdose because I never catch my migraine until it's terrible but the injections get rid of the pain fast!",
                    "Miracle drug for me! Migraine gone within the hour of taking Maxalt. It made me groggy but I will take that over hours of pain",
                    "Miracle medicine! Only thing that helps my migraines and within minutes. Insurance wont cover so will have to find an alternative. If your insurance covers it, it is well worth it!",
                    "I am 56 and I've suffered with migraines since I was 5 years old. Maxalt is the only migraine medication that has worked wonders for me!! I take one as soon as I get the slightest beginning of a migraine and it is gone in 20 minutes! Not only that, but I've been taking it for 3 years now and I used to get 2 or 3 migraines a month, and now I only get about 1 every 2 months! Maxalt has been like a miracle for me...I no longer have to suffer with horrible headaches!! Additionally, I have not experienced any side effects!",
                    "One Maxalt-MLT usually gets rid of the migraine in an hour or less. Occasionally, I need another one 2 hours later to really get rid of it for good. Rarely, even the second one did not quite do it for me. But this is still the most effective medicine that's worked for me, after trying 8-10 other medicines (over-the-counter and prescription).",
                    "This is a miracle drug! I've tried all sorts of medicines over the past 30 some years and this drug is the only one that has ever stopped my migraines. If you are like me and have migraines often, then you got to try this drug, of course not all people have the same experience with medicines, but it is well worth trying.",
                    "I am a 35yo female and had my first migraine at 16yo just after giving birth to my firstborn. Over the years, particularly after each baby, the symptoms have become worse and are always experienced during menstruation. Recently codeine products that would normally help are not even touching the sides of the pain, and I have been experiencing increasing levels of sickness that anti-nausea tablets don't have any impact on. But yesterday a friend gave me a maxalt wafer because I couldn't function under the intensity of the sickness and pain. At first it didn't seem to do anything. But after maybe an hour to 90 minutes and I was no longer sick, nor was I in pain!! It was like a miracle!! How ever vision was slightly more blurred than usual.",
                    "Took this for the first time last night. Worked as well as Relpax (which my insurance no longer covers). I could actually get a good night's sleep!",
                    "Works well for my migraines. For me, I start feeling better in 20 minutes or so, and am completely back to normal within two hours.",
                    "Maxalt does work. Usually Fioricet works but when my migraine becomes worse Fioricet doesn't do anything and Maxalt does the trick!",
                    "This is the best sos pill for migraines, I barely have side-effects from it and if I melt it in my mouth it acts much faster killing my migraine in less than 20 minutes. I cannot imagine my life without Rizatriptan !! It gave me my life back!",
                    "I've been using maxalt for about 6 years (give or take) and it's about the only medication I've found that really gets rid of my migraines. The MLT version is great when your stomach's so upset you can't keep down a pill, too. The only side effect I've ever had is a tingling feeling in my shoulders. Well worth the co-pay!",
                    "I started taking Maxalt after horrible experiences with Imitrex. I had almost all the same side effects: extreme nausea, dizziness, falling asleep, and a general out of it feeling the rest of the day. But the worst part is that it did absolutely nothing for my migraine. I am just glad that I had samples so I didn't get stuck paying for a prescription I would not use. ",
                    "I have suffered migraines since childhood 2-5 migraines a year. Then at about 38 I started getting these horrible severely debilitating headaches 1-3 times a year and the headaches would last up to weeks with intermittent increase in severity. I was finally diagnosed with cluster headaches and prescribed Rizatriptan. If I feel the onset it diminishes the intensity and duration. I have been using it for 2 years and very grateful.",
                    "My first time taking it. I have complex partial seizures and my aura has changed to where I now have migraine headaches afterwards. We are doing test to rule out other problems but this medicine helped me more than anything so far. Still have that groggy feeling afterwards but I can deal with that. Just do not know how I can take it should I have to at work since I work in a call center 10 hours a day with constant calls.",
                    "I have used maxalt four times in the last three months. The first time it worked fine and it was gone in a few hours but had heart racing.  The second migraine I was concerned about the side effects but gave a second chance. I had severe throbbing in my head like it was going to explode and then suddenly the migraine broke.  My third attempt my migraine was so severe that I had to take a second dose for relief! I find that if I take it on the onset it works but still light headache and felt numbing sensation.  My fourth today no relief after 2nd dose. Took 3rd after 4 hours but still feeling migraine. Had slight heart racing and throbbing pain. I may continue to see if this is right meds. If not, then I think there's no hope for me!",
                    "Works fast limited side effects.",
                    "This is the only migraine medicine that consistently gets rid of my migraines. I've tried Zomig, Imitrex, and many others - but Maxalt gets it gone in 15-30 minutes and I'm back, up and ready to get back into life. I can even take one at work and just rest my eyes at my desk until it kicks in. Never could do that before.",
                    "This medicine is a miracle drug. I have migraines that last for 3 days and until my doctor prescribed maxalt I could not get rid of them or function properly. Now I take a pill and within 30 min it is gone. My life is so much nicer I am up moving around exercising and actually living my life like a normal person.",
                    "I call this my \"miracle drug\". I had been suffering from constant migraines since I was 9 years old. I am now 64. They used to tell my parents I was \"high-strung\" and had \"tension headaches\". I was never diagnosed with migraine until I was about 48 years old. This is the ONLY drug that has ever stopped my migraine (of course...you have to take it immediately at the onset, as with all migraine meds). I had lost so many days of my life to the extreme pain/nausea and impaired vision/speech/general functionality before I discovered rizatriptan. Quite literally, I thank God for leading someone to develop this and for someone prescribing it for me.",
                    "I am a 42 yr old male and I have been susceptible to migraines since I was very little. My worst childhood memories are of me moaning and rocking back and forth in agony on my bed when suffering from my very first migraines as an 8 or 9 yr old child. I too have not had any luck with Imitrex and some of the other medicines mentioned in this post. My insurance gives me terrible problems when I am trying to get a migraine prescription filled. As it is right now I have figured out that Axert and Maxalt are the only two medicines that I know will work for certain when I am afflicted and totally incapacitated by migraine headaches. The problem with Axert is that my insurance will only allow a monthly script of 6 tablets at $10/tablet. Maxalt does it for less dollars.",
                    "Migraine, the word can't convey the impact on life. For me, a typical one lasted about 36 hours, followed by another 24 hours of \"hangover\". Somewhere during the 36 hour duration, would be 12 hours of hell. I've used Maxalt MLT about 10-12 times over the last 6 months. It has worked every time; I take one when I sense a migraine is starting, and it just doesn't \"blossom\". I have no side effects, no nausea, and no drowsiness. Sometime in the next 20-30 minutes I'll realize the apprehension, tension and other precursors to the migraine have just disappeared. Migraines took too much of my life, and at their worst, pushed depression to the edge of suicide; it's good to have a normal life back.",
                    "Maxalt is the only migraine medicine I have tried, and it works well for me. When I take it early (before it becomes a full-bloomed migraine), it works within maybe 30 minutes, completely getting rid of the pain. I do have some side effects: most of the time, I feel a tightening of the throat for about 15 minutes after taking it (my doctor had warned me about that), and if I happen to be a bit tired when taking it, I feel a bit dizzy for a couple of hours. But it sure beats a 24-hour migraine.",
                    "I have tried different medicines for migraines, all just calmed it down a little, it just had to run its 3 day duration. Am seeing another Dr & she put me on Maxalt yesterday, my migraine was gone within an hour of taking it. I just want to go back and hug her because after 5 yrs of trying I just accepted my pain. It made me drowsy, but I will take drowsy over pain any day.",
                    "Amazing! I took Imitrex for years and it didn't really help. Maxalt is the only medication that works for me to continue my busy life. I have had hormonal migraines since I was 12. Tried everything from pain medicines (temporary fix) to nasal to shots. I love Maxalt!",
                    "I had my doubts that this would work -- it was fantastic! within 15-20 minutes the pain that felt like my skull was in a vise disappeared. I am a horse trainer and I work full time on my own farm, and I can't function when I have a migraine, ( 4-5 attacks a month, 24-48 hours each time) Maxalt 10-mg was a miracle for me. I don't have to put all the work on my daughter, and my temper has become much more even. The anxiety of worrying about a migraine attack has helped enormously, for my emotional state, too. **side note** I had a Mirena IUD and had it removed, I believe this contributed to the attacks, so hopefully in 4-6 weeks I won't need the Maxalt, either.",
                    "This works wonders for me, but makes me a little nutty for awhile. Better than migraines by a long shot. They try and make it taste minty, but still a little foul tasting.",
                    "Works within minutes usually. Have not noted any side effects with it although I do not care for taste. After it melts and is gone, I drink water to get taste out of my mouth.",
                    "Maxalt relieves my migraine in 1 hour however it does make me sleepy. I love the fast dissolve feature. I will have to stop using it however due to the rising cost not covered by my insurance company. I am now hoping Imitrex will work as well.",
                    "I have used this medication for over 3 years now. Just recently I was told to take 2 instead of one since my migraines seem to be getting worse each time (I blame it on MS). Nothing else works for me. I can deal with the kids bickering. I carry this drug with me always! ",
                    "This medication always takes my migraine away. It is the only medicine that has done that for me. Sometimes I do get rebound headaches from the medicine, but I am pleased that I have finally found something to take the migraine away. I just wish I could find something to alleviate my migraines altogether because I get them way too often."

                    "//What is it?//Headache and migraine are different entities. Migraine is one of the most common and well characterized, but there are 14 broad categories that can be subdivided into more than 200 different forms. Migraine itself has about 20 different genres. In general, headaches are divided into two large groups: primary and secondary. Primary illnesses correspond to a disease, not reflecting other health problems and represent around 90% of the total. Secondary symptoms are symptoms of diseases of the nervous system or other organs of the human body. They can occur in cases of flu, alcohol poisoning or withdrawal, minor head trauma, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels) or a high blood pressure crisis. Migraine is a primary headache in which very intense episodes of pain occur interspersed with periods without symptoms. In general, it begins between the ages of 15 and 40, but it can appear in childhood or shortly after the first menstruation. If it appears for the first time after the age of 45, other causes must be excluded. Some of its characteristics are closely associated with the female reproductive cycle: higher prevalence after the first menstruation or during the menstrual period; occasional worsening due to taking birth control pills or hormone therapy; attenuation or disappearance during pregnancy or menopause. Before adolescence, migraines affect boys and girls equally. From then on, it is two to three times more common in females. It is estimated that 8% to 15% of individuals living in Western countries (including Portugal) suffer from this problem. The fact of reaching people in the productive phase implies large economic, social and family costs.//Symptoms//It appears recurrently, several times throughout life, but always with completely free intervals. If it occurs every day, it is probably overuse of painkillers or other medications. Drug abuse can convert a migraine into a chronic daily headache. There are people who preferably appear on the weekend. These crises can be precipitated by changes in sleep schedule, failure to eat breakfast, reduced stress or alcohol abuse. In these cases, it is important to consider a lifestyle change over the weekend. The symptoms are intense and often prevent work or study. The pain tends to be throbbing, worsening with physical exertion or head movements. In general, it affects only one side of the head, and is accompanied by nausea, vomiting, intolerance to light, noise and some smells. It is not mandatory that all of these elements are present simultaneously. And they can occur twice a week or just a few throughout a lifetime. During attacks, people seek a dark, quiet place to rest or fall asleep. An episode can last from a few hours to three days. Between attacks, there are usually no complaints. Some types of migraines may have more complex symptoms (with aura). These forms are less common, affecting around 15% of people with this problem, and include transient neurological symptoms, originating attributable to certain areas of the brain. The other signs are identical to those of migraine without aura. The most common auras are temporary vision disorders, in the form of loss of vision on one side of the visual field, blurred images, perception of bright points, geometric figures or bright zigzags. Other auras can be translated as tingling or numbness on one side of the face or one of the hands. There are people who have difficulty speaking or even temporary paralysis of their limbs, usually only on one side of the body. These changes last about 10 to 30 minutes and precede the pain. In children, migraines tend to be bilateral, less intense and of shorter duration. Vomiting and dark circles can be exuberant. Disturbances in sleep and meal schedules are common precipitating factors. Treating these crises is easier than in adults. Sleep usually gives good results. At these ages, the occipital location is not normal and, when present, requires a medical consultation. Likewise, the presence of headaches with morning vomiting or other unusual symptoms in very young children should be seen by a healthcare professional.//Causes//It is caused by a combination of brain processes: excitation/depression of cells, dilation of arteries and release of chemicals. People with migraine are more sensitive to certain stimuli, environmental or from their own body, that can trigger these brain processes. It is also thought that there is some genetic susceptibility. Some individuals can identify the signs of their attacks. The most common are cheese, chocolate, strawberries, seafood, wine, artificial sauces, changes in sleep patterns, stress, menstruation, fasting, physical exercise, and minor trauma. Others cannot identify them at all. People who drink coffee regularly may experience headaches when they stop this habit.//Diagnosis//The key to diagnosis lies in the clinical history, physical and neurological examination. Observation of the fundus is a very important part of these procedures. In some cases, it may be necessary to resort to computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to exclude other diseases.//Treatment//Migraines have no cure but can be controlled. There are medications and behaviors that can reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks. Symptomatic treatment, during acute periods, involves resting in a quiet, dark place. Pressure or cold can be applied to the area of \u200b\u200bpain. At this stage, analgesics, anti-inflammatories, antiemetics and triptans are very useful.//Prevention//People with migraines should create calendars that allow them to identify their symptoms and assess their impact on their quality of life. The first step in prevention is to identify and eliminate precipitating factors, whenever possible. In some cases, it is necessary to use daily medication to reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks, but there are no drugs specifically developed for their prevention. However, there are some drugs used in other contexts that have proven to be effective, such as beta-blockers, antidepressants or antiepileptics, and these should always be prescribed by a doctor.

                    "At 59 years of age have been suffering migraines since I was 21. Think I have tried every medication available in the UK. Maxalt is the only thing that has ever worked for me.Pain usually gone after 20 minutes, before I took Maxalt I could be in bed for 2 days rolling around in agony. Only side effects are tiredness and strangely It makes me sneeze just once as soon as I have taken it. Maxalt has completely changed my life. Fortunate to live in UK as I get it free on national health prescription.",
                    "I have had migraines since I was 12 yrs. Old, I am 67. As a child I just suffered all the time. When I was in my late 20's, fiorinal was the answer. It did help. There have been a couple of others (can't remember the name). Then imitrex came out. Didn't work. I did not find relief, even with addition of percocet until maxalt came out. Thank heavens. Mostly 20 days per month. I learned very quickly first sign for me is a slice of pain, then I immediately take the maxalt. Within a half hour, 99% gone. I have been so fortunate to have medicine coverage through private employer insurance with reasonable copay, otherwise it would affect my ability to support myself. I take over 12 meds per day..No interactions",
                    "Works within 2 hours but my migraine always returns the next day. I take the medication the next day - headache goes away within two hours - comes back the next day again. Medication works but I feel extremely tired and depressed for the three days. Insurance companies also limit me to 9 pills a month which adds to my stress.",
                    "This medication worked great for me to get rid of my headache. When I take it before I feel a bad migraine coming on, it alleviates it before it gets bad. My only complaint about this medication is I get really bad heart burn and I really do not sleep that well while I am on it. I guess you can%u2019t have everything.",
                    "I occasionally get migraine when I have been in stressful situations. It appears that my migraine are related to a deficit of serotonin. I also get migraines in stores that sell lots of cheap plastic items. This medication is 100% effective for me.",
                    "Puts me in nice restful deep sleep (normal 7hr night), walk up in morning migraine gone, with no hangover feeling that you would normally get if went to ER for a shot.",
                    "To me, this is the ONE medicine I can not live without. I have had to try others due to insurance, and none comes even close! Within 15-30 even the strongest, wanting to smash my head-in migraine will be totally gone! No side effects for me either. Never makes me tired, groggy or the medicated feeling. Taken on empty stomach while in college class and had no problems finishing the class and going home to play with the kids and not the mom who was hiding in a dark room with no noise allowed in the house.",
                    "Maxalt has worked wonders for me. When I have migraines I never feel like swallowing tablets, so the fact that I have the dissolving tablet is an absolute bonus. Before this medicine I was bedridden for days at a time, and after a migraine, my head always felt so heavy and like a bowling ball. Now however I am able to go to work the next day. I recommend it to every person I meet!",
                    "My daily headaches started after a ventricular assist device (VAD). Maxalt has worked beautifully in killing the pain. Occasionally I will wake up with a headache the following day, but not severe enough to warrant another dose. I am careful to avoid triggers so don't have to take this very often. I am grateful that I have this option since I am allergic to NSAIDs.",
                    "Very effective with no side effects (i.e. drowsiness). I've had mixed luck with other migraine medicines, but find Maxalt MLT to be consistently helpful.",
                    "I have suffered from migraines for at least 15 years and tried so many medications and therapies to help. Maxalt is the only thing that helps me. I have missed a day to three of work in a row from migraines and now do not have to miss any. It takes the pain away within an hour. I don't get any effects from the drug really, maybe a bit tired once and awhile. My only complaint is the wafer tastes pretty gnarly but it is worth it!",
                    "If taken at the start of a migraine this medicine works wonders . There are side effects such as dry mouth, tiredness, and joint aches. But as anyone who has migraines know that is a small price to pay for relief from the migraine itself.",
                    "I've suffered from Pure Menstrual Migraine for 4 years. Nothing I have tried to date has helped ease any of the migraine pain at all, which usually goes on for 3 days solid every month, le. Until now. I asked my dr if I could try Rizatriptan and he agreed. My warning sign that a migraine is on it's way is an ache down the left hand side of my face. Well, within the last hour I got that warning so took my first ever Rizatriptan dissove in the mouth tablet. Revolting! Utterly vile - like a really bad mint that went off years ago. However, rather than spit it out (since they are very expensive) I let it dissolve. Now 40 mins later I have no ache and no pain, and I hope that means that I will not get a mega-migraine! So far so good ..",
                    "I avoid drugs of all kinds and I'm a usually healthy person. After suffering years from horribly painful headaches that would leave me vomiting all day and totally out of it (I thought it was due to whiplash injury), my doctor prescribed Rizatriptan 10mg. It truly is a miracle drug for me. I use the melt-away tablets, and find the relief starts in about 15 minutes, and by 30 minutes, any headache is gone. I take them at the very beginning of symptoms. I do get sleepy, so I've learned that I can just take half a tablet, get the same result, and not feel so tired. I have had very slight jaw pain once or twice, and cutting back the dosage also alleviated that problem.",
                    "Since I was about 26 I have suffered from migraines (now 65) and tried everything from daily preventative meds, to expensive self injecting & very expensive medication, then cafegot suppositories with 3 aspro clear for the pain, I could spend hours and days feeling like dying and vomiting non stop, then there was a shortage of cafegot and that was hell, and finally they took it off the market, that is when my Dr. asked me to trial Maxalt wafers, at first I thought nothing could replace cafegot and I was very conscious of not taking ergotomine with rizatriptan. Maxalt is the best, it works within an hour, and so far after 4-5 years no side effects at all, and no more vomiting ever. Also I do not take any other drugs for anything, but Maxalt.",
                    "Maxalt is truly one of the most amazing migraine medications I have ever tried, and believe me, having migraines as a child and now at 52 years of age, there have been many. As a migrainer, we truly know what suffering is. Maxalt is the best, although, after losing my job 18 months ago and with no success of getting another, it is too expensive. From my understanding the patent expires in 2012. I truly hope the price goes down for those of us who cannot be without it.",
                    "43 yr old male.For me this is close to a miracle cure, it has given my life back. I have had stomach and esophagus lesions due to way too much aspirin/ ibuprofen/digesics/codeine trying to halt an attack. No more screaming in E.R rooms waiting for pethidine/morphine. No more thoughts off grabbing a drill to stop the throbbing pain. I actually have a life after 26 yrs of suffering 2-4 attacks a week each last up to 36 hrs each. Numerous preventive medicines didn%u2019t work. I am truly in debt to the manufacturers and the on call doctor who gave me to Maxalt. Takes about 40-90 minutes to work with a second dosage sometimes needed. My fear is the more i take it the less effective it will become as lately I need the second wafer.",
                    "Bad headaches. This medicine works like it says it should.",
                    "I am very greatful for Maxalt wafers as they help me get rid of my migraines, although the side effects of insane burning and jaw pain last and hour before, the wafer curing my migraine.  Half half if you can endure the pain, its wonderful",
                    "Wonder drug. I tried many others. Maxalt MLT works so quick and free of all the usual side effects. I can use Maxalt MLT and within 30-60 minutes return to normal activities free of the normal after migraine haziness. It has given me my life back. Many thanks to Dr. Z. for prescribing this.",
                    "This medication is labeled a wonder drug in my household. It is the last line of defense and treatment for migraine. However and very sadly I might add recently the copay my insurance company imposed is going to make it hard to take. Limited to 4 tablets per week (while they state all medicines are calculated at a monthly dose level) NOW a copay of $60 per script makes it $240 for each myself and my wife. We just can't afford this after paying $2400.00 monthly for the insurance coverage. We are being choked to death! If the medicine was covered properly under the contract we could handle the $60 copay per month but because they limit the medication to 3-4 tablets per week. ",
                    "I took it for the first time today. My migraine was gone within an hour; however, it made me really sleepy. Three hours later, I'm still very groggy. Next time, I think I'll stay home from work and sleep it off. But missing work is what I'm trying to avoid. I'm incredibly thrilled that my migraine is gone, though.",
                    "I have suffered from hormonal migraines since puberty and am now in my fifties. I tried every option the Doctor could offer but nothing helped until I found Maxalt Melt about ten years ago. I call them my magic pill as they can clear a migraine completely within an hour. Very occasionally I have to take a second dose. They work for me with minimal side effects and are worth every penny. I'm in the UK so can get them on prescription.",
                    "I use this medication to help my migraines. I used to take Relpax. I quit taking it because it was too expensive and the side effects were strong. I like this medication because my insurance covers most of it and it is very effective with little side effects. The only cons are the taste (a little minty but the end has a bitter taste), I seem to get different side effects each time I take it (very mild, includes some drowsiness and nausea), also in my experience you need to take this medication as soon as you feel the migraine coming on or you may find yourself taking two or three pills during the migraine every two hours to keep it gone. Overall I find it very cost friendly and effective. I will continue using this medication.",
                    "My Migraine did Not go away . It might have only marginally lessened it . I went to bed for two hours and have felt terrible all day . This medication made me very sleepy . I took a Second Wafer some hours later but there was Still No Improvement ! Now I cannot take any other migraine medication for a whole 24 hours. Which is far too long . I made the mistake of taking the second wafer when the first one wasn't helping. I already had Jaw Pain so reading that others get it as a side effect makes me wonder. It reminds me of Imigraine and I thought that useless. Sydney Australia 2015.05.18",
                    "I've had ever-worsening migraines since I was in my 40's (I'm now 73). When they started, all that was available were drugs like Fiorinal and other mind-scrambling drugs. Finally, the triptans came along and saved my life. I started with Imitrex and tried the various other triptans, but Maxalt was the most effective. I would like to share one important observation: When I first started taking triptans, I had very few side effects, and was able to function at a high-level job, run home with kids, etc. HOWEVER, as I got older, I realized that side-effects emerged which have only gotten stronger over time. e.g. fogginess, sleepiness, nausea, etc. -- so be aware that side-effects can increase with age. Still, Maxalt is a life-saver.",
                    "I have been taking Maxalt for a couple of years and it's the only migraine medicine that gets rid of the pain without making me sick. I have a couple of side effects: tingling in my jaw, neck, and spine and also it makes me have to pee a lot. ",
                    "I have suffered with cluster headaches since I was in my twenties. I am now 61 and still get them, sometimes every few months and sometimes I can go several years, but when they hit, the are debilitating and I never know how many days or weeks they will continue. My physician gave me a sample to try as I had been having these headaches almost everyday for 2 or more weeks. Within 30-45 minutes the pressure and pain were gone and my drooping, puffy eye looked normal again. I plan to ask my doctor if he can prescribe a larger quantity so I can take them during these lengthy episodes. I would love to be part of a study on the efficacy of this drug on cluster headache patients. Wish I had known about it sooner.",
                    "This Med is nothing short of a miracle. Quick acting and has broken the cycle this making frequency decrease. Wish my insurance wasn't so tight on filling. I've waited years fora generic & they finally covered 4 pills. Woo hoo! Cheaper than an ER visit that doesn't even work as quickly. I would recommend this product to everyone who mentions the word migraine.",
                    "I love Maxalt my doctor gave it to me about 4 months ago. After years of no relief my migraine was gone in 20 minutes! I admit I get extremely sleepy after I take it but a 1 hour nap and I'm back in business. Much better then four days of blinding pain that's for sure it is very expensive but I contacted my local clinic and they had me fill out some forms and received a free 6 month supply at which time I can reapply. You can also try contacting the company online they may help depending on your income.",
                    "I love how fast I get relief with this and how the melting form ones work when I'm nauseated.",
                    "I have headache for an unknown reason, but they are always in the left temple behind my eye. The pain is awful. I've tried every over the counter med and this is the only one that works. Hopefully the cause can be cured until then. This are doing the job",
                    "I had a migraine for 7 days. When I finally couldn't take the pain anymore, I went to my doctor and was prescribed this medication. Within 20 minutes my migraine was gone. Its heaven sent. You have to take it as soon as you feel a migraine coming on. Also it makes me very sleepy. But almost all medications do that to me. If you haven't taken it ...get it. It will solve your migraine problems.",
                    "OMG! This stuff is a life changer! I suffer from migraines at least once or twice a week. Makes me feel a little nauseated for a few minutes but within 20 minutes my headache and nausea is gone. Now I have to figure out how to get more then my insurance will allow me to get in a month.... They only allow 9 a month :-/ Way better than Imatrex!",
                    "Aside from a slight burning sensation where my migraine is located this drug works wonderfully. Better than any nasal spray or OTC drug I've ever tried.",
                    "I've had migraines since I was 11 and was first prescribed Maxalt when I was 17. It's wonderful. I take it as soon as I start to notice the signs of a migraine and about 70% of the time the first dose does the job, within an hour or less. Occasionally I take a second dose if the symptoms haven't gone after 2-3 hours. Very occasionally it doesn't work at all. It has improved my life enormously. I evangelize about it. My migraines used to last up to 3 days - now I get a unkillable one only once or twice a year. Side effects for me are (as someone else has mentioned) one sneeze within a few minutes of taking it, a little drowsiness and eventually a little euphoria (though maybe that's a rational response to knowing the migraine has gone).",
                    "I've had migraines for years and have been given everything for them. I also believe I've gone through every triptan that one could imagine. This medicine has been phenomenal in relieving really tough migraine pain. Within 30 minutes I can get relief. Also, I like that you can get it in sublingual form. Sometimes my migraines are so bad that I'm constantly throwing up everything. When I'm nauseous the sublingual form is wonderful, however, it also comes in a tiny tablet. I keep this with me at all times. It has saved me from multiple hospital visits in the past. Hope this helps!",
                    "I've had Migraine headaches since grade school. This is the only medication that I have tried that gives me relief in less than 15 minutes and has no side effect",
                    "Very effective migraine medicine. Take at first sign of migraine and did very well.",
                    "I have had migraines since I was a teenager (I'm now 42.) After trying almost everything, including OTC meds and other tryptans that didn't work, I am so glad my Dr gave me Maxalt .It works every time. Very rarely I need a second dose, but I know it will always work.This drug has saved me from calling in sick to work on many occasions, and I can even take it at work if I need it, as I don't experience any side effects from it. My only complaint is the expense. Even with insurance and using generic, my copay is still $31 for only 12 pills that are supposed to last me a month.If I refill the prescription before that month ,the copay goes up to $50. Sometimes I will get 3 or 4 migraines a week, so 12 pills is just not enough.This is a great drug though.",
                    "Maxalt, especially the melt aways are simply amazing. I've had to take them off and on for years. (Going quite awhile without migraines.) Then the generic was introduced. I've tried two different kinds. They are not the same! The generic makes my headache get worse right after I take it, then about 1/2 hour later it might work. I'm usually asleep soon after that. I searched for the 'real' deal again and it is as I remembered. Started working RIGHT away with very little side effects. Maybe sore throat. Such a miracle for me. It is expensive at times depending on whim of insurance coverage, but I will pay to have pain go away!",
                    "I've suffered from severe, debilitating migraines since I was 30 (I'm now 49). I've been prescribed everything under the sun but Maxalt is the ONLY medication that works for me. First of all, it dissolves under my tongue so I know that if I vomit, I won't throw it up. Secondly, and especially if I take it at the first sign of a migraine, it usually only takes about 30 minutes to kick in and fully eradicate my migraine. Imitrex and the others I've been on haven't worked or haven't worked as completely as Maxalt. I consider it a life saver.",
                    "Tried a sample of Maxalt that the doctor gave me for the first time today and could not believe the results. Within 1 hour the migraine was gone and within 2 hours I was back to normal and working. This is truly a miracle medicine for me. I also take 100 mg of Topamax daily so that has really cut down on the migraines but again the Maxalt was a lifesaver for me today. I am worried about my copay after reading some of the post on here but I do have to say that I think it will be worth it.",
                    "I live in the UK so I get Maxalt free on NHS. I suffer from migraines a lot, and before I started taking Maxalt I would get minimum of 4 migraines a month sometimes more. These would last a whole 7 days with the first 24 hrs being hell! Its hard to explain to non-sufferers how painful these are. All of you will know what I am on about. Couldn't believe how amazing Maxalt was, didn't even reach the painful stage but it was totally gone. Works every time straight away for me. I take it along with codeine also prescribed. Tiny side effect, cramps in tummy but goes away within 30 mins. Worth it though!",
                    "Works nearly every time on one dose. The second dose will make you fell washed out for the next 24 hours. Life is normal with this drug as it works in about an hour. I am in the UK so NHS covers the costs of the drug.",
                    "Maxalt has worked wonders for me! I've suffered from migraines for several years now and Maxalt has been the only thing that can stop them. When I feel a migraine coming on I take one of the 10 mg dissolvable tablets and it soon disappears. Occasionally I do end up with a full-blown migraine (because I'm forgetful and don't always have Maxalt on me) and taking two doses helps it go away much more quickly than it would otherwise. Miracle!",
                    "Works about 75% of the time. So far this is the best medication I've been prescribed.",
                    "This is the only medicine that tackles my migraines. They can make me sleepy and stupid, but I'll take that over a migraine pain any day.",
                    "I've had migraines since I was about 9 years old because of a life long battle with insomnia. When I was a kid and I had my first migraine...I thought I was dying. I didn't understand what I had, what set it off or why I had it. And the pain and all of the vomiting. EVERYTHING hurt. Any light, the slightest noise and any movement I made while in bed made the migraine worse and I'd start vomiting NON-STOP. The doctor prescribed Maxalt to me. I didn't even know they MADE medicines for migraines and I have to say I cannot be without it. But as the directions state, take AS SOON as you feel a migraine (not just a headache) coming on. Your body usually gives you signs, for me it's excessive yawning every few seconds and irritability.",
                    "I had migraines for nearly 35 years after working in a building that had been \"bug bombed\" overnight. About 10 years ago I realized they only came from neck pain and chiropractic did not help. After an exceptionally bad reaction 3 years ago to Cafergot, I was prescribed Maxalt and it became my wonder medicine. I have not had a migraine now in nearly 18 months (something in my neck has moved to relieve the pressure) but I still take Maxalt when nothing else will get rid of a bad headache after all night pain last night, it was gone in 10 minutes when I finally took it this morning. I wish I had known about it decades ago, none of the other triptans worked for me.",
                    "Life changing, I love this medicine.",
                    "This is an amazing medicine that I can not live without. No side effects and completely knocks put the pain. Only once or twice did I need a second dose. It's a life saver. My insurance still covers it so I am lucky.",
                    "I have had migraines for about 12 years. Maxalt is the only drug that works and it works fast. Only problem is my insurance will only pay for 10 a month and when my cluster headaches come I eat through them like candy.",
                    "I have been taking Maxalt for migraines for the past five years. This medication is the only one I have found that really takes care of the migraine and any residual headache. The generic ones don't work for me. ",
                    "My migraines started on April 2 2016, I have had a constant headache since then, with the 13 migraines, after a CT scan in my neck, I have a long which needs to be removed, which could be the root cause for this ongoing headache however finally I was prescribed maxalt today after almost 4 months of suffering headaches and migraines,and taking other pain relief, icing it, quiet rooms, limiting bright light stimulation ,msiisng out on family and friend events and I cannot believe the difference it's made. I don't like taking medications, I try to do things naturally, think this really really helped, and I have so much relief. Kudos to the angel who told me about it from Medicare, while we were trying to sort out my card going missing",
                    "Maxalt was a wonderful medication for two years, then its effectiveness rapidly diminished. My unforeshadowed migraines feature very mild headaches; instead, I first lost my sense of balance, then my lunch, and then the desire to live for the next three hours. Although I was on a migraine-suppressing tricyclic and metroprolol, migraines would punch through two to eight times a month. Maxalt shutdown such migraines within 20 minutes-no side effects. (NOTE: Maxalt did not suppress the rare aura). After further adjustment of my daily medicines, my rescue medicine became Relpax  2 Aleve.",
                    "Tried some samples of Maxalt and while it got rid of my (minor in this case) migraine, I did experience a side effect that made me more than a bit nervous. I experienced numbness in my left hand and arm. My doctor told me to immediately stop using it. I'm a bit saddened that I can't continue on Maxalt as it did get rid of my migraine and definitely worked better than Imitrex, but not worth the risk of the side effect I experienced.",
                    "I had no luck with this medicine. I have tried a few different migraine medicines: Maxalt, Imitrex, Treximet, Fiortal, Indocin, Vicodin, and Percocet. I have suffered from migraines for 4 years, however I am able to recognize the signs before an attack. I attempted to take the Maxalt at the first sign of the migraine and nothing happened. On the other hand, I tried Treximet and had WONDERFUL results. Treximet is expensive, but if you have a healthcare plan that covers it, it works wonders (assuming you catch the migraine early). I am now on a daily dose of Topamax that has drastically cut the number of severe migraines per month .",
                    "I get hormonal migraines, about 3 a month. Just got the dissolvable tablet and tried it twice. Worked both times in about 30 minutes. I get pretty drowsy, but I get drowsy when taking Excedrin and Midol. Both times I used it, I had already taken an OTC and it hadn't worked. Next time I'll skip the OTC and just take this. ",
                    "Fantastic drug! Works every time within half an hour. Feel a little strange for around 30 minutes after taking it, but no other side effects. Highly recommend it as it's the only thing that works for my migraines",
                    "Maxalt almost always gets rid of my migraine with one pill. It does make me sleepy so I take it near bedtime. When I wake up, I am groggy for up to 6 hours. That is the only side effect I have experienced. If I am having what I call a migraine marathon (up to five days) I alternate taking Maxalt and Imitrex.",
                    "I have had migraines since my teenage years and am currently 49 years old. I sometimes go for long periods of time with no migraines, but then I can have migraine and accompanying neck pain that goes on for 2 days or more.  I've been on Fiorinal, then Fioricet, and just recently, Maxalt. Recently, I asked my Dr about having a different medication that would be legal to take to Europe, as Fioricet is banned in at least some, if not all, countries in Europe. Since another Dr had previously tried prescribing Maxalt, he had me try this. It WORKS. I find it works better and faster than other meds, and I don't feel woozy when taking it.  Tricare allows 18 pills per 45 day period before another refill.",
                    "I have used Maxalt for the past 7 years and I swear by it. If I feel a migraine coming on I put my melt into my mouth and I am free and clear in less then 15 minutes. Some people call this medicine Migraine Gold. To me it is a lifesaver.",
                    "I have had migraines for over 20 years. They were always debilitating and would last for days. I would literally pull my hair to relieve some of the pain. I went to all kinds of doctors to find out the cause, none took me seriously. Finally one doctor did and prescribed Maxalt as needed. She is my hero! When I feel a migraine coming on, I let a Maxalt melt in my mouth and in a few minutes, the migraine is forgotten. I have not had ANY side effects!",
                    "Have had migraine for 33 years. Experienced first one after giving birth for the first time. Migraines are very severe and symptoms include non stop vomiting, lack of balance, loss of sensation, sensitivity to light, sound, etc. Rizatriptan works for a migraine attack which is not so severe. It has to be taken immediately. I usually lie down quietly for 20 minutes after taking it and then it works. It does not completely get rid of the headache, but suppresses it. This allows you to get on with your day. It makes me very tired, and makes my body feel heavy. Reactions are sometimes slower, so don't drive. If it does not work within 20-30 minutes, then it won't. ",
                    "I used to take the Maxalt in pill form and these work 2x as fast. I took one today at the first sign of a headache and it stopped it in it's tracks in just under 15 minutes. The pill used to take 30 and often the headache had time to bloom and get bad by then. They didn't immediately get rid of the nausea I get, but it went away in about 20 min after it stopped the bloom. I rated these as a 9 because of the taste. They taste a bit like a peppermint candy that's gone bad, but it's bearable and only lasts for about 5 seconds. I usually wash the flavor away with coffee - I like to back up anything I take for a headache with a good dose of caffeine. These will be replacing my Maxalt pills even if they do taste awful.",
                    "Rizatriptan has enabled me to control my headaches and continue a near normal life.",
                    "I have suffered with migraine since I was 12 yr old, and I'm now in my 50's. I've had every head exam and test possible as well as tried a myriad of medications over the years for treatment. From taking preventive type things daily to treating the pain only during the headache. Nothing has given me the swift relief as this drug. It seems to give me complete relief within 30-40 minutes, without any side effects (that I've noticed). I took immitrex for years with little relief and horrible side effects. It would make me feel dizzy, weird and always made me nauseous. So I stopped taking it. Now with the Maxalt, I'm thrilled to know I can take it without worry of unwanted side effect. Thank you Maxalt! Finally migraine relief! ",
                    "Migraines since I was 15, now in my 40's. Identified as menstrual migraines in my early 30's after 1st child, up to 5 days of migraines every 26 days. Nothing worked before, but started taking rizatriptan 9 months ago. It works every time, no side effects. I have my life back. Amazing. Recommend making a mentrual and migraine diary before going to the doctor.",
                    "Maxalt has less side effects, for me, than other Migraine Medication. Previously I have been on the Maxalt 5 but needed to go up to the Maxalt 10 which helps relieve the pain more completely. I tried many other medicines, and this has been the best for me, I believe it is different for every person. My nausea does increase on this medication, but no chest heaviness as with other medicines.",
                    "For me Maxalt is a miracle drug. I have tried almost everything OTC, and nothing worked. Excedrin worked for awhile, then after a few weeks, it stopped working. I can always count on Maxalt to get rid of my migraines. I usually feel relief within an hour of taking it. That being said ,this drug is very expensive. Even with insurance and taking the generic version, I am still out of pocket about $50 a box, and they only give you 12 pills. Sometimes I have 3 or 4 migraines in a week, so this can get really expensive. It works wonders for me though, so unfortunately it's a necessary expense.",
                    "Didn't work for me. I had serious allergic reaction. My tongue swelled up, my cheeks were going numb and had to take Benadryl within 30 minutes of taking this medicine.",
                    "I took it when I was felt a migraine coming on and I experienced dizziness, memory loss, shakiness and a fever. I had used it before with no problems.",
                    "Good relief without being too wiped out",
                    "I have suffered from migraines since I was 15 , and am now 42. Maxalt has changed my life ! I used to be in agony for up to 3 days , but now at the first sign of an attack I take one , very rarely I have had to take another one a few hours after that if it started to come back . It can sometimes make me drowsy, but other times I have no side effects , just relief that there is something that actually works . I'm in Australia, so a pack of 4 costs me $25 .",
                    "Maxalt saved my life! It is the only medicine that works for me when have a migraine attack, I swear by it and carry it with me always just in case. It literally gave me back my life, I was ill for days that ran into weeks that went into months. It was shocking, I felt suicidal with having no life and one day was sitting in my doctors room sobbing begging him to help me, and he prescribed me rizatriptan (maxalt). I love it!!",
                    "Usually the migraine wakes me up at night with the pain beginning at the base of my head. I keep the rizatriptan on my bedside table and I take it immediately. When I wake in the morning the pain is gone. Before I would wake with the pain, and it would linger for days with hardly no relief. I works great for me.",
                    "I have had no side effects to date, and the medicine quickly relieves symptoms. Best medication I have taken for treatment of migraines.",
                    "It works rather well but puts me to sleep for about 3 hours. I am still trying to find a migraine drug that does not put me to sleep. ",
                    "I have had migraines for over 30 years. Have tried everything. This works the best almost every time. I'd say 9 out of 10 times it cures the migraine and is a winner in my book.",
                    "I take Maxalt 10mg ODT when my Imitrex fails. Maxalt rarely fails and is actually my back up plan but has lately been my go to since Imitrex has stopped working completely. Maxalt is great! It works within an hour of taking it and I have little to no side effects. I give it a 9 because it does make me shake and if I take two, it will make me feel washed out the next day. Of course, all of this is an even trade for killing a migraine. Overall, great and effective drug!",
                    "Maxalt has really changed how I felt about my migraines. Before I was prescribed Maxalt, I would suffer terribly, taking only OTC medications which \"never\" helped much. Now when I feel those tell-tale signs of a migraine coming on (I do not experience any \"aura\"), I take a Maxalt (and sometimes some ibuprofen, too) and I know my migraine will be gone within the hour! And I'm not sleepy.",
                    "Maxalt is great. Once I can tell my headache is starting I take the pill. Usually in less than 30-60 minutes I forget that my head was hurting and I am able to work for 8-12 hours, smometimes longer. I agree with another comment: it gives no side effects like a rapid heart rate or chest pain. After having surgery I got spinal meningitis which started my migranes when I was 34 years old. Now at 48 I am thankful for Maxalt.",
                    "When I took a 10 mg dose it made me nauseous and super high, and now three days later I am still nauseaous and have had to call out of work because ive been feeling like im going to vomit if i stand up. I look to try and function as normal when i take abortive migraine medication, this one has made me feel worse. At least I can actually go to work when I have just a migraine.",
                    "I have had migraines since I was 9 so for 22 years now. I tried Imitrex nasals with no results. My hero of a doctor prescribed Maxalt 8 years ago and I can manage my life now. I don't have any side effects from it although it wouldn't matter since I now get relief! I have found migraine medicines are hit or miss for many so I'm beyond pleased I found a hit. I recommend Maxalt to anyone that will listen.",
                    "I am 34 years old and have suffered migraines on and off since I was about 10 years old. This is the first medication that has helped me. It great that it is a wafer and easy to take as vomiting is perhaps what stops other medications from working? Thank you maxalt, I love you!",
                    "When I was about 23, I started getting horrific migraines out of nowhere that would incapacitate me for days at a time. My neurologist couldn't find anything wrong and I tried several medications (some would take at least 12 hours to have an effect). The only medication that ever successfully treated my migraines was Maxalt and it pretty much gave me my life back. It would still take at least an hour to work but it was really a life changer. Ultimately, I sought an ENT and after I had sinus surgery (and corrected my deviated septum) in 2011, my migraines never returned. But if they ever did come back, I would be running to Maxalt as my savior again!",
                    "43 yo female migraines since 2nd grade. Some are with aura most are without. I get pain in my Left scapula that eventually radiates into the base of my skull through to my Left eye. If taken right away, I get almost total relief in 20-40 minutes. If I wait longer, it may take over an hour to work. Works over 90 percent of the time averaging 12 headaches per month. Side effects for me are a tightening sensation in my neck (where the arteries are on either side) then a \"floaty\" sensation. The pain goes away and I'm left tired, yawning frequently and a little fuzzy minded, but able to function much better than with the migraine. I've tried imitrex, zomig, midrin, and rx pain relievers. Maxalt has worked by far the best for me.",
                    "I went to see a headache specialist yesterday, and she recommended I take this for my migraines, which occur about 2-3 times a month. Of course, I woke up this morning with one. The tabs taste pretty bitter but when your head hurts, you don't really care. Just wash it down with water once it's done dissolving. Within half an hour it had subsided. As somebody who is used to suffering through them for 2 days, this is truly amazing.",
                    "Just took some for the first time 10 minutes ago and my migraine is ALREADY subsiding. Helps a lot more to put it under your tongue so it'll go into your blood stream quicker. ",
                    "Maxalt has saved me from migraines. It tends to make me a little drowsy, but that is a plus for me. I just lay down to take a nap, and when I wake up, the migraine is gone. This is also a plus at night as I could not sleep with migraines. The pounding and the pain would keep me up all night. Highly recommend this to anyone suffering from migraines. The drowsiness is not so bad that if I needed to stay awake I would be unable to.",

                    "I have had migraines since I was 11. When people say they are not hereditary...they are wrong. My grandma, mom, sisters and brothers all have them they did not even skip a generation.. my daughter and nieces as well get them. My physician calls mine sinus migraines. I get stomach pain, vomiting, an aura, light sensitivity. They had me on demerol, Percocet, phenergan, imitrex, nothing helped. I have been on maxalt a few years and the one thing I have noticed is that i get pain around the upper jaw area just under the ear...then all of a sudden like the snap of a finger all pain is gone 15 to 25 min. It makes me drowsey. I wake up from my nap feeling great but real thirsty.",
                    "Yesterday was my first time when I took Maxalt-MLT to cure my migraine. My doctor prescribed this drug six months ago but all those months I had no incidence of a migraine. Yesterday was again after my weight lifting workout. I only get migraines after a workout the last years. I always get aura for about 20 minutes before a headache begin. That is good the doctor said because I can take Maxalt faster before the pain begins. My first impression is that the aura lasted about 15 minutes and the pain was bearable in a scale of ten I would say 6.5 compared to other times that reaches 9 -10. The first 10 minutes, I was feeling a little bit weird and little dizzy. After 90 minutes the migraine got away, I think it needs about 90 minutes to act",
                    "I have suffered with severe menstrual migraines for 25+ years to the point where I fantasize about amputating my head. I was on Imitrex (made me very sleepy), Relpax (worthless) , generic (even worse). Maxalt is my go to medicine. Unfortunately its a fight with the insurance company to get regular refills. They are trying to force me to take a generic. I used to get 12 tablets and they changed it to 9- which 9 is not enough. When I run out I cannot help but pray for the day I get a refill fearing I will get a migraine before that time. When the refill day comes, I stalk my pharmacy on the phone until it is ready. Ugh...talk about \"drug-seeking\" !",

                    "Tried Imitrex and Relpax first, but had bad heart-squeezing and neck-squeezing side effects. Tried Maxalt and did not have that problem. It usually takes away the migraines, but can take 1-2 hours to get relief. I'm also very fatigued after the pain goes away, which makes daytime onset of migraines a hassle. Also for the 1-2 hours I am waiting for it to work, the pain actually intensifies until suddenly it lets go and the blood vessels in my head feel cold. Strange, but true.",
                    "Within half an hour, the headache has totally subsided. sometimes need a second dose. It does cause my skin to feel sensitive to heat and my throat feels tight for about 2 hours but the headache and all symptoms are totally gone. Brilliant",
                    "Today was my first time taking Rizatriptan and the fact that I am able to write this review just hours after the onset of a migraine is amazing because normally I would be completely down for the count for at least a whole day with a migraine. So here is my experience: I have taken countless meds before including Imitrex with terrible side effects and zero relief so naturally I was skeptical about this new med. I took it as soon as I knew that this was going to be a particularly bad migraine. The only side effect I had was sleepiness, no \"heart attack\" feeling as I had experienced with Imitrex. I fell asleep within 15 min of taking Rizatriptan and woke up 2 hours later completely migraine free.",
                    "This pill is like a magic. I just noticed that the pill works in minutes for me and I feel a bit dizziness and like a burning head and then the pain is gone. Today I got a early migraine and I was able to use the MLT and work kind of slowly but it stopped the pain in time. But I still feel very sensitive to light. Great medication ask your doctor for Maxalt or Maxalt-MLT.",
                    "As you may know, migraines are extremely debilitating even when trying to perform most menial tasks let alone professional responsibilities. I tried Maxalt for the first time today approximately 20 minutes after my first aura and it actually works. I am happily surprised! I have yet to experience any side effects. However, lets be honest, I'd be tolerant of almost anything besides a migraine - which feels like a freight train chugging through my head.",
                    "Must take within 20 minutes of onset. The longer you wait, the longer it takes to work. Keep it in your pocket/wallet at all times. For me, it is a lifesaver.",
                    "My experience was mixed. I took Maxalt MLT as soon as I had my usual \"Aura\". It worked within 30 minutes. The aura was gone and I never did get a migraine. However, within an hour I had a severe angina attack and had to take my nitro twice to relieve the pain. Nitro glycerin gives you a headache, so I think I'd rather have the migraine than the chest pain! My daughter took it and had a wonderful experience, took the pain away within 30 minutes and no side effects at all. I guess I won't be taking it again. Too bad, it worked on the migraine.",

No real side effects except a bit of drowsiness. And it is very expensive. Insurance does not cover the whole cost.",

                    "I've always had 3 day migraines. MaxAlt will take it away in about 35 minutes. Sometimes I would have to take another one (dissolved in my mouth) the next day. I cannot stress enough how much I love this medicine. I come from days when Darvon's were given for migraines, they didn't do anything but zombie you with the pain. I thank the scientist who figured out how to control whatever it is that is being controlled. Of course, it IS too expensive. Without insurance, I would have to suffer, as they are about $32 per pill!",

Since starting this miracle drug as we call it, I am myself again. The only side effect I am experiencing is having to pee a lot. I don't know if I am alone in that matter, but I would gladly substitute spending sometime in the potty then spending a whole day in the ER or in the bedroom in the dark.",
                    "The Maxalt-MLT self-dissolving tab worked wonders for me. At a time when my doctor was trying to determine the most-effective treatment form my migraine headaches, this medicine was a God-send. My doc gave me samples of various triptan meds and I was to try one out at the onset of every migraine. Of the 5-6 different samples I was given, Maxalt-MLT worked the fastest & had the least amount of side-effects. I was amazed. Unfortunately, my insurance would not cover it and I had to settle with sumatriptan. Sumatriptan worked, but it took about an hour and I just remember feeling really weird after taking it. Anyway, if/when my migraines start again- Maxalt is what I want.",

I then started trying a bunch of preventative drugs, beta blocker, calcium blockers and ssri drugs. Finally found one that works fairly well, but along with that I use maxalt as a rescue drug which I still take 6+ times a month. It's a good drug and is effective. I have always noticed the migraines redoubles its efforts before leaving after I take it. I also notice it makes me very sleepy and foggy. I don't like to take it at work because of that. 9 times out of 10 it works, but there are still times it does nothing for me. Some is better than none in my world though. I take a generic due to cost.",

I was prescribed Maxalt this past year (after trying a whole bag of other medicines). It has given me my life back... within thirty minutes after taking Maxalt the symptoms decrease by 50% and are gone within an hour. Several side effects, very drowsy and increased nausea but after several hours of sleep all is good.",
                    "I have tried OTC migraine medicines, and three other prescriptions. Maxalt is by far the best, and MLT makes it nearly perfect. The only bad side effect I have is that the back of my neck gets sore. Maxalt does this far less than Zomig, and taking Advil Liquigels or Vicodin with the Maxalt MLT helps quite a bit. My ideal treatment for a migraine is to take Maxalt MLT and Advil Liquigels, then lay down with something cold on my forehead. Once I am able to doze, I sleep until I wake up on my own. I can't believe how much better I feel after the nap. At work, I just take the two medicines. It takes me longer to feel better, but makes my headache much more bearable.",
                    "Works well, Headaches gone in about 2 hours of taking it.",
                    "99% of the time my migraine symptoms fade within an hour. I have had to take a second tablet only twice in ten years. I can function as normal. The only drawback is feeling tired and increased urination, but compared to going through a 36 hour migraine, that's nothing!",
                    "I would definitely try this for migraines if you haven't already. I had used Imitrex pills for a few years and suddenly they stopped working. I tried a couple different pills and then found Maxalt. The only problem with the pills is that I have to take them right away. Once the migraine has started they don't take away all the pain, only like 60% for me. I was on Maxalt for a few years, then put on Cymblata and didn't have migraines for 2 years on that, but then they came back and Maxalt didn't help me... Now I use Imitrex Statdose because I never catch my migraine until it's terrible but the injections get rid of the pain fast!",
                    "Miracle drug for me! Migraine gone within the hour of taking Maxalt. It made me groggy but I will take that over hours of pain",
                    "Miracle medicine! Only thing that helps my migraines and within minutes. Insurance wont cover so will have to find an alternative. If your insurance covers it, it is well worth it!",
                    "I am 56 and I've suffered with migraines since I was 5 years old. Maxalt is the only migraine medication that has worked wonders for me!! I take one as soon as I get the slightest beginning of a migraine and it is gone in 20 minutes! Not only that, but I've been taking it for 3 years now and I used to get 2 or 3 migraines a month, and now I only get about 1 every 2 months! Maxalt has been like a miracle for me...I no longer have to suffer with horrible headaches!! Additionally, I have not experienced any side effects!",
                    "One Maxalt-MLT usually gets rid of the migraine in an hour or less. Occasionally, I need another one 2 hours later to really get rid of it for good. Rarely, even the second one did not quite do it for me. But this is still the most effective medicine that's worked for me, after trying 8-10 other medicines (over-the-counter and prescription).",
                    "This is a miracle drug! I've tried all sorts of medicines over the past 30 some years and this drug is the only one that has ever stopped my migraines. If you are like me and have migraines often, then you got to try this drug, of course not all people have the same experience with medicines, but it is well worth trying.",
                    "I am a 35yo female and had my first migraine at 16yo just after giving birth to my firstborn. Over the years, particularly after each baby, the symptoms have become worse and are always experienced during menstruation. Recently codeine products that would normally help are not even touching the sides of the pain, and I have been experiencing increasing levels of sickness that anti-nausea tablets don't have any impact on. But yesterday a friend gave me a maxalt wafer because I couldn't function under the intensity of the sickness and pain. At first it didn't seem to do anything. But after maybe an hour to 90 minutes and I was no longer sick, nor was I in pain!! It was like a miracle!! How ever vision was slightly more blurred than usual.",
                    "Took this for the first time last night. Worked as well as Relpax (which my insurance no longer covers). I could actually get a good night's sleep!",
                    "Works well for my migraines. For me, I start feeling better in 20 minutes or so, and am completely back to normal within two hours.",
                    "Maxalt does work. Usually Fioricet works but when my migraine becomes worse Fioricet doesn't do anything and Maxalt does the trick!",
                    "This is the best sos pill for migraines, I barely have side-effects from it and if I melt it in my mouth it acts much faster killing my migraine in less than 20 minutes. I cannot imagine my life without Rizatriptan !! It gave me my life back!",
                    "I've been using maxalt for about 6 years (give or take) and it's about the only medication I've found that really gets rid of my migraines. The MLT version is great when your stomach's so upset you can't keep down a pill, too. The only side effect I've ever had is a tingling feeling in my shoulders. Well worth the co-pay!",
                    "I started taking Maxalt after horrible experiences with Imitrex. I had almost all the same side effects: extreme nausea, dizziness, falling asleep, and a general out of it feeling the rest of the day. But the worst part is that it did absolutely nothing for my migraine. I am just glad that I had samples so I didn't get stuck paying for a prescription I would not use. ",
                    "I have suffered migraines since childhood 2-5 migraines a year. Then at about 38 I started getting these horrible severely debilitating headaches 1-3 times a year and the headaches would last up to weeks with intermittent increase in severity. I was finally diagnosed with cluster headaches and prescribed Rizatriptan. If I feel the onset it diminishes the intensity and duration. I have been using it for 2 years and very grateful.",
                    "My first time taking it. I have complex partial seizures and my aura has changed to where I now have migraine headaches afterwards. We are doing test to rule out other problems but this medicine helped me more than anything so far. Still have that groggy feeling afterwards but I can deal with that. Just do not know how I can take it should I have to at work since I work in a call center 10 hours a day with constant calls.",
                    "I have used maxalt four times in the last three months. The first time it worked fine and it was gone in a few hours but had heart racing.  The second migraine I was concerned about the side effects but gave a second chance. I had severe throbbing in my head like it was going to explode and then suddenly the migraine broke.  My third attempt my migraine was so severe that I had to take a second dose for relief! I find that if I take it on the onset it works but still light headache and felt numbing sensation.  My fourth today no relief after 2nd dose. Took 3rd after 4 hours but still feeling migraine. Had slight heart racing and throbbing pain. I may continue to see if this is right meds. If not, then I think there's no hope for me!",
                    "Works fast limited side effects.",
                    "This is the only migraine medicine that consistently gets rid of my migraines. I've tried Zomig, Imitrex, and many others - but Maxalt gets it gone in 15-30 minutes and I'm back, up and ready to get back into life. I can even take one at work and just rest my eyes at my desk until it kicks in. Never could do that before.",
                    "This medicine is a miracle drug. I have migraines that last for 3 days and until my doctor prescribed maxalt I could not get rid of them or function properly. Now I take a pill and within 30 min it is gone. My life is so much nicer I am up moving around exercising and actually living my life like a normal person.",
                    "I call this my \"miracle drug\". I had been suffering from constant migraines since I was 9 years old. I am now 64. They used to tell my parents I was \"high-strung\" and had \"tension headaches\". I was never diagnosed with migraine until I was about 48 years old. This is the ONLY drug that has ever stopped my migraine (of course...you have to take it immediately at the onset, as with all migraine meds). I had lost so many days of my life to the extreme pain/nausea and impaired vision/speech/general functionality before I discovered rizatriptan. Quite literally, I thank God for leading someone to develop this and for someone prescribing it for me.",
                    "I am a 42 yr old male and I have been susceptible to migraines since I was very little. My worst childhood memories are of me moaning and rocking back and forth in agony on my bed when suffering from my very first migraines as an 8 or 9 yr old child. I too have not had any luck with Imitrex and some of the other medicines mentioned in this post. My insurance gives me terrible problems when I am trying to get a migraine prescription filled. As it is right now I have figured out that Axert and Maxalt are the only two medicines that I know will work for certain when I am afflicted and totally incapacitated by migraine headaches. The problem with Axert is that my insurance will only allow a monthly script of 6 tablets at $10/tablet. Maxalt does it for less dollars.",
                    "Migraine, the word can't convey the impact on life. For me, a typical one lasted about 36 hours, followed by another 24 hours of \"hangover\". Somewhere during the 36 hour duration, would be 12 hours of hell. I've used Maxalt MLT about 10-12 times over the last 6 months. It has worked every time; I take one when I sense a migraine is starting, and it just doesn't \"blossom\". I have no side effects, no nausea, and no drowsiness. Sometime in the next 20-30 minutes I'll realize the apprehension, tension and other precursors to the migraine have just disappeared. Migraines took too much of my life, and at their worst, pushed depression to the edge of suicide; it's good to have a normal life back.",
                    "Maxalt is the only migraine medicine I have tried, and it works well for me. When I take it early (before it becomes a full-bloomed migraine), it works within maybe 30 minutes, completely getting rid of the pain. I do have some side effects: most of the time, I feel a tightening of the throat for about 15 minutes after taking it (my doctor had warned me about that), and if I happen to be a bit tired when taking it, I feel a bit dizzy for a couple of hours. But it sure beats a 24-hour migraine.",
                    "I have tried different medicines for migraines, all just calmed it down a little, it just had to run its 3 day duration. Am seeing another Dr & she put me on Maxalt yesterday, my migraine was gone within an hour of taking it. I just want to go back and hug her because after 5 yrs of trying I just accepted my pain. It made me drowsy, but I will take drowsy over pain any day.",
                    "Amazing! I took Imitrex for years and it didn't really help. Maxalt is the only medication that works for me to continue my busy life. I have had hormonal migraines since I was 12. Tried everything from pain medicines (temporary fix) to nasal to shots. I love Maxalt!",
                    "I had my doubts that this would work -- it was fantastic! within 15-20 minutes the pain that felt like my skull was in a vise disappeared. I am a horse trainer and I work full time on my own farm, and I can't function when I have a migraine, ( 4-5 attacks a month, 24-48 hours each time) Maxalt 10-mg was a miracle for me. I don't have to put all the work on my daughter, and my temper has become much more even. The anxiety of worrying about a migraine attack has helped enormously, for my emotional state, too. **side note** I had a Mirena IUD and had it removed, I believe this contributed to the attacks, so hopefully in 4-6 weeks I won't need the Maxalt, either.",
                    "This works wonders for me, but makes me a little nutty for awhile. Better than migraines by a long shot. They try and make it taste minty, but still a little foul tasting.",
                    "Works within minutes usually. Have not noted any side effects with it although I do not care for taste. After it melts and is gone, I drink water to get taste out of my mouth.",
                    "Maxalt relieves my migraine in 1 hour however it does make me sleepy. I love the fast dissolve feature. I will have to stop using it however due to the rising cost not covered by my insurance company. I am now hoping Imitrex will work as well.",
                    "I have used this medication for over 3 years now. Just recently I was told to take 2 instead of one since my migraines seem to be getting worse each time (I blame it on MS). Nothing else works for me. I can deal with the kids bickering. I carry this drug with me always! ",
                    "This medication always takes my migraine away. It is the only medicine that has done that for me. Sometimes I do get rebound headaches from the medicine, but I am pleased that I have finally found something to take the migraine away. I just wish I could find something to alleviate my migraines altogether because I get them way too often."

                    "//What is it?//Headache and migraine are different entities. Migraine is one of the most common and well characterized, but there are 14 broad categories that can be subdivided into more than 200 different forms. Migraine itself has about 20 different genres. In general, headaches are divided into two large groups: primary and secondary. Primary illnesses correspond to a disease, not reflecting other health problems and represent around 90% of the total. Secondary symptoms are symptoms of diseases of the nervous system or other organs of the human body. They can occur in cases of flu, alcohol poisoning or withdrawal, minor head trauma, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels) or a high blood pressure crisis. Migraine is a primary headache in which very intense episodes of pain occur interspersed with periods without symptoms. In general, it begins between the ages of 15 and 40, but it can appear in childhood or shortly after the first menstruation. If it appears for the first time after the age of 45, other causes must be excluded. Some of its characteristics are closely associated with the female reproductive cycle: higher prevalence after the first menstruation or during the menstrual period; occasional worsening due to taking birth control pills or hormone therapy; attenuation or disappearance during pregnancy or menopause. Before adolescence, migraines affect boys and girls equally. From then on, it is two to three times more common in females. It is estimated that 8% to 15% of individuals living in Western countries (including Portugal) suffer from this problem. The fact of reaching people in the productive phase implies large economic, social and family costs.//Symptoms//It appears recurrently, several times throughout life, but always with completely free intervals. If it occurs every day, it is probably overuse of painkillers or other medications. Drug abuse can convert a migraine into a chronic daily headache. There are people who preferably appear on the weekend. These crises can be precipitated by changes in sleep schedule, failure to eat breakfast, reduced stress or alcohol abuse. In these cases, it is important to consider a lifestyle change over the weekend. The symptoms are intense and often prevent work or study. The pain tends to be throbbing, worsening with physical exertion or head movements. In general, it affects only one side of the head, and is accompanied by nausea, vomiting, intolerance to light, noise and some smells. It is not mandatory that all of these elements are present simultaneously. And they can occur twice a week or just a few throughout a lifetime. During attacks, people seek a dark, quiet place to rest or fall asleep. An episode can last from a few hours to three days. Between attacks, there are usually no complaints. Some types of migraines may have more complex symptoms (with aura). These forms are less common, affecting around 15% of people with this problem, and include transient neurological symptoms, originating attributable to certain areas of the brain. The other signs are identical to those of migraine without aura. The most common auras are temporary vision disorders, in the form of loss of vision on one side of the visual field, blurred images, perception of bright points, geometric figures or bright zigzags. Other auras can be translated as tingling or numbness on one side of the face or one of the hands. There are people who have difficulty speaking or even temporary paralysis of their limbs, usually only on one side of the body. These changes last about 10 to 30 minutes and precede the pain. In children, migraines tend to be bilateral, less intense and of shorter duration. Vomiting and dark circles can be exuberant. Disturbances in sleep and meal schedules are common precipitating factors. Treating these crises is easier than in adults. Sleep usually gives good results. At these ages, the occipital location is not normal and, when present, requires a medical consultation. Likewise, the presence of headaches with morning vomiting or other unusual symptoms in very young children should be seen by a healthcare professional.//Causes//It is caused by a combination of brain processes: excitation/depression of cells, dilation of arteries and release of chemicals. People with migraine are more sensitive to certain stimuli, environmental or from their own body, that can trigger these brain processes. It is also thought that there is some genetic susceptibility. Some individuals can identify the signs of their attacks. The most common are cheese, chocolate, strawberries, seafood, wine, artificial sauces, changes in sleep patterns, stress, menstruation, fasting, physical exercise, and minor trauma. Others cannot identify them at all. People who drink coffee regularly may experience headaches when they stop this habit.//Diagnosis//The key to diagnosis lies in the clinical history, physical and neurological examination. Observation of the fundus is a very important part of these procedures. In some cases, it may be necessary to resort to computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to exclude other diseases.//Treatment//Migraines have no cure but can be controlled. There are medications and behaviors that can reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks. Symptomatic treatment, during acute periods, involves resting in a quiet, dark place. Pressure or cold can be applied to the area of \u200b\u200bpain. At this stage, analgesics, anti-inflammatories, antiemetics and triptans are very useful.//Prevention//People with migraines should create calendars that allow them to identify their symptoms and assess their impact on their quality of life. The first step in prevention is to identify and eliminate precipitating factors, whenever possible. In some cases, it is necessary to use daily medication to reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks, but there are no drugs specifically developed for their prevention. However, there are some drugs used in other contexts that have proven to be effective, such as beta-blockers, antidepressants or antiepileptics, and these should always be prescribed by a doctor.

                    "At 59 years of age have been suffering migraines since I was 21. Think I have tried every medication available in the UK. Maxalt is the only thing that has ever worked for me.Pain usually gone after 20 minutes, before I took Maxalt I could be in bed for 2 days rolling around in agony. Only side effects are tiredness and strangely It makes me sneeze just once as soon as I have taken it. Maxalt has completely changed my life. Fortunate to live in UK as I get it free on national health prescription.",
                    "I have had migraines since I was 12 yrs. Old, I am 67. As a child I just suffered all the time. When I was in my late 20's, fiorinal was the answer. It did help. There have been a couple of others (can't remember the name). Then imitrex came out. Didn't work. I did not find relief, even with addition of percocet until maxalt came out. Thank heavens. Mostly 20 days per month. I learned very quickly first sign for me is a slice of pain, then I immediately take the maxalt. Within a half hour, 99% gone. I have been so fortunate to have medicine coverage through private employer insurance with reasonable copay, otherwise it would affect my ability to support myself. I take over 12 meds per day..No interactions",
                    "Works within 2 hours but my migraine always returns the next day. I take the medication the next day - headache goes away within two hours - comes back the next day again. Medication works but I feel extremely tired and depressed for the three days. Insurance companies also limit me to 9 pills a month which adds to my stress.",
                    "This medication worked great for me to get rid of my headache. When I take it before I feel a bad migraine coming on, it alleviates it before it gets bad. My only complaint about this medication is I get really bad heart burn and I really do not sleep that well while I am on it. I guess you can%u2019t have everything.",
                    "I occasionally get migraine when I have been in stressful situations. It appears that my migraine are related to a deficit of serotonin. I also get migraines in stores that sell lots of cheap plastic items. This medication is 100% effective for me.",
                    "Puts me in nice restful deep sleep (normal 7hr night), walk up in morning migraine gone, with no hangover feeling that you would normally get if went to ER for a shot.",
                    "To me, this is the ONE medicine I can not live without. I have had to try others due to insurance, and none comes even close! Within 15-30 even the strongest, wanting to smash my head-in migraine will be totally gone! No side effects for me either. Never makes me tired, groggy or the medicated feeling. Taken on empty stomach while in college class and had no problems finishing the class and going home to play with the kids and not the mom who was hiding in a dark room with no noise allowed in the house.",
                    "Maxalt has worked wonders for me. When I have migraines I never feel like swallowing tablets, so the fact that I have the dissolving tablet is an absolute bonus. Before this medicine I was bedridden for days at a time, and after a migraine, my head always felt so heavy and like a bowling ball. Now however I am able to go to work the next day. I recommend it to every person I meet!",
                    "My daily headaches started after a ventricular assist device (VAD). Maxalt has worked beautifully in killing the pain. Occasionally I will wake up with a headache the following day, but not severe enough to warrant another dose. I am careful to avoid triggers so don't have to take this very often. I am grateful that I have this option since I am allergic to NSAIDs.",
                    "Very effective with no side effects (i.e. drowsiness). I've had mixed luck with other migraine medicines, but find Maxalt MLT to be consistently helpful.",
                    "I have suffered from migraines for at least 15 years and tried so many medications and therapies to help. Maxalt is the only thing that helps me. I have missed a day to three of work in a row from migraines and now do not have to miss any. It takes the pain away within an hour. I don't get any effects from the drug really, maybe a bit tired once and awhile. My only complaint is the wafer tastes pretty gnarly but it is worth it!",
                    "If taken at the start of a migraine this medicine works wonders . There are side effects such as dry mouth, tiredness, and joint aches. But as anyone who has migraines know that is a small price to pay for relief from the migraine itself.",
                    "I've suffered from Pure Menstrual Migraine for 4 years. Nothing I have tried to date has helped ease any of the migraine pain at all, which usually goes on for 3 days solid every month, le. Until now. I asked my dr if I could try Rizatriptan and he agreed. My warning sign that a migraine is on it's way is an ache down the left hand side of my face. Well, within the last hour I got that warning so took my first ever Rizatriptan dissove in the mouth tablet. Revolting! Utterly vile - like a really bad mint that went off years ago. However, rather than spit it out (since they are very expensive) I let it dissolve. Now 40 mins later I have no ache and no pain, and I hope that means that I will not get a mega-migraine! So far so good ..",
                    "I avoid drugs of all kinds and I'm a usually healthy person. After suffering years from horribly painful headaches that would leave me vomiting all day and totally out of it (I thought it was due to whiplash injury), my doctor prescribed Rizatriptan 10mg. It truly is a miracle drug for me. I use the melt-away tablets, and find the relief starts in about 15 minutes, and by 30 minutes, any headache is gone. I take them at the very beginning of symptoms. I do get sleepy, so I've learned that I can just take half a tablet, get the same result, and not feel so tired. I have had very slight jaw pain once or twice, and cutting back the dosage also alleviated that problem.",
                    "Since I was about 26 I have suffered from migraines (now 65) and tried everything from daily preventative meds, to expensive self injecting & very expensive medication, then cafegot suppositories with 3 aspro clear for the pain, I could spend hours and days feeling like dying and vomiting non stop, then there was a shortage of cafegot and that was hell, and finally they took it off the market, that is when my Dr. asked me to trial Maxalt wafers, at first I thought nothing could replace cafegot and I was very conscious of not taking ergotomine with rizatriptan. Maxalt is the best, it works within an hour, and so far after 4-5 years no side effects at all, and no more vomiting ever. Also I do not take any other drugs for anything, but Maxalt.",
                    "Maxalt is truly one of the most amazing migraine medications I have ever tried, and believe me, having migraines as a child and now at 52 years of age, there have been many. As a migrainer, we truly know what suffering is. Maxalt is the best, although, after losing my job 18 months ago and with no success of getting another, it is too expensive. From my understanding the patent expires in 2012. I truly hope the price goes down for those of us who cannot be without it.",
                    "43 yr old male.For me this is close to a miracle cure, it has given my life back. I have had stomach and esophagus lesions due to way too much aspirin/ ibuprofen/digesics/codeine trying to halt an attack. No more screaming in E.R rooms waiting for pethidine/morphine. No more thoughts off grabbing a drill to stop the throbbing pain. I actually have a life after 26 yrs of suffering 2-4 attacks a week each last up to 36 hrs each. Numerous preventive medicines didn%u2019t work. I am truly in debt to the manufacturers and the on call doctor who gave me to Maxalt. Takes about 40-90 minutes to work with a second dosage sometimes needed. My fear is the more i take it the less effective it will become as lately I need the second wafer.",
                    "Bad headaches. This medicine works like it says it should.",
                    "I am very greatful for Maxalt wafers as they help me get rid of my migraines, although the side effects of insane burning and jaw pain last and hour before, the wafer curing my migraine.  Half half if you can endure the pain, its wonderful",
                    "Wonder drug. I tried many others. Maxalt MLT works so quick and free of all the usual side effects. I can use Maxalt MLT and within 30-60 minutes return to normal activities free of the normal after migraine haziness. It has given me my life back. Many thanks to Dr. Z. for prescribing this.",
                    "This medication is labeled a wonder drug in my household. It is the last line of defense and treatment for migraine. However and very sadly I might add recently the copay my insurance company imposed is going to make it hard to take. Limited to 4 tablets per week (while they state all medicines are calculated at a monthly dose level) NOW a copay of $60 per script makes it $240 for each myself and my wife. We just can't afford this after paying $2400.00 monthly for the insurance coverage. We are being choked to death! If the medicine was covered properly under the contract we could handle the $60 copay per month but because they limit the medication to 3-4 tablets per week. ",
                    "I took it for the first time today. My migraine was gone within an hour; however, it made me really sleepy. Three hours later, I'm still very groggy. Next time, I think I'll stay home from work and sleep it off. But missing work is what I'm trying to avoid. I'm incredibly thrilled that my migraine is gone, though.",
                    "I have suffered from hormonal migraines since puberty and am now in my fifties. I tried every option the Doctor could offer but nothing helped until I found Maxalt Melt about ten years ago. I call them my magic pill as they can clear a migraine completely within an hour. Very occasionally I have to take a second dose. They work for me with minimal side effects and are worth every penny. I'm in the UK so can get them on prescription.",
                    "I use this medication to help my migraines. I used to take Relpax. I quit taking it because it was too expensive and the side effects were strong. I like this medication because my insurance covers most of it and it is very effective with little side effects. The only cons are the taste (a little minty but the end has a bitter taste), I seem to get different side effects each time I take it (very mild, includes some drowsiness and nausea), also in my experience you need to take this medication as soon as you feel the migraine coming on or you may find yourself taking two or three pills during the migraine every two hours to keep it gone. Overall I find it very cost friendly and effective. I will continue using this medication.",
                    "My Migraine did Not go away . It might have only marginally lessened it . I went to bed for two hours and have felt terrible all day . This medication made me very sleepy . I took a Second Wafer some hours later but there was Still No Improvement ! Now I cannot take any other migraine medication for a whole 24 hours. Which is far too long . I made the mistake of taking the second wafer when the first one wasn't helping. I already had Jaw Pain so reading that others get it as a side effect makes me wonder. It reminds me of Imigraine and I thought that useless. Sydney Australia 2015.05.18",
                    "I've had ever-worsening migraines since I was in my 40's (I'm now 73). When they started, all that was available were drugs like Fiorinal and other mind-scrambling drugs. Finally, the triptans came along and saved my life. I started with Imitrex and tried the various other triptans, but Maxalt was the most effective. I would like to share one important observation: When I first started taking triptans, I had very few side effects, and was able to function at a high-level job, run home with kids, etc. HOWEVER, as I got older, I realized that side-effects emerged which have only gotten stronger over time. e.g. fogginess, sleepiness, nausea, etc. -- so be aware that side-effects can increase with age. Still, Maxalt is a life-saver.",
                    "I have been taking Maxalt for a couple of years and it's the only migraine medicine that gets rid of the pain without making me sick. I have a couple of side effects: tingling in my jaw, neck, and spine and also it makes me have to pee a lot. ",

I am now 61 and still get them, sometimes every few months and sometimes I can go several years, but when they hit, the are debilitating and I never know how many days or weeks they will continue. My physician gave me a sample to try as I had been having these headaches almost everyday for 2 or more weeks. Within 30-45 minutes the pressure and pain were gone and my drooping, puffy eye looked normal again. I plan to ask my doctor if he can prescribe a larger quantity so I can take them during these lengthy episodes. I would love to be part of a study on the efficacy of this drug on cluster headache patients. Wish I had known about it sooner.",
                    "This Med is nothing short of a miracle. Quick acting and has broken the cycle this making frequency decrease. Wish my insurance wasn't so tight on filling. I've waited years fora generic & they finally covered 4 pills. Woo hoo! Cheaper than an ER visit that doesn't even work as quickly. I would recommend this product to everyone who mentions the word migraine.",

I admit I get extremely sleepy after I take it but a 1 hour nap and I'm back in business. Much better then four days of blinding pain that's for sure it is very expensive but I contacted my local clinic and they had me fill out some forms and received a free 6 month supply at which time I can reapply. You can also try contacting the company online they may help depending on your income.",

Its heaven sent. You have to take it as soon as you feel a migraine coming on. Also it makes me very sleepy. But almost all medications do that to me. If you haven't taken it ...get it. It will solve your migraine problems.",

Makes me feel a little nauseated for a few minutes but within 20 minutes my headache and nausea is gone. Now I have to figure out how to get more then my insurance will allow me to get in a month.... They only allow 9 a month :-/ Way better than Imatrex!",

                    "I've had migraines since I was 11 and was first prescribed Maxalt when I was 17. It's wonderful. I take it as soon as I start to notice the signs of a migraine and about 70% of the time the first dose does the job, within an hour or less. Occasionally I take a second dose if the symptoms haven't gone after 2-3 hours. Very occasionally it doesn't work at all. It has improved my life enormously. I evangelize about it. My migraines used to last up to 3 days - now I get a unkillable one only once or twice a year. Side effects for me are (as someone else has mentioned) one sneeze within a few minutes of taking it, a little drowsiness and eventually a little euphoria (though maybe that's a rational response to knowing the migraine has gone).",
                    "I've had migraines for years and have been given everything for them. I also believe I've gone through every triptan that one could imagine. This medicine has been phenomenal in relieving really tough migraine pain. Within 30 minutes I can get relief. Also, I like that you can get it in sublingual form. Sometimes my migraines are so bad that I'm constantly throwing up everything. When I'm nauseous the sublingual form is wonderful, however, it also comes in a tiny tablet. I keep this with me at all times. It has saved me from multiple hospital visits in the past. Hope this helps!",

After trying almost everything, including OTC meds and other tryptans that didn't work, I am so glad my Dr gave me Maxalt .It works every time. Very rarely I need a second dose, but I know it will always work.This drug has saved me from calling in sick to work on many occasions, and I can even take it at work if I need it, as I don't experience any side effects from it. My only complaint is the expense. Even with insurance and using generic, my copay is still $31 for only 12 pills that are supposed to last me a month.If I refill the prescription before that month ,the copay goes up to $50. Sometimes I will get 3 or 4 migraines a week, so 12 pills is just not enough.This is a great drug though.",
                    "Maxalt, especially the melt aways are simply amazing. I've had to take them off and on for years. (Going quite awhile without migraines.) Then the generic was introduced. I've tried two different kinds. They are not the same! The generic makes my headache get worse right after I take it, then about 1/2 hour later it might work. I'm usually asleep soon after that. I searched for the 'real' deal again and it is as I remembered. Started working RIGHT away with very little side effects. Maybe sore throat. Such a miracle for me. It is expensive at times depending on whim of insurance coverage, but I will pay to have pain go away!",
                    "I've suffered from severe, debilitating migraines since I was 30 (I'm now 49). I've been prescribed everything under the sun but Maxalt is the ONLY medication that works for me. First of all, it dissolves under my tongue so I know that if I vomit, I won't throw it up. Secondly, and especially if I take it at the first sign of a migraine, it usually only takes about 30 minutes to kick in and fully eradicate my migraine. Imitrex and the others I've been on haven't worked or haven't worked as completely as Maxalt. I consider it a life saver.",

Within 1 hour the migraine was gone and within 2 hours I was back to normal and working. This is truly a miracle medicine for me. I also take 100 mg of Topamax daily so that has really cut down on the migraines but again the Maxalt was a lifesaver for me today. I am worried about my copay after reading some of the post on here but I do have to say that I think it will be worth it.",

These would last a whole 7 days with the first 24 hrs being hell! Its hard to explain to non-sufferers how painful these are. All of you will know what I am on about. Couldn't believe how amazing Maxalt was, didn't even reach the painful stage but it was totally gone. Works every time straight away for me. I take it along with codeine also prescribed. Tiny side effect, cramps in tummy but goes away within 30 mins. Worth it though!",

When I feel a migraine coming on I take one of the 10 mg dissolvable tablets and it soon disappears. Occasionally I do end up with a full-blown migraine (because I'm forgetful and don't always have Maxalt on me) and taking two doses helps it go away much more quickly than it would otherwise.

I didn't understand what I had, what set it off or why I had it. And the pain and all of the vomiting. EVERYTHING hurt. Any light, the slightest noise and any movement I made while in bed made the migraine worse and I'd start vomiting NON-STOP. The doctor prescribed Maxalt to me. I didn't even know they MADE medicines for migraines and I have to say I cannot be without it. But as the directions state, take AS SOON as you feel a migraine (not just a headache) coming on. Your body usually gives you signs, for me it's excessive yawning every few seconds and irritability.",

About 10 years ago I realized they only came from neck pain and chiropractic did not help. After an exceptionally bad reaction 3 years ago to Cafergot, I was prescribed Maxalt and it became my wonder medicine. I have not had a migraine now in nearly 18 months (something in my neck has moved to relieve the pressure) but I still take Maxalt when nothing else will get rid of a bad headache after all night pain last night, it was gone in 10 minutes when I finally took it this morning.

I don't like taking medications, I try to do things naturally, think this really really helped, and I have so much relief. Kudos to the angel who told me about it from Medicare, while we were trying to sort out my card going missing",

My unforeshadowed migraines feature very mild headaches; instead, I first lost my sense of balance, then my lunch, and then the desire to live for the next three hours. Although I was on a migraine-suppressing tricyclic and metroprolol, migraines would punch through two to eight times a month. Maxalt shutdown such migraines within 20 minutes-no side effects. (NOTE: Maxalt did not suppress the rare aura). After further adjustment of my daily medicines, my rescue medicine became Relpax  2 Aleve.",
                    "Tried some samples of Maxalt and while it got rid of my (minor in this case) migraine, I did experience a side effect that made me more than a bit nervous. I experienced numbness in my left hand and arm. My doctor told me to immediately stop using it. I'm a bit saddened that I can't continue on Maxalt as it did get rid of my migraine and definitely worked better than Imitrex, but not worth the risk of the side effect I experienced.",
                    "I had no luck with this medicine. I have tried a few different migraine medicines: Maxalt, Imitrex, Treximet, Fiortal, Indocin, Vicodin, and Percocet. I have suffered from migraines for 4 years, however I am able to recognize the signs before an attack. I attempted to take the Maxalt at the first sign of the migraine and nothing happened. On the other hand, I tried Treximet and had WONDERFUL results. Treximet is expensive, but if you have a healthcare plan that covers it, it works wonders (assuming you catch the migraine early). I am now on a daily dose of Topamax that has drastically cut the number of severe migraines per month .",

I sometimes go for long periods of time with no migraines, but then I can have migraine and accompanying neck pain that goes on for 2 days or more.  I've been on Fiorinal, then Fioricet, and just recently, Maxalt. Recently, I asked my Dr about having a different medication that would be legal to take to Europe, as Fioricet is banned in at least some, if not all, countries in Europe. Since another Dr had previously tried prescribing Maxalt, he had me try this. It WORKS. I find it works better and faster than other meds, and I don't feel woozy when taking it.

Migraines are very severe and symptoms include non stop vomiting, lack of balance, loss of sensation, sensitivity to light, sound, etc. Rizatriptan works for a migraine attack which is not so severe. It has to be taken immediately. I usually lie down quietly for 20 minutes after taking it and then it works. It does not completely get rid of the headache, but suppresses it. This allows you to get on with your day. It makes me very tired, and makes my body feel heavy. Reactions are sometimes slower, so don't drive. If it does not work within 20-30 minutes, then it won't.

The pill used to take 30 and often the headache had time to bloom and get bad by then. They didn't immediately get rid of the nausea I get, but it went away in about 20 min after it stopped the bloom. I rated these as a 9 because of the taste. They taste a bit like a peppermint candy that's gone bad, but it's bearable and only lasts for about 5 seconds. I usually wash the flavor away with coffee - I like to back up anything I take for a headache with a good dose of caffeine. These will be replacing my Maxalt pills even if they do taste awful.",

I've had every head exam and test possible as well as tried a myriad of medications over the years for treatment. From taking preventive type things daily to treating the pain only during the headache. Nothing has given me the swift relief as this drug. It seems to give me complete relief within 30-40 minutes, without any side effects (that I've noticed). I took immitrex for years with little relief and horrible side effects. It would make me feel dizzy, weird and always made me nauseous. So I stopped taking it. Now with the Maxalt, I'm thrilled to know I can take it without worry of unwanted side effect. Thank you Maxalt! Finally migraine relief! ",

Previously I have been on the Maxalt 5 but needed to go up to the Maxalt 10 which helps relieve the pain more completely.

I can always count on Maxalt to get rid of my migraines. I usually feel relief within an hour of taking it. That being said ,this drug is very expensive. Even with insurance and taking the generic version, I am still out of pocket about $50 a box, and they only give you 12 pills. Sometimes I have 3 or 4 migraines in a week, so this can get really expensive. It works wonders for me though, so unfortunately it's a necessary expense.",

                    "I take Maxalt 10mg ODT when my Imitrex fails. Maxalt rarely fails and is actually my back up plan but has lately been my go to since Imitrex has stopped working completely. Maxalt is great! It works within an hour of taking it and I have little to no side effects. I give it a 9 because it does make me shake and if I take two, it will make me feel washed out the next day. Of course, all of this is an even trade for killing a migraine. Overall, great and effective drug!",
                    "Maxalt has really changed how I felt about my migraines. Before I was prescribed Maxalt, I would suffer terribly, taking only OTC medications which \"never\" helped much. Now when I feel those tell-tale signs of a migraine coming on (I do not experience any \"aura\"), I take a Maxalt (and sometimes some ibuprofen, too) and I know my migraine will be gone within the hour! And I'm not sleepy.",
                    "Maxalt is great. Once I can tell my headache is starting I take the pill. Usually in less than 30-60 minutes I forget that my head was hurting and I am able to work for 8-12 hours, smometimes longer. I agree with another comment: it gives no side effects like a rapid heart rate or chest pain. After having surgery I got spinal meningitis which started my migranes when I was 34 years old. Now at 48 I am thankful for Maxalt.",
                    "When I took a 10 mg dose it made me nauseous and super high, and now three days later I am still nauseaous and have had to call out of work because ive been feeling like im going to vomit if i stand up. I look to try and function as normal when i take abortive migraine medication, this one has made me feel worse. At least I can actually go to work when I have just a migraine.",
                    "I have had migraines since I was 9 so for 22 years now. I tried Imitrex nasals with no results. My hero of a doctor prescribed Maxalt 8 years ago and I can manage my life now. I don't have any side effects from it although it wouldn't matter since I now get relief! I have found migraine medicines are hit or miss for many so I'm beyond pleased I found a hit. I recommend Maxalt to anyone that will listen.",
                    "I am 34 years old and have suffered migraines on and off since I was about 10 years old. This is the first medication that has helped me. It great that it is a wafer and easy to take as vomiting is perhaps what stops other medications from working? Thank you maxalt, I love you!",
                    "When I was about 23, I started getting horrific migraines out of nowhere that would incapacitate me for days at a time. My neurologist couldn't find anything wrong and I tried several medications (some would take at least 12 hours to have an effect). The only medication that ever successfully treated my migraines was Maxalt and it pretty much gave me my life back. It would still take at least an hour to work but it was really a life changer. Ultimately, I sought an ENT and after I had sinus surgery (and corrected my deviated septum) in 2011, my migraines never returned. But if they ever did come back, I would be running to Maxalt as my savior again!",
                    "43 yo female migraines since 2nd grade. Some are with aura most are without. I get pain in my Left scapula that eventually radiates into the base of my skull through to my Left eye. If taken right away, I get almost total relief in 20-40 minutes. If I wait longer, it may take over an hour to work. Works over 90 percent of the time averaging 12 headaches per month. Side effects for me are a tightening sensation in my neck (where the arteries are on either side) then a \"floaty\" sensation. The pain goes away and I'm left tired, yawning frequently and a little fuzzy minded, but able to function much better than with the migraine. I've tried imitrex, zomig, midrin, and rx pain relievers. Maxalt has worked by far the best for me.",
                    "I went to see a headache specialist yesterday, and she recommended I take this for my migraines, which occur about 2-3 times a month. Of course, I woke up this morning with one. The tabs taste pretty bitter but when your head hurts, you don't really care. Just wash it down with water once it's done dissolving. Within half an hour it had subsided. As somebody who is used to suffering through them for 2 days, this is truly amazing.",
                    "Just took some for the first time 10 minutes ago and my migraine is ALREADY subsiding. Helps a lot more to put it under your tongue so it'll go into your blood stream quicker. ",
                    "Maxalt has saved me from migraines. It tends to make me a little drowsy, but that is a plus for me. I just lay down to take a nap, and when I wake up, the migraine is gone. This is also a plus at night as I could not sleep with migraines. The pounding and the pain would keep me up all night. Highly recommend this to anyone suffering from migraines. The drowsiness is not so bad that if I needed to stay awake I would be unable to.",

                    "I have had migraines since I was 11. When people say they are not hereditary...they are wrong. My grandma, mom, sisters and brothers all have them they did not even skip a generation.. my daughter and nieces as well get them. My physician calls mine sinus migraines. I get stomach pain, vomiting, an aura, light sensitivity. They had me on demerol, Percocet, phenergan, imitrex, nothing helped. I have been on maxalt a few years and the one thing I have noticed is that i get pain around the upper jaw area just under the ear...then all of a sudden like the snap of a finger all pain is gone 15 to 25 min. It makes me drowsey. I wake up from my nap feeling great but real thirsty.",
                    "Yesterday was my first time when I took Maxalt-MLT to cure my migraine. My doctor prescribed this drug six months ago but all those months I had no incidence of a migraine. Yesterday was again after my weight lifting workout. I only get migraines after a workout the last years. I always get aura for about 20 minutes before a headache begin. That is good the doctor said because I can take Maxalt faster before the pain begins. My first impression is that the aura lasted about 15 minutes and the pain was bearable in a scale of ten I would say 6.5 compared to other times that reaches 9 -10. The first 10 minutes, I was feeling a little bit weird and little dizzy. After 90 minutes the migraine got away, I think it needs about 90 minutes to act",
                    "I have suffered with severe menstrual migraines for 25+ years to the point where I fantasize about amputating my head. I was on Imitrex (made me very sleepy), Relpax (worthless) , generic (even worse). Maxalt is my go to medicine. Unfortunately its a fight with the insurance company to get regular refills. They are trying to force me to take a generic. I used to get 12 tablets and they changed it to 9- which 9 is not enough. When I run out I cannot help but pray for the day I get a refill fearing I will get a migraine before that time. When the refill day comes, I stalk my pharmacy on the phone until it is ready. Ugh...talk about \"drug-seeking\" !",
                    "This Migraine Med is a must have if you expereince regular Migraines..no side effects!",
                    "I find Maxalt Wafers amazing. I get a little tightness in my throat but apart from that no side effects and they work within I/2 an hour. In fact it feels like a huge weight has been lifted off me. They are expensive but worth it.",
                    "Tried Imitrex and Relpax first, but had bad heart-squeezing and neck-squeezing side effects. Tried Maxalt and did not have that problem. It usually takes away the migraines, but can take 1-2 hours to get relief. I'm also very fatigued after the pain goes away, which makes daytime onset of migraines a hassle. Also for the 1-2 hours I am waiting for it to work, the pain actually intensifies until suddenly it lets go and the blood vessels in my head feel cold. Strange, but true.",
                    "Within half an hour, the headache has totally subsided. sometimes need a second dose. It does cause my skin to feel sensitive to heat and my throat feels tight for about 2 hours but the headache and all symptoms are totally gone. Brilliant",
                    "Today was my first time taking Rizatriptan and the fact that I am able to write this review just hours after the onset of a migraine is amazing because normally I would be completely down for the count for at least a whole day with a migraine. So here is my experience: I have taken countless meds before including Imitrex with terrible side effects and zero relief so naturally I was skeptical about this new med. I took it as soon as I knew that this was going to be a particularly bad migraine. The only side effect I had was sleepiness, no \"heart attack\" feeling as I had experienced with Imitrex. I fell asleep within 15 min of taking Rizatriptan and woke up 2 hours later completely migraine free.",
                    "This pill is like a magic. I just noticed that the pill works in minutes for me and I feel a bit dizziness and like a burning head and then the pain is gone. Today I got a early migraine and I was able to use the MLT and work kind of slowly but it stopped the pain in time. But I still feel very sensitive to light. Great medication ask your doctor for Maxalt or Maxalt-MLT.",
                    "As you may know, migraines are extremely debilitating even when trying to perform most menial tasks let alone professional responsibilities. I tried Maxalt for the first time today approximately 20 minutes after my first aura and it actually works. I am happily surprised! I have yet to experience any side effects. However, lets be honest, I'd be tolerant of almost anything besides a migraine - which feels like a freight train chugging through my head.",
                    "Must take within 20 minutes of onset. The longer you wait, the longer it takes to work. Keep it in your pocket/wallet at all times. For me, it is a lifesaver.",
                    "My experience was mixed. I took Maxalt MLT as soon as I had my usual \"Aura\". It worked within 30 minutes. The aura was gone and I never did get a migraine. However, within an hour I had a severe angina attack and had to take my nitro twice to relieve the pain. Nitro glycerin gives you a headache, so I think I'd rather have the migraine than the chest pain! My daughter took it and had a wonderful experience, took the pain away within 30 minutes and no side effects at all. I guess I won't be taking it again. Too bad, it worked on the migraine.",
                    "Maxalt has helped me so much. My migraines get so intense and the minute I take Maxalt I start to feel relief.",
                    "Maxalt is a very good migraine medicine for me. No side effects but only a little tired but that's good.",
                    "1 Maxalt malt usually starts working in 30 to 45 minutes for me. Within an hour I'm able to continue my day. I have very frequent migraines and have used Maxalt for many years. No real side effects except a bit of drowsiness. And it is very expensive. Insurance does not cover the whole cost.",

                    "I've always had 3 day migraines. MaxAlt will take it away in about 35 minutes. Sometimes I would have to take another one (dissolved in my mouth) the next day. I cannot stress enough how much I love this medicine. I come from days when Darvon's were given for migraines, they didn't do anything but zombie you with the pain. I thank the scientist who figured out how to control whatever it is that is being controlled. Of course, it IS too expensive. Without insurance, I would have to suffer, as they are about $32 per pill!",
                    "I've had chronic migraines for around 12 years. I take 5mg and it usually takes care of my headache. It makes my neck ache a little but the relief from the horrible symptoms of a migraine are well worth it. I've tried other triptans but this one works best. The generic is very inexpensive.",
                    "I have just started experiencing migraines and thought my life was over at first. Nothing was working and I couldn't be a wife to my husband or mom to my five year old daughter. Since starting this miracle drug as we call it, I am myself again. The only side effect I am experiencing is having to pee a lot. I don't know if I am alone in that matter, but I would gladly substitute spending sometime in the potty then spending a whole day in the ER or in the bedroom in the dark.",
                    "The Maxalt-MLT self-dissolving tab worked wonders for me. At a time when my doctor was trying to determine the most-effective treatment form my migraine headaches, this medicine was a God-send. My doc gave me samples of various triptan meds and I was to try one out at the onset of every migraine. Of the 5-6 different samples I was given, Maxalt-MLT worked the fastest & had the least amount of side-effects. I was amazed. Unfortunately, my insurance would not cover it and I had to settle with sumatriptan. Sumatriptan worked, but it took about an hour and I just remember feeling really weird after taking it. Anyway, if/when my migraines start again- Maxalt is what I want.",

                    "I have suffered from migraines since I was a kid. I'm 49 now. In my mid 30s I started taking imitrex and it completely derailed me. I then started trying a bunch of preventative drugs, beta blocker, calcium blockers and ssri drugs. Finally found one that works fairly well, but along with that I use maxalt as a rescue drug which I still take 6+ times a month. It's a good drug and is effective. I have always noticed the migraines redoubles its efforts before leaving after I take it. I also notice it makes me very sleepy and foggy. I don't like to take it at work because of that. 9 times out of 10 it works, but there are still times it does nothing for me. Some is better than none in my world though. I take a generic due to cost.",
                    "I have suffered from migraines Since An Auto accident in 2009, sometime as many as 15 a month. I was prescribed Maxalt this past year (after trying a whole bag of other medicines). It has given me my life back... within thirty minutes after taking Maxalt the symptoms decrease by 50% and are gone within an hour. Several side effects, very drowsy and increased nausea but after several hours of sleep all is good.",
                    "I have tried OTC migraine medicines, and three other prescriptions. Maxalt is by far the best, and MLT makes it nearly perfect. The only bad side effect I have is that the back of my neck gets sore. Maxalt does this far less than Zomig, and taking Advil Liquigels or Vicodin with the Maxalt MLT helps quite a bit. My ideal treatment for a migraine is to take Maxalt MLT and Advil Liquigels, then lay down with something cold on my forehead. Once I am able to doze, I sleep until I wake up on my own. I can't believe how much better I feel after the nap. At work, I just take the two medicines. It takes me longer to feel better, but makes my headache much more bearable.",

                    "I would definitely try this for migraines if you haven't already. I had used Imitrex pills for a few years and suddenly they stopped working. I tried a couple different pills and then found Maxalt. The only problem with the pills is that I have to take them right away. Once the migraine has started they don't take away all the pain, only like 60% for me. I was on Maxalt for a few years, then put on Cymblata and didn't have migraines for 2 years on that, but then they came back and Maxalt didn't help me... Now I use Imitrex Statdose because I never catch my migraine until it's terrible but the injections get rid of the pain fast!",

I take one as soon as I get the slightest beginning of a migraine and it is gone in 20 minutes! Not only that, but I've been taking it for 3 years now and I used to get 2 or 3 migraines a month, and now I only get about 1 every 2 months! Maxalt has been like a miracle for me...I no longer have to suffer with horrible headaches!! Additionally, I have not experienced any side effects!",
                    "One Maxalt-MLT usually gets rid of the migraine in an hour or less. Occasionally, I need another one 2 hours later to really get rid of it for good. Rarely, even the second one did not quite do it for me. But this is still the most effective medicine that's worked for me, after trying 8-10 other medicines (over-the-counter and prescription).",
                    "This is a miracle drug! I've tried all sorts of medicines over the past 30 some years and this drug is the only one that has ever stopped my migraines.

Over the years, particularly after each baby, the symptoms have become worse and are always experienced during menstruation. Recently codeine products that would normally help are not even touching the sides of the pain, and I have been experiencing increasing levels of sickness that anti-nausea tablets don't have any impact on. But yesterday a friend gave me a maxalt wafer because I couldn't function under the intensity of the sickness and pain. At first it didn't seem to do anything. But after maybe an hour to 90 minutes and I was no longer sick, nor was I in pain!! It was like a miracle!! How ever vision was slightly more blurred than usual.",

                    "I've been using maxalt for about 6 years (give or take) and it's about the only medication I've found that really gets rid of my migraines. The MLT version is great when your stomach's so upset you can't keep down a pill, too. The only side effect I've ever had is a tingling feeling in my shoulders. Well worth the co-pay!",
                    "I started taking Maxalt after horrible experiences with Imitrex. I had almost all the same side effects: extreme nausea, dizziness, falling asleep, and a general out of it feeling the rest of the day. But the worst part is that it did absolutely nothing for my migraine. I am just glad that I had samples so I didn't get stuck paying for a prescription I would not use. ",

Then at about 38 I started getting these horrible severely debilitating headaches 1-3 times a year and the headaches would last up to weeks with intermittent increase in severity. I was finally diagnosed with cluster headaches and prescribed Rizatriptan. If I feel the onset it diminishes the intensity and duration. I have been using it for 2 years and very grateful.",

We are doing test to rule out other problems but this medicine helped me more than anything so far. Still have that groggy feeling afterwards but I can deal with that. Just do not know how I can take it should I have to at work since I work in a call center 10 hours a day with constant calls.",
                    "I have used maxalt four times in the last three months. The first time it worked fine and it was gone in a few hours but had heart racing.  The second migraine I was concerned about the side effects but gave a second chance. I had severe throbbing in my head like it was going to explode and then suddenly the migraine broke.  My third attempt my migraine was so severe that I had to take a second dose for relief! I find that if I take it on the onset it works but still light headache and felt numbing sensation.  My fourth today no relief after 2nd dose. Took 3rd after 4 hours but still feeling migraine. Had slight heart racing and throbbing pain. I may continue to see if this is right meds. If not, then I think there's no hope for me!",

I've tried Zomig, Imitrex, and many others - but Maxalt gets it gone in 15-30 minutes and I'm back, up and ready to get back into life. I can even take one at work and just rest my eyes at my desk until it kicks in. Never could do that before.",

They used to tell my parents I was \"high-strung\" and had \"tension headaches\". I was never diagnosed with migraine until I was about 48 years old. This is the ONLY drug that has ever stopped my migraine (of course...you have to take it immediately at the onset, as with all migraine meds). I had lost so many days of my life to the extreme pain/nausea and impaired vision/speech/general functionality before I discovered rizatriptan. Quite literally, I thank God for leading someone to develop this and for someone prescribing it for me.",

My worst childhood memories are of me moaning and rocking back and forth in agony on my bed when suffering from my very first migraines as an 8 or 9 yr old child. I too have not had any luck with Imitrex and some of the other medicines mentioned in this post. My insurance gives me terrible problems when I am trying to get a migraine prescription filled. As it is right now I have figured out that Axert and Maxalt are the only two medicines that I know will work for certain when I am afflicted and totally incapacitated by migraine headaches. The problem with Axert is that my insurance will only allow a monthly script of 6 tablets at $10/tablet. Maxalt does it for less dollars.",

Somewhere during the 36 hour duration, would be 12 hours of hell. I've used Maxalt MLT about 10-12 times over the last 6 months. It has worked every time; I take one when I sense a migraine is starting, and it just doesn't \"blossom\". I have no side effects, no nausea, and no drowsiness. Sometime in the next 20-30 minutes I'll realize the apprehension, tension and other precursors to the migraine have just disappeared. Migraines took too much of my life, and at their worst, pushed depression to the edge of suicide; it's good to have a normal life back.",

When I take it early (before it becomes a full-bloomed migraine), it works within maybe 30 minutes, completely getting rid of the pain. I do have some side effects: most of the time, I feel a tightening of the throat for about 15 minutes after taking it (my doctor had warned me about that), and if I happen to be a bit tired when taking it, I feel a bit dizzy for a couple of hours. But it sure beats a 24-hour migraine.",

Am seeing another Dr & she put me on Maxalt yesterday, my migraine was gone within an hour of taking it. I just want to go back and hug her because after 5 yrs of trying I just accepted my pain. It made me drowsy, but I will take drowsy over pain any day.",

                    "I had my doubts that this would work -- it was fantastic! within 15-20 minutes the pain that felt like my skull was in a vise disappeared. I am a horse trainer and I work full time on my own farm, and I can't function when I have a migraine, ( 4-5 attacks a month, 24-48 hours each time) Maxalt 10-mg was a miracle for me. I don't have to put all the work on my daughter, and my temper has become much more even. The anxiety of worrying about a migraine attack has helped enormously, for my emotional state, too. **side note** I had a Mirena IUD and had it removed, I believe this contributed to the attacks, so hopefully in 4-6 weeks I won't need the Maxalt, either.",

                    "//What is it?//Headache and migraine are different entities. Migraine is one of the most common and well characterized, but there are 14 broad categories that can be subdivided into more than 200 different forms. Migraine itself has about 20 different genres. In general, headaches are divided into two large groups: primary and secondary. Primary illnesses correspond to a disease, not reflecting other health problems and represent around 90% of the total. Secondary symptoms are symptoms of diseases of the nervous system or other organs of the human body. They can occur in cases of flu, alcohol poisoning or withdrawal, minor head trauma, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels) or a high blood pressure crisis. Migraine is a primary headache in which very intense episodes of pain occur interspersed with periods without symptoms. In general, it begins between the ages of 15 and 40, but it can appear in childhood or shortly after the first menstruation. If it appears for the first time after the age of 45, other causes must be excluded. Some of its characteristics are closely associated with the female reproductive cycle: higher prevalence after the first menstruation or during the menstrual period; occasional worsening due to taking birth control pills or hormone therapy; attenuation or disappearance during pregnancy or menopause. Before adolescence, migraines affect boys and girls equally. From then on, it is two to three times more common in females. It is estimated that 8% to 15% of individuals living in Western countries (including Portugal) suffer from this problem. The fact of reaching people in the productive phase implies large economic, social and family costs.//Symptoms//It appears recurrently, several times throughout life, but always with completely free intervals. If it occurs every day, it is probably overuse of painkillers or other medications. Drug abuse can convert a migraine into a chronic daily headache. There are people who preferably appear on the weekend. These crises can be precipitated by changes in sleep schedule, failure to eat breakfast, reduced stress or alcohol abuse. In these cases, it is important to consider a lifestyle change over the weekend. The symptoms are intense and often prevent work or study. The pain tends to be throbbing, worsening with physical exertion or head movements. In general, it affects only one side of the head, and is accompanied by nausea, vomiting, intolerance to light, noise and some smells. It is not mandatory that all of these elements are present simultaneously. And they can occur twice a week or just a few throughout a lifetime. During attacks, people seek a dark, quiet place to rest or fall asleep. An episode can last from a few hours to three days. Between attacks, there are usually no complaints. Some types of migraines may have more complex symptoms (with aura). These forms are less common, affecting around 15% of people with this problem, and include transient neurological symptoms, originating attributable to certain areas of the brain. The other signs are identical to those of migraine without aura. The most common auras are temporary vision disorders, in the form of loss of vision on one side of the visual field, blurred images, perception of bright points, geometric figures or bright zigzags. Other auras can be translated as tingling or numbness on one side of the face or one of the hands. There are people who have difficulty speaking or even temporary paralysis of their limbs, usually only on one side of the body. These changes last about 10 to 30 minutes and precede the pain. In children, migraines tend to be bilateral, less intense and of shorter duration. Vomiting and dark circles can be exuberant. Disturbances in sleep and meal schedules are common precipitating factors. Treating these crises is easier than in adults. Sleep usually gives good results. At these ages, the occipital location is not normal and, when present, requires a medical consultation. Likewise, the presence of headaches with morning vomiting or other unusual symptoms in very young children should be seen by a healthcare professional.//Causes//It is caused by a combination of brain processes: excitation/depression of cells, dilation of arteries and release of chemicals. People with migraine are more sensitive to certain stimuli, environmental or from their own body, that can trigger these brain processes. It is also thought that there is some genetic susceptibility. Some individuals can identify the signs of their attacks. The most common are cheese, chocolate, strawberries, seafood, wine, artificial sauces, changes in sleep patterns, stress, menstruation, fasting, physical exercise, and minor trauma. Others cannot identify them at all. People who drink coffee regularly may experience headaches when they stop this habit.//Diagnosis//The key to diagnosis lies in the clinical history, physical and neurological examination. Observation of the fundus is a very important part of these procedures. In some cases, it may be necessary to resort to computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to exclude other diseases.//Treatment//Migraines have no cure but can be controlled. There are medications and behaviors that can reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks. Symptomatic treatment, during acute periods, involves resting in a quiet, dark place. Pressure or cold can be applied to the area of \u200b\u200bpain. At this stage, analgesics, anti-inflammatories, antiemetics and triptans are very useful.//Prevention//People with migraines should create calendars that allow them to identify their symptoms and assess their impact on their quality of life. The first step in prevention is to identify and eliminate precipitating factors, whenever possible. In some cases, it is necessary to use daily medication to reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks, but there are no drugs specifically developed for their prevention. However, there are some drugs used in other contexts that have proven to be effective, such as beta-blockers, antidepressants or antiepileptics, and these should always be prescribed by a doctor.

So I thought I was in heaven one day to find less pain and the post nasal drip decreased.",

                    "Hi .Chlorpheniramine is very effective drug. I tried all the antihistamine and medicines like cetrizine , loratdine , fexofenafine etc. I spent a lot of money but just chlorpheniramine work for me and chlorpheniramine is very cheap!!A few minutes  after taking this , I get complete relief and my allergies have gone especially eye allergy. chlorpheniramine has 2 side effects for me: 1-make me very sleepy 2-need take this each 4 hours.at least 4 times in day.",
                    "I took these pills for an attack of hives and anxiety. I am female and aged 78. After three days I began to feel nauseous. I was OK before I went on a long car journey. After half an hour with my husband driving I began to feel extremely ill. He managed to stop the car as I was near to fainting and I vomited at the roadside. I felt as if I was losing consciousness for about 15 mins and felt extremely sick, but could not vomit.  I felt my BP was extremely low. Finally I felt able to return to our home.  The doctor who gave me the pills was one I was not known to. I was a visitor to the town. I have a history of tachycardia and arrhythmia and was diagnosed with M.E. 8 years ago. I told the doctor of my medical history.",
                    "I have been taking this drug off and on for 41 years. As the new 24 hour drugs came out I would switch and try them, but they were never as effective. I wish the 12 hr extended release was more available and came in larger amounts than 12 or 24 to a box. I have no side effects, in fact it has never caused me any drowsiness.",
                    "I have had severe hayfever since childhood and this is one of the few antihistamines that work for all of my symptoms without making me overly drowsy. I'm just sad that they only sell 4 hour pills otc now. I'll have to switch to something else.",
                    "It's good.",
                    "It was really effective. It took only about 5 minutes before my blocked nose started to clear up.",
                    "I have been taking this for allergic sneezing, itchy eyes, itchy tongue and back if mouth, allergic post-nasal drip. Very effective. My grandmother told me about it forty five or fifty years ago. Don't take it if you have high blood pressure. This is an oldie but a goodie. I prefer the short acting yellow pills rather then the twelve hour pills.",
                    "I occasionally get severe sneezing attacks, cause unknown. They start as a feeling like something tickling my nose followed by a deep intake of breath and a powerful (mostly dry) sneeze. This then repeats about every 20 seconds for several minutes, when it stops, leaving me exhausted and with teary eyes and a runny nose. I found that swallowing a short-acting chlorpheniramine maleate tablet at the first sign, or in between sneezes, is effective at immediately stopping the attack, with no noticeable side effects. I have other chronic health conditions for which I take prescription medications; long term use of antihistamines for me is not recommended.",
                    "I used this for my seasonal allergies. Works great but the 12 hour extended release is nearly impossible to find in stock in my area.",
                    "Have returned repeatedly to Chlortrimeton after taking Zyrtec or Claritin off and on. I get relief for hayfever symptoms without drowsiness and cost is lower. I feel sleepy on the other two meds and the 24 hour dose is not consistent over that period of time. My hayfever is not a severe case with running nose, itchy eyes, and sneezing from Mid-March to May seemingly getting less with age. I'm 69. Have tried the 12 hour dose and find it works consistently for me but prefer the 4 hour tablet.",
                    "While it makes me drowsy, gives me dry mouth and can make my scalp tingle/itch it is the only antihistamine that works for my severe hay fever. The 4 hour pills work most of the time and when my symptoms are really bad the 8 or 12 hour ones make my life normal.",
                    "24 hours after taking chlortrimeton 90% of my hives have disappeared. This is the first OTC drug I have taken that has had an effect. I experienced some drowsiness but functioned quite well.",
                    "The 4mg dosage works very well for seasonal allergic reactions.",
                    "This little pill works in a BIG way. Everyone I've introduced it to has said the same. I have had allergies for some time now and it's hard to find medicine that works well.",
                    "Although an off-label use, I find this drug to be an excellent sleep aid. It is relatively short acting and may be appropriate for middle of the night awakenings. It is very important, however, to get your doctor's clearance before such use. There are some drugs that interact with chlorpheniramine. It is especially important not to combine chlorpheniramine or any similar drug, including drugs for motion sickness, such as Dramamine or Meclizine. Patients with eye pressure issues (glaucoma) should also either avoid and/or discuss with a doctor before using it.",
                    "I give this to my German Shepherds for food and environmental allergies. It works better than most, and doesn't make them sleepy like Benadryl. Highly recommended! I've used myself for hay fever.",

I felt as if I was losing consciousness for about 15 mins and felt extremely sick, but could not vomit.  I felt my BP was extremely low. Finally I felt able to return to our home.  The doctor who gave me the pills was one I was not known to. I was a visitor to the town. I have a history of tachycardia and arrhythmia and was diagnosed with M.E. 8 years ago. I told the doctor of my medical history.",
                    "I have been taking this drug off and on for 41 years. As the new 24 hour drugs came out I would switch and try them, but they were never as effective. I wish the 12 hr extended release was more available and came in larger amounts than 12 or 24 to a box. I have no side effects, in fact it has never caused me any drowsiness.",
                    "I have had severe hayfever since childhood and this is one of the few antihistamines that work for all of my symptoms without making me overly drowsy. I'm just sad that they only sell 4 hour pills otc now. I'll have to switch to something else.",
                    "It's good.",
                    "It was really effective. It took only about 5 minutes before my blocked nose started to clear up.",
                    "I have been taking this for allergic sneezing, itchy eyes, itchy tongue and back if mouth, allergic post-nasal drip. Very effective. My grandmother told me about it forty five or fifty years ago. Don't take it if you have high blood pressure. This is an oldie but a goodie. I prefer the short acting yellow pills rather then the twelve hour pills.",
                    "I occasionally get severe sneezing attacks, cause unknown. They start as a feeling like something tickling my nose followed by a deep intake of breath and a powerful (mostly dry) sneeze. This then repeats about every 20 seconds for several minutes, when it stops, leaving me exhausted and with teary eyes and a runny nose. I found that swallowing a short-acting chlorpheniramine maleate tablet at the first sign, or in between sneezes, is effective at immediately stopping the attack, with no noticeable side effects. I have other chronic health conditions for which I take prescription medications; long term use of antihistamines for me is not recommended.",
                    "I used this for my seasonal allergies. Works great but the 12 hour extended release is nearly impossible to find in stock in my area.",

I feel sleepy on the other two meds and the 24 hour dose is not consistent over that period of time. My hayfever is not a severe case with running nose, itchy eyes, and sneezing from Mid-March to May seemingly getting less with age. I'm 69. Have tried the 12 hour dose and find it works consistently for me but prefer the 4 hour tablet.",
                    "While it makes me drowsy, gives me dry mouth and can make my scalp tingle/itch it is the only antihistamine that works for my severe hay fever. The 4 hour pills work most of the time and when my symptoms are really bad the 8 or 12 hour ones make my life normal.",
                    "24 hours after taking chlortrimeton 90% of my hives have disappeared. This is the first OTC drug I have taken that has had an effect. I experienced some drowsiness but functioned quite well.",
                    "The 4mg dosage works very well for seasonal allergic reactions.",
                    "This little pill works in a BIG way. Everyone I've introduced it to has said the same. I have had allergies for some time now and it's hard to find medicine that works well.",
                    "Although an off-label use, I find this drug to be an excellent sleep aid. It is relatively short acting and may be appropriate for middle of the night awakenings. It is very important, however, to get your doctor's clearance before such use. There are some drugs that interact with chlorpheniramine. It is especially important not to combine chlorpheniramine or any similar drug, including drugs for motion sickness, such as Dramamine or Meclizine.

It does not irritate my nasal membrane like other brands that I tried. Insight pharm has discontinued manufacture of the spray, that is sad. However the drops may still be obtainable.",
                    "I wish they would bring this back to the market, Privine is the only product that never causes nosebleeds and works beautifully. Have used since childhood. If the manufacturer would reintroduce this it would be most helpful.",

It is the only thing that works. One or two drops per nostril before bedtime and I can sleep all during the night. Nothing else works the same. I could never find it on store shelves in the past 20 years. I would have to go to the pharmacy counter and even though this was over-the-counter, the pharmacy had to order it. I would order six boxes of Provine at a time. When I would run out I would order another six so I won't have to think about it. Today I go order it only to find that it's discontinued. I don't know what I'm going to do.",

Over the years, I've always had some on hand and also used it for my son, who also has allergies. No other product is as mild. The rebound effect is much less of a problem with Privine. I even noticed that one of the over the counter allergy eye drop products contains the same active ingredient. Now, Privine is discontinued, and I honestly don't know where to go from here. There is nothing else that can take it's place.",
                    "Please, please, please put this product back on the market. I've been using Privine for over 35 years and there is no other product on the market like it. It clears up my stuffy nose in minutes and lasts all night. There are no side effects and it's very gentle on the nose tissue. I don't know what I'm going to do without it.",
                    "I have been using Privine Nose Drops for more than 50 years and they are the only product that really helps my severe nasal congestion from colds, allergies or sinus infections. Best of all, Privine gives me no bad side effects whatsoever, unlike all of the other nose drops and nasal sprays that I have tried. Privine should be sold in all drugstores but now.",

Boy was I wrong it no longer contained only an infusion of Rose Petals with 0.01% Thimerosal as a preservative. Which got rid of the itchy, red & blisters on my families eyes after only 60-90 seconds. It was fantastic but now it (Estivin ll) has a bunch of things that can't be pronounced with a Big list of warnings including warnings for pregnant women or wanting to become pregnant women. Now it does not give any relief at all in fact it actually makes things a little worse. I wish that the company would bring back the old version and have it available also so people had a choice of what to use.",

                    "//What is it?//Whooping cough (also known as pertussis or whooping cough) is a highly contagious respiratory disease (of the trachea and bronchi) caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. The disease is spread through respiratory droplets that the infected person expels when coughing or sneezing. It can also occur through contact with objects contaminated with a patient's secretions. In 2018, there were more than 151,000 cases of this acute infectious disease worldwide. Pertussis is most dangerous for babies and is a significant cause of illness and death in this age group.//Symptoms//The incubation period for whooping cough is 7-10 days, but can range from 5-21 days. The symptoms of whooping cough are usually mild and similar to those of a cold: Runny nose;/ Nasal congestion;/ Watery and red eyes;/ Fever;/ Cough;/  Whooping cough progresses in phases. The first is the catarrhal phase (lasting 1-2 weeks), in which the following occurs: Inflammation and runny nose;/ Non-productive cough;/ Low fever;/  In the second phase - the paroxysmal phase, which lasts for 2-6 weeks - the cough worsens, is more frequent at night and can worsen with crying (in the case of children) and eating. It can be accompanied by cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin and lips) and swelling of the tongue. In addition, the patient may produce a characteristic noise of the disease when breathing in and the cough can even cause vomiting. During the convalescence phase (2-6 weeks), the cough progressively decreases in intensity and frequency. The noise produced when inhaling and vomiting also disappear. However, whooping cough does not appear equally in all patients. There are people who do not develop noise when breathing. There are cases where a persistent cough is the only sign that a teenager or adult may be infected. Babies, on the other hand, may not have a cough, but may only have difficulty breathing or even suddenly stop breathing. Vaccinated children, adolescents and young adults may have only mild symptoms, such as a persistent cough. Patients with whooping cough are most contagious until about 3 weeks after the cough appears. It is a good idea to consult your doctor if you have prolonged coughing attacks and experience symptoms such as: Vomiting;/ Red or blue coloration of the face;/ Difficulty breathing;/ Breathing noise when inhaling;///Possible complications//Complications associated with whooping cough are often side effects of persistent coughing, such as: Broken or sore ribs;/ Abdominal hernias;/ Rupture of blood vessels in the skin or eyes;/  Pneumonia is a relatively common complication, while seizures and neurological disease rarely occur.  In babies\u2014especially before 6 months of age\u2014complications of whooping cough can be more serious, including: Pneumonia;/ Slower breathing or respiratory arrest;/ Dehydration or weight loss due to difficulties in eating;/ Dizziness;/ Neurological damage;///Causes//Whooping cough is caused by the bacteria Bordetella pertussis. Transmission occurs when an infected person sneezes or coughs, expelling microbes into the air. These droplets can then be inhaled by other people, infecting them.//Diagnosis//Diagnosing whooping cough in the early stages can be difficult because the signs and symptoms are very similar to those of other respiratory illnesses, such as colds, flu and bronchitis. In most cases, the diagnosis is made through clinical observation. However, tests may be done to help confirm the diagnosis, such as: Collection of nasopharyngeal exudate;/ Blood tests;/ Chest X-ray;///Treatment//In older children and adults, pertussis treatment is usually done at home and includes taking antibiotics. Because babies are at higher risk of complications, they are more likely to need hospital treatment. If your child is unable to take in liquids or food, intravenous fluids may need to be administered. Your child may also be isolated from other people to prevent transmission of the disease. Family members who have been exposed to the infection may need to take prophylactic antibiotic treatment. Cough relief is difficult. Over-the-counter cough medicines have little effect on whooping cough and are not recommended. Always follow your doctor's instructions.//What you can do at home//In addition to the prescribed medical treatment for whooping cough, there are some measures you can take at home: Rest, preferably in a dark, cool and quiet room.;/ Increase fluid intake: water, juice and soup are good options to stay well hydrated. Be aware of possible signs of dehydration in children, such as dry lips, crying without tears and urinating infrequently.;/ Eat lighter meals. This is important to prevent vomiting associated with coughing.;/ Air out the house, keeping the interior free of irritants that could aggravate the cough, such as tobacco smoke or fireplace smoke.;/ Practice proper respiratory etiquette by covering your face whenever you cough. It is also important to wash your hands frequently and wear a mask around other people.;///Prevention//The best way to prevent whooping cough is through vaccination. The pertussis vaccine is free and is included in the National Immunization Program (PNV), and must be administered in five doses at 2, 4, 6, 18 months and 5 years of age. Pregnant women should also be vaccinated between 20 and 36 weeks of gestation, ideally up to 32 weeks. The combined vaccine against pertussis, tetanus and diphtheria is also included in the PNV.  There are also preventive medications against whooping cough, which can be prescribed by your doctor for some specific groups that have been exposed to the disease: Health professionals;/ Pregnant women;/ Babies under 12 months;/ Patients with a health condition that increases the risk of serious illness or complications, such as immunosuppression or asthma;/ Living with someone who has whooping cough;/ Living with someone who is at increased risk of developing a serious illness or complications from pertussis;/ Mayo Clinic, janeiro 2021 World Health Organization, January 2021 SNS 24, janeiro 2021 Whooping cough has returned and again poses a threat, especially to babies. It is essential to vaccinate pregnant women between 20 and 36 weeks of gestation. It can be scary to see that you have spit or coughed up blood, but it may not be serious and there are several possible reasons. The answer is \"yes\". Although infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus confers some immunity, no one is 100% protected and reinfection with COVID-19 can occur.

The pain goes away in a few days altogether. I only use the pills for the very painful outbreaks. Some sores don't warrant the need to risk unneccessary medicine.

Two days later, I had a light rash that I mistook for razor burn along my bikini line on my left thigh. Two days after that, my OB (I was 31 weeks pregnant) diagnosed me with shingles. I started Famciclovir the next day (went to PCP who prescribed it...long story). My PCP mentioned that the back pain was probably a symptom of shingles, that the area of my back in question was linked to the same dermatome as the rash on my leg. By day 3 on medication, my discomfort had decreased and new sections, while they had appeared, did not blister. By day 5, my blistered section was mostly scabbed over.",

One day my doctor gave me a script to buy Famvir and wow. The tingle sting went away in less than 24hrs. And after a couple of days the cold sores were healing and almost gone. This works so much better than the creams! Cause if you are not careful, you can infect other areas of your mouth with your fingers as you apply the cream.  When fighting a cold sore, get heaps of sleep, spoil yourself with sleep.  So happy that now in Australia, I can buy this product over the counter and don't have to visit my doctor every time.",

I took both medications religiously (shingles is nothing to mess around with). Over the next 3 days the spot on my eyebrow blistered and then scabbed over, my eye swelled up, and I started to develop another spot on my forehead. On day 4 the swelling was noticeably reduced and was completely gone by day 6. The second place on my forehead never blistered or scabbed over. I didn't experience any side effects. Worked great for me (29 yr old female).",
                    "It worked great for me. 1500mg in one shot, the swelling was almost gone the same day and it healed quickly. What a relief? That was 10 days ago.",
                    "I get at least three cold sores a year usually around wintertime. Now I get the pills prescribed by my doctor and have extra on hand to take when I first see signs of cold sores. I never catch it at tingling stage so I can only review what it does after taking when blisters already formed. My symptoms would last 10-14 days without this med. it goes swollen and painful and gross too. But with this med, I only get a red patch for 3-4 days and then it's gone. It's amazing!",
                    "Side effects were serious enough to warrant a concurrent dose of prednisone. Condition was shingles, upper left body quadrant. Welts, blisters, itching, pain. One week on the medicine was insufficient to clear it up. Side effects included persistent headache, nausea, diarrhea and serious swelling/itching on the palms of my hands. ",
                    "This drug, along with its predecessor, acyclovir, is a godsend. If you ever suffered breakouts, you know how embarrassing it is to go about your day with a cold sore. If you have to spend the workday talking to people, it's even worse. My breakouts were usually a week long, with the residual scar visible for another few weeks. I take famciclovir at the earliest opportunity. Caught early, I'm even able to stop a full breakout, and only redness remains left to be healed. This drug works so well, I am puzzled by the \"remedies\" peddled on TV, the internet, and health food stores (Abreva, Bactine, essential oils, lip balms, etc.). Famciclovir/acyclovir is the only thing that has worked for me.",
                    "I always have a packet of this on me. ALWAYS. In the hand bag, in the bedside drawer... it doesn't matter. I feel panicky when I don't have a packet on me somewhere. Many times I've thought I've felt the tingle or seen a tiny little bump, and I've taken the 3 x pills STRAIGHT AWAY and no cold sore has ever appeared. There was one instance when my lip got burnt from too much sun / wind exposure, and my lip swelled up and I had the MOTHER of all cold sores - unfortunately these nifty pills didn't stop that, but definitely cut healing time back to roughly 4 days (instead of 10!). Zinc, Lysine and yoghurt are also very good to take when treating an outbreak. Good luck!",
                    "Famvir works the best. I have a lot less breakouts, and when one is coming on I take it and it is gone within a day. I don't have any side effects like I did with the others (headaches and breakouts). It is worth the money.",
                    "Cold sore sufferer since child (now 43). Get a cold sore occasionally now (i.e. every couple of months). PROS If you take tablet when feel tingle/itch - have found it stopped outbreak (used twice and it did work) - at least I think it must have (can't be sure I suppose). CONS Don't always experience tingle/itch (i.e. asleep/sick) and cold sore breaks out - then it's too late to take (have tried twice but did not work; in fact, I only had one cold sore on top of lip and took meds but then another broke out next day in corner of mouth). A serious sufferer may not get required results. Expensive (you get 3 tabs for $30 - $40 in Australia over the counter at the chemist). You MUST have these meds on hand i.e. in bedside drawer/handbag",
                    "I was getting attacked by cold sores even though I was taking Acyclovir. My Dr had me try Famcyclovir and since I started on it a year and half ago, I've gotten maybe 3 incidences.",
                    "Itching started Wednesday around midday, however I mistakenly thought it was due to a pimple I had popped. That evening the itching got worse and the area (corner of my mouth, bottom lip) started getting red - I knew it was a coldsore. I took the 3 tablets before bed and was afraid it may have been too late. Thurs woke up with a slight headache, assumed it was the drugs fighting the outbreak. Fri & Sat, you could see a small blister, a little red, but wasn't getting much bigger. By Sunday afternoon it was disappearing and today (Monday morning) it's almost gone. Relief! Next time I won't hesitate & will take as soon as I feel the itch! Had I not taken them, I assume I'd have developed an ugly CS that would've last till next weekend.",
                    "I was impressed! My cold sore had gotten to the 2nd day when it was blistering and weeping - took 1500mg as a single dose and within the same 24 hour period the cold sore had stopped blistering completely, dried up and formed a healthy scab. After 48 hours the scab had fallen off and new skin was underneath. Impressed. Next time I'm using this wonderful medication when I get the \"tingle\". I'm usually not impressed by medications but this particular medicine works a treat for cold sores and it's available over the counter.",
                    "Excellent medicine, effective and no side effects.",
                    "Took 3 tablets (1,500mg) before my lip blistered, right at the first tingle BUT I still got 2 cold sores. Meds gave me a headache and a stomach ache. Waste of money because it didn't work for me.",
                    "I have suffered from embarrissing cold sores for years. My doctor told me about a single day dose of Famvir (1500mg). He wrote me a script so that I have them on hand when I feel an outbreak coming. I soon as I feel the outbreak, I initiate the therapy and the cold sore does nothing more than get a little red for a day or so. No more full blow outbreaks, this has been wonderful.",
                    "I have experienced 1 cold sore ever two years, this year I've had 1 already due to a lip burn, just recently I had another burn to the lip from food, I went to the chemist to see what was available for fast acting treatment (I normally use Zovirax ointment which is fabulous) but I thought there may be something else. I was recommended famciclovir. The second day after the 3 tablet once of dosage I had extreme gas pain in my abdomen. It was the only thing I feel could have caused it. I took the dose on the first day I noticed the cold sore, it's now day 3 and it's simply a dry red patch. Amazing medication, of course I was using Zovirax too. But I recommend it!",
                    "I rarely get a cold sore (normally once every two or three years), but when I do they are mostly quite large and last for at least a week. So when one popped up in the morning and had already started to blister I went to the chemist straight away. He suggested I try this (1500mg one dose). Wow did it work, cut the time in half and scabbed alot quicker. I continued using cream as well. Only downside was on the day of medication I felt quite drowsy and had a mild nagging headache until the next morning. But so worth it. I will be taking this everytime from now on!",
                    "I have had cold sores since I can remember. they've always been hugely traumatic for me and really mess with my self esteem not to mention everyone on here would know they aren't pleasant physically! I've always tried lysine which seemed to help but now that I've discovered famiclovr I realize they were doing nothing.  I've taken the three tablets on three occasions now where they prevented a cold sore from coming out altogether!  There have been two occasions where I took the tablets when I felt a blister and the blister got bigger however the very next day seems to be nearly gone.  Basically, if the cold sore is too powerful/you're too late to take the medicine it still reduces the healing time from 2 weeks to 4 days! Amazing drug."

                    "//What is it?//Cold sores are a common and very common viral infection and it is estimated that more than 90% of the population is infected with the herpes virus. Once infected, the individual never stops having this virus. Generally, the first outbreak is the worst, but not all are severe; some are so discreet that the person does not realize they have been infected with herpes. Over time, outbreaks tend to become less frequent and serious because our body begins to produce antibodies (defenses) to the virus.//Symptoms//Small blisters filled with liquid, called vesicles, appear on the skin affected by herpes, which are accompanied by tingling or pain. The vesicles then rupture and become covered with crusts that fall off after a few days. This process tends to repeat itself with varying frequency, from a week to long months or years. On average, each outbreak lasts two to three weeks. Although most lesions appear on or around the lips, cold sores are not limited to that area: they can appear inside the nose, on the cheek or on the chin.//Causes//The herpes virus is transmitted through contact with the skin of someone who has the virus and it is possible for contagion to occur even when the infected person does not show symptoms. Some ways this can occur are by: Kiss;/ Touching someone's skin, especially the face area;/ Sharing objects, such as cutlery or lipstick;/ Once a person is infected with the herpes virus, it never leaves the body again - it goes through some phases in which it is \u201cdormant\u201d and therefore does not cause symptoms. Some factors that can trigger a herpes outbreak are: Fever;/ Stress;/ Cold;/ Sol;/ Menstruation;/ Surgery;///Diagnosis//When lesions are active, a dermatologist can make a diagnosis simply by observing them. To confirm the diagnosis, the specialist may take a sample with a cotton swab and send it for laboratory analysis. If, on the other hand, there are no lesions, other tests, such as blood tests, may be done to check for the existence of the herpes simplex virus.//Treatment//There is no cure for cold sores. However, the lesions often disappear without the need for any type of treatment. Many people still choose to do so to alleviate symptoms and shorten the duration of the outbreak. Typically, an antiviral ointment is used to relieve burning, itching, and tingling. Taking an antiviral medication orally or intravenously may also help a cold sore outbreak go away faster. These medications, when taken daily, can decrease the severity and frequency of outbreaks and help prevent contagion. However, they should not be taken without a medical prescription.

                    "//What is genital herpes?//Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted disease that affects the genital region and is caused by the Herpes simplex virus. There are two types of herpes simplex virus (HSV-1 and HSV-2). HSV-2 is usually transmitted sexually, while HSV-1 usually infects the mouth, nose, or, more rarely, the eyes. Both types can affect the genitals and the skin around the rectum or hands (especially the nail beds) and can be transmitted to other parts of the body. The prevalence of HSV-1 infection is 60% to 80% in the world population, which may mean that there is a large reservoir of this virus. This incidence depends on age, being over 40% at 15 years of age and 60% to 90% in adults. In developed countries, it is 20% at five years of age and 40% to 60% between the ages of 20 and 40. The current trend is for the incidence of HSV-1 to exceed that of HSV-2. Genital herpes is more common in women than in men because the virus is easier to transmit from man to woman than in the opposite direction.//Sintomas do herpes genital//Symptoms of the first bout of infection usually begin four to seven days after infection and include itching, tingling, and pain. In a second phase, a small reddish plaque appears, followed by a group of small, painful blisters or vesicles that rupture and merge to form circular ulcers, which are generally painful and covered with crusts within a few days. Depending on the location of the infection, difficulty urinating and, in certain cases, pain when walking may occur. Ulcers heal after 10 days and may leave scars. Lymph nodes in the groin often enlarge slightly and become painful to the touch. As a rule, the first outbreak is more painful, prolonged and widespread than subsequent ones, and can cause fever and malaise. In men, vesicles and ulcers can appear anywhere on the penis, including the foreskin. In women, they appear on the vulva, inside and outside the vagina, and on the cervix. Those who have anal sex may have lesions around the anus and rectum. In immunocompromised individuals, such as those infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), herpes sores can be severe, spread to other areas of the body, persist for weeks and, on rare occasions, become resistant to treatment. The lesions tend to reappear in the same and adjacent areas, because the virus persists in nearby nerves and reactivates to reinfect the skin. VHS-2 reactivates better on pelvic nerves. VHS-1 reactivates best in facial nerves, causing cold sores or nasal herpes. Either way, either virus can cause disease in both areas. About three to 12 days after the first appearance of blisters in the genital area, the herpes virus can spread to other parts of the body. However, serious complications are rare. The membrane covering the brain (meninges) can become infected, causing vomiting, headache, and stiff neck. The spinal cord can become infected, causing weakness in the legs or other symptoms. The nerves in the pelvic area can also be affected, causing temporary pain, constipation, inability to urinate and, in men, impotence. Although rare, the virus can spread through the bloodstream to the joints, liver or lungs, especially in newborns or people with poor immune systems. The most common complication of genital herpes is the reappearance of the vesicles, which, as a rule, are confined to one side of the body and are less intense than in the initial outbreak. The patient may feel discomfort, itching, tingling or pain in the affected area before each access. The risk of recurrence in the genital area is greater with HSV-2 than with HSV-1. In some people, outbreaks recur frequently for many years. The blisters can recur and extend beyond the genital area until reaching the buttocks, groin or thighs. In pregnant women, herpes infection can cause miscarriage or premature birth. On the other hand, the virus can enter the bloodstream and cause a serious and potentially fatal infection in the baby. As such, prevention, diagnosis and early treatment measures are even more important at this stage.//Causes//It is a viral infection that results from transmission that occurs as a result of vaginal, oral or anal sex with someone who is infected. The fluids present in herpetic vesicles contain the virus and contact with these fluids can cause infection. Infection can occur even when there are no visible blisters or vesicles because the virus can be shed from the skin in the infected area. Since the virus does not survive outside the cells it infects, it is impossible for contagion to occur through contact with sanitary facilities, towels or objects used by people infected with genital herpes.//Diagnosis of genital herpes//The clinical appearance of the lesions and their location are highly suggestive of Herpes simplex infection. For confirmation, samples of the lesions are sent for culture in the laboratory. Results are available within 48 hours. Blood tests may show evidence of past infections or suggest a recent one.//Genital herpes treatment//It is important to note that no treatment cures genital herpes, but only reduces the duration of each outbreak. On the other hand, the number and frequency of occurrences can be reduced by adopting continuous prophylaxis with low doses of antiviral medication. Treatment is most effective if started quickly, usually two days after the onset of symptoms. Acyclovir or related antiviral drugs can be administered orally or in cream form directly to the lesions. These medications reduce the spread of live virus from lesions, thereby reducing the risk of infection. They can also reduce the severity of symptoms during the initial outbreak. However, even early treatment of the first attack does not prevent recurrences.//Prevention//The best form of prevention is not to have sex with people infected with Herpes simplex. In the case of sexually active people, it is important, even in monogamous and stable relationships, to carry out regular laboratory tests to screen for this and other sexually transmitted diseases. Using a condom reduces the risk of infection by the virus. However, since herpes lesions can occur in areas adjacent to the genitals, infection can occur even when a condom is used.

                    "//What is it?//HPV, or Human Papilloma Virus, is responsible for a high number of infections, which are most often asymptomatic and regress spontaneously. This is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections worldwide. HPV can lead to benign lesions, such as warts, condylomas and benign lesions of the oropharynx, and, in relatively rare situations, can progress to cancer, with special emphasis on cervical cancer. As the name suggests, HPV is a common virus in humans, responsible for the formation of lesions called papillomas. There are different types of HPV; some types can infect the anogenital area, while others infect areas such as the feet or hands, where they can lead to warts or \u201cblackheads.\u201d Viruses that infect the anogenital area can be transmitted\u00a0during vaginal, oral, or anal sex, or during intimate skin-to-skin contact between people where at least one person is infected. In the sexually active population, 50 to 80% of individuals acquire HPV infection at some point in their lives, although in the vast majority of cases there is no progression to symptomatic disease. Cervical cancer, the second most common type of cancer in women worldwide, is the most relevant disease associated with HPV infection, especially when it is not detected early, progressing to invasive forms. In fact, approximately 100% of cervical cancer cases are related to HPV infection. Progression to cervical cancer is very slow and generally asymptomatic. Persistent HPV infection has a prolonged latency period (years or decades between the onset of infection and the development of tumors) passing through several phases. To date, there are more than 200 types of HPV identified, of which around 40 preferentially infect the anogenital system: vulva, vagina, cervix, penis and perianal areas. Regarding cervical cancer, existing national data points to around 1,000 new cases every year, with an incidence rate of 20.95/100,000 women, for all ages. Total mortality from cervical cancer in Portugal is 4.5/100,000 women over 15 years of age. HPV can also be associated with cancer of the vulva, penis and anus, among others.//Symptoms//HPV generally causes a silent infection in which many of those infected have no symptoms or signs. Sometimes warts are present but not visible because they are located on an internal part of the body, or because they are very small. Anogenital warts, also called condylomas, can appear as small, raised, cauliflower-like lesions, or they can be flat. In women, warts can appear on the vulva, cervix, thighs, anus, rectum, or urethra. HPV does not appear to affect the ability to get pregnant. In very rare situations, HPV can lodge in the oropharynx of an infected child during birth. During pregnancy, the number and size of warts may increase, but they usually decrease after giving birth.//Causes//Genital HPV infections are generally transmitted sexually, through direct contact with the skin or mucosa, and, more rarely, during childbirth. Some cases of transmission by orogenital contact have also been described. Although many women become infected with HPV, the infection rarely progresses to cancer. Some factors have been identified that increase the risk of persistent HPV infection and progression to cancer: some types of virus (HPV 16 and HPV 18); co-infection with various immunodeficiencies; early onset of sexual activity; multiple sexual partners; multiple births; genetic predisposition; smoking habits; co-infection with other sexually transmitted microorganisms (mainly Herpes Simplex virus type 2 and Chlamydia trachomatis). Some studies suggest that prolonged use of oral contraceptives may be another risk factor for progression to cervical cancer.//Diagnosis//Regularly performing the Pap test helps identify early changes in colon cells, allowing for treatment and surveillance. This routine cytological test is an important screening tool, as there is no way to know in advance which person the virus will persist and develop into cancer. If these changes are not identified early, there is the possibility of them developing into more serious injuries and, eventually, cancer. The HPV-DNA test, which enables the genetic characterization of the virus, is available in Portugal, but is not part of regular screening. This more specific test can be recommended in situations of colon changes detected by the screening test.//Treatment//There is no known cure for HPV infections, but the vast majority of people have an adequate immune system and can eliminate the infection from their bodies. Although a high percentage of sexually active people are infected with HPV, only a small proportion will develop cancer. Treatment involves applying a product to the lesions. Methods may include cryotherapy, electrocoagulation, laser or, very rarely, surgical excision. Sometimes warts can return after treatment, making it necessary to repeat the treatment.//Prevention//Preventing HPV infection depends, above all, on the behaviors adopted. It is important to know preventive measures and use them consistently, learn to recognize the signs and symptoms of sexually transmitted infections, their consequences and methods of transmission. Women should regularly undergo a gynecological examination and undergo colpocytology and/or HPV-DNA testing, if recommended and available, even if you have had the vaccine. The use of condoms is recommended to prevent all sexually transmitted infections. It is important to emphasize that areas of skin not covered by the condom are not protected. It is very important to talk to your partner about sexually transmitted infections and their prevention and to bear in mind that a partner's previous behaviors are also a risk factor, especially if they have had multiple previous partners. Vaccination is essential and should be done by women, in accordance with the National Vaccination Program, or as recommended by a doctor. There are currently two vaccines that offer protection against types 16 and 18, responsible for around 70% of cervical cancer cases. One of them also protects against types 6 and 11, responsible for around 90% of anogenital warts,\u00a0and, additionally, against types 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58, which provide extra protection against cervical cancers in plus 20%. Routine universal vaccination with the HPV vaccine applies to young people who turn ten years of age in the respective calendar year, in two doses. Vaccination does not require any prior analytical test to be carried out.

                    "//What is it?//AIDS is a clinical condition resulting from HIV infection, of which two types are known: HIV 1 and HIV 2. It is a disease that is transmitted through blood and sexual contact - which is why anyone can be infected - in which HIV invades the blood cells responsible for defending the body against other infections and some tumors, compromising them. a. In a patient with greatly reduced defenses, even a simple infection can become fatal. The first cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) were reported in the 1980s and, currently, according to the World Health Organization, it is estimated that there are around 36.9 million people infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Regarding the national panorama, \u201cby the end of 2017, 57,913 cases of HIV infection were cumulatively diagnosed in Portugal, of which 22,102 reached the AIDS stage\u201d - HIV and AIDS Infection Report from the Reference and Epidemiological Surveillance Unit of the Department of Infectious Diseases from the National Institute of Health Doutor Ricardo Jorge, in collaboration with the National Program for HIV Infection and AIDS of the Directorate-General for Health.//Symptoms//HIV infection at the beginning is barely noticeable because the symptoms are mild and can be confused with the flu or a common virus. In around 30% of cases, a short, feverish period with no special characteristics occurs 10 to 15 days after infection, as if it were the flu. After infection, AIDS has a long period of silent evolution without causing the slightest disturbance or complaint. This is the period during which the virus takes hold, begins to invade and destroy lymphocytes (the cells responsible for our defences) and to multiply. During this phase, the body compensates for this loss of cells by increasing its production and trying to eliminate the virus. Its duration is very variable (on average 8 to 10 years) and depends on the intensity and severity of the infection, the body's defence capacity and the occurrence of other diseases that reduce the defence capacity. During this period, the patient is referred to as being a carrier of the virus or HIV-positive, since the tests carried out at this stage can identify its presence. Even without signs of illness, an HIV carrier can infect anyone with whom they have sexual contact. At the end of this long silent phase, the body's defenses collapse and all the complications that define AIDS appear: Infections caused by common microorganisms that are more serious here;/ Infections by rarer agents;/ Some types of cancer that, under normal conditions, would not be able to develop;///Causes//For HIV to develop and proliferate and thus cause disease, it must have access to the bloodstream, since outside, outside the cells, it is quickly destroyed. The main forms of transmission of this virus are as follows: Blood products and derivatives. This route is currently very rare because all blood donors undergo laboratory tests for this virus.;/ Use of contaminated needles. This scenario is impossible in healthcare facilities, where all needles are disposable, but it can occur in the context of drug addiction through the sharing of syringes and needles. Thanks to various information measures, this route of transmission has been substantially reduced.;/ Sexual contact. Any unprotected sexual relationship, heterosexual (the most common form of transmission in Portugal, which corresponds to around 60% of cases) or homosexual, can be a form of transmission of this virus.;/ Pregnancy. It is possible for an infected pregnant woman to transmit the virus to her children. Appropriate treatment during pregnancy significantly reduces this risk. Infection at the time of birth or during breastfeeding is much less likely.;///Diagnosis//The diagnosis is simple and is based on the analysis of saliva or blood where antibodies against HIV can be found. Generally, these tests are still negative in the first few weeks after infection. However, new tests have been developed that allow for faster diagnosis, in the first few days after infection, which is important, as the earlier the infection is detected, the more effective the treatment will be. In addition to confirming the presence of infection, laboratory tests are important in defining the progression of AIDS and selecting the best medications to treat it.//Treatment//There is still no cure for AIDS. It is a virus with an enormous capacity for multiplication and which undergoes numerous mutations that make treatment difficult because they often make the virus resistant to current medications. The number of medications available to control this infection is currently very significant and, in most cases, it is possible to maintain a good quality of life for a long time. The effectiveness of the treatment depends on the early diagnosis and regular medical control that makes it possible to assess, at each moment, the maintenance of the response to the selected medications.//Prevention//There is still no effective vaccine against this virus. In prevention, risk groups should not be considered, but rather risk behaviors, and therefore, correct information and the use of common sense allow, in many cases, to keep this virus at bay. Prevention includes adopting measures such as: Condom use;/ Avoid direct contact with blood or blood products;/ Take the HIV test;/ AIDS Portugal, 2013 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, abril de 2012 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, agosto de 2012 National Institute of Health Dr. Ricardo Jorge National Program for HIV/AIDS Infection RSV infection can progress to bronchiolitis or pneumonia. M\u00f4nica Cr\u00f3 Braz, Pediatrician, points out the warning signs and prevention strategies. The pandemic has brought pediatricians an additional concern: Respiratory Syncytial Virus.

                    "//What is it?//Marburg virus was first detected in 1967, after several simultaneous outbreaks occurred in laboratories located in Marburg and Frankfurt, Germany, and in Belgrade, Serbia. Like the Ebola virus, this virus belongs to the Filoviridae family. Although the diseases caused by the Marburg virus and Ebola are different, they have similar clinical profiles, capable of causing outbreaks with high mortality rates. The disease caused by the Marburg virus is a rare, serious type of hemorrhagic fever with a high mortality rate - on average, 50%, but it can vary between 24% and 88%, depending on several factors, such as the strain of the virus and the health care provided to the patient. The bat Rousettus aegyptiacus, which is distributed throughout Africa, is considered a natural host of the Marburg virus, but it has also been detected in monkeys and chimpanzees. This is a zoonotic disease, meaning it can be transmitted from animals to humans. The virus can also infect other non-human primates, and more studies are needed to determine whether other species can also be hosts for the virus. Outbreaks have been reported in Africa, including cases in: Gana;/ Uganda;/ Zimbabwe;/ Democratic Republic of the Congo;/ Kenya;/ Angola;/ South Africa;/  Although cases of Marburg virus disease have occurred outside of Africa (as in 1967), these are rare.//Symptoms of Marburg Virus//The incubation period (interval between the moment of infection and the appearance of symptoms) of the disease caused by the Marburg virus can vary between two and 21 days (or up to 26 days). Symptoms appear suddenly and include: High fever;/ Goosebumps;/ Severe headache;/ Severe malaise;/ Muscle pain (myalgia);/ Severe diarrhea (appears around the 3rd day of symptoms and can last up to a week);/ Nausea and vomiting (usually appear on the 3rd day);/ Abdominal pain and cramps (usually appear on the 3rd day);/ Fatigue, sunken eyes and severe lack of strength;/ Chest pain;/ Sore throat;/  Around the 5th day of symptoms, a maculopapular rash (reddish spots and papules) may occur, mainly on the chest, abdomen and back. Five to seven days after the onset of symptoms, severe bleeding may appear, which is associated with the majority of fatal cases (often bleeding in multiple areas of the body). Blood in stool and vomit is often accompanied by bleeding from the nose, gums and vagina (in women). Bleeding may also occur in areas where the skin is punctured to obtain intravenous lines (to administer fluids, medications or obtain blood tests). In the most severe phase of the disease, patients maintain a high fever and the following may also occur: Confusion;/ Aggressiveness;/ Irritability;/  As the disease progresses, symptoms can become more severe and include: Jaundice;/ Shock;/ Liver failure;/ Inflammation of the pancreas;/ Multiple organ dysfunction and failure;/ Severe weight loss;/ Delusions;/ Severe bleeding;/ Orchitis (inflammation of one or both testicles - in the case of men);/  In very severe cases resulting in death, this most often occurs between the 8th and 9th day after the onset of symptoms and is usually preceded by severe blood loss, shock and multiple organ failure.//Causes//The Marburg virus is transmitted from the bat Rousettus aegyptiacus to humans (when there is prolonged exposure to the habitat of these animals), and contagion between humans can then occur. From person to person, transmission can occur through: Direct contact (through breaks in the skin or mucous membranes) with the blood, secretions (e.g. respiratory), organs and other fluids (feces, urine, vomit, saliva) of the infected person.;/ Contact with surfaces and materials, such as clothing and bedding, contaminated with the previously mentioned fluids.;/ Through infected semen - this type of contagion can occur up to seven weeks after the person is considered clinically recovered.;/ Use of infected injection equipment and needlestick injuries.;/  Transmission of the Marburg virus does not occur during the incubation period and, usually, infected people are contagious only after symptoms appear. So, people are considered infectious as long as the virus is detected in their blood. Contamination of other people can occur even after the patient's death, for example, through contact with the body during funeral ceremonies. It is known that Marburg virus can persist in some recovered people. Recurrence without reinfection in someone who has recovered from the disease is a rare event, but it has been documented.//Diagnosis of Marburg virus//It may be difficult to distinguish clinically between Marburg virus disease and other infectious diseases (such as malaria, meningitis, typhoid fever, shigellosis, and other viral hemorrhagic fevers). Therefore, blood tests are necessary, which detect the presence of an immune response to this virus in order to confirm whether the disease is effectively caused by the Marburg virus - ELISA method (immunoenzymatic serological test), RT-PCR tests, among others . These diagnostic methods are often not available in countries that have fewer health care resources and a higher risk of outbreak.//Marburg virus treatment//Despite the high mortality rate (which can reach 88%), this can be much lower when adequate health care is provided. To increase the likelihood of survival, early oral or intravenous hydration and symptomatic treatment are very important. To date, there is no approved specific antiviral treatment or vaccine for Marburg virus disease, but there are several therapies in development (such as immunotherapy or drugs). Although the disease caused by the Marburg virus is similar to Ebola, the Ebola vaccine is not effective in preventing this infection.//Prevention//Some strategies that can help prevent community transmission of Marburg virus include: Avoid traveling to areas where there are active outbreaks of the disease.;/ Reduce the risk of transmission from the bat Rousettus aegyptiacus to humans, such as using protective equipment (such as gloves, masks and appropriate clothing) when visiting the habitat of these animals (caves or mines).;/ Avoid eating bushmeat. When there are active outbreaks, all animal products (blood and meat) should be consumed thoroughly cooked/cooked.;/ Avoid close and direct contact with infected people.;/ Avoid contact with clothing, bedding or other objects that have been in contact with infected patients.;/ Use gloves and other protective equipment if it is necessary to care for the patient at home and at funeral ceremonies for people who were sick.;/ Wash your hands frequently (or, when this is not possible, use alcohol gel), especially after visiting the patient in the hospital and in care.;/ Men who have recovered from the infection, in order to reduce sexual transmission of the virus, must reinforce the adoption of safe sexual practices and hygiene in the 12 months following the onset of symptoms or until the semen has tested negative for the presence of the virus twice in a laboratory analysis.;/  Healthcare professionals must wear facial protection (visor, mask and glasses), long-sleeved lab coat and gloves whenever providing close care to patients with Marburg virus.

                    "//What is it?//Epstein-Barr (VEB) is a virus that belongs to the group of human herpesviruses. It is one of the most common, being present all over the world. Around 50% of children up to 5 years of age are infected and more than 90% of adults carry the virus. This means that most people, at some point in their lives, become infected with Epstein-Barr.  EBV is mainly known for causing infectious mononucleosis (popularly known as the kissing disease). It can also be associated with other diseases and complications, such as: Ear infections;/ Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome;/ Nose, throat and gastric cancer;/ Burkitt's lymphoma;/ Hodgkin's lymphoma;/ Interstitial pneumonia;/ Pancytopenia (decrease in the number of blood cells);/ Uveitis (inflammation of the uvea, the vascular layer of the eyeball);/  Recent studies also show that the Epstein-Barr Virus could be associated with multiple sclerosis. The virus is found mainly in saliva and nasal secretions and infects B lymphocytes. After the first infection, EBV remains permanently in the host and spreads asymptomatically and intermittently from the oropharynx. Spread is greater in immunocompromised patients (e.g. HIV patients or organ recipients).//Symptoms//Infection with the Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is generally asymptomatic and the incubation period for the virus is approximately 30 to 50 days. In children, symptoms, if they exist, may not be distinguishable from other common illnesses such as a cold or flu. Young people and adults generally have more characteristic symptoms of the disease, which may include: Fatigue;/ Fever;/ Sore throat;/ Appearance of lymph nodes in the neck;/ Lack of appetite;/ Skin irritation - rash;/ Headache;/ Tonsillitis;/  In more serious cases, the infection can also cause an increase in the size of the liver and spleen and generate neurological, hematological, respiratory and hepatic complications. Symptoms usually disappear after two to four weeks, but tiredness can last for months.//Causes//The Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is transmitted, above all, through saliva between an infected person and an uninfected person - hence mononucleosis, the most common disease caused by this virus, is also known as \u201ckissing disease\u201d -, but also through use of contaminated objects, such as toothbrushes or glasses. EBV is also found in blood and sperm, so it is possible to spread it through transfusions of untreated blood, organ transplants or sexual intercourse. When a patient becomes infected for the first time - the so-called primary infection - they can spread the virus for weeks while being asymptomatic. After this first infection, the virus remains in the patient's body and can become active again, making the person contagious again.//Diagnosis//Diagnosing Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection can be time-consuming, as the symptoms are easily confused with other illnesses such as flu or tonsillitis. Examination of the patient at the doctor's appointment may reveal more details, such as swelling of the liver or spleen and white spots on the tonsils. The blood count can also detect the infection, by finding antibodies to the virus or leukocytes (white blood cells), produced by the immune system to fight the infection.//Treatment//There is no specific medication to treat Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection, and it must follow its natural course until cured, generally after two to four weeks. However, the patient can take some measures to alleviate symptoms: Increase your fluid intake to stay hydrated;/ Rest during the acute phase of the disease;/ Avoid doing sports and demanding physical activities;/ Taking medicines such as ibuprofen or paracetamol to relieve pain and fever;/  Antibiotics should not be administered, as this is an infection caused by viruses and not bacteria. In more serious cases, corticosteroids may be used.//Prevention//There is no vaccine against Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection. Therefore, the best form of prevention is to avoid contact with infected people or objects. You should not kiss or share drinks, food and personal objects with anyone who is infected. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, February 2022 MSD Manual, February 2022 National Health Service, February 2022 WebMD, February 2022 When mononucleosis affects you or a family member, it is important to consider the types of foods and drinks that can help fight this viral infection.

                    "//What is it?//Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the main cause of bronchiolitis and viral pneumonia in babies and young children. The likelihood of serious infection caused by RSV is greater in children: Premature;;/ Up to 2 years old who were born with heart or lung disease;;/ Whose immune system is weakened due to illness or medical treatment;;/ Less than 8 to 10 weeks old;;/  The World Health Organization estimates that 33 million lower respiratory tract infections caused by Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) occur annually in children under 5 years of age worldwide, of which 3.3 million require hospitalization. Around 60,000 of these children end up losing their lives due to complications.//Symptoms of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)//RSV infection typically manifests itself four to six days after infection and the main symptoms include: Runny nose;;/ Loss of appetite;;/ Cough;;/ Sneezing;;/ Fever;;/ Wheezing/wheezing.;/  As a general rule, these symptoms do not appear all at the same time and some may not appear at all. In very young babies, the only symptoms of RSV may be irritability, decreased activity, refusal to feed, or difficulty breathing. In children younger than 6 months, apnea (obstruction of airflow to the lungs) may be the initial symptom of RSV infection. In healthy adults and older children, the illness is usually mild and may be virtually asymptomatic or manifest as just a common cold.//Causes//Like other viruses that cause respiratory infections, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is also transmitted through secretions from the nose or mouth. Contagion is easy and can occur through direct contact (for example, when kissing the face of an infected child) or through droplets expelled when talking, coughing or sneezing. The virus can still remain on surfaces for hours, and this aspect is of great importance, considering that sharing toys is one of the most common ways of transmitting RSV among children, in daycare centers and nurseries. Epidemics tend to be seasonal, with the peak generally recorded between December and January, although the virus can circulate at other times of the year. Having been infected once does not protect against reinfection, but the antibodies that are developing against RSV contribute to a decrease in the severity of the disease. The contagious period begins two days before symptoms appear and only ends when the infection is completely controlled. However, some children and adults with weakened immune systems can continue to spread the virus even after no symptoms, for up to four weeks.//RSV Diagnosis//The diagnosis of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is usually made based on the patient's clinical history and observation, including auscultation of the lungs. The doctor also takes into account the time of year and the circulation of the virus at the time. Although it is not the most common, it is possible that the clinician will resort to some tests, especially if the disease is serious, requires hospitalization or rules out other diagnoses. Among the tests that the attending physician may use include: Blood and urine tests, with the aim of identifying associated complications or other causes that explain the symptoms;;/ Chest X-ray, to look for signs of pneumonia or identify lung complications associated with RSV;;/ Rapid antigen tests, PCR tests or virus culture.;///Treatment of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)//Most RSV infections eventually go away after a week or two, and nothing more than relieving symptoms is needed, similar to what is done for most colds. There is no specific treatment for RSV, so as a rule it is advised to manage fever and pain with antipyretics/pain relievers and drink plenty of fluids, preferably water, to prevent dehydration and help thin secretions. Although treatment can be carried out at home, it is important that the evolution of the situation is monitored and that a doctor is consulted in case of difficulty breathing, dehydration or worsening of symptoms. Before administering any medication to a child, it is advisable to ask the attending physician for help, bearing in mind that not all medications are suitable. People with breathing difficulties may be hospitalized (especially children and the elderly) and, depending on the clinical picture, doctors may treat them with oxygen, intravenous hydration and medications or procedures (intubation) to open the airways.//RSV prevention//The main measures to prevent infection with Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) are similar to those for other respiratory viral infections, namely: Hygiene: frequent hand washing with running water and soap. If washing is not possible, it is advisable to use alcohol gel, particularly in public places. Frequently clean high-touch surfaces, such as door handles, handrails, switches and screens of electronic devices;;/ Respiratory etiquette: anyone showing symptoms of a respiratory infection should wear a mask, especially if they come into contact with children or the elderly. In situations where you do not wear a mask, you must protect your nose and mouth with a disposable tissue or your forearm when sneezing or coughing, throw away used tissues and wash your hands immediately;;/ Avoid close contact: anyone with symptoms compatible with RSV should avoid close contact with other people, that is, kissing, touching hands and sharing glasses, cups or cutlery. Care must be taken in the case of children and the elderly who are at high risk of serious RSV infections;;/ Immunization: although not yet considered a vaccine, the long-acting monoclonal antibody nirsevimab was recently approved for immunization against RSV. Immunization will be seasonal, taking place every year between October 1 and March 31. It should be administered at birth, for those born during that period in public, private or social sector maternity hospitals. Immunity lasts only six months, so taking it does not provide lifelong immunity but only for the autumn/winter of the year in which it is administered*. The introduction of this new immunization represents a major achievement in the fight against RSV, particularly among the most vulnerable. This measure is expected to significantly reduce hospitalizations and significantly increase the number of lives saved, as well as preventing seasonal outbreaks of this common and challenging agent.;/  *Exceptionally, in 2024 the following will be covered: I. Babies born in August and September; II. Preterm children up to 34 weeks (exclusive) born between January 1st and July 31st; III. Children with other risk factors for serious RSV infection such as heart disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and other chronic lung diseases who have not yet turned 2 years old by September 30, 2024.

                    "//What is it?//Cytomegalovirus is a common virus, part of the herpes virus family, that can infect anyone, regardless of age. Once infected, the virus remains dormant and can reactivate. In pregnant women or patients with a depressed immune system, this virus can cause complications.//Symptoms//When they first contract the virus, some individuals may experience flu-like symptoms, such as: Fever;/ Muscle pain;/ Tiredness;/ Manchas na pele;/ Discomfort;/ Sore throat;/ Enlarged lymph nodes;/  As a general rule, treatment is symptomatic - that is, the symptoms are treated. In some cases, cytomegalovirus can cause mononucleosis or hepatitis.//You drink//Most babies with congenital cytomegalovirus appear healthy at the time of birth. Some of them develop symptoms only later - sometimes months or years after birth. Among these late symptoms, the most common are hearing loss or developmental delay. A small number of babies may still develop vision problems. In the case of babies with congenital cytomegalovirus, who present symptoms right at birth, some of the most common are: Premature birth;/ Low birth weight;/ Yellow skin and eyes (jaundice);/ Enlarged and malfunctioning liver or spleen;/ Purple spots and/or rash;/ Abnormally small head (microcephaly);/ Pneumonia;/ Seizures;///Immunocompromised patients//People with compromised immune systems may experience severe symptoms that affect multiple organs.//Diagnosis//The presence of cytomegalovirus can be detected through laboratory tests, for example, of blood or other body fluids. In the case of newborn babies, blood tests are not the best option; It is preferable to do a urine analysis. In pregnant women, there is the possibility of carrying out tests to check whether the woman is infected with this virus. In the case of pregnant women who already have antibodies against cytomegalovirus, the risk of reactivation of the infection - and consequent transmission to the fetus - is very low. However, if the doctor detects a new cytomegalovirus infection during pregnancy, performing an amniocentesis (taking a sample of amniotic fluid) can determine whether or not the fetus has been infected with the virus. Pregnant women who experience a viral/flu-like condition should speak to their attending physician who, if necessary, may prescribe tests to diagnose cytomegalovirus. The doctor may do this even if the woman has no symptoms. If the attending physician suspects that the baby may have congenital cytomegalovirus, it is important to undergo testing within the first three weeks after birth. If your baby is confirmed to have cytomegalovirus, your healthcare provider may recommend additional tests to assess the status of your organs, such as your liver, kidneys, vision, hearing, and brain. In the case of immunosuppressed patients, it is also important to perform tests to detect the presence of cytomegalovirus. For example, people who have HIV or who have had a transplant are monitored regularly.//Causes//Cytomegalovirus can go through several cycles/periods where it is \"dormant\" and then reactivates. In healthy people, this virus remains essentially inactive. During periods when cytomegalovirus is active in the body, we can transmit it to other people. Transmission occurs through bodily fluids \u2013 including blood, urine, saliva, breast milk, tears, semen and vaginal fluids. Casual contact does not transmit cytomegalovirus. Some ways the virus is transmitted include: Touching your eyes or the inside of your mouth/nose after you have come into contact with bodily fluids from an infected person.;/ Having sexual relations with an infected person.;/ Coming into contact with the breast milk of an infected woman.;/ Organ, bone marrow or stem cell transplants or blood transfusions.;/ The birth. An infected mother can pass the virus to her baby before or during birth. The risk of transmission is greater if a woman becomes infected for the first time during pregnancy.;///Treatment//As a general rule, healthy children and adults do not need treatment for the infection caused by cytomegalovirus. They simply need to take some precautions to help their body fight the infection, such as rest and symptomatic treatment. On the other hand, newborns and immunocompromised people who show symptoms may need treatment, depending on the severity of the infection. Antiviral drugs are the most common therapy. Although they do not eliminate the virus, they can reduce its reproduction and the risk of more serious problems. New medications and vaccines are being studied to treat and prevent cytomegalovirus infection.//Prevention//The best strategy for preventing cytomegalovirus is good hygiene. In this sense, some important measures include: Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for 15-20 seconds, especially after contact with younger children or their diapers, saliva or other oral fluids.;/ Avoid contact with a child's tears and saliva, especially if you are pregnant.;/ Do not share food or drink from the same glass as other people.;/ Be careful with disposable items, such as diapers or wipes, that may be contaminated with bodily fluids. Before touching your face, wash your hands thoroughly.;/ Clean toys, countertops, or other surfaces that may have come into contact with a child's urine or saliva.;/ Practice safe sex.

                    "//Infections caused by Bacteria//Among bacteria, the most common disease is impetigo. It is a superficial skin infection caused by streptococcus or staphylococcus. Yellowish or reddish crusts are observed in more or less extensive areas. When the patient moves, he spreads the infection. It may not cause any complaints or may cause burning or itching. It often appears superimposed on another pre-existing disease on the scalp. It is treated with vigorous washing with soap and water, topical antibiotic ointment to break down the crusts and possibly oral antibiotics (usually erythromycin or flucloxacillin). Much less common are deeper skin infections, such as ectima, which causes ulcerations covered by crusts, and erysipelas/cellulitis, which causes large areas of redness and swelling, usually in patients with fever and general malaise. Treatment is with oral antibiotics, although in more severe cases hospitalization and intravenous medication may be necessary.//Infections caused by Viruses//Among the viruses, the most common to affect the scalp are the herpes virus and varicella-zooster. Although the herpes virus most often affects the face, it can also affect the scalp. The patient complains of burning and redness and grouped micro-vesicles are observed. Chickenpox, as is common knowledge, often affects the scalp, usually in the form of micro-vesicles. The same virus (varicella-zoster) in those who have had chickenpox causes the so-called \u201cshingles\u201d, which frequently affects the scalp. The pain and burning are more intense than in the case of herpes simplex and the affected area extends along the dermatome (skin with the same embryonic origin and with common innervation). These infections are treated with oral antivirals (acyclovir, valacyclovir), relieving pain/burning and preventing secondary infection. In children, the very common molluscum contagiosum virus can cause centrally depressed lumps that are easily removed by the doctor.//Fungal Infections//Scalp ringworm is a superficial fungal infection of the skin. It is much more common in children. The most frequent agents vary by geography. In Portugal and most developed countries, the most common agents are of the genus Tricophyton and Microsporum. There may be itching, which is the most common complaint, but is not mandatory. Upon observation, the most common thing is that there is simply peeling in a localized area of \u200b\u200bthe skin, and there may or may not be redness that becomes more evident on the periphery of the lesion. The lesions grow centrifugally.\u00a0 Rarely, there may be lumps with actual pus lakes or large yellowish plaques. The doctor must collect material to be able to identify the agent.  The most useful antifungal medicine is griseofluvin (currently not available in Portugal), so we often use terbinafine, itraconazole and fluconazole. Load more;/ It is a fungus that is resistant to the medications normally used to treat fungal infections and has therefore raised some concern in the medical community.

                    "//What is it?//It is almost always a self-limiting disease, in the form of acute gastroenteritis. More rarely, it can be associated with generalized infection, arthritis, meningitis or pneumonia, among others. Salmonella is a bacteria responsible for infections in humans. There are two species which, in turn, are divided into subgroups. Knowledge of these divisions is important in the case of epidemics to be able to identify the source of infection and also to better study the resistance to antibiotics that these bacteria may present. Salmonella gastroenteritis represents a global public health problem, with its real incidence being much higher than the number of declared cases. In the United States, it is estimated that there are 1.4 million incidents per year, with only 10% being declared. These infections are more common in the summer months. In Portugal, between 2004 and 2008, 456 episodes were reported annually, 82% of which were in children under 15 years of age. Although a relationship is recognized between hygiene and sanitary conditions, the availability of drinking water and the way food is stored and prepared, in recent decades there has been an increase in its incidence in industrialized countries, a fact that can be justified by globalization and the changing eating habits.//Symptoms//In most cases, it manifests as diarrhea, abdominal pain and fever that develop 12 to 72 hours after infection. The disease lasts between four and seven days and most people recover without needing any treatment. In some cases, the infection can be serious and require hospitalization. This happens when it spreads from the intestines to the bloodstream and from there to other parts of the body. This condition requires urgent treatment with antibiotics. The most serious forms occur in the elderly, children and people with weakened immune systems. Most recover spontaneously, but some patients develop joint complaints, eye irritation and burning sensation when urinating. This condition is called reactive arthritis and can last months or years, leading to chronic arthritis that is difficult to treat. This situation can arise regardless of the use of antibiotics to treat gastroenteritis.//Causes//These bacteria inhabit the digestive tract of humans and other animals, such as some birds. In general, the infection is transmitted by eating food contaminated with animal feces, which, however, has a normal appearance. The most common are meat, milk, eggs and poultry, although contamination can also occur from vegetables. Correct food preparation allows the destruction of this type of bacteria. However, contagion can occur through the hands of those who handle or make them. Since Salmonella can be present in the feces of some domestic animals or pets, this is another possible source, especially if people do not wash their hands after coming into contact with them. Some reptiles, such as turtles and snakes, can also harbor this bacteria, so hand washing is essential, even if they are healthy.//Diagnosis//There are many diseases that can manifest with diarrhea, fever and abdominal pain. For this reason, diagnosis requires a laboratory study, using stool samples, to identify Salmonella and its subtype.//Treatment//Salmonella gastroenteritis rarely requires treatment, other than adequate hydration, and improves after five to seven days. If the diarrhea is very intense, it may be necessary to resort to intravenous hydration in a hospital environment. The use of antibiotics is only justified in cases of severe diarrhea, high fever, passage of the infection into the bloodstream, in hospitalized patients or in those at greater risk of complications, such as children, patients over 65 years of age and those with reduced defenses.//Prevention//It is important to avoid consuming undercooked foods, undercooked eggs and unpasteurized milk. All must be kept in good refrigeration conditions. Hands must be washed before preparing them, as well as the surfaces and utensils that will be used.\u00a0 Food must still be cooled before being transported from one location to another. Hands should always be washed after contact with animals, even if they do not show any signs of illness.

There are situations in which oral feeding is difficult, impossible or has risks, so it may be necessary to resort to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). We don't all react to foods the same way, but some are more likely to cause heartburn. Get to know them.
