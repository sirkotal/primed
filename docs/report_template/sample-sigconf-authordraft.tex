\section{Introduction}
Nowadays, accurate and comprehensive medicine information plays a vital role in decision-making on the healthcare and investigation sectors. Having access to clean and relevant information is crucial to enhance the efficiency and safety of treatments.

The \textit{\textbf{PRIMED}} project aims to compile and organize such data so that it can be accessed in an easy and organized way. It provides insights that can be applied both in practical cases or simply in developing new health safety politics.

In this part of the project, data from various sources was collected, processed and analysed with the goal of creating a solid basis for a pharmaceutical system. The whole process is described in this document, from the choice of the theme itself up to the analysis of gathered data and its subsequent classification.

\section{Theme Selection}
The choice to focus on medicines as the central theme for this project stems from the critical role they play in modern healthcare. Medication is the primary tool for treating multiple health problems and conditions, making them an essential component in both public healthcare systems and individual patient care. The data surrounding these substances, such as active substances, applicable cases and clinical trials, offers valuable insights that can improve decision-making in medical practice and pharmaceutics.

\section{Data Collection}
This chapter outlines the data selection process and the methods utilized to gather it.

\subsection{Selection of Data}
One of the main challenges of the healthcare sector is ensuring that accurate and up-to-date information on medication is available to healthcare professionals. Given these needs, the selection of data to be collected was made:

\begin{itemize}
	\item {\texttt{Medicines}}: The main component of the data, consisting of medicines and their respective relevant, intrinsic information.
	\item {\texttt{Sicknesses}}: To complement the collected data, information on some diseases was collected so that it would be possible to get more information to allow for an easier medicine selection process.
	\item {\texttt{Pharmaceutical Companies}}: Some pharmaceutical companies are more trusted than others due to their credibility and higher quality products, which can impact the decision-making process.
	\item {\texttt{Reviews}}: It is important to know the success rate of the presented medicine and how the people who use it feel about it.
\end{itemize}

With this data, the aim is to provide the required information to the users.

\subsection{Gathering}

Finding data suitable for the project proved to be a challenge; not only did it have to be relevant and accurate, but it also had to meet some criteria in terms of quantity and quality. Therefore, the data had to be gathered from multiple sources using different methods - most of the data came from prepared datasets found on Kaggle, while the rest came from scraping Wikipedia.

\subsubsection{Medicines}

The Medicines dataset contains a list of pharmaceutical treatments and some relevant, mostly textual, information about the cases where it is used.

The present information on this dataset is:
\begin{itemize}
	\item {\texttt{Medicine Name}}: The name of the treatment.
	\item {\texttt{Composition}}: The active ingredient on the treatment.
	\item {\texttt{Uses}}: A list of the cases where the treatment is used, mostly sicknesses.
	\item {\texttt{Side effects}}: Another list, this time, of possible side effects of this medicine.
	\item {\texttt{Manufacturer}}: The name of the company responsible for creating the medicine treatment.
	\item {\texttt{Reviews}}: Three other columns of "Excellent", "Average" and "Poor" reviews of each treatment.
\end{itemize}

This dataset was available on \href{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/singhnavjot2062001/11000-medicine-details}{\textit{\textbf{Kaggle}}}, containing about 11000 lines of data and a \href{https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/}{\textit{\textbf{CC0 1.0 Universal}}} licence, which allows for the copying and modification of the data.

\subsubsection{Sicknesses}

This dataset was gathered with the aim of complementing the previous data on the "Uses" or "Side effects" columns, containing more information on the disease. Note that these sicknesses are only autoimmune diseases.

The information extracted from this dataset is:
\begin{itemize}
	\item {\texttt{Disease}}: The name of the disease.
	\item {\texttt{Primary organ/body part affected}}: Information of the affected part of the body by the disease.
	\item {\texttt{Autoantibodies}}: Antibodies that are directly affected by it.
	\item {\texttt{Acceptance as an autoimmune disease}}: How probable it is for the disease to be considered autoimmune.
	\item {\texttt{Prevalence rate (US))}}: The percentage of people or how many the disease affects in the US.
\end{itemize}

This information was scraped from the tables on this \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_autoimmune_diseases}{\textit{\textbf{Wikipedia}}} page. The gathered dataset contains about 110 lines of diseases, having the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_the_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_4.0_International_License}{\textit{\textbf{CC0 1.0 UniversalWikipedia:Text of the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License}}} licence, which allows for the sharing and adaptation of the contents.

\subsubsection{Pharmaceutical Companies}

To compliment the data on companies, another scraping of Wikipedia was made so that there could be more data on pharmaceutical companies.

The gathered information for the companies was:
\begin{itemize}
	\item {\texttt{Company name}}: The name of the company.
	\item {\texttt{Year}}: The year the company was created and, if available, when the company was shut down.
	\item {\texttt{Description}}: A short description of each company, it's values and some more information about them.
\end{itemize}

The origin of the information was a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_pharmaceutical_companies}{\textit{\textbf{pharmaceutical companies list}}} where around 700 companies names and years were gathered from and, for each company, their respective Wikipedia page's first description. This dataset also falls under the same licence ( \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_the_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_4.0_International_License}{\textit{\textbf{CC0 1.0 UniversalWikipedia:Text of the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License}}}) as the previous dataset, as it was gathered in a similar way.

\subsubsection{Reviews}

Lastly, some reviews for the arranged medicine with more personal descriptions from users was added.

The information is:
\begin{itemize}
	\item {\texttt{Unique ID}}: The ID of the review.
	\item {\texttt{Drug Name}}: Name of the drug/treatment.
	\item {\texttt{Condition}}: The condition of the patient where it was used.
	\item {\texttt{Review}}: Written review of the experience of taking the drug.
	\item {\texttt{Drug Name}}: Name of the drug/treatment.
\end{itemize}

This information was gathered from \href{https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/462/drug+review+dataset+drugs+com}{\textit{\textbf{UC Irvine}}}, containing around 215000 entries. This dataset is covered by the \href{https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode}{\textit{\textbf{Attribution 4.0 International}}} licence, which allows for the sharing and adaptation of the datasets for any purpose, provided that the appropriate credit is given.

\section{Modifications}

Modifying the template --- including but not limited to: adjusting
margins, typeface sizes, line spacing, paragraph and list definitions,
and the use of the \verb|\vspace| command to manually adjust the
vertical spacing between elements of your work --- is not allowed.

{\bfseries Your document will be returned to you for revision if
  modifications are discovered.}

\section{Pipeline Description}

\section{Conceptual Data Model}

\section{Information Needs}

\section{Dataset Characterization}

\section{Conclusions}

\section{Typefaces}

The ``\verb|acmart|'' document class requires the use of the
``Libertine'' typeface family. Your \TeX\ installation should include
this set of packages. Please do not substitute other typefaces. The
``\verb|lmodern|'' and ``\verb|ltimes|'' packages should not be used,
as they will override the built-in typeface families.

\section{Title Information}

The title of your work should use capital letters appropriately -
\url{https://capitalizemytitle.com/} has useful rules for
capitalization. Use the {\verb|title|} command to define the title of
your work. If your work has a subtitle, define it with the
{\verb|subtitle|} command.  Do not insert line breaks in your title.

If your title is lengthy, you must define a short version to be used
in the page headers, to prevent overlapping text. The \verb|title|
command has a ``short title'' parameter:
\begin{verbatim}
  \title[short title]{full title}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Authors and Affiliations}

Each author must be defined separately for accurate metadata
identification.  As an exception, multiple authors may share one
affiliation. Authors' names should not be abbreviated; use full first
names wherever possible. Include authors' e-mail addresses whenever
possible.

Grouping authors' names or e-mail addresses, or providing an ``e-mail
alias,'' as shown below, is not acceptable:
\begin{verbatim}
  \author{Brooke Aster, David Mehldau}
  \email{dave,judy,steve@university.edu}
  \email{firstname.lastname@phillips.org}
\end{verbatim}

The \verb|authornote| and \verb|authornotemark| commands allow a note
to apply to multiple authors --- for example, if the first two authors
of an article contributed equally to the work.

If your author list is lengthy, you must define a shortened version of
the list of authors to be used in the page headers, to prevent
overlapping text. The following command should be placed just after
the last \verb|\author{}| definition:
\begin{verbatim}
  \renewcommand{\shortauthors}{McCartney, et al.}
\end{verbatim}
Omitting this command will force the use of a concatenated list of all
of the authors' names, which may result in overlapping text in the
page headers.

The article template's documentation, available at
\url{https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template}, has a
complete explanation of these commands and tips for their effective
use.

Note that authors' addresses are mandatory for journal articles.

\section{Rights Information}

Authors of any work published by ACM will need to complete a rights
form. Depending on the kind of work, and the rights management choice
made by the author, this may be copyright transfer, permission,
license, or an OA (open access) agreement.

Regardless of the rights management choice, the author will receive a
copy of the completed rights form once it has been submitted. This
form contains \LaTeX\ commands that must be copied into the source
document. When the document source is compiled, these commands and
their parameters add formatted text to several areas of the final
document:
\begin{itemize}
\item the ``ACM Reference Format'' text on the first page.
\item the ``rights management'' text on the first page.
\item the conference information in the page header(s).
\end{itemize}

Rights information is unique to the work; if you are preparing several
works for an event, make sure to use the correct set of commands with
each of the works.

The ACM Reference Format text is required for all articles over one
page in length, and is optional for one-page articles (abstracts).

\section{CCS Concepts and User-Defined Keywords}

Two elements of the ``acmart'' document class provide powerful
taxonomic tools for you to help readers find your work in an online
search.

The ACM Computing Classification System ---
\url{https://www.acm.org/publications/class-2012} --- is a set of
classifiers and concepts that describe the computing
discipline. Authors can select entries from this classification
system, via \url{https://dl.acm.org/ccs/ccs.cfm}, and generate the
commands to be included in the \LaTeX\ source.

User-defined keywords are a comma-separated list of words and phrases
of the authors' choosing, providing a more flexible way of describing
the research being presented.

CCS concepts and user-defined keywords are required for for all
articles over two pages in length, and are optional for one- and
two-page articles (or abstracts).

\section{Sectioning Commands}

Your work should use standard \LaTeX\ sectioning commands:
\verb|section|, \verb|subsection|, \verb|subsubsection|, and
\verb|paragraph|. They should be numbered; do not remove the numbering
from the commands.

Simulating a sectioning command by setting the first word or words of
a paragraph in boldface or italicized text is {\bfseries not allowed.}

\section{Tables}

The ``\verb|acmart|'' document class includes the ``\verb|booktabs|''
package --- \url{https://ctan.org/pkg/booktabs} --- for preparing
high-quality tables.

Table captions are placed {\itshape above} the table.

Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best placement for
them is typically the top of the page nearest their initial cite.  To
ensure this proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the
environment \textbf{table} to enclose the table's contents and the
table caption.  The contents of the table itself must go in the
\textbf{tabular} environment, to be aligned properly in rows and
columns, with the desired horizontal and vertical rules.  Again,
detailed instructions on \textbf{tabular} material are found in the
\textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide}.

Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table~\ref{tab:freq} is included in the input file; compare the
placement of the table here with the table in the printed output of
this document.

\begin{table}
  \caption{Frequency of Special Characters}
  \label{tab:freq}
  \begin{tabular}{ccl}
    \toprule
    Non-English or Math&Frequency&Comments\\
    \midrule
    \O & 1 in 1,000& For Swedish names\\
    $\pi$ & 1 in 5& Common in math\\
    \$ & 4 in 5 & Used in business\\
    $\Psi^2_1$ & 1 in 40,000& Unexplained usage\\
  \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of the page's
live area, use the environment \textbf{table*} to enclose the table's
contents and the table caption.  As with a single-column table, this
wide table will ``float'' to a location deemed more
desirable. Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table~\ref{tab:commands} is included in the input file; again, it is
instructive to compare the placement of the table here with the table
in the printed output of this document.

\begin{table*}
  \caption{Some Typical Commands}
  \label{tab:commands}
  \begin{tabular}{ccl}
    \toprule
    Command &A Number & Comments\\
    \midrule
    \texttt{{\char'134}author} & 100& Author \\
    \texttt{{\char'134}table}& 300 & For tables\\
    \texttt{{\char'134}table*}& 400& For wider tables\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table*}

Always use midrule to separate table header rows from data rows, and
use it only for this purpose. This enables assistive technologies to
recognise table headers and support their users in navigating tables
more easily.

\section{Math Equations}
You may want to display math equations in three distinct styles:
inline, numbered or non-numbered display.  Each of the three are
discussed in the next sections.

\subsection{Inline (In-text) Equations}
A formula that appears in the running text is called an inline or
in-text formula.  It is produced by the \textbf{math} environment,
which can be invoked with the usual
\texttt{{\char'134}begin\,\ldots{\char'134}end} construction or with
the short form \texttt{\$\,\ldots\$}. You can use any of the symbols
and structures, from $\alpha$ to $\omega$, available in
\LaTeX~\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}; this section will simply show a few
examples of in-text equations in context. Notice how this equation:
\begin{math}
  \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
\end{math},
set here in in-line math style, looks slightly different when
set in display style.  (See next section).

\subsection{Display Equations}
A numbered display equation---one set off by vertical space from the
text and centered horizontally---is produced by the \textbf{equation}
environment. An unnumbered display equation is produced by the
\textbf{displaymath} environment.

Again, in either environment, you can use any of the symbols and
structures available in \LaTeX\@; this section will just give a couple
of examples of display equations in context.  First, consider the
equation, shown as an inline equation above:
\begin{equation}
  \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
\end{equation}
Notice how it is formatted somewhat differently in
the \textbf{displaymath}
environment.  Now, we'll enter an unnumbered equation:
\begin{displaymath}
  \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} x + 1
\end{displaymath}
and follow it with another numbered equation:
\begin{equation}
  \sum_{i=0}^{\infty}x_i=\int_{0}^{\pi+2} f
\end{equation}
just to demonstrate \LaTeX's able handling of numbering.

\section{Figures}

The ``\verb|figure|'' environment should be used for figures. One or
more images can be placed within a figure. If your figure contains
third-party material, you must clearly identify it as such, as shown
in the example below.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{sample-franklin}
  \caption{1907 Franklin Model D roadster. Photograph by Harris \&
    Ewing, Inc. [Public domain], via Wikimedia
    Commons. (\url{https://goo.gl/VLCRBB}).}
  \Description{A woman and a girl in white dresses sit in an open car.}
\end{figure}

Your figures should contain a caption which describes the figure to
the reader.

Figure captions are placed {\itshape below} the figure.

Every figure should also have a figure description unless it is purely
decorative. These descriptions convey what’s in the image to someone
who cannot see it. They are also used by search engine crawlers for
indexing images, and when images cannot be loaded.

A figure description must be unformatted plain text less than 2000
characters long (including spaces).  {\bfseries Figure descriptions
  should not repeat the figure caption – their purpose is to capture
  important information that is not already provided in the caption or
  the main text of the paper.} For figures that convey important and
complex new information, a short text description may not be
adequate. More complex alternative descriptions can be placed in an
appendix and referenced in a short figure description. For example,
provide a data table capturing the information in a bar chart, or a
structured list representing a graph.  For additional information
regarding how best to write figure descriptions and why doing this is
so important, please see
\url{https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/describing-figures/}.

\subsection{The ``Teaser Figure''}

A ``teaser figure'' is an image, or set of images in one figure, that
are placed after all author and affiliation information, and before
the body of the article, spanning the page. If you wish to have such a
figure in your article, place the command immediately before the
\verb|\maketitle| command:
\begin{verbatim}
  \begin{teaserfigure}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sampleteaser}
    \caption{figure caption}
    \Description{figure description}
  \end{teaserfigure}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Citations and Bibliographies}

The use of \BibTeX\ for the preparation and formatting of one's
references is strongly recommended. Authors' names should be complete
--- use full first names (``Donald E. Knuth'') not initials
(``D. E. Knuth'') --- and the salient identifying features of a
reference should be included: title, year, volume, number, pages,
article DOI, etc.

The bibliography is included in your source document with these two
commands, placed just before the \verb|\end{document}| command:
\begin{verbatim}
  \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}
  \bibliography{bibfile}
\end{verbatim}
where ``\verb|bibfile|'' is the name, without the ``\verb|.bib|''
suffix, of the \BibTeX\ file.

Citations and references are numbered by default. A small number of
ACM publications have citations and references formatted in the
``author year'' style; for these exceptions, please include this
command in the {\bfseries preamble} (before the command
``\verb|\begin{document}|'') of your \LaTeX\ source:
\begin{verbatim}
  \citestyle{acmauthoryear}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Acknowledgments}

Identification of funding sources and other support, and thanks to
individuals and groups that assisted in the research and the
preparation of the work should be included in an acknowledgment
section, which is placed just before the reference section in your
document.

This section has a special environment:
\begin{verbatim}
  \begin{acks}
  ...
  \end{acks}
\end{verbatim}
so that the information contained therein can be more easily collected
during the article metadata extraction phase, and to ensure
consistency in the spelling of the section heading.

Authors should not prepare this section as a numbered or unnumbered {\verb|\section|}; please use the ``{\verb|acks|}'' environment.

\section{Appendices}

If your work needs an appendix, add it before the
``\verb|\end{document}|'' command at the conclusion of your source
document.

Start the appendix with the ``\verb|appendix|'' command:
\begin{verbatim}
  \appendix
\end{verbatim}
and note that in the appendix, sections are lettered, not
numbered. This document has two appendices, demonstrating the section
and subsection identification method.

\section{Multi-language papers}

Papers may be written in languages other than English or include
titles, subtitles, keywords and abstracts in different languages (as a
rule, a paper in a language other than English should include an
English title and an English abstract).  Use \verb|language=...| for
every language used in the paper.  The last language indicated is the
main language of the paper.  For example, a French paper with
additional titles and abstracts in English and German may start with
the following command
\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass[sigconf, language=english, language=german,
               language=french]{acmart}
\end{verbatim}

The title, subtitle, keywords and abstract will be typeset in the main
language of the paper.  The commands \verb|\translatedXXX|, \verb|XXX|
begin title, subtitle and keywords, can be used to set these elements
in the other languages.  The environment \verb|translatedabstract| is
used to set the translation of the abstract.  These commands and
environment have a mandatory first argument: the language of the
second argument.  See \verb|sample-sigconf-i13n.tex| file for examples
of their usage.

\section{SIGCHI Extended Abstracts}

The ``\verb|sigchi-a|'' template style (available only in \LaTeX\ and
not in Word) produces a landscape-orientation formatted article, with
a wide left margin. Three environments are available for use with the
``\verb|sigchi-a|'' template style, and produce formatted output in
the margin:
\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{sidebar}:]  Place formatted text in the margin.
\item[\texttt{marginfigure}:] Place a figure in the margin.
\item[\texttt{margintable}:] Place a table in the margin.
\end{description}

%%
%% The acknowledgments section is defined using the "acks" environment
%% (and NOT an unnumbered section). This ensures the proper
%% identification of the section in the article metadata, and the
%% consistent spelling of the heading.
\begin{acks}
To Robert, for the bagels and explaining CMYK and color spaces.
\end{acks}

%% The next two lines define the bibliography style to be used, and
%% the bibliography file.
