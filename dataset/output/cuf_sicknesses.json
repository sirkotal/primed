    "Lung abscess": {
        "What is it?": "These are cavities that originate in the lung, with an accumulation of dead lung tissue and fluid inside. As a rule, a lung abscess corresponds to a concavity measuring one centimeter or more in diameter. They are caused by bacteria and are more common on the right side. Before the existence of antibiotics, lung abscess was a devastating disease, with a mortality rate of about a third. This situation has evolved favorably and, currently, both the mortality rate and the prognosis are much more favorable, with around 90% of patients cured through the use of medical treatment. The frequency of lung abscesses in the general population is not known. It is known that they are more common in the elderly, due to the higher prevalence of periodontal disease and higher risk of aspiration. One of the main risk factors appears to be related to immunosuppression and bronchial obstructive disease, in which cases mortality rates can reach 75%. Lung abscesses can be classified based on their duration: those lasting less than four to six weeks are considered acute, while chronic abscesses last longer. They can be single or multiple, primary and secondary, with the former being related to infectious processes, aspiration or pneumonia, and the latter being caused by pre-existing conditions, namely obstructive disease, bronchiectasis (dilation of the bronchi) or immunosuppression, among other causes.",
        "Symptoms": "The clinical picture varies, depending on the patient's history, the severity and extent of the pathology and the microorganism involved. Patients with lung abscesses caused by anaerobic bacterial agents present discrete symptoms that may evolve over weeks or months, and usually have associated gum disease. These signs may resemble those of pulmonary tuberculosis. The main signs are fever at the end of the day, with an axillary temperature of 37\u00b0 - 37.5\u00b0C, night sweats, a cough that is initially dry and then productive, difficulty breathing, chest pain, loss of appetite and weight loss. The sputum usually has a foul smell and an unpleasant taste. Blood in the sputum and pleurisy may appear if the abscess ruptures into the bronchi or the pleural cavity. Medical evaluation and auscultation provide important information that allows a better understanding of the clinical picture. Complications result from rupture into the pleural space causing empyema, pulmonary fibrosis, trapped lung, respiratory failure, bronchopleural or cutaneous-pleural fistula, and spread of infection through the bloodstream. In patients with empyema associated with lung abscess, drainage with prolonged antibiotic treatment is often essential.",
        "Causes": "It results from the passage of bacteria from the oral cavity to the lung tissue. These patients are particularly prone to aspiration pneumonia and often have periodontal disease, particularly gingivitis. The most frequent cause is anaerobic bacteria in the oral cavity. Other infectious, aerobic agents can also cause them, although less frequently. They tend to be more aggressive infections, associated with bacterial pneumonia, requiring urgent therapy, with the cavity appearing as the process of necrosis of the lung tissue develops. These include Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophylus influenzae, Streptococcus (pneumonia), Klebsiella, among others. The most vulnerable patients are those with dental or gum disease, epilepsy or alcoholism, and the risk is related to the greater possibility of aspiration of contents from the oropharynx, due to altered state of consciousness. Among the risk groups, it is worth mentioning those with alterations in the gastroesophageal junction, structural alterations of the pharynx and esophagus, reflux disease, difficulty swallowing due to neurological injury, bronchial obstruction due to tumor or foreign body, poor dental and oral hygiene, individuals unable to protect their airways, cases of coma with loss of consciousness, general anesthesia or sedation. Other situations are related to septic embolizations to the lung, caused by the existence of bacteremia (presence of bacteria in the blood) or endocarditis of the tricuspid valve.",
        "Diagnosis": "In addition to the medical assessment, a detailed analytical study must be carried out, with a blood count and inflammatory parameters being essential. Sputum collection must be performed before starting antibiotic treatment, including a sensitivity test. Blood collection for microbial culture can play an important role in identifying the cause of the clinical picture. X-rays are also useful. The typical radiographic image of a lung abscess is that of a cavity with irregular contours with an air-fluid level inside. Computerized tomography allows for better anatomical definition of the lesions. To obtain sterile material, the contents of the abscess can also be aspirated by transtracheal or transthoracic needle puncture, pleural fluid culture or blood cultures. Finally, bronchoscopy is performed when bronchial obstruction due to carcinoma or inhalation of a foreign body is suspected.",
        "Treatment": "The main problem in its\u00a0 treatment is the growing presence of antibiotic resistance. Given the high risk of recurrence with shorter therapeutic regimens, the medication should last on average four to six weeks and should be continued until the radiological image is resolved or until the lesion is reduced to a small, stable lesion. Antibiotics should initially be administered intravenously and then orally. Surgical intervention is rarely necessary, limited to cases of poor response\u00a0to medical therapy, neoplasms or congenital malformations.",
        "Prevention": "Early recognition and treatment of respiratory infections are essential to prevent their progression to lung abscess. Good oral hygiene is also important. Patients with gastroesophageal disorders should be instructed to avoid aspiration of gastric contents by sleeping with the head of the bed elevated and not overfilling the stomach before going to sleep.

    "Transient ischemic attack (TIA)": {
        "What is it?": "A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a temporary, short-lived blockage\u2014usually lasting less than five minutes\u2014of blood flow to the brain or spinal cord. If it is caused by a clot, the clot causing the blockage usually dissolves on its own, or \"breaks loose.\" Often nicknamed the \"mini stroke\" or \"stroke principle\", the fact that it causes no permanent damage means it is often ignored. However, TIA is actually a warning and can often precede a future cerebrovascular accident (CVA) - possibly in the following hours or days - and should be taken seriously and as an opportunity to take action to prevent it. Similar to a stroke, TIA can affect speech, vision, or movement in certain parts of the body.",
        "Symptoms of transient ischemic attack": "Different areas of the brain are associated with different tasks and therefore the symptoms manifested in case of a transient ischemic attack (TIA) will depend on the area of \u200b\u200bthe brain that is affected. Some signs and symptoms of TIA include the sudden onset of: Weakness, numbness or paralysis in the face, arm or leg usually on one side of the body;/ Aphasia, slurred speech or difficulty understanding others;/ Loss of vision in one or both eyes or double vision;/ Dizziness or loss of balance or coordination;/ Severe headache with no apparent cause;/  A TIA usually lasts only a few minutes and most signs and symptoms disappear within an hour, but rarely it can last up to 24 hours. It is possible to have more than one repeat TIA, and recurring signs and symptoms may be similar or different depending on the area of \u200b\u200bthe brain affected.  Attention! When experiencing TIA symptoms, it is important to seek help immediately and contact an emergency medical service. Immediate medical evaluation can help prevent a possible stroke.",
        "Causes": "The causes of a transient ischemic attack (TIA) are the same as those of an ischemic stroke (the most common type of stroke), in which a clot - usually due to atherosclerosis, the buildup of plaque in the arteries - blocks the blood supply to a certain area of \u200b\u200bthe brain. Unlike what happens in an ischemic stroke, in TIA this blockage is shorter and does not cause permanent damage. Anyone can have a TIA, however, there are some factors that can increase this risk. TIA risk factors are divided into those that can be controlled and/or modified and those that cannot.  Modifiable habits and lifestyle: Smoking: Smoking increases the risk of blood clots, increases blood pressure and promotes atherosclerosis.;/ High blood pressure: The risk of stroke is higher when levels are above 140/90 mmHg. However, ideal values \u200b\u200bvary from person to person and should be determined by the attending physician.;/ High cholesterol.;/ Sedentary lifestyle.;/ Poor diet.;/ Excess weight: obesity, especially excess weight in the abdominal region, increases the risk of stroke in both sexes.;/ Excessive intake of alcoholic beverages.;/ Use of illicit drugs, especially cocaine, is associated with an increased risk of stroke and TIA.;/ Cardiovascular disease, such as heart failure, heart defects, heart infection, or arrhythmias.;/ Carotid stenosis.;/ Peripheral arterial disease.;/ Diabetes.;/ High levels of homocysteine: high levels of this amino acid in our blood can harm arteries and increase their susceptibility to clots.;/  Although the following risk factors cannot be modified, knowing them can serve as motivation to act on those that can be controlled: Age: the risk increases with age, especially after age 55.;/ Family history: the risk is higher when someone in the family has had a stroke or TIA.;/ Sex: overall, women have a higher risk of stroke.;/ Previous TIA: having had one or more TIA in the past increases the risk of having a stroke.;/ Sickle cell disease: In this disease, stroke is a common complication.;/",
        "Diagnosis": "If a transient ischemic attack (TIA) occurs, it is important to undergo an immediate assessment in an emergency department in order to determine the best treatment. To determine the cause of the TIA and assess the risk of stroke, in addition to the physical and neurological examination, which may include tests of vision, eye movement, speech, strength, reflexes and the sensory system, blood pressure and cholesterol levels, among others, the doctor may also prescribe an urgent computed tomography (CT) scan of the skull or, alternatively, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in people with suspected TIA or stroke. In people with TIA, stroke or early spontaneous recovery, immediate diagnostic evaluation is recommended, which should include urgent vascular imaging (e.g. ultrasound, CT angiography or MR angiography).",
        "Treatment of transient ischemic attack": "Once the cause of the transient ischemic attack (TIA) has been determined, the goal of treatment includes treating the underlying cause and preventing stroke. The type of treatment adopted depends on the cause of the TIA, and may vary between medication, surgery and angioplasty: Medications: There are several medications that can reduce the likelihood of stroke after a TIA, which are chosen taking into account factors such as location, severity, cause and type, and usually include antiplatelet medications and anticoagulants.;/ Surgery: when the blockage is moderate to severe, surgical procedures may be indicated, such as carotid endarterectomy (surgery that removes fatty deposits present in the carotid arteries of the neck).;/ Angioplasty: in some cases, this procedure can be done on the carotid artery. An instrument similar to a balloon is used to inflate and \"open\" the clogged artery, allowing a stent to be placed (a small hollow tube that keeps the blood vessel open).;/",
        "Prevention": "To prevent transient ischemic attack (TIA), some measures that can be put into practice are: Make regular appointments with your doctor.;/ No smoking.;/ Limit fat consumption (especially saturated and trans).;/ Do not consume excess salt.;/ Include fruits and vegetables in your diet. These foods contain nutrients such as potassium, folic acid and antioxidants, which can protect against both TIA and stroke.;/ Practicing regular physical exercise: this is one of the strategies that allow you to reduce blood pressure values \u200b\u200bwithout resorting to medication. Getting 30 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity most days can help reduce your risk of TIA.;/ Limit alcohol consumption: at most, it should be consumed in moderation - no more than one drink per day for women and two for men - but ideally it should not be part of your habits.;/ Maintain a healthy weight, as being overweight contributes to other risk factors such as high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.;/ Do not take drugs.;/ Keep diseases such as diabetes under control through diet, physical exercise, adequate weight and, when necessary, medication.;/ American Stroke Association, February 2022 Harvard Health Publishing, February 2022 Mayo Clinic, February 2022 Brazilian Society of Neurology, August 2022 Load more;/ Although there are risk factors common to both men and women, women have a higher risk of suffering a stroke than men.

    "Acne": {
        "What is it?": "Acne is probably the most common skin condition, affecting between 85 and 100% of the population at some point in their lives. However, the age groups most affected are between 10 and 24 years old. This is a very common (and almost universal) problem during adolescence. Although it is not serious, it has a significant psychological impact, given the age of the young people affected. This impact is generally short-term, but it must be monitored, as there is a risk of it becoming serious, accompanied by a decrease in self-esteem that can lead to social withdrawal or depression. In a study carried out in Portugal, a prevalence of acne of 82.4% was found in young people aged 10 to 12 years, with a predominance of males. Of these young people, only 44% were undergoing some type of treatment. In another Portuguese study, acne was observed in 42.1% of young people under the age of 15, in 55.8% of those aged 15-29, in 9.2% of those aged 30-40 and in 2.1% of people over 40. It is important, however, not to forget that acne does not only affect teenagers: many women aged 30, 40, 50 or older can suffer from acne and even newborns can suffer from this clinical condition. Acne is a skin condition in which hair follicles have excess oil and dead skin cells. The most affected areas are the face, neck, chest, back and shoulders, as these are the areas where there is a greater concentration of sebaceous follicles. Acne lesions tend to heal slowly and often disappear in other places and appear in other places.",
        "Symptoms": "The most common forms of manifestation are non-inflammatory lesions, the common comedones, white or blackheads, which result from the filling of hair follicles with fat, cells and bacteria. Inflammatory lesions correspond to papules, which are more prominent, red and painful, given the presence of infection in the hair follicle. In more serious cases of acne, larger lesions form, which are uncomfortable and can lead to permanent scars, such as: Pustules;/ Nodules;/ Cysts;/",
        "Causes": "Acne results from an excess production of oil, the accumulation of dead skin cells that irritate the hair follicles, and the accumulation of bacteria in the midst of this oil and dead cells. There are factors that can aggravate acne, such as: Male hormones;/ Hormonal changes during pregnancy or related to the use of oral contraceptives;/ Some medications (corticoids, androgens, lithium);/ Foods rich in carbohydrates, which increase blood sugar levels;/ Hormonal changes are common in adolescence, in girls and women two to seven days before their period and in pregnancy. Contrary to popular belief, fatty foods, chocolate or poorly cleaned skin are not important factors in the development of acne. In fact, excessive cleansing of the skin with irritants can aggravate acne, and gentle cleansing is enough to remove excess oil and dead cells. Skin contact with oily substances or some cosmetics, family history, skin friction from cell phones, helmets, ornaments are also factors to be considered. Stress does not cause acne, but when the condition is present, stress can make it worse.",
        "Diagnosis": "Acne is diagnosed by a dermatologist, as there are other skin conditions that can mimic this condition. Once the diagnosis is made, the doctor will determine the severity of the condition and, based on this, determine the best treatment.",
        "Treatment": "There is a myth that acne is not worth treating and that it should run its course. However, if left untreated, acne can lead to unsightly or even disfiguring scars, which are, in themselves, difficult to treat. This evolution will be rarer the earlier treatment is started. This is often very effective and allows for an improvement in self-esteem. Acne treatment is based on reducing oil production, accelerating skin cell renewal, controlling infection and reducing infection. In general, treatment must be prolonged, with results not being visible before four to eight weeks of treatment. Treatments can be local or oral. Oral medications should not be used during pregnancy, especially in the first trimester. Some examples of therapeutic options include: Lotions that reduce oil production, destroy bacteria and promote the elimination of dead skin cells.;/ Medications, many of which are based on vitamin A-derived formulations, stimulate skin cell renewal. Isotretinoin is a useful medication for more severe forms of acne, but should be used under close medical supervision. Antibiotics are important in eliminating bacteria that accumulate on the skin.;/ Oral contraceptives.;/ Laser or phototherapy treatment.;/ Skin exfoliation or microabrasion.;/ Use of collagen filling in the most affected areas.;/ The treatment for each case of acne should be decided by the dermatologist. Many of the available medications can have side effects and, therefore, it is important to define the most appropriate treatment for each case.",
        "Prevention": "Wash problem areas with a gentle solution that helps control acne.;/ Avoid substances that can irritate the skin, as well as skin contact with hair, objects, sweat and fat.;/ Never squeeze skin lesions to avoid scarring or infection.;/ Sun exposure should be controlled and some of the medications used to treat acne can make the skin more sensitive to the sun.;/ Be moderate in your use of makeup, which can irritate your skin and, if used, should be removed at bedtime.;/ Do not wear clothes that are too tight.;/",
        "The role of diet": "Diet is an important aspect to consider. In general, sugar intake seems to have an impact on the development of acne. The most recent data suggests that specialized nutritional monitoring specific to each case is important.

    "Acromegaly": {
        "What is it?": "Acromegaly has an incidence of three new cases per million inhabitants annually and results from the excessive production of growth hormone in adults. In 90% of cases it is caused by a pituitary adenoma.",
        "Symptoms": "Acromegaly manifests itself through an increase in the soft parts of the hands and feet (which usually leads to the patient having to increase, for example, the size they wear). Other symptoms are: degenerative joint changes (arthrosis);/ carpal tunnel syndrome;/ thick and oily skin;/ voice changes;/ snoring (snoring);/ In addition to changes in muscle strength, bone changes, and common bone deformities, the impact of the disease differs between men and women. In women, changes in the menstrual cycle may also appear and in men, sexual changes such as impotence may appear. About 17% of the population is believed to have small pituitary adenomas that generally do not produce excess growth hormone or cause symptoms.",
        "Causes": "The overproduction of growth hormone associated with acromegaly is usually the result of a tumor. The most common type is a pituitary adenoma, a benign neoplasm that causes the production of too much growth hormone. These tumors are not malignant, but they can cause problems due to their size and location in the surrounding brain tissue, such as headaches and vision problems. Other rare causes of acromegaly: tumors in the lungs, adrenal glands or pancreas, implying overproduction of GH.",
        "Diagnosis": "Signs and symptoms appear slowly and diagnosis may take time. However, an early sign of acromegaly may be excessive growth of the hands and feet, prominence of the chin and eyebrow area. There are tests that can confirm the presence of this pathology, such as the analysis of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), a hormone produced in the liver, usually elevated in people with acromegaly. Other pituitary hormones can also be measured, as well as the oral glucose tolerance test. Brain MRI may be important in determining the location and size of the tumor.",
        "Treatment": "It depends on the location of the adenoma, the person's age and other concomitant diseases. Treatment aims to reduce excess hormone production and improve symptoms. Acromegaly can sometimes be treated with medication alone; the most commonly used drugs include somatostatin analogues, dopamine agonists and growth hormone receptor antagonists (which aim to stop the secretion or action of growth hormone). Surgery may be needed to remove the tumour, which stops the overproduction of growth hormone and relieves pressure on the surrounding tissue. Sometimes surgery may not be indicated because the tumour is difficult to access within the brain. Radiation therapy may be useful, either alone or in combination with surgery, to remove tumor cells; radiation therapy may also be used in conjunction with medications to reduce growth hormone levels. The combination of medical and/or surgical treatments in possible association with radiotherapy may be indicated.",
        "Prevention": "Acromegaly cannot be prevented. Early diagnosis and treatment is the most effective way to treat or manage it.

    "Tinnitus": {
        "What are they?": "Also called tinnitus or tinnitus, tinnitus corresponds to the perception of a sound, in the ear or head, unilaterally or bilaterally, without the existence of an external stimulus. They can originate from any part of the auditory system and are a very common symptom that can affect people of any age or gender. However, they occur more frequently in men. It is important to emphasize that they are a symptom and not a disease. The type and intensity of the sound varies from person to person. It can be constant, intermittent or pulsating. It is estimated that they affect about one in five individuals. Although they are a cause of discomfort, they rarely indicate a serious condition and, although they can worsen with age, in most cases they are treatable.",
        "Symptoms": "They correspond to an unpleasant sensation of sound in the absence of a sound stimulus. They can be bells, horns, clicks, among others. These phantom sounds can vary in intensity and can occur in one or both ears. In some cases, their volume is so loud that it interferes with the ability to concentrate or hear real sounds. They can also be always present or be intermittent. They have the ability to be subjective, when they are heard only by the patient, or objective, when the doctor can also hear them. This type is rarer and can result from vascular anomalies, changes in the ear bones or muscle contractions. It is important to emphasize that these conditions significantly affect patients' quality of life, causing fatigue, stress, changes in sleep and concentration, memory problems, depression, anxiety or irritability. Treating these conditions, even without reducing tinnitus, will help the patient feel better.",
        "Causes": "They can be associated with various conditions, such as hearing loss, dizziness, earwax build-up, certain medications (antibiotics, diuretics, antidepressants, aspirin), infections, ear or head trauma, cardiovascular or ear diseases and exposure to noise. In many cases, the exact origin cannot be identified. One of the most common is damage to the inner ear. Hearing loss associated with age, especially after age 60, is also a common cause. Exposure to noise is important in the professional context and also occurs in association with the use of headphones to listen to music. In these cases, the tinnitus may be short-lived, as happens after a concert, or be more prolonged, indicating a more serious situation. They may also appear associated with M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, temporomaxillary joint or vascular changes, such as atherosclerosis or high blood pressure, and tumor lesions. Tobacco is also a risk factor for its development.",
        "Diagnosis": "The medical examination is very important and should include the ears, head and neck, in order to try to detect its cause. This typically includes an audiogram, movement assessment and imaging studies (CT or MRI). In many cases, its origin is not detected and it is important to define the best strategy to minimize its impact on the patients' lives.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment will vary depending on its cause and therefore different reasons have different approaches. Most of the approaches used use medications or therapy called TRT (Tinnitus Retraining Therapy). In this technique, a portable device is programmed to mask the specific frequencies of each patient's tinnitus. Over time, this method allows the patient to get used to their tinnitus, becoming less focused on them. Removing ear wax can help reduce symptoms. And whenever there are vascular changes, they must be treated. It is also important to review all ongoing medication, because, as mentioned, some therapies may be the cause. Noise suppression using so-called \u201cwhite noise\u201d can be very useful. There are electronic devices that emit it and, at the same time, can produce relaxing sounds (rain, sea), which are quite effective. Using a fan, dehumidifier or air conditioning in the bedroom at night also generates white noise that can help suppress it, allowing for a more restful sleep. Medications do not treat tinnitus but can minimize the severity of symptoms. In this context, antidepressants or some sedatives may be relevant.",
        "Prevention": "Prevention involves avoiding frequent noisy places. If this is not possible, it is essential to use adequate hearing protection. It is also important to avoid drinking coffee, black tea, chocolate or other substances that contain caffeine and reduce the consumption of tobacco and alcoholic beverages. Blood pressure must be controlled. Finally, when using headphones to listen to music, you should keep the volume at a level that is not too high. Portuguese Association of Audiologists, 2014 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, Fev. 2013 American Academy of Otolaryngology, 2014 Listening to music too loudly can damage your ears, but the type of headphones and time spent using them can also affect your hearing. Find out how. The answer is no. Using cotton swabs can push wax into the ear canal, and there is a risk of injury. Know what to do alternatively.

    "Medical acupuncture": {
        "What is it?": "Medical acupuncture is a diagnosis and treatment method used in some clinical situations, which allows the correction of some changes and an improvement in global organic functioning. These corrections are made through the introduction of small needles in certain anatomical locations, promoting the restoration of physiology in the body through local, segmental and supra-segmental effects.  Western medicine, from a scientific point of view, explains the effects of acupuncture through the stimulation and release of endogenous substances, endorphins, neurotransmitters and hormones that will shape the central and autonomic nervous system, promoting balance in the body without the administration of any chemical substance. .  After the anamnesis, which consists of asking different questions related to aspects of the patient's life and clinical observation, a diagnosis is reached and only then treatment is started. This can be multimodal (using one or more synergistic techniques) and will be initiated according to a strategy previously defined, for the correct management of the set of medical and complementary contributions.  The clinical effectiveness of acupuncture, demonstrated in dozens of studies, led the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the US government's medical research center, to recognize acupuncture, which originated in traditional Chinese medicine, as a powerful ally of Western medicine.  In Europe, particularly in Germany, studies involving a large number of patients have confirmed the effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of musculoskeletal pathologies, such as hip and knee osteoarthritis, low back pain, chronic shoulder pain and in other situations such as tension headaches and dysmenorrhoea (menstrual pain).  Acupuncture is also recommended for the treatment or relief of organic functional symptoms such as intractable hiccups, nausea and vomiting of various types, including pregnancy and chemotherapy.  The World Health Organization presents a list of various indications.",
        "Added value": "What is the advantage of seeking a doctor with expertise in Medical Acupuncture? The doctor is the only professional who has the scientific knowledge, such as anatomy, physiology, biochemistry and pathology, to make the correct diagnosis, and can request and interpret additional tests. He or she has the ability to advise on the most appropriate therapy for each clinical situation, which may or may not be acupuncture, and to treat any complications that may arise. One of the serious problems that can occur when acupuncture is not practiced by doctors is the delay in the diagnosis and treatment of various pathologies, which require other types of treatments, and for which acupuncture is not indicated, which can create increased risks. It is up to the doctor to decide which situations are likely to be treated with acupuncture. This is a therapeutic technique that should be integrated and combined with conventional therapies, such as medication, surgery or other types of treatments and should not be seen as alternative medicine, but rather as complementary. In Portugal, medical acupuncture is practiced by specialists certified (competence) by the Medical Association.",
        "Who is it for?": "Acupuncture can be used as an alternative to some treatments or when drugs are contraindicated, such as during pregnancy (use of only some points), allergies, kidney and heart failure. Acupuncture and acupressure can be used at any age, particularly in Pediatrics. Acupuncture is less effective in patients taking certain medications, so it is necessary to de-medicate at an early stage before starting treatment.",
        "Facts and Curiosities": "Acupuncture aims to restore the body as a whole, by inducing regenerative processes, normalizing altered functions, strengthening the immune system and controlling pain. It is an ancient technique, showing benefits in individuals with gastrointestinal, respiratory, muscular, urological, endocrinological, psychological, neurological, gynecological, dermatological problems, in reducing emotional tension, weaning from smoking and drugs with psychoactive action.  Anti-inflammatory and analgesic function of acupuncture;/ Experiments on rats have shown that acupuncture can even triple the effects of a natural compound known for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic functions. Researchers at the University of Rochester in the USA observed that tissues close to the needles had up to 24 times more adenosine, suggesting that the imperceptible piercing of the skin may trigger both the accumulation of the substance in more external tissues of the skin, as well as signaling to the brain to create endorphins against pain and neurotransmitters and natural hormones, both with regulatory action.  Stimulation techniques in acupuncture;/ According to Easterners, the energy meridians that run through the body are affected by \"perverse\" energies, which affect the organism in general. Although it may seem like mysticism, Western tradition itself considers that winds, bacteria, viruses, injuries, traumas, anxieties, cold or heat constitute a large part of the \"perverse\" energies. Acupuncture points can be stimulated using fingers (acupressure), lasers and other techniques. The important thing is that energy flows are restored and the body's energy is balanced. Other techniques are also used, the best known being moxibustion (application of heat to certain points or meridians), auriculotherapy and electroacupuncture. The direction of the needles, the time and the form of stimulation may vary depending on the treatment. It is common to use a \"guide\" to insert the needles. This is a small disposable plastic tube inside which the needle is located. Light pressure of the tip of the \"guide\" on the skin helps to reduce the sensation of the needle entering, but experienced acupuncturists often choose to insert the needle in a quick movement without the guide to the indicated depth.

    "Aphasia": {
        "What is it?": "Aphasia is an acquired communication disorder that interferes with the ability to process language, without affecting intelligence. It impairs speech and understanding of other people and, in many cases, also compromises reading and writing. The most common cause is a stroke (about 25% to 40% of people with a stroke have this disorder). Other common causes include head injuries, brain tumors, or neurological problems. Therefore, in aphasia, as a result of a brain injury, one or more parts of language use stop working properly. It is one of the most disabling consequences of a stroke, making it difficult for the patient and their family to adapt to this situation. It requires dramatic changes at a professional, social and economic level, and generates communication difficulties and sometimes serious emotional disturbances. On the other hand, it has a strong impact on the notion of identity, self-esteem and interpersonal and social relationships, generating depression, physical limitations and isolation. It can also be associated with difficulties in daily actions, in observing the surroundings, in concentration, in taking the initiative to speak, in memory and can cause an inability to do two things simultaneously. No two people suffer from aphasia in the same way. Its severity and extent depend, among other things, on the location and magnitude of the brain injury, previous language skills and the individual's personality. Some people can understand language but have trouble finding the right words or constructing sentences. Others tend to talk a lot, but what they say is difficult to understand. This condition affects around one million Americans and is more common than Parkinson's disease, cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy. More than 100,000 Americans acquire this disorder each year. It is a very common disorder in elderly people but can occur at any age, regardless of gender or race. Its identification is very important because it tends to be a factor of social and family isolation, given the communication difficulties it causes. As many professions require language and speech skills, aphasia can hinder the full performance of work. People with mild and moderate pathology are able to return to work, but their functions or occupations may be adapted. In Portugal there is no data on its incidence but it is estimated that around 50% of survivors of a stroke have communication difficulties.",
        "Symptoms": "Some people have difficulty speaking, while others have difficulty following a conversation. In some cases, it is very light and is not noticeable on first contact. In others, it can be very severe, affecting speaking, writing, reading and understanding. The specific symptoms are very varied, but what all individuals with aphasia have in common are communication difficulties. People with this disorder may have difficulty remembering words and names, but their intelligence is basically intact. Aphasia is not like Alzheimer's disease because, in this case, the difficulty lies in the ability to access ideas and thoughts and not in the elaboration of the idea or thought itself. However, because many people with aphasia have difficulty communicating, they are often mistaken for being mentally ill. Many individuals with this disorder also have paralysis or weakness of the right upper and lower limbs because aphasia results from damage to the left side of the brain, which controls movement on the right side of the body. Loss of visual field, lack of knowledge of how to perform simple sequences of actions (such as getting dressed, eating, drinking or swallowing), memory problems, difficulty controlling emotions and epilepsy may also occur.",
        "Causes": "It develops as a result of brain injury, such as a stroke, trauma, or brain tumor. In the brain there are several areas with different functions. For most people, the areas responsible for language are located on the left side of the brain. When this part is\u00a0 affected, aphasia appears.",
        "Diagnosis": "It is essentially done through four tests: speech analysis, naming objects by visual confrontation, repetition of words and understanding of simple commands. In addition to diagnosis, it is essential to identify the brain injury, which can be achieved by magnetic resonance imaging.",
        "Treatment": "The goal of treatment is to make communication functional. Many people with aphasia have been hospitalized for some time. This happens after the brain injury has occurred. After being discharged from the hospital, many individuals still need access to therapeutic resources. It's not always clear who to turn to. Treatment is almost always carried out by speech therapists (speech therapists). In principle, anyone suffering from this disorder is eligible for speech therapy. Its duration depends, among other things, on the recovery time from aphasia. Due to this condition, the way in which the aphasic person understands the world or the way in which he or she expresses himself or herself undergoes a change. By making the best possible use of the patient's remaining communication skills, it is still possible to communicate with him or her. A person with severe aphasia often understands only the most important words of a sentence. Often those around him or her think that both have understood each other, but a negative reaction from the patient shows that this is not the case. For communication to be effective, it is important to allow time. Sitting comfortably and maintaining eye contact is very helpful. Speak slowly and in short sentences, emphasizing the most important words in each sentence. Help the person with aphasia to express themselves when they have difficulty. This can be done by pointing to an object, making gestures, drawing pictures or writing something about what is being said. If symptoms last more than two to three months after the brain injury, a full recovery may be less likely. However, it is important to know that many individuals continue to improve even after years or decades. This evolution is part of a slow process that involves both the individual and the family, and it is important to develop compensatory communication strategies.",
        "Prevention": "Since the most common cause of aphasia is a stroke, prevention involves measures that minimize the risk of its occurrence: regular physical exercise; a balanced diet, low in salt and fat, and rich in fruit and vegetables; avoiding tobacco; moderate alcohol intake; controlling weight and blood pressure; and treating associated diseases such as diabetes and excess cholesterol. International Aphasia Association, 2013 National Aphasia Association, 2012 Gabriela Leal et al., Assessment of aphasia by the Family Physician, Rev Port Clin Geral 2005;21:359-64 American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2013 Prosopagnosia consists of the inability to recognize other people's faces, including friends. Find out more about this neurological change. Although there are risk factors common to both men and women, women have a higher risk of suffering a stroke than men. Find out why. Stroke can be a serious condition with a high risk of causing disability or being fatal. Fortunately, some of the risk factors can be controlled and treated.

    "Alcoholism": {
        "What is it?": "The concept of alcoholism encompasses the entirety of problems caused by alcohol, in the individual, on the physical and psychological planes, in disturbances in family, professional and social life, and also in their economic, legal and moral implications. In Portugal, despite the latest available data indicating a slight decrease at a national level, its per capita intake remains quite high. On the other hand, there has been growing consumption among young people and women and significant changes that worsen risk situations. This topic has been a recurring theme in the media and has led to changes in legislation in order to try to control this problem. Portugal systematically appears among the largest consumers of alcoholic beverages at European and global level. In a recent study, estimates were found in the country over 15 years of age, of 58 thousand alcoholic patients (alcohol dependence syndrome), that is, around 7% of the population, and 750 thousand excessive drinkers (alcohol abuse syndrome). alcohol), which is equivalent to 9.4% of the national population. In the Portuguese school population, it is estimated that the prevalence of alcohol-related problems is between 10% and 20% in university students. Regarding high school, with an average age of 16, between 18% and 20% would have gotten drunk at least once. It is also estimated that excessive consumption occurs in around 10% of women and 20% of men. It is also known to be related to 50% of deaths in car accidents, 50% of homicides and 25% of suicides. Alcohol is currently a legal and commercialized drug in Portugal, and is part of the eating habits of a large majority of the population. In addition, it is often associated with numerous forms of relationships, both private and public, of a ritual, celebratory, recreational nature, and is part of the lifestyle or even the identity of many social groups.",
        "Symptoms": "The symptoms of alcoholism are very diverse and include the inability to reduce alcohol consumption, the feeling of an enormous need to consume it, the development of tolerance, which requires greater consumption to obtain the same effect, drinking in isolation or in secret, a physical sensation of withdrawal (nausea, sweating, tremors), memory lapses, creation of rituals, consuming alcohol at set times with a feeling of frustration if this is not possible, irritability, to feel good or to feel \u201cnormal\u201d, to deal with legal, financial, personal and professional problems, accompanied by a loss of interest in other activities that are usually enjoyable. Alcohol causes nervous system depression, although in some people the initial reaction is stimulation. Reduces inhibitions, affects thoughts, emotions and the ability to judge and decide. It also interferes with speech and muscle coordination and, in excessive doses, can induce a coma or cause death. On the other hand, alcohol dependence is often associated with dependence on other substances. As a consequence of the loss of all the aforementioned capabilities, the risk of car and domestic accidents increases, performance at work and school is reduced, and the likelihood of committing violent crimes increases. It also worsens the possibility of medical complications such as liver disease (hepatitis, cirrhosis, cancer), digestive problems (gastritis, ulcers); malabsorption, pancreatitis; heart problems (high blood pressure, myocardial infarction, stroke); complications in diabetic patients; changes in sexual function; vision difficulties; osteoporosis; neurological implications; decrease in defenses; congenital anomalies in case of consumption during pregnancy; and increased risk for several forms of cancer.",
        "Causes": "Alcoholism is influenced by genetic, psychological, social and environmental factors that affect the body's response and behavior to this type of drink. The addiction process occurs gradually. Alcohol, over time, alters the normal balance between the chemical substances that exist in the brain associated with the sensation of pleasure, ability to evaluate and control the body. This fact causes it to consume itself to recover the good sensations or to ward off the negative ones. Some risk factors for the development of alcoholism: Regular consumption over time, which generates physical dependence.;/ Age: the earlier you start, the greater the risk of developing dependence.;/ Family history: the risk is higher when there are close family members who are alcoholics.;/ Depression and other mental health problems, such as anxiety or bipolar disorder.;/ Social and cultural factors: having friends or close people who drink regularly increases the risk of drinking and becoming dependent. Media messages about the association between drinking and social status may be an important factor in some cases.;/ Mixing medications and alcohol: Some drugs interact with alcohol, which can increase or decrease therapeutic effects.;/",
        "Diagnosis": "It is important for the person to become aware that they are consuming more alcohol than normal and that they should seek help. Diagnosis therefore involves a thorough interview with the attending physician, an assessment of daily consumption and a series of tests to assess the extent of the disease. There are several resources that are important in identifying problems associated with alcohol, such as clinical tests, abdominal ultrasound, liver biopsy and others, and it is up to the physician to select the most appropriate ones in each case.",
        "Treatment": "The treatment of alcoholism is complex and must encompass biological and psychosocial aspects, as well as the family, professional and social environment in which the patient lives. As for organic problems, in the initial phase the damage caused may be reversible. This period can take some time and basically involves complete abstinence from consuming alcoholic beverages. Medication may also be prescribed to help combat the symptoms caused by dependence or withdrawal. In the more advanced stages, the damage may be irreversible (liver cirrhosis). Despite this, treating the complications may contribute to a significant improvement in quality of life.",
        "Prevention": "The only truly foolproof way to prevent this would be to simply not drink alcohol. But what really matters is moderation. During social events you should drink less than is considered reasonable, and it is also important not to mix different drinks. It is important to evaluate the group of friends and people close to you because excessive alcohol consumption is often encouraged by third parties. Playing sports, reading, meditating, going to the theater and cinema can be good alternatives to help release stress and prevent the need to escape to alcoholic beverages. It is also worth noting that \u201canti-hangover\u201d medications do not protect against the harmful effects of alcohol.

    "Food allergy": {
        "What is it?": "Food allergy is a pathology whose prevalence and severity have increased in recent years. Milk, eggs and fish are the foods most frequently involved; less frequently, wheat, peanuts, nuts, shellfish and fresh fruits appear. An allergy to a certain food can lead to the appearance of symptoms within minutes of ingesting it. These reactions can affect the skin and mucous membranes (hives and angioedema are the most common), the respiratory tract (rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma), the intestine (vomiting, diarrhoea) and the cardiovascular system (anaphylactic shock, which is less common but more serious).",
        "Symptoms": "Accidental ingestion may occur despite all precautions taken to avoid the drug. Treatment for these reactions depends on the symptoms that arise. Antihistamines are used when mild symptoms such as itchy nose or eyes, sneezing or hives appear. Corticosteroids are used when more generalized skin symptoms or respiratory difficulties occur. In selected cases, the prescription of adrenaline may be indicated.",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of food allergy is based on the clinical history and complementary diagnostic tests, including skin prick tests and specific IGE measurement, and is confirmed by the oral provocation test with the suspected food. Skin prick tests are a quick, safe and effective diagnostic tool that has virtually no adverse effects when performed by specialists. However, when there is a history of severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), it is recommended that skin tests be performed in a day hospital, which is done regularly at our Allergy Center. The oral food challenge test (OPT) is the reference method for diagnosing food allergy. These tests are also indicated for the periodic assessment of the acquisition of tolerance to food or for determining the patient's tolerance threshold. It should always be performed in a hospital setting and by specialized teams experienced in these procedures. The patient must be previously informed about the reason, method and risks of the OPT and must sign their informed consent. The protocol used depends on the clinical history, but increasing doses of the suspected food are usually administered orally at regular intervals (usually 15 to 30 minutes), until a total dose corresponding to the amount ingested in a meal is reached. The test is suspended if a reaction occurs.",
        "Treatment": "Once the diagnosis of food allergy has been confirmed, traditional treatment consists of total avoidance of the food(s) and treatment of allergic reactions that may result from accidental or inadvertent ingestion of the food involved. Food allergy in childhood is often temporary, so it is important to regularly schedule PPOs to assess tolerance. However, severe and long-lasting forms of food allergy are increasingly common, when the likelihood of the disease resolving naturally is lower. In severe forms, the risk of a potentially fatal allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) is a reality, there is a risk of hidden food allergens being present, the recommended avoidance diet is difficult to follow and may become incompatible with an adequate quality of life. In these cases, tolerance induction emerges as an innovative form of food allergy treatment. This is a therapeutic strategy that must be used judiciously, always under the supervision of experienced immunoallergists, in different centers, in order to guarantee the safety of the procedure. This treatment should only be considered when there is availability and understanding of the objectives of the procedure, whether by the patient or their family members. Tolerance induction is achieved by ingesting increasing doses of food until a target dose or maximum tolerated dose is reached. All dose increases take place in a day hospital, in sessions lasting up to 8 hours, under permanent medical supervision. The schedule of hospital visits will be scheduled according to the clinical evolution and availability of the patient/family. This treatment must always be carried out in accordance with the instructions of the medical team. The aim is to allow the allergy sufferer to reach tolerance to the food in question, maintaining its effect over time, which is subject to regular intake in accordance with medical advice. The patient and their family members/caregivers, in the case of the child, will be able to count on the availability of the medical team to clarify any doubts that may arise during the treatment.

    "Allergies": {
        "What is it?": "Allergies are exaggerated responses of the body after contact with the environment around it, and are more frequent when there is a family tendency, that is, a genetic risk for their occurrence. In other words, \u201callergies are an excess of defenses\u201d, as opposed to other clinical situations in which there is a lack of defenses. In addition to genetics, many risk factors related to the lifestyle of Western societies \u2013 sedentary lifestyle, change in diet, obesity, pollution inside and outside buildings, exposure to allergens, excessive consumption of medications, particularly antibiotics \u2013 are some of the important attributes significant increase in the almost explosive expression that has occurred in allergic diseases in recent decades. In Europe, these illnesses chronically affect more than a third of the population and Portugal is no exception. Immunoallergology or Allergology bases its activity on health promotion, preventing, at various levels, situations that affect the quality of life of populations, from asthma to rhinitis, from urticaria to eczema, from food allergies to medication.",
        "Symptoms": "Allergic diseases are very common but their severity varies. While it is well known that asthma can have a fatal outcome, insect bites, taking medication or eating food are not usually recognized or valued as being responsible for very serious conditions. In some allergic patients, contact with allergens, even in minimal quantities, can be very disturbing: Unrecognized ingestion of food allergens, hidden in other foods (for example, milk mixed with fruit juices or even alcoholic beverages \u2013 \u201cmilk liqueur\u201d), can put your life at risk.;/ Accidents related to taking medication should be reported to the healthcare team and well known to you and your family and friends.;/ Reactions related to insect bites, especially if very serious, should be reported quickly to the attending physician, which is often not done. And the situation can represent a permanent risk to life.;/",
        "Insect allergy": "When to suspect an insect allergy? Many species of insects can cause allergic reactions, most often local, such as mosquitoes, midges, flies, fleas and bedbugs. However, in some patients allergic to the venom of Hymenoptera \u2013 bees and wasps \u2013 their stings can trigger very serious systemic reactions. Insect stings usually only cause a local reaction, with pain, itching, redness and swelling, resulting from the injection of the toxic components of the venom. In cases of severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), symptoms usually appear a few minutes after the sting and have varying degrees of severity, from skin reactions (hives, angioedema), digestive symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain), respiratory symptoms (wheezing, stridor, shortness of breath), cardiovascular symptoms (tachycardia, dizziness, confusion, feeling faint), to anaphylactic shock (cardiopulmonary comparison). The risk is usually greater in bee stings than in wasp stings. Patients with a history of systemic reactions should carry an emergency kit with adrenaline for self-administration. They should also be referred to an Immunoallergology Centre for assessment and possible indication for an anti-allergy vaccine with venom extract in a hospital environment.",
        "Food Allergy": "When to suspect a food allergy? When symptoms appear, immediately or close to ingestion of a food, and less frequently after contact or inhalation of cooking vapors.;/ When identical symptoms recur after eating the same food, or related foods.;/ When the following signs appear, either alone or in combination, close to eating a food:;/ Skin and mucous membranes - itchy red spots or bumps on the skin (hives), swelling; itchy mouth; Digestive: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps; Respiratory: sneezing, itchy or watery eyes, coughing, wheezing, difficulty breathing.;/ Severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), which may involve several organs such as the skin, respiratory and digestive systems and/or cardiovascular symptoms, resulting in a sudden drop in blood pressure, sweating, paleness, palpitations and loss of consciousness.;/ After intense physical exercise, an allergic reaction that can range from hives to a severe allergic reaction.;/ Itching in the mouth, with or without swelling of the lips and/or tongue, immediately after eating plant foods, such as fresh fruits \u2013 oral allergy syndrome.;/ Redness and itching of the skin \u2013 contact urticaria.;/ In children, presence of moderate to severe eczema, particularly in the first years of life.;/ When they occur, particularly in children, frequent digestive symptoms such as refusal to eat, vomiting, diarrhea, poor weight gain or blood in the stool.;/ If you have been diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis.;/ Patients with a history of severe allergic reactions should carry an emergency kit with adrenaline for self-administration in cases of accidental ingestion of the food(s) to which they are allergic. It is recommended that patients with food allergies be evaluated at Immunoallergology Centers with experience in this area, mainly due to the particularities inherent in the diagnosis of food allergies according to the age of the patient \u2013 \u200b\u200bparticularly in children \u2013 due to the complexity of some situations involving cross-reactivity reactions between food groups, and due to the possibility that in more serious situations specific oral tolerance induction procedures may have to be carried out (cow's milk or eggs, for example).",
        "Latex allergy": "When to suspect a latex allergy? Latex (rubber) is used in many products, including medical equipment (gloves, catheters, catheters, masks, drains, probes, tourniquets, among others) and everyday equipment (condoms, balls, balloons, caps, toys, pacifiers, teats, etc.). Symptoms of latex allergy can range from a local allergic reaction (contact urticaria), rhinitis (sneezing, itchy nose, runny nose), conjunctivitis (itching, redness, watery eyes), asthma (dyspnea, wheezing and coughing), to episodes of severe allergic reaction or anaphylactic shock. You should suspect a latex allergy when: An allergic reaction occurs in a child or adult who has undergone multiple surgeries (e.g. spina bifida and other congenital malformations) or has had professional exposure to latex (e.g. healthcare professionals, veterinarians, hairdressers, etc.);;/ Immediate symptoms after contact with latex gloves, condoms or other products containing latex (direct contact and/or inhalation of latex allergen particles);;/ Reactions during medical or surgical procedures, such as dental treatments, gynecological examinations, or intraoperative interventions;;/ Reactions with foods with cross-reactivity described with latex (latex-fruit syndrome).;/ Patients with a history of severe allergic reactions should carry an emergency kit with adrenaline for self-administration in situations of accidental exposure to latex and/or foods with cross-reactivity with latex to which they are allergic. These patients should be referred to an Immunoallergology Center for evaluation and possible indication for immunotherapy (anti-allergy vaccine) with latex extract in a hospital environment.",
        "Drug allergy": "When to suspect a drug allergy? When the following symptoms (alone or in combination) occur close to the administration of a certain medication: most frequently, involvement of the skin and mucous membranes, with itchy red spots or papules (urticaria, rash), swelling (angioedema) or itchy skin; less frequently, digestive complaints, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea or abdominal cramps; eye and/or respiratory complaints, itchy or watery eyes, sneezing, coughing, wheezing or difficulty breathing; or even cardiovascular symptoms, resulting in a sudden drop in blood pressure (hypotension), with dizziness, palpitations, feeling faint or even shock and loss of consciousness.;/ When a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) occurs immediately or shortly after the administration of a certain drug. The most relevant reactions occur, in most cases, within the first 30 minutes to one hour after administration.;/ In the case of proven drug allergy, patients must carry information about the substances involved, the type of reaction and therapeutic alternatives. Do not forget that the drug in question can exist in many different forms. Due to the complexity of the diagnosis, it is recommended that these individuals be evaluated at Immunoallergology Centers, with experience in the area.",
        "Diagnosis": "Correct and timely recognition of these mild to very serious clinical conditions allows for the design of measures for diagnosis and treatment, offering dietary and medicinal alternatives and structuring emergency action if very serious symptoms occur. However, for diagnosis to be possible, it is important that the attending physicians and affected citizens, adults or children, pregnant women or the elderly, are referred to an Immunoallergology specialist.",
        "Treatment": "There are several medications that can be divided into three groups: Symptomatic medications to relieve complaints, including antihistamines to control allergy symptoms in the nose, eyes or skin, and bronchodilators to treat asthma complaints.;/ Preventative, anti-inflammatory medications that help combat allergies and prevent the appearance of symptoms.;/ Anti-allergy vaccines. They are a specific treatment, targeted at the allergen involved, which are highly effective as long as they are administered correctly and under strict supervision by a doctor specializing in Immunoallergology.\u00a0It is a method that aims to modify the evolution of allergic disease. For example, in patients with pollen rhinitis who are at increased risk of developing asthma, vaccines may prevent this progression.;/ Allergic diseases, when they are chronic, formally have no cure. Therefore, the main objective is to obtain control and thus allow an adequate quality of life. We are talking about anti-allergy vaccines or tolerance induction protocols for medicines or foods, which experts have the capacity to apply according to strict indications. In any case, an allergic patient can go decades without feeling any allergy symptoms, and this is less likely to happen the more controlled the allergy is.",
        "Prevention": "The treatment that allows control is divided into several approaches, but is based, first, on a correct diagnosis. The fundamental pillars in controlling the disease are: Educate the patient and his/her family;;/ Avoid aggravating factors;;/ Treat acute episodes or crises, using drugs that relieve bronchial obstruction;;/ Plan preventive or control treatment through allergy vaccines.;/",
        "Avoid indoor allergens": "House dust mites represent the main cause of allergies in the Brazilian population. The recommended measures to avoid exposure to yourself and other contaminants are: Maintain adequate ventilation and aeration;;/ Avoid carpets and rugs, replacing them with linoleum, mosaic or varnished wood floors;;/ Use new mattresses, less than a year old;;/ Place anti-mite covers on mattresses and pillows;;/ Use cotton sheets and synthetic duvets;;/ Wash bedding and plastic covers with water at temperatures above 50\u00baC;;/ Remove stuffed animals or objects that accumulate dust (e.g. books) from the room;;/ Use a vacuum cleaner with a high-efficiency filter (HEPA);;/ Control relative humidity below 50%;;/ In patients allergic to fungi, environmental control measures are similar. For those allergic to domestic animals - cats, dogs, rabbits, hamsters, among others - it will be necessary to remove them from the house.",
        "Avoid allergens from the external environment": "Pollens are the most important allergens in the external environment. For patients allergic to this element, whose usual season is spring, some measures may be useful: Know the region's pollen bulletin (available on the website of the Portuguese Society of Allergology and Clinical Immunology - www.spaic.pt);;/ Plan work trips or vacations choosing times of year and places free from the pollens to which you are allergic;;/ Avoid going to the countryside during periods of high pollen concentration, especially in the morning;;/ Keep the windows closed during the day at home, opting to ventilate at dusk;;/ Wear sunglasses;;/ Traveling by car with the windows closed, and motorcyclists must wear a full-face helmet.;/",
        "Avoid tobacco smoke, both active and passive": "Tobacco smoke increases the risk of developing asthma and other allergic diseases, and in children with this condition, the risk of serious attacks increases, which can lead to hospitalization. Parents of minors with asthma should be aware that if they smoke or allow others to smoke around their children (at home, in the car...) they are seriously harming their children's health, significantly increasing the severity of the disease. It is important to remember that children cannot express their discomfort verbally, and that coughing is usually their only form of expression.

    "Alopecia": {
        "What is it?": "Alopecia is a natural condition in which hair gradually becomes thinner with age. More hair follicles enter the resting phase, and the remaining hairs become shorter and fewer in number. Alopecia means less hair on the head, while defluvius means more hair loss. One can exist without the other and vice versa. Hair loss can have a variety of causes, with androgenetic alopecia being the most common. It focuses mainly on the upper part of the scalp, sparing the back and side areas (which is due to different hormonal receptors in these areas).",
        "Symptoms": "Signs of hair loss and thinning vary between men, women and children. However, at any age, signs appear when you start to notice more hair on your brush when combing or more hair falling out when washing your hair.",
        "Causes": "There are two types: androgenetic alopecia (common baldness) and telogen defluvium. In androgenetic alopecia, men typically lose their hair when three factors interact: genetics, age, and hormones. While hormone levels change with aging, genetic factors also play a role in this process, which contributes to the gradual shrinkage of hair follicles. Hair grows progressively shorter and thinner until it stops growing. In women, genetics appears to be a significant factor, with women inheriting the gene from either parent. It tends to be more common as women get older and reach middle age, although it can start earlier. It often develops after menopause, when hormonal changes can also be a contributing factor, and is manifested by a generalized decrease in follicles across the scalp, but especially at the crown. Telogen defluvium is related to the hair cycle (more or less three years) after which it falls out and is replaced by another. In this context, there is a change in this cycle. Seasonality (autumn), childbirth, stress, tiredness, surgery or an illness may contribute to this. The triggering phenomenon precedes hair loss by three or four months. As for seasonality, it appears to be mediated by variation in sunlight. The pituitary gland detects this change and varies the levels of prolactin, melatonin and other hormones that act on receptors that condition the cycle of each follicle. Hair that falls out due to telogen defluvius can be completely recovered as what happens is just a hair cycle disorder: many hairs fall out, but others are born. Recovery of full volume may take up to a year.",
        "Diagnosis": "If hair loss persists at a level higher than usual, you should consult a dermatologist to rule out the presence of a disease. Most pathologies that affect hair do so in two main ways: Due to interference in the hair cycle. If an external factor (stress, childbirth, unbalanced diet, medications or surgeries) causes a large number of hairs to simultaneously enter the phase of the cycle in which they come loose, this will result in greater hair loss when combing and washing and, depending on Due to the intensity and duration of the phenomenon, there may be less hair on the scalp.;/ Injury to the part of the follicle where the pluripotent cells capable of regenerating it exist, which occurs in the presence of a series of inflammatory diseases that affect the scalp but also in common baldness. In this case, the inflammation, associated with genetic factors, leads to the death of hair cells, making them increasingly thinner until they disappear.;/",
        "Treatment": "Alopecia is a concern for most people and can negatively affect self-image. There are three levels of intervention: Medical/Topical:There is currently no doubt that the most effective topical product is minoxidil. Doctors also prescribe appropriate shampoo.;/ Medical/Systemic: The administration of Finasteride (tablets) orally, in order to block the action of the male hormone on the hair follicle, constitutes, in many cases, a good adjuvant. The combination of multivitamins/trace elements (orally) is common in the treatment of alopecia, although its usefulness is not obvious, except in cases where there is a lack of a nutrient.;/ Surgical: This involves hair transplants. The first ones were performed half a century ago. The technique has evolved a lot and for the past ten years, Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT) has been performed. In this procedure, hair is removed from donor areas, usually in the form of a thin strip of skin or follicle by follicle. The hair is then cut in a microscopically controlled manner and micro holes are made in the area where the aim is to improve hair density. Finally, the follicles are inserted into each hole. The transplanted hair falls out between the first and second month. It grows back between the third and fourth month, with a natural appearance. A careful clinical history is essential before proceeding with this procedure. Diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and bleeding dyscrasias must be under control. The procedure lasts on average four to five hours, after which the patient goes home. Common adverse effects include swelling of the eyelids that occurs between the second and fourth day after the transplant and micro-crusts that are visible at the site of each implanted follicle (for 15 days). With the current technique, it is possible to perform sessions of more than 1,500 implanted hairs. It is important to adapt expectations to reality. One session greatly improves the appearance but does not provide the volume of a normal head of hair. The result is better the thicker the hair and the denser the donor area. In women, the technique is slightly different, as there are usually no completely depopulated areas, so reinforcing two or three centimeters anteriorly can have a great effect. In men with androgenetic alopecia, three sessions are expected during their lifetime: one for anterior reinforcement, another for posterior reinforcement, and one that joins both areas. There is an average of four years between sessions. On the other hand, this technique also allows the correction of scars caused by hair diseases, trauma, tumors or radiotherapy.;/",
        "Prevention": "You must maintain a healthy lifestyle and, above all, have a balanced diet. You can also resort to taking some nutritional supplements, which help control hair loss.

    "Alopecia cicatricial": {
        "What is it?": "Cicatricial alopecia is nothing more than the final stage of aggression or disease in which normal skin is replaced by areas of scarring, making it impossible to regenerate the follicle, and permanently losing hair. We classify it as Primary or Secondary. Primary, when a skin disease directly affects the hair follicle. These are usually inflammatory diseases that destroy the reservoir of pluripotent cells existing in the superficial part of the follicle. Secondary, when an aggression \u2013 trauma, surgery, radiotherapy, infection, acne \u2013 causes an area of \u200b\u200bscarring that leads to irreversible alopecia.",
        "Symptoms": "Diseases that cause primary cicatricial alopecia are not very common. Among Caucasians, the most common is lichen planopilaris (LPP). In the most common form, it causes small patches of hair or a retreat from the previous hairline, increasing the length of the forehead.\u00a0 This last form is called frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA) and is more common in postmenopausal women. It is treated with corticosteroids and, sometimes, finasteride. Much rarer and exclusive to Caucasians, erosive pustulosis of the scalp, which causes erosions, scales and crusts and responds to cream corticosteroids. In black people, the most common type is traction alopecia. It is caused by the physical aggression caused by the tension caused by braiding hair and mainly affects the frontotemporal area. The key is to stop the aggression and in the very early stages minoxidil can help. Exclusive to black people is central centrifugal alopecia, in which the area of \u200b\u200balopecia spreads from the inside out (it responds poorly to any treatment). Also almost exclusive to black people is acne keloidalis nucae, characterized by inflammation of follicles and scars in the nape area. Folliculitis decalvans (FD) can appear in both white and black people and is characterized by groups of hair in tufts, crusts, pus spots and an area of \u200b\u200balopecia (usually a single area that spreads). It is treated with topical antibiotics \u2013 clindamycin, erythromycin \u2013 and systemic antibiotics \u2013 minocycline, rifampicin, clindamycin, etc. Less common, and occurring in both races, benign cutaneous lupus erythematosus (called discoid) also causes scarring alopecia. The best medication to control it is hydroxychloroquine.",
        "Diagnosis": "As each disease is treated differently, it is important to know exactly what it is. The diagnosis can be aided by dermoscopy (viewing the skin in magnification) and confirmed by histological examination of the biopsy specimen. The inflammatory cells are lymphocytes in the case of LPP or Lupus and neutrophils in the case of FD. In the final stage, histology cannot determine the disease, only that it is cicatricial alopecia.",
        "Treatment": "These diseases present a challenge in both diagnosis and treatment and should be referred to dermatologists with experience in treating them. The first objective is to\u00a0stop the disease. In a second phase, and with the disease clinically non-evolving, transplantation trials can be performed (10 or 20 implants). If they survive after a year, it is permissible to try to repopulate the area of \u200b\u200bcicatricial alopecia through hair transplantation (see hair transplantation). The same can be done for scars from trauma, surgery, radiotherapy, infection or acne (in this case for scars in the beard area).  Why it happens, to what extent it is normal and how to prevent it.

    "High myopia": {
        "What is it?": "Myopia is a refractive error frequently found in the population, in which the image is blurred into the distance. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), high myopia is considered to be present when the refractive error exceeds 5 (five) diopters. It is estimated that myopia and high myopia affect 27% and 2.8% of the world's population, with a tendency to increase. The WHO estimates that, by 2050, myopia and high myopia will affect, respectively, 52% and 10% of the world's population.  High myopia is associated with complications, which include, among others: Myopic macular degeneration;/ Retinal detachment;/ Macular hole;/ Myopic schisis (separation of the macular retinal layers);/ Glaucoma;/ Cataract;/ Strabismus;/  High myopia, alone or associated with one of these pathologies, can lead to serious and irreversible visual loss.",
        "Symptoms": "A myopic individual can see clearly up close, but has difficulty seeing far away. High myopia is often diagnosed during adolescence; it can lead to poor vision that is not corrected by glasses, due to atrophy of the layer of the eye responsible for receiving light stimuli, which translates into areas of lower definition in the visual field.\u00a0 Patients with high myopia should undergo regular eye exams to check for eye damage as, in many cases, symptoms are not evident. It is, however, advisable to carry out frequent self-monitoring in order to identify some of the complications early.  Symptoms that should lead a highly myopic person to seek ophthalmological examination are: Visualization of flashes of light (photopsias);/ Visualization of floaters (myodesopsias);/ Sudden loss of visual acuity;/ Sudden image distortion;/  These symptoms may be associated with a retinal detachment or choroidal neovascularization and require targeted therapy.",
        "Causes": "The origin of high myopia is still not fully understood. A genetic predisposition is recognized and it is more common in individuals of Asian descent. It can be part of other diseases, such as congenital glaucoma, premature retinopathy, Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, among others. The importance of the environment in which the individual lives has become increasingly relevant in the development of this pathology.",
        "Treatment": "Refractive error can be corrected through the use of glasses, contact lenses or refractive surgery. Complications of high myopia may require intraocular injections, laser therapy, or intraocular surgery. Myopia, astigmatism and hyperopia often lead to the use of glasses or contact lenses. LASIK surgery can restore good vision. For many children, spending more time at home has meant spending more time in front of screens. Learn how to protect your child's eyes.

    "Changes in sexual desire": {
        "What is it?": "This is a situation that naturally affects men's quality of life, more in some than others, but which often causes marital or relational conflicts as it negatively interferes with sexuality. In this context, this decrease in sexual desire can accompany other symptoms that affect a couple's sexual life, such as erectile dysfunction or ejaculatory changes, which is why a correct diagnosis is essential for the treatment to be as successful as possible.",
        "Symptoms": "It is important to keep in mind that around 20 to 30% of men after the age of 45 have symptoms related to low testosterone levels. Some studies show that low testosterone levels may be associated with an increased risk of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Effective treatment can be effective and restore normal sexual function, improving mood and energy. Changes in libido occur in most cases with weak or absent erections, fatigue, depression, anhedonia (inability to feel pleasure in various daily activities) and increased abdominal fat.",
        "Causes": "Changes in male sexual desire can have several causes, some of which are organic in origin, and may first be this symptom, while others are psychological in origin and can affect all age groups. All of these causes must be diagnosed in order to be subjected to specific treatment.  The main cause in men over 50 years of age is male hypogonadism, defined as a clinical syndrome caused by a deficiency of the male hormone (testosterone) and which can also negatively affect multiple organic functions. This hypogonadism can originate from testicular diseases (called primary), pituitary or hypothalamus diseases located in the brain (called secondary) and also related to age (late-onset hypogonadism, which is a mixed situation of the previous two). The main causes of hypogonadism in this age group are the use of certain medications and late-onset hypogonadism, which have different treatments. Since this hormonal deficiency causes not only changes in the sexual sphere but also significant organic changes, such as anemia, loss of bone mass, increased visceral fat, sleep disorders and even fatigue, irritability or depression, it is important to diagnose and treat it in the context of men's health, and hormone replacement therapy may be indicated to improve the patient's physical condition and prevent or treat these metabolic changes.  On the other hand, psychological causes also play an important role. The national reality shows that more than 10% of Portuguese men have a lack of sexual interest. The most implicated factors are fatigue and professional demands. However, in some cases, it is because they are anxious, depressed or bored, they feel insecure, they have low levels of confidence in their erectile function or there are conflicts in the marital relationship, especially when they last a long time. The most surprising thing is that men between 30 and 39 are the most affected. And the main reasons for the lack of sexual interest in this age group are the routine of relationships and the change in the couple's role, and parenthood, for example, tends to influence the couple's relationship.",
        "Treatment": "For these situations, psychological support is recommended, rather than drug therapies, with professionals specialized in this area, after ruling out organic medical causes.

    "Alveolite dentaria": {
        "What is it?": "Dental alveolitis is one of the most common complications that can occur after tooth extraction. It is classified as dry alveolitis or suppurative alveolitis. Suppurative alveolitis appears when an infection forms in the tooth socket. Dry socket occurs when the blood clot fails to form or is accidentally removed or dislodged. The blood clot is important to protect the tooth socket, namely the bone and surrounding tissues that are exposed after tooth removal. Furthermore, it will also be the basis for healing and the growth of new bones and soft tissues.",
        "Symptoms of dry socket": "The pain inherent to dental alveolitis usually begins one to three days after tooth extraction and can last about five to six days. Symptoms vary and include: Severe pain at the extraction site;/ Bad breath (halitosis);/ Unpleasant taste in the mouth;/ Radiation of pain to the ear, eye, temple or neck;/",
        "Causes": "Only 1% to 5% of patients develop dry socket after tooth extraction, with 30% of cases being associated with the extraction of lower wisdom teeth. The reason for its appearance is unclear, however, possible causes include the type and quantity of bacteria present in the oral cavity and possible trauma to the affected area, either during surgery or afterwards, for example, accidentally touching the clot with a toothbrush.  There are also some risk factors that can increase the likelihood of developing dental alveolitis: Being a smoker and/or chewing tobacco;/ Pre-existing infection in the area treated;/ Practicing poor oral hygiene;/ Not following the recommended care after surgery;/ Rinse your mouth intensely;/ Prolonged tooth extraction surgery;/ Using birth control pills or taking estrogen replacement therapy;/ Have ever had dental alveolitis;/  The type and number of teeth extracted may be a risk factor, given that dental alveolitis is more common after the removal of wisdom teeth or other molars and in single tooth extractions.",
        "Diagnosis": "If the patient has symptoms compatible with alveolitis, he/she should consult a dentist to confirm the diagnosis. This is usually done only through a visual examination. An X-ray may be necessary to confirm that no tooth fragments have been left behind and to rule out the possibility of osteomyelitis (bone infection).",
        "Treatment of dental alveolitis": "Dry socket is a temporary condition that can be treated quickly with proper care. The main focus of treatment is pain management. To help reduce symptoms, the tooth socket can be washed with a saline solution, alveolar curettage can be performed to clean the affected area and it can be filled with medicated products to relieve pain and promote proper tissue healing. The dentist may also prescribe painkillers, anti-inflammatories or antibiotics depending on the signs and symptoms presented. At home, the patient must maintain proper oral hygiene, complemented by rinsing with a 0.12% Chlorhexidine-based mouthwash for the time recommended by the dentist and applying ice or cold compresses to reduce pain and discomfort.",

    "Alzheimer": {
        "What is it?": "Alzheimer's disease is a neurological disorder that causes progressive memory loss and cognitive decline. It is currently the most common type of dementia, accounting for 60% to 80% of cases in the United States: in 2013, 6.8 million people were diagnosed with dementia, of which five million were classified as Alzheimer's. By 2050, numbers are expected to double. Alzheimer's disease, which has an insidious onset and slow progression, first and predominantly affects episodic memory, with the patient beginning to have difficulty remembering recent fragments of their life (where they place objects, messages, what they ate the day before, what day of the month it is).",
        "Symptoms": "Memory loss is slowly joined by other characteristic symptoms: Difficulty recognizing people;/ Poorer, choppy speech looking for words;/ Orientation in spaces becomes increasingly difficult;/ Over time, the first changes in behavior also begin to appear, with visual hallucinations and delusional activity being frequent (the patient thinking they are being robbed or being chased), resulting in agitation and aggression.;/ This set of difficulties increases until it is enough for the person to no longer live independently, having to be helped with tasks previously performed naturally, such as cooking, dressing, washing, dealing with appliances or money.",
        "Causes": "Like other types of dementia, Alzheimer's is a neurodegenerative disease, which means there is a progressive loss of brain cells over time: brain tissue has fewer and fewer nerve cells and the connections between them are lost.",
        "Diagnosis": "Neurological examination is typically normal in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, as are imaging tests which, if not also normal, show only atrophy of the hippocampus, an anatomical formations in the inner part of the cerebral hemispheres that play a fundamental role in the consolidation and recall of new memories. In more advanced stages, patients often develop signs of Parkinson's (slowness and rigidity) and tests show atrophy of the entire brain.",
        "Treatment": "There is no known cure for Alzheimer's disease, as brain cell death cannot be reversed. However, there are therapeutic interventions that improve patients' lives and make dementia easier to manage, including: the control of other concomitant pathologies;/ to occupational therapy;/ involvement in support groups and services;/ drug therapy: drugs that can reduce symptoms and help improve patients' quality of life - cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, tacrine) and memantine.;/ Supportive care for daily activities becomes more important as the person is less able to live independently.",

    "Amblyopia": {
        "What is it?": "Amblyopia (\"lazy eye\") consists of decreased vision in one eye, or less frequently in both eyes, due to problems that interfere with normal visual development during childhood. Generally, the amblyopic eye has no apparent changes, however its vision is lower than normal. It is a situation that affects around 5% of children and although it originates in childhood, if not diagnosed and treated early, low vision remains into adulthood.  Why does it arise? The structure of the visual system is fully formed at birth. However, visual function is very poor. Its development occurs at the brain level, depending on the proper functioning of the eyes, as adequate visual stimulation is necessary for the brain to \"learn to see\". Amblyopia arises because the brain does not \"recognize\" the less clear image that is captured and sent by one of the eyes, and by \"favoring\" the other eye with better vision it can \"block\" the images sent by the worse one, making it amblyopic ( \"lazy\"). The period of childhood in which vision evolves at the brain level is called the critical period. The duration of this period varies for different aspects of visual function, and can last up to approximately eight years of age. However, in cases such as some congenital cataracts, the critical period can end very early in the first months of life. Therefore, depending on the situations, there are time limits beyond which, even if these are corrected, no further improvements in vision will be achieved.",
        "Symptoms": "Family members and educators should suspect that there may be causes of amblyopia (\u201clazy eye\u201d) if the child: squints his eyes to try to see better;;/ brings objects too close to the face;;/ does not adequately identify distant family members;;/ averts one eye.;/ It should be noted that a young child who has amblyopia may not reveal any symptoms. When seeing clearly from one eye, this situation may go unnoticed, only revealing itself when your vision is evaluated at a medical appointment.",
        "Causes": "The main causes are:  Refractive errors: if the child has hyperopia, astigmatism, myopia or anisometropia (\u201cdifference in graduation between the eyes\u201d), the image that reaches the brain is not clear and it \u201cchooses\u201d the eye with better vision.;/ Strabismus: if the eyes are not \u201caligned\u201d, the child\u2019s brain, which has a great capacity for adaptation, suppresses (\u201cblocks\u201d) the image of one of the eyes to avoid \u201cseeing double\u201d. Over time, this leads to amblyopia in the \u201cshifting\u201d eye.;/ Cataracts, ptosis (\u201cdrooping eyelid\u201d), retinal diseases: prevent the eye from \u201ccapturing\u201d and sending a clear image to the brain;/",
        "Treatment": "To treat amblyopia, it is essential to correct the cause. This may consist of:  Use of prescription glasses to correct refractive errors, the most common being hyperopia.;/ Occlusion: It consists of covering the dominant eye (\u201cthe eye that sees better\u201d) with a specific bandage, for a period of time that will depend on the degree of amblyopia and the age of the child. This method, by allowing more intense stimulation of the amblyopic eye (\u201clazy eye\u201d), is what offers better and faster results. There are other methods of penalizing the dominant eye, such as the use of eye drops that dilate the pupils or the prescription of glasses with a filter on the lens of the eye that \u201cseees better.\u201d \u201d, causing blurred vision and thus forcing the amblyopic eye to see.;/ Early surgery for congenital cataracts.;/ Surgery to correct eyelid ptosis.;/",
        "Prevention": "All children should undergo an ophthalmological examination before the age of three. Early diagnosis of amblyopia and its cause is essential for appropriate treatment that can allow recovery, preventing amblyopia from persisting into adulthood. The pediatric ophthalmologist, through observation and the examinations performed during the consultation, assesses whether amblyopia is present. Even in very young or uncooperative children, it is often possible to identify risk factors for amblyopia and correct it in most cases when diagnosed early. Prolonged exposure to television, cell phone and computer screens can have negative effects on your eyes. Find out what to do to take care of your eyes.

These, like adenoids, are lymphoid tissues that, when in good condition, help prevent infections. A sore throat (clinically known as odynophagia) is a common symptom. It can indicate an inflammatory process in the oropharynx, i.e. the tonsils or the pharynx. In the first case, we are dealing with tonsillitis. In the second, it is acute pharyngitis.",
        "Symptoms": "Tonsillitis manifests itself through: Sore throat;/ Fever (varying degree);/ Difficulty swallowing;/ Earache (reflex);/ General malaise;/ The most common symptoms of hypertrophy of the palatine tonsils and adenoids are: Mouth breathing;/ Roncopathy;/ Breathing stops during sleep (sleep apneas);/ Swallowing difficulties;/ Nasal voice;/",
        "Causes": "It is a generally acute, but can also be chronic, inflammation of the tonsils, caused by bacteria (usually streptococci) or viruses.",
        "Diagnosis": "When observing the mouth, redness appears in the throat with or without white spots (pus). The symptoms of tonsillitis can be common to other serious illnesses and should be observed and treated by a doctor.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment for acute tonsillitis depends on: Age, general health conditions and background;/ Extent of infection;/ Type of infection;/ Patient tolerance to medications and medical procedures;/ Evolution of infection;/ Treatment may be medical (with medication) or surgical, depending on the cause, extent, recurrence or severity of the symptoms. Antibiotics may be useful but not always necessary if the cause is a virus. Chronic tonsillitis is an inflammation characterized by tonsillar hypertrophy with marked crypts, sometimes with pus, hyperemia and a foul odor; medical therapy is generally not very effective and surgical intervention should be considered. Surgery is also indicated when there is a high number of tonsillitis cases, tonsillar hypertrophy leading to obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, suspected neoplasia or a history of complications. There are different techniques for tonsillectomy, the most common being cold dissection, electrocautery, laser, radiofrequency ablation.",

        "What is it?": "Anaphylaxis is a severe and life-threatening allergic response that can cause edema (swelling), hives, a sudden drop in blood pressure, shortness of breath, difficulty swallowing, loss of consciousness, or even death if not treated immediately. It can occur in any adult or child after being exposed to a substance to which they are allergic, so early diagnosis of allergies in childhood is important.",
        "Symptoms": "Pruritus (itching);/ Urticaria;/ Swelling of the lips, tongue, eyelids or other areas of the body;/ Cough;/ Difficulty breathing or wheezing;/ Nausea and vomiting;/ Abdominal cramps and diarrhea;/",
        "Causes": "In children, the most common causes of anaphylaxis are related to foods, such as cow's milk, eggs, peanuts, nuts (walnuts, hazelnuts, almonds), shellfish, fish and wheat. Other possible causes include medications, such as anti-inflammatories and antibiotics, cold or insect stings (bees and wasps).",
        "Diagnosis": "If severe allergic symptoms occur, you should call the helpline or go immediately to an emergency room, where adrenaline should be administered in addition to other treatments. If a child has ever had an anaphylactic reaction, it is mandatory to inform school staff about severe allergies, so that they can help avoid them or initiate the necessary treatment. The child must be observed by an immunoallergologist to determine the exact cause of anaphylaxis and correct guidance, particularly indicating the use of devices for self-administration of adrenaline.",
        "Treatment": "In the presence of an acute anaphylactic reaction, the only effective treatment is an injection of adrenaline, which acts quickly, reversing the symptoms of anaphylaxis, and can be administered by the patient or by healthcare professionals. As this is a medical emergency, the patient must be treated immediately in the Emergency Department where life support and resuscitation care will be provided. In the hospital, in addition to adrenaline, treatment may include intravenous fluids and medications to maintain heart and circulatory system function, antihistamines and corticosteroids.",
        "Prevention": "People with allergies are most susceptible to developing anaphylaxis. However, it is not always possible to prevent it, as reactions to a previously unknown substance may occur. Once an allergic reaction has been identified, a record of the trigger should be kept to avoid it in the future (e.g., the name of the antibiotic or food). Since it is not always possible to avoid the allergen, people who have suffered an anaphylactic reaction should always carry an injection of adrenaline and an allergy identification card or bracelet. Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening emergency that requires immediate medical attention.

    "Anemia": {
        "What is it?": "The World Health Organization estimates that around 25% of the world's population may have some type of anemia, although there is no concrete data on the number of cases in Portugal. Anemia is a clinical condition that results from a decrease in the number of red blood cells in the blood or the hemoglobin content in the blood to values \u200b\u200bbelow those considered normal. There are three basic types of cells in our blood: red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. All of these cells are formed in the bone marrow, which is located inside the bones. White blood cells help fight infections and platelets are essential for clotting. Red blood cells contain hemoglobin, which transports oxygen from the lungs to the entire body and, conversely, transports carbon dioxide from the tissues to be eliminated by the lungs. In anemia, red blood cells are no longer able to deliver oxygen to the body effectively. In order for red blood cells and hemoglobin to be produced, the body needs iron, vitamin B12, folates and other nutrients that it obtains through the diet.",
        "Symptoms": "In the initial stages, anemia tends to go unnoticed, being confused with fatigue. In more advanced stages, fatigue is associated with: Generalized lack of strength;/ Pallor;/ Headaches;/ Irritability;/ Sleep changes;/ Dizziness;/ Difficulty concentrating;/ Depression;/ Low blood pressure;/ Rapid heart rate;/ Rapid breathing with a feeling of oppression;/ Fainting;/ Brittle nails;/ Loss of appetite;/ Cold extremities;/ If anemia progresses without treatment, it will tend to worsen other health problems, such as heart failure, by placing additional effort on the heart.",
        "Causes": "The causes of anemia are very variable and this disease occurs whenever the human body does not have the red blood cells necessary for its normal functioning, either due to reduced production in the bone marrow, excessive loss or destruction. Some factors that can favor the onset of anemia are:  1. Iron deficiency It is the most common cause of anemia and can result from losses due to bleeding, as occurs in gastritis associated with the use of anti-inflammatories, in stomach and duodenal ulcers or in cancerous lesions of the digestive tract. Anemia can also be a consequence of an increased need for iron, resulting, for example, from pregnancy or periods of rapid growth, such as preschool age and adolescence. An unbalanced diet low in iron is another common cause of iron deficiency, as occurs, for example, in vegetarian diets. A lack of vitamin B12 and folic acid can also cause anemia.  2. Chronic illnesses Cancer, HIV/AIDS infection, rheumatoid arthritis, kidney failure are some chronic diseases that interfere with the production of red blood cells and cause chronic anemia. If the bone marrow stops producing cells, we will also have anemia, something that can happen in lymphomas, some types of infection or after using some drugs.  3. Bowel diseases They can affect nutrient absorption, increasing the likelihood of developing anemia.  4. Intense physical activity Very intense physical activity, such as running, may be associated with anemia due to the destruction of red blood cells caused by repeated impact.  5. Heredity Some forms of anemia can be hereditary, such as sickle cell anemia (insufficient number of red blood cells capable of transporting the necessary amount of oxygen throughout the body).  6. Other factors Menstruation, pregnancy, alcoholism and the use of certain medications are other factors to consider.",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of anemia is made by combining data from medical observation with the results of laboratory tests, which include those that assess the levels and characteristics of red blood cells, hemoglobin and iron in the blood. Depending on the results of these tests, additional tests may be necessary to identify the cause of the anemia, which may affect, for example, the digestive system or kidneys, among others. Sometimes, a myelogram (bone marrow collection) is necessary to identify the cause of anemia.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment for anemia depends on its causes and involves restoring normal levels of hemoglobin and red blood cells. When blood tests confirm that anemia is caused by iron deficiency, treatment will involve administering iron supplements, either orally or by injection. The same applies to vitamin B12 deficiency, which can be corrected by administering injectable supplements. Adopting a balanced diet can, in many cases, reverse the process that caused anemia. If anemia is caused by blood loss, it is essential to identify the source of the loss and treat it. In more severe anemia, it may even be necessary to resort to blood transfusions.",
        "Prevention": "To prevent anemia, it is essential to adopt a balanced and healthy diet, including meat, fish, fruits and green leafy vegetables. Vitamin C, found in citrus fruits, kiwifruit and broccoli, also plays an important role in iron absorption. In the phases of life when there is a greater need for iron (pregnancy, breastfeeding, childhood and adolescence), dietary intake may not be sufficient and it will be important to take iron supplements, according to medical recommendations.

    "Aneurisma cerebral": {
        "What is it?": "A cerebral aneurysm corresponds to an area of \u200b\u200bweakness in the wall of an intracranial blood vessel that tends to dilate, becoming filled with blood. In general, aneurysms form in the area where the arteries bifurcate, as this is the most fragile area of \u200b\u200btheir structure. This dilation can put pressure on nerves or other adjacent brain structures. Alternatively, it can rupture, causing hemorrhage that will compress neighboring structures. When brain aneurysms are small, they rarely bleed or cause other problems. It is estimated that around 5% of the population has a cerebral aneurysm, with an annual rupture rate of around 2%. The incidence of aneurysm rupture is about 10 in every 100,000 people per year. Brain aneurysms can occur at any age, but are more common in adults (30-60 years of age) than in children and are also more common in females.",
        "Symptoms": "Most brain aneurysms are not associated with symptoms until they enlarge or rupture. Signs result from compression of adjacent structures and may include pain above and around the eyes, tingling sensations, weakness or paralysis in a on the sides of the face, dilated pupils, changes in vision, photophobia. When bleeding occurs, the main symptom is a sudden and extremely severe headache, associated with double vision, nausea, vomiting, stiff neck and loss of consciousness. Sometimes episodes of milder headaches occur in the days before the rupture.",
        "Causes": "Cerebral aneurysms can be congenital, resulting from a weakness in the arterial wall. They are more common in people with other genetic problems, such as connective tissue pathologies, polycystic kidney disease, and circulatory diseases such as arteriovenous malformations. Other possible causes include trauma, high blood pressure, infections, tumors, atherosclerosis, smoking, and alcohol and drug abuse, such as cocaine. There is no consensus on the role of oral contraceptives in the formation of aneurysms.",
        "Diagnosis": "Most brain aneurysms go unnoticed due to the absence of symptoms. They are often detected by chance after a brain scan requested for another reason. Cerebral angiography allows them to be visualized and located with high precision. Computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are very useful exams in the evaluation of these cases and can be combined with the administration of a contrast agent to obtain more detailed information.",
        "Treatment": "In the case of small cerebral aneurysms, regular monitoring is sufficient. Treatment, when necessary, should be individualized according to the type, size and location, and the clinical characteristics of the patient. Surgery: in general, surgical treatment may consist of a clipping process, which involves interrupting blood flow in the aneurysm by placing a metal clip. This procedure may or may not be accompanied by a bypass.;/ Embolization: an alternative to surgery is embolization, in which a catheter is inserted through the femoral artery and guided by angiography to the aneurysm, allowing the placement of a platinum material in the form of a spiral that will fill it, blocking circulation and triggering blood clotting.;/ Medication:\u00a0anticonvulsants and painkillers may be helpful in relieving symptoms.;/ In addition to treating the brain aneurysm itself, it is important to treat other underlying medical conditions, such as high blood pressure. The main complications of a ruptured brain aneurysm are stroke, permanent brain damage or death. Hydrocephalus with cerebral compression or vasospasm phenomena in other areas of the brain with consequent reduction in blood flow may also occur.",
        "Prevention": "A brain aneurysm cannot be prevented, but once diagnosed, it is possible to interfere with its progression by controlling blood pressure, not smoking and not consuming cocaine or other stimulants. The use of aspirin or other medications that thin the blood should be assessed on a case-by-case basis, as well as the use of oral contraceptives.

    "Aortic aneurysm": {
        "What is it?": "The aorta is the largest artery in the body, being responsible for transporting oxygen from the heart to the entire body. The part of the aorta that passes through the chest is called the thoracic aorta and the part that passes through the abdomen, the abdominal aorta. An aortic aneurysm corresponds to an abnormal enlargement of the aortic wall and can occur anywhere along its path. Depending on their shape, they can be called fusiform (more elongated) or saccular (sack-shaped, smaller than fusiform). The\u00a0 abdominal aorta is the most common site of arterial aneurysm. It is defined as a focal dilation, involving all vascular layers, with a diameter greater than or equal to three centimeters. Most occur in the segment of the aorta located below the kidneys. They are four to five times more common in males and their incidence increases with age, being rare before the age of 60. Mortality associated with its rupture is around 80%. When aneurysms are detected before this catastrophic event and reveal dimensions in which surgical correction is indicated, the mortality associated with this procedure is around 5%, and, as such, it is important to consider the benefit of early detection through performing screening actions.",
        "Symptoms": "The majority remain asymptomatic until they rupture. Therefore, they are either discovered by chance during a medical consultation or in complementary diagnostic tests, or they are never detected and the patient ends up dying for any other reason, before their rupture. More rarely, they can manifest themselves in the form of chronic abdominal pain, or through thromboembolic complications, and symptomatic patients are at greater risk of rupture. When this occurs, it often manifests as lower back pain, with or without abdominal pain, hypotension and the presence of a pulsating abdominal mass. Rapid progression to shock may occur, associated with high mortality. Symptoms secondary to the rupture may simulate an acute myocardial infarction, renal colic, pancreatitis, biliary colic, among other situations. In the case of a thoracic aortic aneurysm, the most common signs are pain in the jaw, neck or chest, coughing and difficulty breathing.",
        "Causes": "Smoking, atherosclerosis, high blood pressure and a family history of abdominal aneurysm are among the main risk factors for the formation of an aneurysm. However, approximately 95% of aortic aneurysms are caused by atherosclerosis, which causes a narrowing of the aortic wall. Other associated causes are: The muscular layer of the aorta wall may present congenital weakness, which facilitates the formation of an aneurysm;;/ Arterial hypertension, by increasing the force exerted by the blood on the aortic wall, contributes to the formation of aneurysms;;/ Trauma is another possible cause.;/",
        "Diagnosis": "Early diagnosis is very important to ensure appropriate treatment. To achieve this, there must be a high level of suspicion so that the appropriate additional tests can be selected for each situation. In this case, the symptoms may simulate very different clinical conditions and, as such, the diagnosis is more complex. For this pathology, the recommended tests are chest X-rays and ultrasound, as well as abdominal computed tomography with intravenous contrast.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment depends on the size of the aneurysm. For small, asymptomatic aneurysms, regular monitoring may be sufficient, in addition to treating all risk factors present. For larger aneurysms, it is important to assess the best treatment. Surgery is one option and may involve different techniques depending on the characteristics of the aneurysm.",
        "Prevention": "Prevention involves adopting a diet low in cholesterol and saturated fats, in order to reduce the risk of atherosclerosis. It is also important to prevent, detect and treat high blood pressure. Whenever there is a family history or risk factors, it is also important to have a periodic ultrasound scan.

    "Abdominal aortic aneurysm": {
        "What is it?": "The term aneurysm comes from Greek and means dilation and is used whenever there is an irreversible increase in the normal diameter of the arteries. It is characterized by a more or less voluminous, pulsatile swelling with expansion, that is, with a variation in diameter synchronous with the arterial pulsation. Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a relatively common disease, being called as such whenever the dilation is greater than three centimeters. It results from a structural weakness of the arterial wall, namely the tunica media, the most common cause of which is atherosclerosis. In these situations, the rule has a focal distribution, with preferential locations in the infrarenal abdominal aorta and the popliteal and subclavian arteries. It is more frequent after the age of 65, more common in males and its prevalence is higher in patients with coronary or peripheral arterial occlusive disease and in those with peripheral aneurysms. If the prevalence in the Portuguese population is similar to that in other European countries, it can be admitted that there could be around 500 new cases per year, with a tendency to increase, as a result of the progressive aging of the population. Its clinical importance derives essentially from the irreversibility of arterial dilation and its progressive nature, which can lead to rupture, a fatal situation if not treated surgically, and associated with high mortality - 80% in the best published series, which contrasts with a minimal surgical risk. (less than 4%) - when treated on a scheduled basis.",
        "Symptoms": "It is mostly asymptomatic, rarely causes pain and, in a third of cases, its first clinical manifestation may be rupture. This complication appears to be more frequently associated with aortic aneurysms larger than five centimeters in diameter. The presence of pain, whether spontaneous or on palpation, is an unfavorable symptom, which may be associated with its expansion and/or parietal fissure phenomena without frank rupture. Sometimes it can cause arterial embolization with acute or chronic ischemia, a consequence of the fragmentation of the intra-saccular thrombus. Early diagnosis by abdominal ultrasound is essential, in order to enable effective treatment, in the best possible clinical conditions, reducing risks and, thus, contributing to reducing mortality associated with both the pathology and its correction.",
        "Causes": "Risk factors for abdominal aortic aneurysm include: male gender, age over 60, trauma, circulatory system problems, atherosclerosis, smoking, high blood pressure and genetic predisposition.",
        "Diagnosis": "Most are diagnosed during a routine checkup or on an X-ray taken for another health problem. Once an aneurysm is suspected, the following imaging tests may be used to determine its size, location, and treatment options: Abdominal ultrasound;/ Computed tomography;/ Magnetic resonance imaging;/ Angiograma;/",
        "Treatment": "The usual treatment is surgical and its objective is to exclude it from the circulation, ensuring its continuity through the interposition of an arterial graft. The results are good, long-lasting, with an increasingly lower surgical risk, thanks to developments in anaesthesia and post-operative intensive care. The development of new endoprostheses (name of the grafts used), which are placed by retrograde arterial catheterisation, under radiological control, and released in order to exclude the aneurysmal sac from the circulation through two small incisions in the groin, has led to the development of effective endografts, with a durability of five years compared to conventional surgery. Both traditional surgical repair and endovascular repair have advantages and disadvantages, so the therapeutic indication must be adapted to the specific clinical situation of each patient.",
        "Prevention": "Prevention of cardiovascular disease in general includes a balanced diet, rich in fruit, vegetables and whole grains and low in fat.

    "Angina pectoris": {
        "What is it?": "It is the medical name for chest pain or discomfort resulting from coronary disease, in which the heart muscle does not receive the blood it needs. The cause for this reduction in flow is almost always a narrowing or blockage of one or more of the coronary arteries. It does not correspond to a disease but to a set of symptoms resulting from poor irrigation of the heart. Angina pectoris is, therefore, a cardiovascular pathology, more common in elderly people. Around 20% of men and 12% of women over the age of 65 show some signs of cardiovascular disease. In 2009, there were 23 hospitalizations in Portugal for every 100 thousand inhabitants. Angina pectoris may precede the occurrence of a myocardial infarction. In fact, around 18% of heart attacks initially manifest themselves in this way. As an expression of coronary disease, it appears more frequently in women than in men.",
        "Symptoms": "Silent episodes may occur, i.e. without any type of clinical manifestation and which are only detected on an electrocardiogram. This type is more common in the early hours of the day and is seen, among others, in diabetic patients or those with a high resistance to pain. It generally causes sensations of pressure, discomfort, tightness or even pain in the central region of the chest, although these sensations can be referred to the neck, lower jaw, shoulder, arm or back. This variety of locations makes diagnosis more difficult. Since the symptoms result from reduced blood flow to the heart, they tend to occur during exertion, such as walking on steep terrain or climbing stairs. At rest, these symptoms gradually decrease in intensity. Stress can also trigger angina attacks. Other factors include eating, exposure to cold and fever. Attacks usually last between one and five minutes and are relieved by rest or by taking nitroglycerin under the tongue. When they last only a few seconds, they do not usually correspond to angina episodes.",
        "Causes": "Atherosclerosis is one of the most common causes of narrowing of the coronary arteries. When this narrowing is at least 50%, angina pectoris occurs whenever exertion increases the oxygen needs of the heart muscle. If this narrowing is greater than 90%, angina can occur even at rest. As such, all factors that aggravate atherosclerosis increase the risk of this problem: tobacco, diabetes, high blood pressure, hypercholesterolemia or obesity. Angina pectoris can occur even without narrowing of the coronary arteries and result from their spasm, caused by various mechanisms, such as reduced magnesium levels or smoking. In the presence of severe anemia, the blood's ability to transport oxygen is compromised and can also trigger angina pectoris. Patients with congenital heart problems, such as scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus, polyarteritis nodosa, Kawasaki disease, among others, are at higher risk.",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis is based on the patient's clinical history, observation and the performance of a series of tests, among which the following stand out: electrocardiogram with exercise test, continuous recording of the electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, coronary angiography, angiography and isotope studies. For each case, the cardiologist will define which tests are most appropriate.",
        "Treatment": "Generally speaking, an attack of angina pectoris is relieved by rest. The use of nitrate-based medications is important because it relaxes the coronary arteries and improves blood flow to the heart. Treatment should include measures that prevent the progression of coronary artery disease or help to reverse it. As such, this treatment should focus on all the risk factors already mentioned, such as blood pressure, cholesterol and smoking, among others. In milder forms, the approach involves this control and the use of some medications. The most commonly used drugs reduce poor irrigation and improve symptoms and fall into the following categories: beta-blockers, nitrates, calcium antagonists and antiplatelet agents. The first three act on the heart and arteries; the latter aims to reduce the risk of clots forming in the artery walls. In more severe cases, hospitalization and the use of more complex therapeutic measures are necessary. In these cases, coronary bypass surgery improves circulation and blood supply to the heart muscle. Another option is coronary angioplasty, which seeks to reduce the degree of obstruction in the affected coronary arteries.",
        "Prevention": "This prevention involves controlling all the risk factors already mentioned. Healthy lifestyle practices, physical exercise, controlling weight, blood pressure and cholesterol, avoiding tobacco and alcohol consumption, and regular medical appointments are some good examples of what can and should be done to keep the heart healthy. Taking a small dose of aspirin daily can help prevent blood clots and may be recommended for people at risk of developing angina.

        "Advantages and benefits": "In addition to allowing the evaluation of the circulation pattern of a given organ, this examination also has the advantage of being dynamic (if the images are obtained as the substance is administered, it is possible to evaluate the speed of circulation, its distribution pattern, its symmetry and all this information can be extremely relevant).  Some of the organs most frequently studied by angiography are the retina, heart and brain.  This examination can also be combined with others, such as magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography, and in this way, the images of the circulation are integrated with the images of the organ itself, allowing even more diagnostic elements to be obtained.  In some cases, the time at which the angiography is performed can be used to institute therapeutic measures, such as angioplasty (dilation of a narrowed blood vessel), removal of a clot or placement of a mesh inside the vessel to keep it open and functioning.",
        "Methodology": "Angiography is generally performed in a hospital setting but does not require hospitalization, although in some cases it is recommended to spend a night in the hospital.  The procedure takes between 30 minutes and 2 hours and is performed under local anesthesia or sedation. In the case of children or in more complex cases, general anesthesia may be necessary.  In this method, a very thin, flexible tube is inserted into an artery, usually in the groin, and is gradually directed towards the areas to be examined. This movement is controlled by a radiologist.  Once the area to be studied is located, a contrast substance is injected and a series of radiographic images are taken.  In the case of angiography performed in Ophthalmology, the dye is introduced into a vein in the arm and injected slowly. During this injection, photographs of previously dilated eyes are taken. There is no need to use radiation here.  For each type of angiography and depending on the clinical characteristics of each patient, preparation for this examination must always be adjusted.",
        "Indications": "In the scope of Ophthalmology, angiography allows the evaluation of diseases such as macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy.  Other diseases where angiography is important are strokes, myocardial infarctions, gangrene and organ failure.",
        "Care to be taken": "It may be necessary to stop taking some medications before the angiography, such as aspirin or other medications that interfere with blood clotting, in order to reduce the risk of complications. This should be stopped between 72 hours before the exam and 24 hours after it.  The remaining medication can be continued.  Angiography is a safe and painless procedure, with a reduced risk of complications.  Bruising may form at the injection site and it is important to assess the likelihood of an allergic reaction to the injected substance.  More rarely, bleeding or bruising at the injection site, local infection or a mild allergic reaction may occur. These various problems are usually easily controllable and treatable.  Even more rarely, angiography may be associated with a risk of kidney injury, myocardial infarction, stroke, severe allergic reaction or death.  In any case, the benefits of angiography far outweigh its potential risks.

    "Anorexia nervosa": {
        "What is it?": "Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by a distortion of body image, with an extreme fear of obesity and the inability to maintain a minimum normal weight within 15% of ideal body weight. Patients with this pathology have the perception that they are fat, when in reality they are extremely thin. To become thin, they resort to restrictive diets that result in weight loss below 85% of what would be expected, or body mass index (BMI) values \u200b\u200bbelow 17.5 kg/m2 with an impact on the physical level, and there may be complaints of constipation, abdominal pain, amenorrhea, weakness and intolerance to cold. At a psychological level, symptoms such as sadness, low self-esteem, self-criticism, social isolation, irritability, anxiety and insomnia are common. At a behavioral level, it is quite common for there to be situations of hiding food, faking meals and a refusal or excessive concern about eating in public. Typically, these patients deny their condition, jeopardizing access to treatment. In around 95% of cases, anorexia nervosa affects females. It usually begins in adolescence, sometimes earlier, and more rarely in adulthood. It mainly affects people from middle and high socioeconomic classes. In Western society, the number of individuals with this disorder is increasing. In Portugal, a prevalence of anorexia nervosa is estimated to be in the order of 0.3% to 0.4%, with 90% occurring in females. Although this prevalence is not very high, partial forms of the disease occur in around 12.6% of adolescents, around 7% have body image disorders and 38% with normal weight report a desire to lose weight. These numbers, all referring to Portugal, deserve special attention. The disease can be mild and transient or severe and long-lasting, being fatal in 10% to 20% of cases. Anorexia nervosa is the eating disorder with the highest mortality rate, which is why early access to specialized treatment is crucial.",
        "Symptoms": "Many of the women who later develop anorexia nervosa are meticulous and compulsive, ambitious for success and professional achievement.",
        "Body image concerns": "The first signs are a growing concern about diet and body weight, even if they are already thin, as is the case with most people with anorexia nervosa. Worry and anxiety intensify as they lose weight. Even when faced with extreme thinness, the person insists that they are obese, denies having any problems, does not complain about the lack of appetite or weight loss and, in general, resists treatment. As such, she does not go to the doctor until her family members force her to.",
        "Obsessive food control": "Although anorexia means no appetite, people with anorexia nervosa are hungry and preoccupied with eating, studying diets and counting calories. About 50% of people with anorexia nervosa eat excessive amounts of food and then vomit or take laxatives or diuretics. The other half simply restrict the amount of food they eat. Most also exercise excessively to control their weight.",
        "Hormonal changes": "Women stop menstruating, sometimes before they have lost much weight. A loss of sexual interest is common. There is also a slow heart rate, low blood pressure, low body temperature, swelling of the tissues due to fluid build-up, and thin, soft hair or, conversely, excessive hair growth on the face and body. Depression is common in anorexia nervosa and various types of hormonal changes occur.",
        "Other consequences (in case of severe malnutrition)": "When malnutrition becomes severe, all major organs are affected. The most dangerous problems are those related to the heart, with sodium, potassium and chlorine. The heart becomes weak and expels less blood. The person may become dehydrated and tend to faint. The blood may acidify and blood potassium levels may fall. Vomiting and taking laxatives and diuretics tend to make the situation worse. Sudden death can occur due to the appearance of abnormal heart rhythms.",
        "Causes": "Its cause is unknown, but social pressure appears to be a decisive factor. There are also genetic indicators involved. The desire to be thin is very common in Western society and obesity is considered unattractive. Even children are aware of these attitudes and a large number of teenagers follow diets to control their weight. In fact, anorexia nervosa is related to the process of globalization and the spread of standards in modern societies regarding beauty.",
        "Illness": "The list of diseases that can reduce appetite is vast, highlighting the following: alcoholism, hepatitis, Crohn's Addison's Disease, pneumonia, HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases, depression, anxiety, cancer, renal or heart failure, tuberculosis and ulcerative colitis.",
        "Medication": "Several medications can cause anorexia, such as antidepressants, opiates, amphetamines, some antidiabetics, sudden withdrawal of appetite-stimulating drugs and corticosteroids.",
        "Other factors": "With regard to anorexia as a loss of appetite, its resolution and treatment are directly dependent on the cause and, as such, it will be the diagnosis and correction of the factor that caused it that will be the key to its control.",
        "Diagnosis": "There is no specific diagnosis for anorexia nervosa. It is done based on a marked weight loss and characteristic psychological symptoms. The typical patient is a teenage girl who has lost at least 15% of her body weight, fears obesity, has stopped menstruating, denies being sick, and appears healthy.",
        "Treatment": "Anorexia nervosa requires psychological and physical monitoring, carried out by endocrinologists and nutritionists. It is essential to involve the whole family in the process. It is possible to recover from this pathology. It is estimated that around half of people do it, many others have periods of recovery and relapses and a minority maintain a chronic form, but it is difficult to predict the evolution of each case. Treatment is generally carried out in two phases: the first is the restoration of normal body weight; the second is psychotherapy, often supplemented with drugs.",
        "Weight recovery": "When weight loss has been rapid or intense (e.g. more than 25% below ideal weight) weight regain is crucial and initial treatment is usually carried out in a hospital. Rarely, the patient is fed intravenously or through a tube placed in the nose that reaches the stomach.",
        "Psychotherapy": "When the nutritional status is acceptable, long-term treatment begins, which must be carried out by specialists in appetite changes and which may include individual, group and family psychotherapy, as well as drugs. According to several studies, the intervention Psychological treatment demonstrates effectiveness in the majority of patients who recover their symptoms in full or in part. Through psychological intervention in anorexia nervosa, the patient will seek to return to a healthy weight, reaching motivational levels that help them to cooperate in achieving healthy eating patterns and adhering to treatment. Associated with weight gain, the aim is also to modify a set of maladaptive thoughts, attitudes and emotions related to eating behavior, causing an improvement in self-esteem and self-image and an improvement in interpersonal functioning. After the patient improves, the intervention will have as its central objective the prevention of possible factors that could generate a relapse. Family support is a key factor in the effectiveness of the intervention.",
        "Prevention": "The best prevention of anorexia nervosa involves early identification of the first signs of this disorder and prompt correction. Loss of self-esteem, dissatisfaction with appearance, and changes in eating habits are reasons to address this issue. Support, attention, and dialogue are, in this case, good tools that should be explored.

    "Anosmia": {
        "What is it?": "The sense of smell has a huge responsibility in the quality of life, not only in the perception of the smell of food and the environment, but also in its role in alerting to various dangers such as smoke, gas or spoiled food. Anosmia is the total or partial loss of smell, anosmia or hyposmia respectively, with potential risk to life associated with the lack of perception of dangerous situations such as a gas leak, the smell of smoke or burning, in addition to the lack of awareness of the odor of spoiled food.",
        "Symptoms": "The most obvious sign of anosmia is the loss of smell.",
        "Causes": "The most frequent ones can be grouped into: Diseases of the nasal mucosa in which anosmia results from temporary or permanent irritation or even its destruction. Examples of these situations include sinusitis, allergic or other rhinitis, the common cold or flu;;/ Obstructive diseases of the nasal cavities that group together all clinical situations that cause obstruction to the passage of air that carries odors, such as polyps, deviated septum and benign or malignant tumors;;/ Neurological injuries in which any part of the olfactory pathway, from receptors to the brain, is damaged or destroyed. This group includes Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, aging, brain tumors, traumatic brain injuries and several medications that have, as a side effect, changes in smell.;/",
        "Diagnosis": "Consult an otorhinolaryngologist (ENT) if you notice a persistent loss of smell that cannot be attributed to a cold or allergy. The ENT specialist is essential in the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of clinical situations related to changes in smell, observing the nasal mucosa and possibly requesting additional diagnostic tests, investigating for example the existence of polyps or an infection responsible for anosmia.",
        "Treatment": "Options include medication, surgery, and any therapy needed to resolve an underlying condition. Your doctor may recommend surgery if you have nasal polyps, a deviated septum, or other structural problems. Medications, such as steroids and antihistamines, may also be prescribed to calm any inflammation resulting from an allergy or respiratory infection.",
        "Prevention": "It is important to regularly and correctly humidify the nasal passages, avoid exposure to smoke or other pollutants and only apply vasoconstrictive substances (common nose drops) on medical advice and for a short period of time.

    "Anxiety": {
        "What is it?": "Anxiety is a normal emotion, experienced by people in their daily lives, and characterized by feelings of tension, worry, insecurity, normally accompanied by physical changes such as increased blood pressure and heart rate, sweating, dry mouth, tremors and dizziness. Despite this normative character, when anxiety persists in certain contexts, negatively interferes with the ability to carry out daily activities and causes significant physical and/or emotional suffering, we are faced with an anxiety pathology. This is an important and common problem. In terms of medication, between 2004 and 2009, there was a 25.3% increase in the consumption of anxiolytics, hypnotics, sedatives and antidepressants. These data are confirmed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), where Portugal is above the average of countries in that entity in the consumption of anxiolytics. However, there are few studies that present results relating to the Brazilian reality. Some point to rates of around 50% of primary healthcare users showing symptoms of depression/anxiety. Evidence shows a higher prevalence of depressive and anxiety disorders among women. In Portugal, there is little evidence of this trend, although some recent studies suggest that women are more susceptible to this type of disorder. Under normal conditions, anxiety can be useful, as it helps to identify dangerous situations and allows for better preparation to face them. When well controlled, it acts mainly as a stimulant. In excess, it causes unnecessary suffering. There are different forms of anxiety, each with different symptoms, the main ones being the following: obsessive compulsive disorder;/ post-traumatic stress;/ panic;/ agoraphobia, generalized, social or separation anxiety;/",
        "Relationship between anxiety and depression": "Anxiety is part of the clinical picture of depression and is variably associated with mood changes and depressive states. It can, therefore, be stated that patients with this pathology also suffer from anxiety, more or less pronounced. Likewise, most people whose anxiety manifests itself to a high degree can progress to a depressive state. The simultaneous presence of depression and anxiety is very striking, implying a greater severity of symptoms. Studies carried out in Portugal recorded a strong correlation between depression, anxiety and stress.",
        "Anxiety Symptoms": "The most common symptoms are feelings of apprehension or worry, helplessness, fear or panic. These are often associated with physical manifestations such as increased heart rate and breathing, sweating, tremors, feelings of fatigue, among others. Different types of anxiety present specific signs: Panic attacks can begin suddenly, causing very strong physical symptoms, almost like suffocation. In agoraphobia, anxiety occurs in environments where the patient feels trapped.;/ Social phobias happen in circumstances of social or public exposure.;/ In obsessive-compulsive disorder, persistent thoughts and an uncontrollable desire to repeat, for no apparent reason and without purpose, a certain act arise.;/ In post-traumatic stress, the patient feels that he or she is reliving a traumatic experience, reporting very intense emotional and physical reactions.;/",
        "Causes": "In some cases, anxiety may have an obvious cause. However, in others it seems to have no apparent origin. When this happens, the fact that the patient is unable to identify the cause tends to make it worse. Therefore, one of the important aspects of treatment is identifying the factors that trigger it. There is evidence that there may be a genetic basis for anxiety. The occurrence of stressful experiences and the inability to cope with them is another important issue. The consumption of alcohol, drugs, tea, coffee, tobacco and some medications can also be associated with anxiety attacks. In general, life problems usually trigger anxiety, and in acute cases, anguish. In addition, personal difficulties in integrating into society, and internal conflicts in the affective, emotional and sexual domains can lead to anxiety symptoms. Anxiety can be associated with: Specific Phobias Specific phobias are characterized by marked, irrational fear or anxiety about a specific object or context. These feared objects or contexts are usually avoided or faced with intense fear and anxiety. Among specific phobias there are some subtypes: animal (spiders, dogs, \u2026);/ natural environment (water, storms, \u2026);/ blood-injections (wounds, needles, \u2026);/ situational (airplanes, elevators, closed spaces, \u2026);/  Phobia Social Social Anxiety Disorder is characterized by persistent and excessive fear and anxiety in contexts of exposure to the scrutiny of others. In these contexts, fear of embarrassment, humiliation and rejection is common, which leads to the avoidance of social interaction situations, significant levels of suffering and a considerable impact on different areas of life.  Panic Disorder It is an anxiety disorder characterized by the unexpected onset of recurrent panic attacks and persistent concern about the possibility of subsequent panic attacks. A panic attack is an abrupt period of intense fear and discomfort that reaches its peak within minutes. Experiencing one has as its main consequence the development of maladaptive behaviors, often related to the need to avoid further episodes. Panic Disorder sometimes occurs in comorbidity with Agoraphobia (fear or exaggerated anxiety in contexts in which the person believes that escape or getting help may be impossible, very difficult or embarrassing, should a panic attack occur).  Generalized Anxiety Disorder Generalized Anxiety Disorder is characterized by persistent, excessive and disproportionate anxiety and worry about various aspects of life that are seen as difficult to control. There can be several manifestations of this type of condition: agitation and nervousness;/ easy fatigue;/ concentration difficulties;/ irritability;/ muscle tension;/ insomnia;/",
        "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis can be quite difficult. A medical examination is essential to rule out the presence of a real physical illness that is the basis for the symptoms. Confirmation of the condition depends on the presence of the internationally defined anxiety criteria.",
        "Treatment": "We must not forget that anxiety is a universal phenomenon, which is part of life. Often, small changes in daily life or habits can reduce or even eliminate anxious reactions. It can be helpful to adopt simple daily habits that help reduce anxiety. Examples include relaxation and meditation techniques, good time management and organization, or regular and effective communication with others (both at work and at home). Getting a good night's sleep is also very important. Sometimes it may be necessary to use medications, which should always be prescribed by a doctor. This type of treatment is usually long-term and must be carefully monitored. In some cases, drug use can be complemented with psychiatric support. Self-medication should always be avoided.",
        "Prevention": "There are some strategies that can help prevent anxiety attacks and alleviate symptoms: Relaxation techniques: for example, the deep diaphragmatic breathing technique helps to reduce heart rate, blood pressure and deal with stress, allowing you to reach a calming state of relaxation. Other techniques such as guided imagery (imagining a relaxing garden or your favorite beach) are easy-to-use techniques that are within everyone's reach and contribute to stress relief.;/ Mindfulness, meditation and yoga: increase the capacity for self-control and self-knowledge, reducing stress associated with anxiety attacks and a greater capacity to appreciate what brings happiness and well-being.;/ Exercise, a healthy diet and rest: these should always be part of your daily life, but they are particularly important for those who suffer from anxiety. Exercise reduces stress-related hormones and promotes overall health and well-being. Foods containing caffeine or alcohol should be avoided in your daily diet, and foods rich in omega-3 should be preferred. Lack of rest and restful sleep also promote stress.;/ Self-knowledge - learning to identify what causes anxiety attacks is the most effective way to avoid them.

    "Appendicitis": {
        "What is it?": "Appendicitis is an inflammation of the inner lining of the appendix, a small structure located in the first part of the large intestine, on the right side of the abdomen. It is a relatively common process that is accompanied by very diverse and sometimes misleading manifestations that simulate other clinical conditions, which implies a delay in diagnosis. Appendicitis occurs most frequently between the ages of 10 and 30, with a slight predominance in males and can have a mortality rate of 0.25%. Acute appendicitis is the main cause of urgent abdominal surgery in pediatric age. If left untreated, it can be associated with several complications, such as perforation of the appendix or septicemia (generalized infection).",
        "Symptoms": "In appendicitis, the most common condition is the presence of loss of appetite, abdominal pain around the navel followed by nausea. The pain tends to move to the lower right region of the abdomen and is accompanied by vomiting. This condition is present in around 50% of cases. Diarrhea or constipation may also occur. In the initial stages, fever is not present. Symptoms usually last less than 48 hours but can be more extensive in older people or when perforation occurs. However, appendicitis can simulate other diseases such as a urinary tract infection, renal colic, gastritis or a gynecological problem.",
        "Causes": "Appendicitis is caused by obstruction of the appendix, causing inflammation, congestion, insufficient arterial blood supply with consequent necrosis and potential perforation. This obstruction may be associated with inflammatory bowel disease, infections, tuberculosis, parasites, foreign bodies, neoplasms or the formation of fecaliths (accumulation of fecal material).",
        "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis is not based solely on a sign, symptom or examination. Since appendicitis is a potentially serious disease, it is essential that this identification is correct in order to avoid unnecessary surgery and other complications. A medical examination, as always, is very important. In this case, since appendicitis can simulate several pathologies, this study is even more relevant. Blood and urine tests, an MRI, CT scan and ultrasound are often used. As some results can take time, sometimes the diagnosis requires exploratory surgery, especially in cases where there is a strong suspicion and there is a risk of perforation.",
        "Treatment": "Surgery (appendectomy) remains the only curative treatment. The ideal time for intervention depends on the stage of the disease and sometimes it may be necessary to wait. For example, if there is an abscess, it will be important to pre-treat it with intravenous antibiotics and only then proceed with the operation.",
        "Prevention": "There are studies that suggest that the risk of appendicitis is lower in countries with diets richer in fiber. One possible reason is its effect on the stool, making it softer and thus making it more difficult for the appendix to become obstructed. Fiber is found in foods such as cereals, bread, rice, pasta, root vegetables such as carrots, and fruit. Medscape Reference, October 2012 Ebell, M. H. Diagnosis of Appendicitis: Part I.

    "Application of plasma rich in growth factors": {
        "What is it?": "Platelets are cells in our blood system. Growth factors are proteins contained in platelets, involved in the regulation of various organic processes, namely, inflammation, coagulation, healing, cell differentiation and proliferation.",
        "Applications": "Since these proteins regulate the above-mentioned mechanisms, their use is indicated in pathological processes in which it is necessary to stimulate the healing process, cell proliferation and regeneration, and to control the inflammatory process. They can therefore be applied in situations such as: muscle and muscle-tendon tears;/ ligament ruptures;;/ joint pathology with repetitive episodes of inflammation;;/ joint pathology with cartilaginous and osteocartilaginous defects (recent and chronic injuries-arthrosis);;/ delayed consolidation or non-consolidation of fractures.;/",
        "Obtaining and administering": "They are obtained from a patient's own blood collection. This blood is subsequently prepared by centrifugation in order to obtain the fraction containing platelets. These are subjected to a chemical process with the aim of achieving a plasma rich in growth factors. This plasma is then administered by a simple injection into the location where the pathology to be treated is located (for example, infiltrate in the knee). This procedure can be performed on an outpatient basis or in the surgical center, as an adjuvant to the surgery performed.",
        "Associated risks": "The growth factors are obtained from the patient's own blood, so there is no risk of disease transmission through this route. The entire technique is carried out in strict compliance with aseptic measures, in order to minimize the risk of infection.",

    "Sleep apnea": {
        "What is it?": "Sleep apnea syndrome can often begin with snoring, with 90% of those who suffer from this syndrome snoring. Snoring is the result of a sound caused by the vibration of the palate and the walls of the pharynx. Snoring is not only a nuisance from a marital and social point of view, but can also be the initial phase of sleep apnea syndrome, with 90% of those who suffer from this syndrome snoring. Habitual annoying snoring is often the beginning of an illness with long-term health consequences. About 80% of people who snore have obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). This syndrome affects between 9% and 24% of the adult population, men over 40 years of age, postmenopausal women and children (2%). It is estimated that one million Portuguese people suffer from this pathology. Which is still responsible for more than 100,000 traffic accidents per year, due to patients falling asleep at the wheel.",
        "Symptoms": "Sleep apnea is a sleep-related respiratory disorder, more severe than simple snoring, and consists of the cessation of respiratory flow during sleep for more than 10 seconds and more than five times per hour due to collapse of the upper airway. Its direct consequence is a change in the sleep pattern, in which there is an inability to reach the deep phases, those that allow physical and mental rest. This way, the patient does not feel restored in the morning. You may feel drowsy during the day, whether at work, driving or doing other simple daily activities. You may also have a headache, irritability and mood changes. In the most serious situations, there may be intellectual deterioration, attention, memory and reasoning as well as sexual impotence. Incorrect oxygenation of the blood that occurs during the night leads to serious problems such as increased cardiac work, high blood pressure, cardiac arrhythmias, a greater risk of acute myocardial infarction and hormonal changes.",
        "Causes": "Most people with sleep apnea syndrome have changes in the pharynx, with obstruction of the airway at some level between the epiglottis and the nasal cavities, often associated with excessive weight gain and other risk factors. Fatigue, drowsiness, decreased libido and a higher incidence of cardiovascular problems are situations frequently associated with this clinical condition.",
        "Diagnosis": "Doctors have a set of tools at their disposal to help diagnose and treat sleep apnea, such as complementary endoscopic exams, nocturnal sleep polygraphic studies and, if necessary, surgery to treat snoring. In the case of intense snoring or suspected sleep apnea, the patient should be referred to a specialist consultation, where the diagnosis is confirmed and treatment is planned. Some questions are asked about how easy it is to fall asleep in everyday situations. Through an objective examination, it is possible to identify anatomical changes and plan a treatment. When OSA is suspected, a polysomnographic sleep study should be performed, an examination that evaluates several parameters, allowing the diagnosis to be confirmed.",
        "Treatment": "There are currently a number of treatment options for sleep apnea syndrome, although the first step should always be to correct risk factors such as obesity, drinking alcohol at night, smoking, gastroesophageal reflux, taking certain medications and sleeping on your back. The most standard medical treatment involves wearing a device at night that increases pressure in the upper airways, thereby preventing apnea. This has the advantage of being effective in almost all patients, but it can be uncomfortable and must be worn permanently. Surgical treatments are diverse and must be adapted to the changes found in the patient, particularly nasal, pharyngeal and palatal, tongue and craniofacial anomalies. They have the advantage of correcting the problem without the permanent use of devices. They can be minimally invasive, such as radiofrequency or laser intervention, or, if necessary, more traditional, such as nasal, palatal and base of the tongue surgery.",
        "Prevention": "Some risk factors can be avoided, such as smoking and the use of muscle relaxant drugs, alcohol or sedatives. 80% of the population with this disease is underdiagnosed.

    "Aquablacao": {
        "What is it?": "Aquablation is the latest treatment for Benign Prostate Hyperplasia (BPH), based on a high-pressure water jet with millimeter precision. It manages to destroy the prostate tissue that compresses the urethra, completely relieving the patient's obstructive symptoms caused by BPH, preserving sexual function, namely ejaculation, as well as urinary continence.",
        "Advantages and Benefits": "For years, to solve this problem, classical, endoscopic, laparoscopic, laser and excision surgery techniques were used, with good results. However, in all these methods, among other aspects, some form of thermal energy is used, which ends up causing changes in sexual function, in addition to the need for a few days of hospitalization.",
        "Methodology": "The surgical procedure is controlled and performed by an ultrasound-guided robotic system - Aquabeam\u00ae. The surgeon controls the entire procedure through ultrasound and the visual image of the cystoscopy in real time, planning the treatment in a personalized way and delimiting the prostate tissue to be removed by the robot, in an automated way. The assessment of all prostate tissue to be removed is initially carried out by the surgeon. Once the information is transmitted, the removal of the prostate tissue is then carried out with the support of a robotic arm. Aquablation (Aquablation) is a quick and very safe procedure. At the end, the patient has a catheter in the bladder, which is removed the following day, and is discharged after 24 hours of hospitalization.",
        "Indications": "The ideal cases are prostates with volumes greater than 40 grams to very large volumes and with medium lobes.",
        "Care to be taken": "It is advisable to avoid exertion in the first week after the operation. If you are taking anticoagulants, you should stop a few days before the procedure, always with the advice of your doctor. 0% incontinence and preservation of sexual function are two advantages of aquablation.

    "Arrhythmias": {
        "What are they?": "Heart rhythm disorders (arrhythmias) occur when the heart's electrical impulses that coordinate the heartbeat are not sent properly, causing the heart to beat too fast (tachycardia), too slow (bradycardia) or irregularly. The heart is a muscular organ with four chambers designed to work continuously and efficiently throughout life. The muscular walls of each chamber contract in a precise sequence and, during each beat, expel the largest quantity of blood with the least possible effort. These contractions of the heart's muscular fibers are controlled by electrical discharges that travel through the heart following different trajectories at a specific speed. The resting heart rate is 60 to 100 beats per minute. Many young adults have lower heart rates, especially if they are in good physical condition. Variations in these frequencies are normal and can result from exercise, inactivity, pain, anxiety, among other causes. Only when the rhythm is inappropriately fast or slow, or when electrical impulses follow anomalous pathways, is the heart considered to have an abnormal rhythm (arrhythmia). Furthermore, this condition is often harmless, in the sense that everyone can experience irregular heartbeats occasionally. However, arrhythmias can be uncomfortable and sometimes life-threatening. During a change in heart rhythm, the heart may not be able to pump enough blood to the body, which can cause damage to the brain, heart, and other organs. The majority affect individuals over 60 years of age, given the presence of heart disease and other health problems that can be associated with arrhythmias. Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia and affects around 1% of people under 55 years of age. This type increases in frequency throughout life, especially between the ages of 65 and 80. Considering the high mortality rate from cerebrovascular accident (CVA) in Portugal and assuming that atrial fibrillation accounts for 15% of ischemic strokes, it is understood that it is important to control this arrhythmia as a way of preventing the occurrence of stroke.",
        "Symptoms": "Some types of arrhythmias cause few or no symptoms, but can cause problems. Others never cause any major problems, but do cause symptoms. When arrhythmias affect the heart's ability to pump blood, they can cause nausea, dizziness, and fainting. Those that cause these symptoms require immediate attention. Other possible symptoms include palpitations, chest pain, and difficulty breathing. It is important to see a doctor if these symptoms appear suddenly or occur frequently.",
        "Causes": "An arrhythmia can occur when the electrical signals that control the heartbeat are delayed or blocked or if a structure in the heart stops producing electrical signals. Each type has its own cause. Mild symptoms may arise due to excessive alcohol or tobacco consumption, stress or exercise. Hyperactivity, thyroid disease, and some medications, especially those used to treat lung disease and hypertension, can also change heart rate and rhythm. Cocaine and amphetamines, some over-the-counter medications, and caffeine may also be responsible for arrhythmias. Its most frequent cause is heart disease, especially coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, high blood pressure, valve malfunction and heart failure. Some congenital heart pathologies also cause them. Diabetes, obesity and sleep apnea may also be involved in this type of change. An electric shock can be the trigger for an arrhythmia. However, sometimes they arise without a detectable cause.",
        "Diagnosis": "Description of symptoms almost always makes it possible to make a provisional diagnosis and determine their severity. Additional tests are usually needed to determine exactly the nature of the disease. The most important are: electrocardiogram; a portable monitor (Holter) that allows recording for 24 hours; echocardiogram; invasive electrophysiological studies, in which a catheter is introduced intravenously into the heart; and coronary angiography.",
        "Treatment": "Drug administration is very useful in case of intolerable symptoms or when they pose a risk. There is no single medicine that cures all arrhythmias in everyone. Sometimes you need to try several treatments until you find one that suits you. Antiarrhythmic drugs can also produce side effects and worsen or even cause arrhythmias. Artificial pacemakers, electronic devices that act in place of a natural pacemaker, program themselves to imitate the heart's normal sequence. They are usually implanted under the skin of the chest and have cables that reach the heart. These units currently last between eight and 10 years. Sometimes, an electrical shock to the heart can stop an abnormal rhythm and restore it to normal. This is called cardioversion, electroversion, or defibrillation. Some types of arrhythmias can be corrected through surgery or other invasive procedures. For example, arrhythmias caused by coronary artery disease can be controlled through angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery. After an initial evaluation, your doctor will determine the right treatment for each patient.",
        "Prevention": "Since many arrhythmias are associated with heart disease, it is important to keep the heart healthy through a balanced diet, regular exercise, controlling blood pressure and cholesterol, not smoking and reducing alcohol and coffee consumption. Controlling anxiety and stress is also very important.

    "Hypotension": {
        "What is it?": "It is thanks to the heart that blood circulates throughout our body through blood vessels. Blood pressure is the force exerted on the walls of the arteries by the blood that is pumped. There are several factors that can influence blood pressure, such as physical exercise, which causes an increase, or exposure to heat, which lowers it. Hypotension, or low blood pressure, means that the pressure at which the blood circulates is lower than what would be considered normal. According to the Portuguese Cardiology Foundation, blood pressure is considered normal when the minimum levels are up to 80 and the maximum levels are up to 120. However, hypotension ends up being a somewhat relative term, as blood pressure levels vary according to individual characteristics and what is considered low for one person may not be low for another, being worrying when it has a negative impact on the person. .",
        "Symptoms": "In general, chronic hypotension is considered worrisome if it causes symptoms such as: Dizziness when sitting or standing up;/ Imbalance;/ Nausea;/ Fainting;/ Dehydration and an abnormal feeling of thirst;/ Difficulty concentrating;/ Blurred vision;/ Pale, cold, clammy skin;/ Rapid and shallow breathing;/ Fatigue;/ Depression;/ Weakness;/",
        "Causes": "Low blood pressure can occur in the following cases: Pregnancy, particularly in the first 24 weeks;/ Significant blood loss;/ Certain medications, such as diuretics or drugs to treat high blood pressure, heart disease, Parkinson's disease, depression, or erectile dysfunction;/ Heart problems, such as bradycardia, heart valve problems, heart attack (myocardial infarction) or heart failure;/ Endocrine problems, such as hypothyroidism or diabetes;/ Severe infection (septic shock);/ Allergic reaction (anaphylaxis);/ Nutritional deficiencies, such as vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency, as they can cause anemia;/ Emotional stress, fear, insecurity or pain;/ Dehydration, which reduces blood volume;/ Body's reaction to heat;/",
        "Diagnosis": "To facilitate diagnosis, keep a diary of your symptoms and what you were doing at the time they occurred. Assessment of blood pressure levels is done by measuring blood pressure using a digital or manual sphygmomanometer.",
        "Treatment": "When a person does not present symptoms associated with hypotension or if these are not significant, treatment is not necessary. If, on the other hand, signs that may indicate the presence of a problem appear, the patient should consult their doctor. Treatment for hypotension will depend on the factor that is causing it. For example, if its origin is medication, the solution may be to adjust the dose or if it is due to a stomach ulcer, treating it can also treat hypotension. If a reason cannot be found that could be associated with low blood pressure, medication may be prescribed to raise it. Increasing fluid and salt intake may improve symptoms of hypotension. It is, however, important to emphasize that none of these measures should be adopted without medical advice.",
        "Prevention": "To prevent blood pressure levels from falling too low, simply adopt some simple lifestyle habits, such as: Stand up and sit down slowly;/ Raise the head of the bed by about 15 cm;/ Eat small meals frequently;/ Increase water intake;/ Avoid spending long periods standing or sitting without moving;/ Do not change position or posture suddenly;/ Avoid excessive alcohol or caffeinated beverage intake late in the day;/ American Heart Association, maio de 2019 Better Health Channel, May 2019 Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Paulista de Cardiologia, May 2019 Medical News Today, May 2019 National Health Service, May 2019 About us;/ Events;/ Clients and Companions;/ News;/ CUF Academic Center;/ Partnerships;/ Contacts;/ Frequently Asked Questions;/ Join us;/ Virtual Visit;/ English version;/ My CUF;/ Access Solutions and Health Plans;/ Facebook;/ Facebook Instagram;/ Instagram LinkedInCreated with Sketch.;/ LinkedIn Youtube;/ Youtube award4;/ award4 certification1;/ certification1 certification2;/ certification2 certification3;/ certification3 Complaints and compliments;/ Complaints and compliments Privacy and Cookies Policy;/ Terms and Conditions;/ Whistleblower Channel;/ \u00a9 CUF 2024 All rights reserved Start;/ Health A-Z: Diseases, Symptoms and Treatments;/"

    "Hypothyroidism": {
        "What is it?": "Hypothyroidism is a decrease in the production of thyroid hormones and results in changes in the regulation of metabolism and the use of energy by the body. It is the most common functional thyroid disease and reflects deficient hormone production. It is usually caused by primary thyroid failure, but it can also result from decreased TSH stimulation of the thyroid (central or secondary hypothyroidism). Autoimmune thyroiditis, also called Hashimoto's thyroiditis or chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, is the leading cause of hypothyroidism (70%) and is associated with high titers of anti-thyroid antibodies.",
        "Symptoms": "The clinical manifestation is gradual and non-specific, so diagnosis is often delayed. Symptoms are varied and include fatigue, dry skin, hair loss and brittleness, slight weight gain, dull complexion, intolerance to cold, irritability, forgetfulness, depression, menstrual irregularities and even infertility.",
        "Causes": "Hypothyroidism results from insufficient hormone production by the thyroid gland. There are several causes: Autoimmune diseases: Hashimoto's disease or Hashimoto's thyroiditis. It is the most common cause of hypothyroidism. It is an autoimmune disease characterized by a disorder of the immune system in which antibodies attack the cells of the thyroid gland itself, causing inflammation and interfering with the ability to produce hormones;;/ Exaggerated response to hyperthyroidism treatment: Treatment of hyperthyroidism (a condition characterized by excess production of thyroid hormones) with radioactive iodine and medications can sometimes exceed normal levels and cause hypothyroidism.;/ Thyroid surgery: total or partial removal of the thyroid can lead to a decrease in hormone production that needs to be compensated for with medication.;/ Radiation therapy: Radiation treatments for head and neck tumors can affect thyroid hormone production.;/ Medications: Some drugs such as lithium can cause hypothyroidism.;/ Other less common conditions can also cause hypothyroidism: congenital disease, pituitary disease, pregnancy, iodine deficiency.;/",
        "Diagnosis": "In the presence of a clinical picture suggestive of hypothyroidism such as fatigue, dry skin, constipation and weight gain, tests will be prescribed to determine the diagnosis of this condition. Laboratory studies include the measurement of TSH, which is the thyroid-stimulating hormone, and the levels of thyroxine (t4)\u00a0 and triiodothyronine (t3), which are the hormones produced in the thyroid gland. An increase in TSH means that there is an effort by the body to force the production of hormones and is a response to the decrease in levels of these in circulation. Other tests may be necessary to diagnose the causes of the disease, namely the investigation and measurement of antithyroid antibodies.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment involves hormone replacement therapy with levothyroxine, which must be taken daily and on an empty stomach, that is, approximately 20 to 30 minutes before a meal. The dose is individualized according to age, weight and associated pathologies. It may take around six months for the clinical situation to stabilize. As in most cases hypothyroidism is permanent, treatment and follow-up are for the rest of your life.",
        "Prevention": "There is no way to prevent it, but people at higher risk of hypothyroidism (for example, women during pregnancy) should consult their doctor about the need for iodine supplements. Screening for hypothyroidism is only indicated in symptomatic patients, and may eventually be done in people at risk: history of autoimmune disease;/ previous radiation treatment to the head or neck;/ goiter;/ family history of thyroid problems;/ use of medications known to affect thyroid function;/ These people may be tested for early signs of the disease. If the results are positive, they should take steps to prevent the disease from progressing. There is no evidence that a specific diet prevents hypothyroidism, and there is no way to prevent it.

    "Hypotonia": {
        "What is it?": "Hypotonia is defined as a decrease in resistance to passive movement. It is easily recognized when observing the newborn, being one of the most frequent signs of illness in this age group. It is a nonspecific clinical sign, but often associated with serious illness, so early diagnosis is important to establish appropriate therapy, establish prognosis and offer genetic counseling. The wide variety of underlying causes and corresponding complementary tests highlights the importance of a methodical and systematic investigation. We speak of hypotonia when there is a reduction in muscle tone. It is a symptom and not a disease in itself. Healthy muscles are never completely relaxed. There is always some degree of tension and stiffness that translates into resistance to movement. During sleep, muscle tone is lower. Hypotonia is different from muscle weakness, although it is sometimes difficult to distinguish the two conditions, which can even occur in the same patient. However, hypotonia is more common in newborns or children. It can also occur in later stages of life.",
        "Symptoms": "Signs include little or no control of the neck muscles, allowing the head to droop, a very limp body when picked up, an inability to bear any weight on the legs or shoulders, arms and legs hanging down at the sides of the body instead of having a normal flexion at the elbows, knees and heels, difficulty sucking and swallowing and a weak cry. Development in these children is slower, taking longer until they are able to crawl, walk and feed themselves. In adults, hypotonia translates into loss of balance with frequent falls, difficulty in getting up from a sitting or lying position, an unusually high degree of flexibility in the heels, knees and elbows, difficulty in reaching or lifting an object.",
        "Causes": "It can result from a deficit of oxygen or cerebral irrigation, these being the most common causes in newborns;;/ Hypotonia appears associated with many cases of cerebral palsy;;/ Premature newborns, born before 37 weeks, experience hypotonia because their muscle tone is not yet fully developed:;/ Many cases result from an interruption in signals transmitted to muscles from nerves. This may occur at the level of the brain or spinal cord (central hypotonia), or be the result of more peripheral nerve damage (peripheral hypotonia). Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy is the main cause of in newborns. Central causes of hypotonia (acute or chronic) are more common in the neonatal period (60-80%) than peripheral causes (20-40%), with the prognosis generally being more serious in the latter. In the neonatal period, the main causes are spinal muscular atrophy type I, congenital myotonic dystrophy and congenital myopathies.;/ But the list of diseases that can cause it is very long. In babies and children the following are found: cerebral palsy, brain and spinal cord injuries, meningitis, encephalitis, Down syndrome, Tay-Sachs syndrome, congenital hypothyroidism, spinal muscular atrophy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, myasthenia gravis, dystrophy muscle, Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. In older age, the most common causes are multiple sclerosis and motor neuron diseases.",
        "Diagnosis": "Clinical observation is essential to try to discover the underlying cause. As a rule, laboratory tests, imaging studies such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalogram, electromyography, and genetic studies are necessary. More specific tests such as muscle biopsies or nerve conduction studies may also be requested. It is important to emphasize that, in some cases, the origin of the condition is not detected, even with exhaustive investigation.",
        "Treatment": "Depending on its cause, hypotonia may improve, stabilize or worsen over time. In the case of prematurity, hypotonia tends to improve as the child develops. In many other situations, it is not treatable, so the approach involves physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy. Physiotherapy improves posture and motor coordination and helps to strengthen the muscles around the joints, providing greater stability.",
        "Prevention": "Considering that hypotonia can have such diverse causes, it is difficult to say that it can be prevented, especially with regard to the genetic diseases associated with it. In the case of congenital anomalies related to pregnancy, all precautions to have a healthy pregnancy can be useful in preventing this and other clinical conditions. Correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment of the underlying disease can also prevent or minimize hypotonia.

    "Hirsutism": {
        "What is it?": "It is defined as the presence of hair in women, in anatomical areas characteristic of male distribution. Depending on the cause, hirsutism may manifest as an isolated complaint or accompanied by other signs of hyperandrogyny (acne, seborrhea, baldness), virilization (clitoral hypertrophy, increased muscle mass, changes in voice tone), menstrual disorders and/or infertility or even metabolic changes. It results from the action of androgens (male sex hormones) circulating on the skin. This occurs due to the presence and activity of enzymes capable of making substances with androgenic properties available inside the pilosebaceous follicle. Hirsutism is usually the result of medical conditions that are not serious. However, it can sometimes be a sign of a serious medical condition and this should be taken into account when evaluating the condition. Most women seek treatment for cosmetic reasons, as excess hairiness clashes with Western cultural standards and is therefore a source of discomfort and reduced self-esteem. Since the pattern of hair distribution varies from woman to woman, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between variations of normality and hirsutism.",
        "Symptoms": "In addition to the distribution of hair with masculine characteristics, women may present typical male baldness, a deep voice, breast atrophy, increased muscle mass and clitoral hypertrophy.",
        "Causes": "Hirsutism can result from three categories: Excess androgens produced by the ovaries and/or adrenal glands;;/ Increased skin sensitivity to circulating androgens;;/ Situations involving secondary changes in androgen transport and/or metabolism.;/ The first case includes polycystic ovary syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Cushing's syndrome and tumors of the ovaries or adrenal glands, which produce androgens. The second group is \u201cidiopathic\u201d, characterized by isolated hirsutism in the presence of regular menstrual cycles. The third group includes situations such as thyroid disease, hyperprolactinemia, use of drugs (phenothiazines, danazol, metyrapone, cyclosporine, among others) that can secondarily lead to this condition. Polycystic ovary syndrome is the most common cause of hirsutism of glandular origin. Its prevalence in women of reproductive age varies between 4% and 8% and is associated with hirsutism, oligo/amenorrhea (reduced or absent menstrual period) and infertility. Symptoms appear around puberty and progress over time. A significant number of patients are obese and in 30% to 60% of cases, especially in obese patients, insulin resistance occurs. These patients have a higher risk of developing impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes mellitus. Other dermatological manifestations such as acne and baldness are observed in a smaller number of individuals. Although the cause of this syndrome is unknown, the occurrence of a familial pattern suggests a genetic component of the disease.",
        "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis depends on the cause. For polycystic ovary syndrome, the criteria include at least two of the following three: Ovulatory dysfunction;;/ Evidence of clinical (signs and symptoms) or laboratory (increased serum androgen concentrations) hyperandrogynism;;/ Polycystic appearance of the ovaries on ultrasound.;/ Idiopathic hirsutism is defined by the presence of isolated hirsutism, with regular menstrual and ovulatory cycles and preserved fertility. As a rule, diagnosis involves laboratory evaluation. A pregnancy test, total testosterone and free testosterone levels, as well as other hormones, must be performed.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment should aim to control obesity and insulin resistance, acne, menstrual irregularities, infertility and metabolic complications. It is important to make lifestyle changes for at least six months before starting specific treatment for infertility. Metformin helps reduce insulin resistance, reduces the production of male sex hormones and improves fertility. Oral contraceptives are first-line drugs because they inhibit the production of ovarian androgens, improve hirsutism and acne and protect the endometrium, as well as progesterone, although they do not normalize male sex hormone levels or prevent pregnancy. Antiandrogens such as spironolactone or cyproterone acetate reduce the levels of male sex hormones, responsible for the manifestations of hirsutism.",
        "Prevention": "Hirsutism cannot be prevented. When it occurs in the context of polycystic ovary syndrome, it is important to control obesity and prevent insulin resistance.

    "Hysterectomy": {
        "What is it?": "Hysterectomy involves the surgical removal of the uterus. Women who undergo this procedure stop menstruating and are also unable to get pregnant. Depending on the reason for the surgery, hysterectomy may be associated with adnexectomy, that is, the removal of the ovaries and fallopian tubes. If the ovaries are also removed, in addition to stopping menstruating, the woman may enter menopause earlier - surgical menopause. There are three types of hysterectomy: Total: consists of removing the uterus and cervix.;/ Supracervical: the upper part of the uterus is removed, but the cervix is \u200b\u200bpreserved.;/ Radical: removal of the uterus and cervix, as well as surrounding structures such as part of the vagina and lymph nodes.;/  The surgery is most frequently performed on women between the ages of 40 and 50.",
        "Who is it for?": "Hysterectomy is usually performed as a form of surgical treatment for diseases that affect the female reproductive system and that do not benefit from other forms of medical treatment: Menorrhagia (menstruation with heavy and prolonged bleeding);/ Chronic pelvic pain;/ Fibroids (benign tumor that grows in the tissue of the uterus);/ Endometriosis;/ Recurrent uterine polyps;/ Cancer of the ovaries, uterus, cervix or fallopian tubes;/ Uterine prolapse (when the uterus drops into the vaginal canal due to weakened muscles), causing urinary incontinence;/ Adenomyosis (growth of endometrial tissue inside the walls of the uterus);/ Hyperplasia (increased number of cells in the uterus);/",
        "How the procedure is performed": "A hysterectomy takes about one to three hours, but the length of the surgery depends on the size of the uterus, the physical condition of the patient, any other concomitant pathologies and the possible need to remove other organs. There are three surgical approaches to performing a hysterectomy: laparotomy, laparoscopy or vaginally, and the choice of surgical approach depends on the reason for the surgery. Alaparotomy (or abdominal hysterectomy) consists of removing the uterus from an incision in the abdomen. This type of approach is more common in cases of cancer, when the uterus is enlarged or when there is also disease that has spread to other pelvic areas. When compared to vaginal hysterectomy or laparoscopy, abdominal hysterectomy involves a longer recovery period and is associated with a greater risk of complications such as infection, blood loss, risk of pulmonary embolism, etc. In the laparoscopic procedure, a laparoscope (a small tube with a video camera) is inserted into the abdomen through a small incision. Several other small incisions are made for the insertion of other surgical instruments. The uterus is removed through these small incisions made in the abdomen or through the vagina. Laparoscopy can also be done robotically. Compared to laparotomy, laparoscopy involves less recovery time and is associated with a lower risk of complications. Vaginal hysterectomy is considered the preferred approach, as it is the least invasive and has a shorter recovery period and less risk of complications. In this procedure, the uterus is removed through an incision at the top of the vagina.",
        "Recovery and complications": "Hysterectomy offers a greater quality of life to women who suffer from conditions that permanently affect the reproductive system, however, it is not reversible, the recovery period is long (between four to six weeks) and, like any other surgery, it involves risks and side effects, such as: Thrombosis (blood clots);/ Infection;/ Blood loss;/ Intestinal occlusion;/ Urinary tract injury;/ Adverse reaction to anesthesia;/ Incontinence;/ Decreased libido;/ Prolapso vaginal;/",
        "What to Expect After a Hysterectomy": "Hysterectomy permanently changes some aspects of a woman's life. In addition to stopping menstruating, the patient may enter menopause earlier than normal if the ovaries are also removed (surgical menopause).

    "Hpv human papillomavirus": {
        "What is it?": "HPV, or Human Papilloma Virus, is responsible for a high number of infections, which are most often asymptomatic and regress spontaneously. This is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections worldwide. HPV can lead to benign lesions, such as warts, condylomas and benign lesions of the oropharynx, and, in relatively rare situations, can progress to cancer, with special emphasis on cervical cancer. As the name suggests, HPV is a common virus in humans, responsible for the formation of lesions called papillomas. There are different types of HPV; some types can infect the anogenital area, while others infect areas such as the feet or hands, where they can lead to warts or \u201cblackheads.\u201d Viruses that infect the anogenital area can be transmitted\u00a0during vaginal, oral, or anal sex, or during intimate skin-to-skin contact between people where at least one person is infected. In the sexually active population, 50 to 80% of individuals acquire HPV infection at some point in their lives, although in the vast majority of cases there is no progression to symptomatic disease. Cervical cancer, the second most common type of cancer in women worldwide, is the most relevant disease associated with HPV infection, especially when it is not detected early, progressing to invasive forms. In fact, approximately 100% of cervical cancer cases are related to HPV infection. Progression to cervical cancer is very slow and generally asymptomatic. Persistent HPV infection has a prolonged latency period (years or decades between the onset of infection and the development of tumors) passing through several phases. To date, there are more than 200 types of HPV identified, of which around 40 preferentially infect the anogenital system: vulva, vagina, cervix, penis and perianal areas. Regarding cervical cancer, existing national data points to around 1,000 new cases every year, with an incidence rate of 20.95/100,000 women, for all ages. Total mortality from cervical cancer in Portugal is 4.5/100,000 women over 15 years of age. HPV can also be associated with cancer of the vulva, penis and anus, among others.",
        "Symptoms": "HPV generally causes a silent infection in which many of those infected have no symptoms or signs. Sometimes warts are present but not visible because they are located on an internal part of the body, or because they are very small. Anogenital warts, also called condylomas, can appear as small, raised, cauliflower-like lesions, or they can be flat. In women, warts can appear on the vulva, cervix, thighs, anus, rectum, or urethra. HPV does not appear to affect the ability to get pregnant. In very rare situations, HPV can lodge in the oropharynx of an infected child during birth. During pregnancy, the number and size of warts may increase, but they usually decrease after giving birth.",
        "Causes": "Genital HPV infections are generally transmitted sexually, through direct contact with the skin or mucosa, and, more rarely, during childbirth. Some cases of transmission by orogenital contact have also been described. Although many women become infected with HPV, the infection rarely progresses to cancer. Some factors have been identified that increase the risk of persistent HPV infection and progression to cancer: some types of virus (HPV 16 and HPV 18); co-infection with various immunodeficiencies; early onset of sexual activity; multiple sexual partners; multiple births; genetic predisposition; smoking habits; co-infection with other sexually transmitted microorganisms (mainly Herpes Simplex virus type 2 and Chlamydia trachomatis). Some studies suggest that prolonged use of oral contraceptives may be another risk factor for progression to cervical cancer.",
        "Diagnosis": "Regularly performing the Pap test helps identify early changes in colon cells, allowing for treatment and surveillance. This routine cytological test is an important screening tool, as there is no way to know in advance which person the virus will persist and develop into cancer. If these changes are not identified early, there is the possibility of them developing into more serious injuries and, eventually, cancer. The HPV-DNA test, which enables the genetic characterization of the virus, is available in Portugal, but is not part of regular screening. This more specific test can be recommended in situations of colon changes detected by the screening test.",
        "Treatment": "There is no known cure for HPV infections, but the vast majority of people have an adequate immune system and can eliminate the infection from their bodies. Although a high percentage of sexually active people are infected with HPV, only a small proportion will develop cancer. Treatment involves applying a product to the lesions. Methods may include cryotherapy, electrocoagulation, laser or, very rarely, surgical excision. Sometimes warts can return after treatment, making it necessary to repeat the treatment.",
        "Prevention": "Preventing HPV infection depends, above all, on the behaviors adopted. It is important to know preventive measures and use them consistently, learn to recognize the signs and symptoms of sexually transmitted infections, their consequences and methods of transmission. Women should regularly undergo a gynecological examination and undergo colpocytology and/or HPV-DNA testing, if recommended and available, even if you have had the vaccine. The use of condoms is recommended to prevent all sexually transmitted infections. It is important to emphasize that areas of skin not covered by the condom are not protected. It is very important to talk to your partner about sexually transmitted infections and their prevention and to bear in mind that a partner's previous behaviors are also a risk factor, especially if they have had multiple previous partners. Vaccination is essential and should be done by women, in accordance with the National Vaccination Program, or as recommended by a doctor. There are currently two vaccines that offer protection against types 16 and 18, responsible for around 70% of cervical cancer cases. One of them also protects against types 6 and 11, responsible for around 90% of anogenital warts,\u00a0and, additionally, against types 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58, which provide extra protection against cervical cancers in plus 20%. Routine universal vaccination with the HPV vaccine applies to young people who turn ten years of age in the respective calendar year, in two doses. Vaccination does not require any prior analytical test to be carried out.

    "Jaundice": {
        "What is it?": "Jaundice is the yellowing of the sclera (i.e. the white surface of the eye) and the skin. Jaundice is not a disease in itself, but rather a manifestation of a disease. Its degree is assessed by measuring the amount of a substance called bilirubin in the blood.",
        "Symptoms": "Jaundice can either appear suddenly or develop slowly. The main signs and symptoms of jaundice include: yellow sclera and skin, darker urine, normal or whitish stools, depending on the type of underlying disease.",
        "Causes": "Red blood cells degrade and have a limited lifespan, which is why they are renewed periodically, that is, when some end their lifespan they are replaced by others. This renewal involves the intervention of the liver, whose function is to clean part of the degradation products from red blood cells. From this renewal, a pigment called bilirubin appears, which when it accumulates in the blood causes jaundice. This buildup occurs when red blood cells break down more than normal or when the liver is not functioning normally. The main processes that can cause an increase in bilirubin in the blood and, consequently, jaundice are: Increased destruction of red blood cells, as in some types of anemia, namely hemolytic anemia;;/ Decreased liver conjugation capacity;;/ Decreased excretory capacity of the liver;/ Most of the time, lower conjugation capacity and liver excretion are associated. This is what happens in viral hepatitis, which is one of the most common causes of jaundice in children. When there are gallstones, the main defect is hepatic excretion. These different mechanisms determine the type of bilirubin that accumulates in the blood. The blood test measures total, direct and indirect bilirubin. Also the shade of jaundice can vary depending on the underlying disease.",
        "Diagnosis": "The presence of jaundice is detected by clinical examination and involves detailed medical investigation to identify its cause. In this context it is important to repeat that jaundice is not a disease in itself, but rather the visible manifestation of an underlying disease. After taking the patient's medical history and performing a physical examination, the doctor may request additional tests, starting with blood tests, which will indicate the amount of bilirubin and red blood cells present in the blood, as well as showing the functioning of the liver through specific liver function tests. Other tests may be performed, but they depend on the underlying cause of the jaundice. The tests to be requested initially are: blood count, liver function tests, virus screening and abdominal ultrasound.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment for jaundice depends on its cause. Therefore, only after diagnosing the disease causing jaundice can we treat the patient.

    "Neonatal jaundice": {
        "What is it?": "Jaundice is the yellowish discoloration of the sclerae (i.e. the white surface of the eye) and skin. It is usually due to physiological immaturity of the newborn, but it can also mean illness, which is why parents should always inform the baby's pediatrician. Jaundice originates from the degradation of red blood cells.\u00a0These blood cells are renewed periodically, that is, when some end their lifespan they are replaced by others. This renewal involves the intervention of the liver, whose function is to clean part of the degradation products from red blood cells. When the liver is immature, jaundice may appear in this physiological cycle, which is assessed by the quantification of a substance called bilirubin in the blood. In general terms, it can be stated that jaundice is more evident the higher the bilirubin value, hence the term hyperbilirubinemia. It should be noted that in black children, observing jaundice on the skin is more difficult due to the babies' natural color, which is why you should always pay attention to the color of the sclera.",
        "Causes": "In newborns, jaundice is in most cases physiological, or developmental, usually appearing on the 3rd day of life, as a result of the newborn's hepatic immaturity. Premature babies have a higher incidence of this type of jaundice, precisely because they are more immature. This jaundice, although not considered a disease, may require phototherapy. What determines the need for therapy is the level of bilirubin in the blood. Developmental jaundice usually resolves within 15 days of life. Another frequent cause of jaundice in the neonatal period is blood incompatibility between the mother and the newborn. Parents are familiar with the different blood types, as well as the RH factor. Incompatibilities can also arise between the blood of mother and child, leading to greater and earlier destruction of red blood cells, causing jaundice. Not all human blood is compatible with each other, and can cause defensive immunological reactions with the consequent production of antibodies. Other rare causes of jaundice in the neonatal period exist, generally associated with important diseases.",
        "Symptoms": "The main symptom is jaundice itself, but in cases of blood incompatibility, associated with major destruction of red blood cells, there may be paleness of the skin and mucous membranes due to associated anemia.",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of jaundice is clinical, as it is made by looking at the baby. But the exact value of bilirubin is determined by measuring it in the newborn's blood. However, there are devices that reliably measure values \u200b\u200btranscutaneously, so in most mild cases this method is sufficient.",
        "Treatment": "When there are excessive levels of bilirubin in the blood, the treatment is phototherapy. It is a treatment in which the baby's entire body surface, with the exception of the eyes, is exposed to a special fluorescent light whose characteristics reduce bilirubin in the blood and, therefore, jaundice. During this treatment, the eyes must be protected, as well as the baby must be offered more liquids. Popular beliefs about treating jaundice by placing the baby in the sun or giving water to drink from stones have no scientific basis.",
        "Prevention": "Blood incompatibility, specifically the RH factor, can and should be prevented by administering specific antibodies to the mother. ABO group incompatibilities are detected in the neonatal period, therefore prevention is not carried out. Developmental jaundice cannot be prevented.  Carotenemia is the name given to this condition which, despite being visually strange, is not dangerous.

    "Impetigo": {
        "What is it?": "Impetigo is a common skin infection and occurs mainly in children between 2 and 5 years old. However, anyone of any age can have impetigo, and adults often become infected through contact with children. Caused by bacteria, impetigo is very contagious and can be transmitted quickly within the family and at school.",
        "Symptoms of impetigo": "Impetigo can cause symptoms such as red, painful, itchy skin, swollen glands and, less commonly, fever or feeling unwell. Symptoms may vary depending on the type of impetigo:  It usually consists of an infection with Streptococcus pyogenes, although recent data have demonstrated more cases of Staphylococcus aureus as the cause of nonbullous impetigo. It is the most common type and evolves in different phases: Initially, only one or a few sores appear, often associated with itching;/ The wound \"bursts\" and the skin may appear red in that area;/ Glands located near the wound may become swollen.;/ Scabs form on wounds;/ The skin heals without scars forming (except when it is scratched or scratched);/  It is possible for the infection to spread to other areas of the body, going through the stages described above again. This is why early treatment is so important.  It is the least common type of impetigo and is caused exclusively by Staphylococcus aureus, consisting of a clinical situation that requires urgent medical advice. In this type of impetigo, blisters with liquid appear, but without redness in the surrounding skin, going through the following phases: Blisters appear that contain a cloudy or yellowish liquid (pus);/ The bubbles become softer and more transparent, eventually \"bursting\";/ Crusts form in areas where the blisters ruptured;/ The skin tends to heal without scarring.;/  Impetigo can appear on any area of \u200b\u200bthe body, although it is most common on exposed areas of skin, such as the face (around the nose and mouth) and hands. Bacteria are easily transmitted and new lesions can form in different locations from where the original infection formed.",
        "Causes": "Impetigo is caused by bacteria mainly Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus, which infect the skin through: Cortes;/ Scratches;/ Insect bites;/ Burns;/ Rash;/ Wounds;/  Impetigo can also appear on the skin of children who, for example, have had chickenpox or itchy eczema - by scratching the skin, a \"gateway\" for bacteria is created, and impetigo can develop. Sometimes impetigo also develops on intact skin. The bacteria that cause impetigo thrive in hot, humid places, which is why this infection is more common in places with this climate. The main way impetigo is transmitted is through skin-to-skin contact with someone who is infected. For example, contact sports \u2013 such as wrestling and football \u2013 carry a higher risk of transmitting impetigo. However, contagion can also occur indirectly, that is, through contact with surfaces, towels, sports equipment and clothing used by the person with impetigo. People with diabetes or who are immunocompromised are at greater risk of developing impetigo.",
        "Diagnosis": "Diagnosing impetigo involves observing the skin, particularly the characteristics of the rash. However, the attending physician or dermatologist can prescribe tests to help diagnose the problem or even to obtain more information to outline the most appropriate treatment plan. These may include, for example, laboratory analysis of pus taken from a blister or even skin so that the doctor can determine, for example, which type of bacteria is responsible for the infection. When the infection is spread throughout the body, blood tests may be needed. It is also important to determine whether impetigo developed after another skin problem, such as scabies. When impetigo continues to worsen or if recurrent episodes occur, your doctor may prescribe a skin or nasal swab to see if the bacteria present there are causing the impetigo episodes.",
        "Treatment of impetigo": "It is important to treat impetigo to prevent possible complications of the infection, such as the development of new lesions, the presence of blisters for several weeks - with treatment, impetigo can disappear within a few days (and is no longer contagious after about 24 to 48 hours), without treatment it can last for 2-4 weeks - or the spread of the infection to deeper layers of the skin, which can be serious. In addition, treatment can also reduce the risk of passing the infection on to other people. The first step in treating impetigo is to regularly remove the scabs using warm water and soap. Afterwards, an antibiotic ointment should be applied (ideally not prolonged or frequently on the same person, as it can contribute to the development of resistance to bacteria). Lastly, cover areas of skin with impetigo to help heal as well as prevent transmission. There are situations in which antibiotics may be used, such as: Topical treatment alone is not effective in resolving impetigo;/ Presence of multiple and/or recurrent lesions;/ Widespread lesions;/ Epidemiological context in the family or at school;/  Children with impetigo cannot go to school until the problem is cured or when the doctor determines that there is no longer a risk of contagion - it is an illness that requires school avoidance. All patients with impetigo must take care to avoid transmission to other people: Avoid direct skin-to-skin contact;/ Keep wounds and blisters covered with gauze and adhesive;/ Wash your hands after touching the lesions;/",
        "Prevention": "There are some measures that can be put into practice to prevent impetigo: Treat injuries (such as cuts or insect bites) as quickly as possible.;/ Take a shower after playing sports.;/ Always wash your hands with soap and water after using the bathroom or whenever they are dirty and dry them with a clean towel.;/ Avoid sharing personal objects, such as clothes, towels and sports equipment.;/ Wear clean clothes, avoiding taking them out of the dirty clothes basket (especially sportswear).;/  Some strategies that people with impetigo can adopt to prevent passing the infection to others, as well as spreading it to other areas of the body, include: Avoid direct skin-to-skin contact with other people until your doctor determines that there is no longer a risk of contagion.;/ Do not touch or scratch or itch the lesions.;/ Do not share personal objects, such as towels, toys, bedding or other items that the person with impetigo has used.;/ Keep injuries clean and covered.;/ Wash your hands with soap and water after touching injuries, using the bathroom or whenever they are dirty. Dry them on a clean towel.;/ Use a clean towel every time you bathe or need to dry the affected area.;/ Wash clothes, towels and bedding that have come into contact with the person with impetigo in hot water (at least 60 \u00baC) separately.;/ Wash clothing and bedding daily during the first few days of treatment.;/ In daily skin care, use a spoon or other object to remove the cream from the packaging. This will prevent the cream from getting contaminated inside the packaging.;/ Disinfect surfaces that the person with impetigo has touched, such as countertops and doorknobs.;/ Keep your nails short, as impetigo can cause itching and lead you to scratch your skin, so at least the likelihood of damaging your skin is lower.;/ American Academy of Dermatology Association, agosto de 2022 British Association of Dermatologists, agosto de 2022 Brazilian Society of Pediatrics, August 2022 Load more;/ We've debunked ten common myths about COVID-19 so that misinformation doesn't put you at risk of contracting the disease.

    "Active middle ear implants": {
        "What is it?": "In normal hearing, the sound captured by the auricle is conducted to the eardrum, causing it to vibrate. This vibration is transmitted by the ossicles to the cochlea, where it will produce an electrical stimulus that is conducted to the brain by the auditory nerve and will be understood as an auditory sensation. Unlike conventional hearing aids, which provide more acoustic energy (\"louder sound\"), Active Middle Ear Implants capture and process ambient sound by providing mechanical stimulation (vibration) to the ossicles of the middle ear or directly to the fluid contained in the cochlea through the round membrane. Active Middle Ear Implants are partially or fully implanted electromagnetic devices that capture ambient sound, process it, and provide mechanical/vibrational stimulation to the structures of the middle ear. Partially implanted devices have an external component (containing the microphone, battery, processor, and transmitter) attached behind and above the ear through magnetic attraction to the internal component. The internal component is surgically implanted under the skin. The signal sent by the external processor is captured and converted into vibration by a transducer fixed to one of the ossicles of the middle ear or applied directly to the membrane of the round window. In fully implanted devices, all elements are implanted under the scalp and are completely invisible. The battery is charged daily using an external magnetically attached charger, with the charge lasting approximately 45 minutes.",
        "Who can benefit?": "Adults with moderate to severe sensorineural deafness who do not benefit from or cannot tolerate conventional hearing aids;/ Patients with external ear pathology (eczema of the auricle or ear canal, recurrent otitis externa, occlusion of the ear canal, etc.);/ Individuals with mixed or conductive deafness (due to changes in the eardrum, malformation or destruction of the ossicular chain, etc.);/  Currently, the indications and results of Active Middle Ear Implants overlap greatly with those of hearing aids. The fact that they do not require an earmold occluding the ear canal makes them very comfortable, avoiding the feeling of plugging or humidity reported by many individuals with conventional hearing aids. Active Middle Ear Implants, in addition to being completely invisible from the outside, allow you to maintain your hearing while sleeping, in the shower or while swimming.",
        "Limitations": "They are not indicated in situations of active middle ear infection.;/ Some models do not allow for magnetic resonance imaging examinations;/ The battery of fully implantable devices currently has a predictable lifespan of 15 years, with replacement accomplished through minor surgery;/",
        "Surgery": "The surgery is performed under general anesthesia, lasts approximately two hours and requires only one day of hospitalization.

    "Cochlear implants": {
        "What are they?": "In certain cases of severe to profound deafness, the hair cells in the cochlea are so damaged that stimulation of the auditory pathway by sound or vibration cannot ensure an improvement in auditory perception. Cochlear implants convert environmental sound into electrical signals and transmit them directly to the auditory nerve through electrodes surgically implanted inside the cochlea. Cochlear implants are surgically implanted electronic devices that directly stimulate the auditory nerve, thereby providing an auditory sensation.  They are made up of two components: External Component;/ Generally used behind the ear, like a hearing aid, it consists of a microphone that captures ambient sound, a processor (minicomputer) that transforms these sounds into an electrical code and a transmitter that sends this code via radio frequency and through the skin to the internal component.  Internal Component;/ It is surgically implanted under the skin behind the ear. It consists of a receiver that receives the signal encoded by the external component and sends it to electrodes placed inside the cochlea, directly stimulating the endings of the auditory nerve. The electrical signals conducted by the auditory nerve will be sent to specific areas of the brain where they will be interpreted as sounds and language.",
        "More information": "Overall, we can say that the Cochlear Implant is indicated for all people with severe to profound deafness, of the neurosensory type (loss of hair cells in the cochlea) who do not benefit from well-adapted hearing aids.  Adults with severe to profound bilateral sensorineural deafness (current data show the advantage of Cochlear Implants in the auditory rehabilitation of individuals with unilateral deafness).  Children with severe to profound bilateral sensorineural deafness with little benefit in speech perception and language acquisition with the use of correctly fitted hearing aids.  The entire process begins with the first consultation, where the cause of deafness is investigated, its impact on language and integration into the social, school or professional environment, and the presence of other diseases that may prevent the placement of a Cochlear Implant is investigated. Hearing tests will quantify the degree of deafness, characterize the type of deafness and evaluate the effectiveness of hearing aids in perceiving sounds and understanding words. In potential candidates for Cochlear Implants, radiological examinations (\"CT scan\" and \"MRI\") will be used to prove the existence of an intact auditory nerve and the presence of an implantable cochlea, essential requirements for the placement of a Cochlear Implant. In children, it is important to assess the degree of existing verbal language and the presence of diseases that may compromise auditory rehabilitation and language acquisition.  Cochlear implant surgery requires general anesthesia and a hospital stay of one to two days. An incision is made in the skin behind the ear, and about two centimeters of hair in this area must be cut. This single scar will be completely hidden by the hair in a short time. The mastoid (bony region behind the ear) is opened, creating a path towards the eardrum, exposing the first spiral of the cochlea. Through a small hole, the electrode cable is introduced into the cochlea where they will stimulate the endings of the auditory nerve. Finally, the receiver is placed under the skin behind the incision area. The entire surgery is performed with monitoring of the Facial Nerve (given its proximity to the path of the electrode cable) and lasts approximately 2-3 hours, being considered a safe surgery with a quick recovery. Surgery is just the first part of the Cochlear Implant rehabilitation process.  A few weeks after surgery, the audiologist will activate the Cochlear Implant by connecting the external component to the internal component. During this initial activation phase, you will be able to hear sounds, but only after a few programming sessions will you be able to understand words. Over time, the brain adapts better to the type of electrical stimulus provided by the Cochlear Implant, improving the quality of auditory perception.  In children with severe to profound deafness, initially - before language acquisition - a whole process of hearing rehabilitation and language acquisition begins, which will require dedication over many years on the part of the child and their family, audiologists, speech therapists and even their teachers. The motivation of all these elements is a determining factor in the success of the Cochlear Implant.  In adults with language, the entire activation and programming process is easier and faster.  The Cochlear Implant is currently the best method of rehabilitation for severe to profound deafness for those who do not benefit from the use of hearing aids. It ensures a great improvement in the perception of sounds and the possibility of understanding human speech.

    "Osteo-integrated implants": {
        "What are they?": "Although hearing depends essentially on sound waves that, propagating through the air, reach our ear (air conduction), an important part of auditory perception results from the vibration produced by sound in the bones of the skull (bone conduction): when we speak, we hear our voice whether through the air or through the bone. This phenomenon explains the fact that most people do not recognize their own voice when it is recorded, given that the recorder only records the airway component. Osteo-Integrated Implants stimulate the inner ear through vibrations transmitted through the skull to the inner ear (bone conduction).  They are made up of two components: External Component;/ It captures external sound and processes it, transforming it into vibration.  Implantable Component;/ A small titanium \"screw\" is surgically fixed to the skull, slightly above and behind the ear. The physical characteristics of titanium and the surgical technique will allow for a close \"fusion\" between the implant and the bone (osteointegration). The vibration produced by the external component will be transmitted by the implant to the skull, propagating and stimulating the inner ear.",
        "More information": "Since the stimulation is carried out by vibration transmitted by the skull directly to the inner ear, this hearing implant is indicated in cases of deafness due to problems in the conduction of sound in the ear canal and/or in the transmission of vibration from the eardrum to the cochlea (transmission deafness due to pathology of the outer ear and middle ear) that cannot be satisfactorily resolved by hearing aids. They also have the advantage of being able to be applied to individuals with permanent (purging) infections who are unable to use hearing aids.  Adults and children with: Malformations of the outer ear or middle ear;/ Closure of the external auditory canal (due to exostoses or skin lesions);/ Sequelae of chronic otitis - with perforation of the eardrum or destruction of the ossicles;/ After cholesteatoma surgery;/ Mixed deafness (poor transmission of sound by the tympanic-ossicular system and with some loss of cochlear sensitivity);/ Profound unilateral sensorineural deafnessThe existence of only one functioning ear makes it difficult to perceive the spatial origin of sounds and affects the discrimination of speech perception in noisy environments (for example in a classroom). Placing an osteointegrated implant on the side of the deaf ear allows the sound that reaches that side to be transmitted by bone vibration to the functioning inner ear on the opposite side, thus restoring the sensation of stereophony and improving speech understanding.;/ Having only one functioning ear makes it difficult to perceive the spatial origin of sounds and affects speech perception discrimination in noisy environments (e.g. in a classroom). Placing an osteo-integrated implant on the side of the deaf ear allows the sound that reaches that side to be transmitted by bone vibration to the functioning inner ear on the opposite side, thus restoring the sensation of stereophony and improving speech understanding.;/ Osteointegrated implant surgery is usually performed under general anesthesia (but may be performed under local anesthesia if necessary), on an outpatient basis or with a one-day hospital stay. Since there is no intervention on the structures of the outer ear or middle ear, there is no risk of worsening pre-existing hearing. It is a surgery that lasts about an hour, is considered very safe, and the post-operative period is painless, allowing the patient to quickly resume their activities.  The osteointegration process between the titanium implant and the bone requires around four weeks, after which it is possible to connect the external component and begin its activation and programming.  In cases where direct fitting models between the external component and the titanium implant (percutaneous) have been chosen, it is only necessary to take \"hygiene\" care of the skin around the titanium implant. Fitting and removing the external component is very easy and safe, even for children. This osteo-integrated implant allows the practice of most activities and sports, although the external component must be removed when sleeping, bathing or swimming.

        "What is it?": "Cervico-isthmic incompetence (cervical insufficiency) is defined as recurrent painless cervical dilation, that is, the cervix begins to shorten and open very early during a pregnancy, which can lead to losses in the second trimester or the inability of the cervix to maintain the pregnancy in the absence of uterine contractions.",
        "Symptoms": "In most cases, the pregnant woman is asymptomatic, but one of the following symptoms may appear: Pelvic pressure;/ Cramps;/ Back pain;/ Increased vaginal discharge;/",
        "Causes": "The likely cause will be structural weakening of the cervix, which may be a consequence of: Previous cervical or uterine surgery (e.g., dilation and curettage, hysteroscopy);/ Congenital anomaly;/ Biochemical changes in the cervix that cause premature cervical shortening and dilation. These conditions can be caused, among others, by inflammation/infection of the membranes and hemorrhage in the decidua (uterine mucosa where the placenta is implanted) or in the placenta.;/",
        "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis is based on a history of previous pregnancy loss in the second trimester, which can present in several ways: Classic history of two or more consecutive second-trimester pregnancy losses or extremely preterm births (<28 weeks), associated with no or minimally mild symptoms;/ Painless cervical dilation and prominent fetal membranes in the second trimester of pregnancy;/ Preterm premature rupture of membranes;/ Rapid and spontaneous labor of a pre-viable fetus;/ Rare or absent uterine contractions;/  It can also occur in situations without a history of previous fetal loss, and in these cases, the diagnosis is based on a combination of: Clinical presentation and physical examination - advanced, painless cervical dilation in the second trimester;/ Ultrasound findings - although the diagnosis is mostly clinical, ultrasound assessment of cervical length may be useful;/",
        "Treatment": "Cervical cerclage is a surgical procedure in which a stitch is placed in the cervix. It is the basis of treatment and should be considered in the following situations: History of second trimester pregnancy loss with painless cervical dilation;/ Previous placement of Cerclage for cervical incompetence;/ History of extremely rapid and spontaneous preterm labor and a short cervix in the early second trimester;/ Painless cervical dilation on physical examination in the second trimester;/  Although cervical cerclage is the focus of treatment, several studies support the use of progesterone supplementation in women at risk of preterm birth. Lifestyle changes such as activity restriction and bed rest have not been shown to be effective.",

    "Anal incontinence": {
        "What is it?": "Anal incontinence consists of the involuntary loss of feces and/or gas through the anus. It can result from traumatic injury to the anal sphincter apparatus (obstetric or perineal trauma, local complication of anorectal surgical interventions) or from neuromuscular functional disturbance of the anal sphincter due to chronic diseases (diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, etc.) or neoplasms. This pathology generally causes a change in the patient's emotional, social and psychological balance, which often hides the symptoms, delaying their diagnosis.",
        "Diagnosis": "Assessment in the prosthetic examination can provide information about the tone of the anal sphincter and the existence of local pathology. It is often necessary to carry out additional tests: endo-anal ultrasound (which evaluates the structure of the anal sphincter system) and ano-rectal manometry (which studies changes in the muscular function of the rectum and anal canal).",
        "Treatment": "If the symptoms are mild, medical treatment with control of stool consistency through dietary care and medication may be effective. In some cases, re-education of the anal sphinter using biofeedback techniques can improve quality of life. If these measures fail, and in cases of serious injury to the anal sphincter, it may be necessary to consider surgical options.

    "Urinary incontinence": {
        "What is it?": "Urinary incontinence, also known as urinary leakage, is defined as the involuntary loss of urine. These losses are often associated with weakening of the pelvic floor muscles and/or uncontrolled bladder overactivity, depending on the cause and age group. The lower urinary tract is made up of the bladder (organ that stores urine) and the urethra (channel through which urine exits), which has a muscular sphincter. The ability to store and eliminate urine requires a complex series of interrelated mechanisms involving the brain, bladder, urethra, and pelvic floor muscles and nerves. As urine is produced and stored in the bladder, the bladder muscles (detrusor muscles) relax and stretch to accommodate it. When your bladder fills up to a certain limit (which varies from person to person), you feel the urge to urinate. When the time is appropriate for urination, the brain signals the detrusor muscle to contract and the urethral sphincter to relax, allowing urine to be eliminated. Normally the bladder needs to empty four to eight times a day and one to two times at night. The urethra and bladder are supported by the pelvic floor muscles (a group of muscles that support the urethra and pelvic organs), which contract during physical exertion to help prevent urine leakage. It is estimated that urinary incontinence problems affect around 200 million people worldwide, with women being the population most affected by this problem, although there are also several men affected. In Portugal, it is estimated that there are around 600,000 incontinent people: three in ten women and one in ten men are affected by urinary incontinence. There are several types of urinary incontinence: Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI) - physical exertion (exercise, coughing or sneezing) puts pressure on the bladder, the urethra is unable to remain closed and urine leaks. In this case the abnormality or weakness is in the urethra or pelvic floor.;/ Urgency Urinary Incontinence (UUI) - UUI is caused by anomalous and involuntary contractions of the bladder (usually the bladder muscle does not contract until we are in the bathroom, ready to urinate). These anomalous contractions, which occur without warning, push urine up the urethra and can cause leakage.;/ Mixed Urinary Incontinence (MUI) - coexistence of SUI and UUI symptoms. An attempt should be made to determine which symptoms predominate and bother the patient the most. Treatment involves a therapeutic approach to both forms of incontinence.;/ Reflux Urinary Incontinence - involuntary loss of urine due to overdistension of a hypotonic bladder.;/ Functional Urinary Incontinence - this type of incontinence occurs when the patient, after recognizing the need to urinate, is unable to reach the bathroom in time, due to limited mobility or a neurological disease that prevents them from planning this action in a structured way.;/",
        "Symptoms": "In women, the bladder and its outlet are controlled by a group of muscles called the pelvic floor muscles, which help to keep the bladder closed. Urinary incontinence in women can occur if these muscles become weak and lose flexibility. Activities as simple as sneezing can cause urine leakage. In the case of men, the most common urinary incontinence is manifested by continuous dripping. The most common cause is an increase in the size of the prostate that prevents the passage of urine during urination. As a result, the bladder never empties completely. In the post-prostate surgery phase, the bladder may be weakened, however, it usually recovers after a few months. Obesity can also cause involuntary urine leakage, as it increases pressure on the pelvic and abdominal muscles. In the case of children, there is no consensus on the definition, prevalence and severity of urinary incontinence. When the development of the nervous system is normal, children stop being incontinent around the age of three. \u201cWetting the bed\u201d does not necessarily mean a health problem. It is estimated that approximately 5% of five-year-old children wet the bed, with boys being more frequent. Its causes are recurrent urinary infections or malformations of the urogenital tract. Except for cases such as urinary incontinence of neurological etiology, which requires a specific approach, many of its manifestations reverse spontaneously.",
        "Causes": "Its most frequent causes are recurrent urinary infections or malformations of the urogenital tract. Except for urinary incontinence of neurological etiology, which requires a specific approach, many resolve spontaneously.",
        "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis includes: Bladder diary: the person records how much they drink, when they urinate, the amount of urine produced, and the number of episodes of incontinence.;/ Physical examination: gynecological examination and assessment of the tone of the pelvic floor muscles. In men, digital examination of the prostate through the rectum may be important to rule out enlargement of the gland.;/ Blood and urine laboratory studies: assessment of kidney function and urinary infection screening;/ Uroflowmetry with measurement of post-void residue: non-invasive test that allows the assessment of the amount of urine remaining in the bladder after urination.;/ Pelvic ultrasound: assesses the presence of pelvic changes.;/ Stress test: The patient applies sudden abdominal pressure while the doctor checks for urine leakage.;/ Urodynamic test: Determines how much pressure the bladder and urinary sphincter muscle can withstand.;/ Cystogram: An X-ray provides a picture of the bladder.;/ Cystoscopy: A thin tube with a lens is inserted into the urethra allowing direct visualization of the lower urinary tract.;/",
        "Treatment": "There are several forms of treatment. In addition to pharmacological and surgical treatment, pelvic reeducation can also play an important role. Through various techniques, it allows effective strengthening of the perineal muscles, in addition to being non-invasive and having no side effects. In some cases, surgical treatment may be necessary.",
        "Prevention": "To avoid urinary incontinence it is important to: Drink adequate amounts of fluids. Dehydration increases bladder irritation and makes incontinence easier.;/ Follow a healthy diet;/ Control your weight;/ Change bathroom usage habits. Go whenever you need. Avoid frequent and prolonged retention as it can damage the bladder muscles and facilitate urinary infection. Empty your bladder completely;/ Avoid constipation.

    "Infecao por helicobacter pylori": {
        "What is it?": "Helicobacter pylori (or, simply put, Hp) is a bacteria that infects and lives in the stomach. It is considered one of the most frequent infections worldwide and, in Portugal, it is estimated that around 60 to 70% of the population is infected. In the vast majority of cases, the infection is acquired in childhood, orally, through ingestion of contaminated food or water and through contact between individuals. It is a chronic infection, lasting for years, decades or even a lifetime, making it very difficult to spontaneously eliminate the bacteria.",
        "Symptoms": "The majority of individuals infected with Helicobacter Pylori remain symptom-free over time. However, in some people, the bacteria is the cause of digestive tract complaints. Hp is the cause of duodenal ulcers, gastric ulcers and certain chronic gastritis. In a very small percentage of infected people, the bacteria is associated with the appearance of some types of tumors, such as lymphoma or adenocarcinoma.",
        "Diagnosis": "The doctor orders a diagnostic test for the bacteria Helicobacter Pylori if he thinks the patient's current symptoms can be attributed to it or if the results of the upper endoscopy suggest its presence. Individuals who have had tumors or ulcers (gastric or duodenal) in the past and those with first-degree relatives with stomach tumors should also undergo a diagnostic test, even if they currently have no complaints. There are several reliable methods for diagnosing the bacteria. The doctor will advise the one that best suits a particular individual. A blood test (antibodies), a breath test (which looks for the presence of a substance in the breath after drinking a certain liquid), a gastric biopsy test or a microscopic analysis, also of a gastric biopsy, may be performed. In very specific cases, it may be necessary to cultivate the bacteria in a laboratory.",
        "Treatment": "As a general rule, if the bacteria has been diagnosed, it should be eradicated. However, there are clinical circumstances in which treatment may not be a priority. Eliminating Hp is difficult to achieve and, to achieve this, it is necessary to combine several medications, including several antibiotics. There are several different combinations of medications used to eradicate Hp, with the aim of achieving very high cure rates (80-90%). The choice of medication depends on several factors, so the doctor will decide which is the best option in each case. It is important to highlight that one of the main conditions for any treatment to be successful is the patient's rigor and discipline in complying with the medication doses and schedules. After treatment, it must always be confirmed that the bacteria has been effectively eradicated. For this, some of the methods described for diagnosing the infection are used. If Hp still persists, new treatment with different medications is recommended. If the bacteria has been eliminated, there is no need to repeat any type of test in the future. The reinfection rate - the probability of acquiring the infection again within a year - is low (2 to 3%). There is no need for any type of periodic \"surveillance\" for infection.",
        "Prevention": "There is no specific recommendation to prevent children or adults from becoming infected with Hp. There is still no effective vaccine. It is essential, however, from the point of view of general health and disease prevention, to cultivate good habits of body hygiene (for example, washing your hands after using the bathroom and before eating) and food hygiene (washing your hands thoroughly). food and drink drinking water) Load more;/ RSV infection can progress to bronchiolitis or pneumonia.

    "Respiratory infection": {
        "What is it?": "It occurs when a part of the respiratory system is infected by a microorganism that can be a virus, bacteria, fungus or parasite. Its manifestations depend on the affected area. In fact, all parts of the respiratory system can suffer from an infection: nose (rhinitis); perinasal sinuses (sinusitis); pharynx (pharyngitis); larynx (laryngitis); bronchi (bronchitis, bronchiectasis); lung (pneumonia) and pleura (pleuritis). Although most are benign, they are very common and can be fatal. For example, pneumonia is the third cause of human mortality and tuberculosis ranks seventh. On a global scale, respiratory infections are responsible for around four million deaths every year. They can have a varied impact, depending on their frequency and severity. The most important are pneumonia, infectious exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, tuberculosis and influenza. In Portugal, it is estimated that more than 800 thousand cases of respiratory infections occur annually, 150 thousand of which are pneumonia. In 2008, there were more than 50 thousand hospitalizations for pneumonia, with more than four thousand people dying from this disease, making it the third cause of mortality in the country.",
        "Symptoms": "Symptoms will depend on the location of the infection and its severity. The most common complaints are nasal congestion and discharge, cough, sore throat and body aches, fatigue and fever. In general, symptoms begin one to three days after exposure to the agent. They may be associated with conjunctivitis in the case of infections caused by certain viruses, and with headache or facial pain in the case of sinusitis. In more advanced cases, difficulty breathing, dizziness, and changes in consciousness may occur. These symptoms generally reflect a difficulty in getting oxygen to the lungs and require urgent evaluation.",
        "Causes": "Being in direct contact with the external environment, the respiratory system is permanently exposed to infectious agents that can reach it by inhalation (through the air we breathe), circulatory route (through the circulation) or by aspiration of infected material from the mouth and /or upper airways. Risk factors include reduced defenses, as occurs in children, the elderly or patients with immunodeficiency (HIV or cancer). Among the various microorganisms that can cause respiratory infections, viruses are the most common. Among bacteria, the most frequent are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae.",
        "Diagnosis": "Medical examination is essential in the evaluation of respiratory infection. In many cases, no additional tests are necessary and treatment can be determined promptly. In more serious cases, an X-ray or CT scan may be requested. Other tests that may be useful are respiratory function tests and laboratory studies of sputum or other samples to try to identify the agent responsible for the infection.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment depends on the location, risk factors and the agent responsible. For infections caused by viruses, there are no specific medications and treatment is based on relieving symptoms. Painkillers, nasal decongestants or cough medicines may be useful. In the case of bacteria, there are several classes of antibiotics that should always be selected by a doctor. It is very important, when faced with a respiratory infection, not to start an antibiotic right away because, in many cases, it is not useful and the risk of side effects and resistance to future treatments is unnecessarily increased.",
        "Prevention": "Although the respiratory system has defense mechanisms against various microorganisms, they are not always sufficient. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle, with a balanced diet, exercising, not smoking, among other aspects, is essential for prevention. Tobacco smoke reduces the activity of cells that destroy bacteria that enter the respiratory tract and, as such, is a major risk factor for respiratory infections. Poor air quality encourages infections and is a vehicle for the transmission of microorganisms. It is therefore very important to avoid poorly ventilated, overcrowded and polluted places, places with excessively dry air, places that are very cold and very humid, or places that are subject to sudden changes in temperature, as well as harsh weather conditions (cold, rain, humidity and wind). Currently there are medicines that belong to the vaccine family and that help increase resistance to respiratory infections. These medications have the ability to stimulate the activity of key cells and protect the respiratory system from infections. They are normally administered orally.

    "Urinary infection": {
        "What is it?": "It corresponds to the presence of bacteria in any part of the urinary system (kidneys, ureters and bladder). Depending on the location, the infection is given different names. In the case of the kidney, it is called pyelonephritis, in the case of the bladder, cystitis and in the case of the urethra, it is called urethritis. They are one of the most common infections. Generally speaking, microorganisms reach the urinary system from the outside, through the urethra or, more rarely, from the blood and settle in the kidneys. Bacteria that reach the urinary tract are usually quickly removed before causing infection by the elimination of urine itself and the body's defenses. When this does not happen, the symptoms of infection become evident. They are more common in women, given the greater proximity of the female urethra to the anus and vagina and given the fact that it is a much shorter urethra than the male urethra, which allows microorganisms to more easily reach the bladder. Children, particularly males up to one year of age, also have a high prevalence of kidney infection, due to the presence of vesicourethral reflux.",
        "Symptoms": "The main symptoms caused by urinary tract infections are: Burning or pain when urinating;/ Occurrence of frequent and small amounts of urination;/ Urgent and frequent urge to urinate;/ Urine with a foul smell;/ Changes in its color;/ Difficulty starting urination;/ Elimination of blood in the urine;/ Pain in the lower abdomen;/ Fever;/ Chills;/ Lower back pain;/ Nausea;/ Vomiting;/ Most cases are not very serious. The exceptions are those involving the kidneys, which require special care. Kidney damage resulting from a urinary tract infection can cause renal scarring, high blood pressure or even renal failure.",
        "Causes": "The most common causes of urinary tract infections are: Pregnancy;/ Diabetes;/ Urinary obstruction;/ Inadequate hygiene habits;/ Insertion of foreign objects;/ Menstrual period;/ Neurological diseases;/ Sexually transmitted diseases;/ The presence of urinary tract abnormalities also tends to increase your risk. The same goes for institutionalized patients or those undergoing catheterization. The microorganisms responsible vary depending on where the infection is acquired.\u00a0When it occurs in a non-hospitalized patient, the most common agent is Escherichia coli (around 80% of cases) and some staphylococci. In hospitalized or institutionalized patients, these bacteria may also be responsible, but others appear that are more aggressive and, therefore, require more complex treatment. These patients also experience urinary infections caused by fungi.",
        "Diagnosis": "Often, when a woman experiences a first episode of urinary tract infection, treatment is started immediately without resorting to a laboratory diagnosis. In cases of repeated infections, in children or hospitalized patients, it is important to assess which microorganism is responsible and seek to identify which situations may be the basis of the infection. Therefore, in addition to medical assessment, laboratory diagnosis is important as it allows the evaluation of the sample, its physical and chemical composition, the presence of microorganisms and, if they are present, their susceptibility to different antibiotics. This aspect is important in order to select the most appropriate antibiotic for each case. For this diagnosis to be effective, it is essential that urine collection is carried out according to very strict rules, which are different for men, women, children and catheterized patients. In the case of recurrent urinary infections, more in-depth evaluations may be necessary using ultrasound, tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, among other diagnostic techniques.",
        "Treatment": "In addition to treatment with the most appropriate antibiotic, it is important to take some extra precautions: Increase fluid intake;/ Take general care of intimate hygiene;/ Correct any anatomical changes that may be responsible for infections;/ Do not delay urinating (this resistance increases the risk of infection because it allows urine to remain inside the bladder for longer);/ Treatment of urinary tract infections with antibiotics should only be started after the bacteria have been identified by the laboratory. However, in daily clinical practice, the procedure is different and, almost always, the patient begins treatment with an antibiotic even without knowing the results of the tests. The most frequently used are fluoroquinolones. In the case of urinary tract infection during pregnancy, the choice of antibiotic must be carefully considered, as some are contraindicated during pregnancy. In men, they are often associated with kidney stones or an enlarged prostate, which means that both investigation and treatment must be oriented differently.",
        "Prevention": "There are several measures that can reduce the risk of urinary tract infections: Drink plenty of water and urinate frequently;/ Avoid liquids such as alcohol and caffeine which can irritate the bladder;/ Urinating immediately after sexual intercourse;/ Wipe from front to back after urinating and defecating to avoid contamination from the rectum.;/ Keep the genital area clean;/ Prefer showers to baths;/ Avoid using oils;/ Sanitary pads or menstrual cups are preferable to tampons;/ Avoid using diaphragms or spermicides as contraceptive methods;/ Avoid using scented products in the genital area;/ Wear cotton underwear and loose clothing to keep the area around the urethra dry.;/ Francisco Jos\u00e9 Barbas Rodrigues et al., Etiology and bacterial sensitivity in urinary tract infections, Rev Port Sa\u00fade P\u00fablica. 2011;29(2): 123-131 Medical News Today National Kidney and Urologic Diseases Information Clearinghouse(NKUDIC),A service of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases(NIDDK),National Institutes of Health(NIH); Maio 2012 The British Association of Urological Surgeons University of Maryland Medical Center, 2011 Load more;/ There are infections that can be caused by heat, chlorine and wet swimsuits.

        "Symptoms": "If the infection is located in the kidney (pyelonephritis) most children will have a high fever and abdominal pain. If the child is very young (newborn or latent) he or she may not have a fever but may refuse to eat, not gain weight, vomit or simply not be well. In infections localized to the bladder (cystitis) and especially in older children, the main symptom is pain when urinating, interrupted stream (peeing in \u201cdribbles\u201d), increased frequency of urination and sometimes urinary incontinence. Infected urine can be foul-smelling, thicker, cloudy and even contain blood. Not all girls with these symptoms have a urinary tract infection, and it could be an episode of vulvovaginitis.",
        "Diagnosis": "To confirm the diagnosis, it is necessary to obtain a urine sample which, in addition to identifying the microorganism, allows us to know its sensitivity to antibiotics.",
        "Treatment": "Infections must be treated with antibiotics to eliminate symptoms, eradicate bacteria from the urinary tract and prevent possible sequelae (kidney scarring). In younger febrile children, those with more severe illness, those who vomit or those with kidney or urinary tract anomalies, hospitalization may be warranted to administer antibiotics intravenously until the infection is resolved. UI may be the first telltale sign of a urinary tract abnormality. Therefore, in some cases (e.g. young children with fever, boys, changes in the urinary tract detected on prenatal ultrasound, children with recurrent urinary infections), it is very important that a study of the urinary tract is carried out. It is accepted that in a small number of children, kidney infection can leave permanent kidney damage (kidney scar). If these lesions are extensive, multiple and bilateral, they can later lead to high blood pressure and/or kidney failure.",
        "Prevention": "Prevention of urinary incontinence involves drinking enough water, emptying the bladder regularly and frequently, and cleaning the perineum properly. Constipation and intestinal parasites should also be treated. In some circumstances, preventive antibiotics may be necessary for a period that varies depending on the child's age, underlying anomalies and the risk of reinfection.

    "Scalp infections": {
        "Infections caused by Bacteria": "Among bacteria, the most common disease is impetigo. It is a superficial skin infection caused by streptococcus or staphylococcus. Yellowish or reddish crusts are observed in more or less extensive areas. When the patient moves, he spreads the infection. It may not cause any complaints or may cause burning or itching. It often appears superimposed on another pre-existing disease on the scalp. It is treated with vigorous washing with soap and water, topical antibiotic ointment to break down the crusts and possibly oral antibiotics (usually erythromycin or flucloxacillin). Much less common are deeper skin infections, such as ectima, which causes ulcerations covered by crusts, and erysipelas/cellulitis, which causes large areas of redness and swelling, usually in patients with fever and general malaise. Treatment is with oral antibiotics, although in more severe cases hospitalization and intravenous medication may be necessary.",
        "Infections caused by Viruses": "Among the viruses, the most common to affect the scalp are the herpes virus and varicella-zooster. Although the herpes virus most often affects the face, it can also affect the scalp. The patient complains of burning and redness and grouped micro-vesicles are observed. Chickenpox, as is common knowledge, often affects the scalp, usually in the form of micro-vesicles. The same virus (varicella-zoster) in those who have had chickenpox causes the so-called \u201cshingles\u201d, which frequently affects the scalp. The pain and burning are more intense than in the case of herpes simplex and the affected area extends along the dermatome (skin with the same embryonic origin and with common innervation). These infections are treated with oral antivirals (acyclovir, valacyclovir), relieving pain/burning and preventing secondary infection. In children, the very common molluscum contagiosum virus can cause centrally depressed lumps that are easily removed by the doctor.",
        "Fungal Infections": "Scalp ringworm is a superficial fungal infection of the skin. It is much more common in children. The most frequent agents vary by geography. In Portugal and most developed countries, the most common agents are of the genus Tricophyton and Microsporum. There may be itching, which is the most common complaint, but is not mandatory. Upon observation, the most common thing is that there is simply peeling in a localized area of \u200b\u200bthe skin, and there may or may not be redness that becomes more evident on the periphery of the lesion. The lesions grow centrifugally.\u00a0 Rarely, there may be lumps with actual pus lakes or large yellowish plaques. The doctor must collect material to be able to identify the agent.  The most useful antifungal medicine is griseofluvin (currently not available in Portugal), so we often use terbinafine, itraconazole and fluconazole.

    "Salmonella infections": {
        "What is it?": "It is almost always a self-limiting disease, in the form of acute gastroenteritis. More rarely, it can be associated with generalized infection, arthritis, meningitis or pneumonia, among others. Salmonella is a bacteria responsible for infections in humans. There are two species which, in turn, are divided into subgroups. Knowledge of these divisions is important in the case of epidemics to be able to identify the source of infection and also to better study the resistance to antibiotics that these bacteria may present. Salmonella gastroenteritis represents a global public health problem, with its real incidence being much higher than the number of declared cases. In the United States, it is estimated that there are 1.4 million incidents per year, with only 10% being declared. These infections are more common in the summer months. In Portugal, between 2004 and 2008, 456 episodes were reported annually, 82% of which were in children under 15 years of age. Although a relationship is recognized between hygiene and sanitary conditions, the availability of drinking water and the way food is stored and prepared, in recent decades there has been an increase in its incidence in industrialized countries, a fact that can be justified by globalization and the changing eating habits.",
        "Symptoms": "In most cases, it manifests as diarrhea, abdominal pain and fever that develop 12 to 72 hours after infection. The disease lasts between four and seven days and most people recover without needing any treatment. In some cases, the infection can be serious and require hospitalization. This happens when it spreads from the intestines to the bloodstream and from there to other parts of the body. This condition requires urgent treatment with antibiotics. The most serious forms occur in the elderly, children and people with weakened immune systems. Most recover spontaneously, but some patients develop joint complaints, eye irritation and burning sensation when urinating. This condition is called reactive arthritis and can last months or years, leading to chronic arthritis that is difficult to treat. This situation can arise regardless of the use of antibiotics to treat gastroenteritis.",
        "Causes": "These bacteria inhabit the digestive tract of humans and other animals, such as some birds. In general, the infection is transmitted by eating food contaminated with animal feces, which, however, has a normal appearance. The most common are meat, milk, eggs and poultry, although contamination can also occur from vegetables. Correct food preparation allows the destruction of this type of bacteria. However, contagion can occur through the hands of those who handle or make them. Since Salmonella can be present in the feces of some domestic animals or pets, this is another possible source, especially if people do not wash their hands after coming into contact with them. Some reptiles, such as turtles and snakes, can also harbor this bacteria, so hand washing is essential, even if they are healthy.",
        "Diagnosis": "There are many diseases that can manifest with diarrhea, fever and abdominal pain. For this reason, diagnosis requires a laboratory study, using stool samples, to identify Salmonella and its subtype.",
        "Treatment": "Salmonella gastroenteritis rarely requires treatment, other than adequate hydration, and improves after five to seven days. If the diarrhea is very intense, it may be necessary to resort to intravenous hydration in a hospital environment. The use of antibiotics is only justified in cases of severe diarrhea, high fever, passage of the infection into the bloodstream, in hospitalized patients or in those at greater risk of complications, such as children, patients over 65 years of age and those with reduced defenses.",
        "Prevention": "It is important to avoid consuming undercooked foods, undercooked eggs and unpasteurized milk. All must be kept in good refrigeration conditions. Hands must be washed before preparing them, as well as the surfaces and utensils that will be used.\u00a0 Food must still be cooled before being transported from one location to another. Hands should always be washed after contact with animals, even if they do not show any signs of illness.

    "Infertility": {
        "What is it?": "Several steps are necessary for pregnancy to occur: the formation and release of an egg from the ovaries; its arrival through the fallopian tubes to the uterus; its union with the male sperm; and the attachment of the fertilized egg to the wall of the uterus (implantation). If problems occur in any of these steps, infertility may occur. Infertility is not exclusively a female problem. As a rule, one third of the causes are female, another third are male and the remaining cases result from a combination of problems in both partners.",
        "Symptoms": "Although the World Health Organization defines infertility as \u201cthe absence of pregnancy after two years of regular sexual intercourse and without the use of contraception\u201d, it is considered a case of infertility when a pregnancy is not achieved after one year of trying. For women over the age of 35, this limit is six months. Infertility is also referred to as women who, although they are able to get pregnant, are unable to carry the pregnancy to term.",
        "Causes": "In about 10% of cases, the cause of infertility cannot be identified. However, there are numerous causes of infertility, both male and female. Male: Varicocele (dilation of the veins in the testicles, increasing the temperature, which affects the number and shape of sperm); changes in the ability of sperm to move; torsion or trauma to the testicle; consumption of alcohol, drugs or tobacco reduces the number of healthy sperm; kidney disease, hormonal changes, mumps, contact with pesticides, medications, exposure to radiation or chemotherapy. All of these factors can affect sperm production, and age itself is associated with a reduction in the number and quality of these cells. Heat is important because it interferes with sperm production. Therefore, professions such as cooks or drivers present a greater risk.;/  Females: most cases result from ovulation problems. One of the signs of changes in ovulation is the occurrence of irregular periods. One of the most common causes is polycystic ovary syndrome, which causes a hormonal imbalance that interferes with ovulation. Another common cause is primary ovarian insufficiency, which occurs when the ovaries stop functioning normally before the age of 40. There are other possible causes: pelvic inflammatory disease, endometriosis, surgery, fibroids, uterine polyps, thyroid disease, history of voluntary termination of pregnancy or repeated miscarriages. As for men, age, smoking, alcohol consumption and stress are factors to consider. Poor nutrition, excessive physical activity, sexually transmitted diseases, and being overweight or underweight also interfere with fertility. Age is important because as age increases, the ovaries become less capable of releasing eggs, their number is smaller, they are not as healthy and the risk of other health problems increases.;/",
        "Diagnosis": "In the initial assessment, it is important to know the couple's sexual habits and recommendations can be made that prove relevant. Diagnosis tends to be time-consuming and expensive and, as noted, even with all testing and counseling, it cannot be guaranteed that pregnancy will occur. The causes of infertility are multiple and may or may not be associated with anomalies in the male or female reproductive system. Therefore, diagnosis must be carried out in stages and include both partners simultaneously. In addition to medical observation, laboratory tests, genetic and hormonal studies and some imaging methods, such as ultrasound or hysterosalpingography, are necessary. In the case of men, one of the most important tests is the spermogram. For women, one of the important steps is to understand whether ovulation occurs every month.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment depends on the cause and may involve medication, surgery, artificial insemination or assisted reproduction. It may be necessary to combine different techniques in the same case. In general, the drugs used are hormonal in nature and seek to improve the ovulation process.  Dealing with infertility can be difficult, as there is no way of knowing when the problem will be resolved. As such, the emotional burden associated with it is considerable. It is therefore important for couples to define their own limits. Diagnostic methods and treatments are expensive and do not always achieve the desired results. All alternatives that can reduce the anxiety that infertility tends to bring should be considered. This can be minimised by enlisting the support of healthcare professionals, friends and family and using relaxation techniques, if necessary.",
        "Prevention": "Many of the male forms are not preventable. However, not smoking, not consuming excessive alcohol, and avoiding high temperatures are some measures to consider. For women, some measures are essential to prevent infertility: Practicing safe sex is one of the most important measures to avoid sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis and HPV (human papillomavirus). These infections can cause pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility and serious systemic diseases.;/ Avoid environmental toxins.;/ Avoid high levels of mercury in foods such as swordfish and mackerel. Avoid benzene (found in detergents, dyes, rubbers, lubricants, hair products, and paint) because it is an endocrine disruptor that can contribute to infertility.

    "Humanity": {
        "What is it?": "It is defined as a subjective experience of inadequate or limited quality sleep, despite the existence of an opportunity and adequate conditions for sleeping, with impairment to social, occupational and other daytime activities. It can also be defined as difficulty falling asleep (initial insomnia), difficulty maintaining it (intermediate insomnia), waking up too early (terminal insomnia) or, although less frequently, a complaint of non-restorative sleep or poor sleep. quality. Regarding duration, it can be acute (lasting less than four weeks) or chronic (lasting more than four weeks) with symptoms occurring at least three nights a week. Sleep fills approximately one third of life and is essential for the individual's physical and mental recovery. Several studies point to a decrease in its average time, of the order of an hour and a half, compared to the beginning of the last century. On the other hand, in European countries the increase in spending on \u201csleeping medicines\u201d is a reality and is a growing concern. Sleep disorders therefore constitute a public health problem that requires intervention both at an individual level and at a broader level. In Portugal, according to the results obtained in some studies, 28.1% of the population over 18 years old suffers from insomnia symptoms, at least three nights a week (in people over 65 years old, complaints of insomnia reach 50%), with negative repercussions on health and quality of life. It is the most common sleep disorder in adults and is associated with important consequences, such as increased mortality caused by cardiovascular diseases, psychiatric disorders, diabetes, accidents and work absenteeism. Around 69% of patients attending a General Clinic consultation experience insomnia and, despite it affecting millions of people around the world, it continues to be under-diagnosed, which is why many patients do not receive adequate treatment. There are variations in sleep throughout life. which are normal, but insomnia is never normal. Insomnia can be an illness in itself, a symptom of another illness or a consequence of poor sleep and lifestyle hygiene. Therefore, it must be correctly evaluated and treated.",
        "Symptoms": "It normally manifests itself: Due to the presence of an altered sleep pattern, characterized by difficulty falling asleep, insufficient sleep duration, waking up too early, frequent or prolonged awakenings and variability in the pattern from night to night;;/ For the quality of sleep, characterized by anxiety or agitation before or during, a feeling of tiredness upon waking and unpleasant sleep experiences, particularly nightmares;;/ Due to daytime consequences, characterized by drowsiness, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, lack of energy, anxiety, depression or irritability, learning and memory problems that affect performance at work and school. On the other hand, it can be the cause of serious accidents, when drowsiness occurs while driving a car or other vehicles.;/ Transient insomnia (lasting from one to several nights) is a common situation with no serious consequences. Persistent or chronic (lasting months/years) may correspond to a disease situation that must be evaluated by the doctor.",
        "Causes": "The most common causes of acute insomnia are situational stress (work, interpersonal, financial or other), environmental stress (noise in the room) and death or illness of a close person. Regarding the causes, it can be divided into primary (not caused by a known physical or mental condition) or secondary (caused by another medical or psychiatric illness, medications, among others.). The prevalence of secondary is much higher than that of primary, and appears to be increasing. Mood and anxiety disorders are present in 30% to 50% of patients with insomnia; medical illnesses (most often pain) are found in 10% of patients, substance abuse is found in another 10%, and only 10% appear to result from primary sleep disorders. The psychiatric illnesses that most frequently present with insomnia include major depression and anxiety. Risk factors include increasing age, female gender, presence of other illnesses (medical, psychiatric illness, substance abuse), few social relationships, low socioeconomic status, marital or partner separation, unemployment and working for a living. shifts. Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease can also cause it, as well as pathologies that cause pain, difficulty breathing, thyroid or digestive problems, a stroke or menopause.",
        "Diagnosis": "A correct clinical history is essential, with a sleep diary, as well as additional information about your partner to know how he/she sleeps. The objective examination and the request for complementary diagnostic tests should be directed towards the suspicion of a secondary cause of insomnia.",
        "Treatment": "Insomnia is a common disorder that can manifest itself as difficulty falling asleep at the beginning of the night, maintaining sleep throughout the night or early awakenings. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, sometimes called CBT-I, is an effective treatment for chronic sleep problems and is recommended as a first line of treatment for insomnia. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia is a structured 5-week program that helps you identify and replace thoughts and behaviors that cause or worsen sleep problems with habits that promote deep sleep. Unlike sleeping pills, CBT-I helps to overcome the underlying causes of sleep problems. How does cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia work? The cognitive component of CBT-I teaches you to recognize and change beliefs that affect your ability to sleep. This type of therapy helps you control or eliminate negative thoughts and worries that inhibit sleep. The behavioral component of CBT-I helps develop good sleep habits and prevent behaviors that impede quality sleep. Depending on each person's needs, the sleep therapist may recommend some of these CBT-I techniques: Stimulus control therapy.;/ Sleep restriction therapy.;/ Hygiene where I am.;/ Check the environment where I am.;/ Relaxation techniques.;/ Thought control techniques.;/ Remain passively awake.;/ Biofeedback.;/ The most effective treatment approach may combine several of these methods. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy vs. Medication Sleeping medications can be an effective short-term treatment \u2013 \u200b\u200bfor example, they can provide immediate relief during a time of great stress or sadness. But they are not the best treatment for long-term insomnia. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia is the treatment recommended by the world's medical colleges for long-term sleep problems. Unlike pills, CBT-I treats the causes underlying causes of insomnia rather than just alleviating the symptoms.",

    "Chronic ankle instability": {
        "What is it?": "The concept of chronic ankle instability is defined by the occurrence of recurrent sprains and the persistence of residual complaints for a prolonged period of time with the maintenance of a subjective sensation of joint failure.  Chronic instability develops after trauma, such as a sprain, although it can have other causes.  This chronic instability condition is characterized by repeated situations of a sensation that the foot is giving way on its outer surface. This sensation can occur while walking or even when standing still.  Chronic instability affects many athletes.  Sports in which athletes frequently perform jumps and receptions while standing on one foot present a high risk of injury to the ankle joint.  Considering that ankle sprains are very common and that this injury progresses to chronic instability in around 30% of cases, the notion of the frequency of this clinical condition is very clear.",
        "Symptoms": "The most common symptoms are pain in the outer ankle, difficulty walking, a feeling of instability, swelling, stiffness and repeated sprains.  The pain can be so intense that it makes walking difficult.",
        "Causes": "The most common cause of chronic instability is incomplete healing of an ankle sprain.  After a sprain, the tissue connecting the bones is under tension or torn. If treatment or physical therapy is not adequate, the ligaments can become weakened, resulting in instability.  Other possible causes of this condition are nerve injuries with stretching or rupture after a blow, inflammation of a tendon, arthritis, a fracture or the development of a scar after a sprain.",
        "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis is based on clinical observation, X-rays or magnetic resonance imaging.  Ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) scans may be helpful.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment depends on the final diagnosis and includes the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroid injections, compression and physical therapy.  Surgery is useful when medical treatment is not effective and may involve removing loose tissue fragments, cleaning the joint surfaces, or repairing ligaments or tendons.  Post-operative rehabilitation can take 6 to 10 weeks.",
        "Prevention": "Prevention of chronic instabilities involves maintaining adequate strength, flexibility and balance in the ankle joint.  In the case of sport, it is essential to warm up correctly and define specific training programs for each modality and wear appropriate footwear. These shoes should be replaced when wear on the sole is visible.  In the case of running, very uneven surfaces should be avoided.  Whenever signs of fatigue occur, rest is crucial.  When a sprain occurs, early and appropriate treatment is essential to prevent the persistence of changes that can evolve into chronic instability.

        "What is it?": "The knee is the largest joint in the body and the patella is the bone located in the anterior region, connecting the muscles of the femur and the tibia, the two bones involved in the knee joint. Strengthens and provides stability to the joint, allowing normal flexion and extension of the knee. Patellar instability occurs when the patella slips out of its joint with the knee and\u00a0causes pain and difficulty in mobilizing the lower limb.",
        "Symptoms": "Patellar instability is characterized by pain in the anterior aspect of the knee, resulting from the inability to bear weight in a \u201csemi-squat\u201d position.",
        "Causes": "The cause is multifactorial, however instability may depend on the insufficiency of stabilizing structures, such as the patellofemoral ligament and the alignment of the lower limb.",
        "Diagnosis": "The clinical examination consists of observing the gait and testing the flexion and extension movements of the knee. Inspection and palpation of the knee joint allows the evaluation of the angulation of the movements as well as the alignment of the bones and the tone of the muscles. The radiological study allows the evaluation of the positioning of the kneecap in the joint and the detection of other causes of pain such as injuries to the muscles, ligaments, cartilage or menisci.",
        "Treatment": "The treatment of this pathology can be something very simple, such as alectomy (release of the external wing of the knee) or it may be necessary to perform an osteotomy of the anterior tuberosity of the tibia (distal realignment through a programmed and guided fracture).",
        "Prevention": "To prevent patellar instability and keep your knees healthy you should: Wear the right shoes for each activity (running, walking);/ Always warm up before exercising;/ Do exercises to keep your thigh muscles (quadriceps and hamstrings) strong and flexible;/ Increase the intensity or duration of exercise gradually;/ Reduce any movement that causes knee pain;/ Maintain a healthy weight, reducing pressure on these joints;/ OrthoInfo, American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons WebMD Load more;/ About us;/ Events;/ Clients and Companions;/ News;/ CUF Academic Center;/ Partnerships;/ Contacts;/ Frequently Asked Questions;/ Join us;/ Virtual Visit;/ English version;/ My CUF;/ Access Solutions and Health Plans;/ Facebook;/ Facebook Instagram;/ Instagram LinkedInCreated with Sketch.;/ LinkedIn Youtube;/ Youtube award4;/ award4 certification1;/ certification1 certification2;/ certification2 certification3;/ certification3 Complaints and compliments;/ Complaints and compliments Privacy and Cookies Policy;/ Terms and Conditions;/ Whistleblower Channel;/ \u00a9 CUF 2024 All rights reserved Start;/ Health A-Z: Diseases, Symptoms and Treatments;/"

    "Wrist instability": {
        "What is it?": "The wrist is a complex structure, composed of bones, ligaments and tendons that together and harmoniously allow movements in different planes. Due to its positioning and range of motion, the wrist is susceptible to constant axial forces and deformation vectors. Wrist stability is defined as its ability to maintain static and dynamic balance between joints under physiological loads and movements. Instability corresponds to the disturbance of this balance, related to bone and/or ligament injuries, resulting in an inability to maintain anatomical and joint relationships and causing a performance deficit, with pain and collapse of the wrist. Acute, repetitive wrist injuries are a leading cause of wrist instability. This instability may also be associated with other diseases such as osteonecrosis, chronic inflammatory diseases (rheumatoid arthritis), some neurological and neoplastic diseases, in addition to specific congenital malformations. Fractures of the radius and scaphoid may also be related to instability. Wrist instability is an often overlooked condition. Adequate interaction between doctors and radiologists is essential to make a correct diagnosis, thus preventing the disease from progressing and preserving patients' quality of life.",
        "Symptoms": "Symptoms vary greatly, with pain, loss of strength or a popping sensation when using the hand being common. Sometimes swelling may occur. Limitation of movement occurs in the late stages",
        "Causes": "Wrist instability is a continuum of disorders that can result from acute trauma or repeated injuries. A fall can cause multiple ligaments to rupture, and repeated minor trauma can damage individual ligaments. These micro-injuries, if left untreated, can progress to arthritis with pain and disability. Sports that involve twisting movements of the wrist (racquet sports, gymnastics) are often associated with this condition, but any sport where there is a risk of falling can be associated with wrist instability.",
        "Diagnosis": "Early diagnosis is essential, however most patients do not seek medical attention immediately because the initial injury tends to be undervalued. Medical observation is very important, and the various bones and ligaments must be palpated and examined. There are some specific maneuvers that contribute to this diagnosis. The diagnosis of wrist instability is a challenge for clinicians and radiologists and must be made based on clinical data and imaging studies. In advanced stages, the diagnosis is obvious, but in the initial stages conventional radiographs may be normal. The initial evaluation should be based on conventional radiographs. If the initial evaluation shows discrete changes, but the clinical findings are suggestive, further studies should be performed. Although rarely used for this diagnosis, magnetic resonance imaging allows the study of ligaments and soft tissues, assisting in eventual surgical planning. Computed tomography is ideal for evaluating bone and joint surfaces. Arthroscopy allows direct visualization of joint surfaces and ligaments.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment will depend on the type of injury detected, the cause, how long it has been developing and the presence of arthritis. Initial treatment methods include immobilization and physical therapy, as well as stopping activities that aggravate symptoms. Whenever possible, affected ligaments should be repaired or reconstructed, which involves surgery. Recovery time varies. Generally, desk work can be resumed after 4 to 6 weeks. Driving can be resumed after 6 to 8 weeks, and activities such as golf or racket sports should be avoided for 3 to 4 months.",
        "Prevention": "Preventing wrist instability in sports depends on adequate physical preparation, with an emphasis on muscle strength, balance, flexibility and defining training programs appropriate for each sport.

    "Heart failure": {
        "What is it?": "Heart Failure corresponds to a clinical situation in which the heart loses its ability to pump blood to meet the body's oxygen and nutrient needs.\u00a0It can result from various diseases or be a degenerative process associated with age. This is a common problem and it is estimated that, in Portugal, it affects around 4.4% of the adult population. For ages over 80 years, this incidence is around 16%. It is a disease closely associated with other highly prevalent diseases such as diabetes and obesity, therefore, its approach must occur in the context of the patient's overall treatment.",
        "Symptoms": "Many of its symptoms are nothing more than the body's attempt to compensate for the heart's increasing inability to circulate blood throughout the body. This compensation involves an increase in the strength and contraction of the heart muscle and its own rhythm, which can generate palpitations; or by greater retention of salt and water in the kidneys in order to increase the volume of circulating blood, which can cause swelling in various parts of the body, depending on the position and the action of gravity (while standing, liquid accumulates). if in the lower limbs; This increase in fluids results in a greater number of urinations during the night. There is also an increase in the thickness of the heart muscle (hypertrophy) which aims to compensate for the lower contractile capacity of this muscle. Although these mechanisms can, at an early stage, compensate for the loss of function of the heart muscle, they tend to introduce additional strain and, as such, contribute to a further deterioration of its function.\u00a0 Heart failure must be promptly diagnosed and treated in order to avoid the development of these mechanisms and all their consequences. In established heart failure, one of the main symptoms is tiredness, which occurs after less and less effort or even at rest. There may also be loss of appetite, coughing or an increase in abdominal volume. The accumulation of fluid in the lungs can cause pulmonary edema, with difficulty breathing and shortness of breath, forcing patients to sleep with the head of the bed elevated or even sitting up.",
        "Causes": "Any disease that affects the heart or blood circulation can cause heart failure. One of the most common is coronary artery disease. These arteries supply blood to the heart muscle itself and, therefore, when affected, this muscle cannot perform its function effectively, which can lead to a heart attack. Other causes are myocarditis (inflammatory and/or infectious processes of the heart muscle), pericarditis (inflammation of the membrane surrounding the heart), diabetes, hyperthyroidism or obesity. As well as changes in the heart valves, arrhythmias and uncontrolled hypertension. Furthermore, any disease that causes a marked increase in the body's consumption of oxygen and nutrients will place additional strain on the heart and, if left untreated, may lead to the development of heart failure.",
        "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis involves assessing the severity of the condition and its underlying cause. Tests usually requested include a chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram and a laboratory study for a more complete evaluation. In some cases, an angiographic study may be necessary.",
        "Treatment": "As a rule, heart failure cannot be reversed and treatment aims to improve quality of life, autonomy and reduce mortality associated with this condition. In addition, it must focus on its cause, which can be medical or surgical, depending on its nature. Blood pressure and cholesterol and diabetes must also be controlled. An adequate diet is essential, as is practicing physical exercises adjusted to each patient's abilities and not smoking. Controlling salt intake is particularly relevant because it is associated with greater fluid retention and, as such, greater stress on the heart. Treatment for heart failure can be done by prescribing: Diuretics, which combat fluid retention;;/ Medicines that increase the strength of the heart muscle contraction and reduce its rhythm, such as digoxin;;/ Vasodilators, which reduce the workload required of the heart. If there is arrhythmia, a pacemaker may need to be implanted;;/ Anticoagulants, as in these patients there is a higher tendency for clots to form inside the heart, which can enter circulation causing distant embolisms.;/ When heart failure is very severe and does not respond adequately to therapy, a heart transplant may be indicated.",
        "Prevention": "Prevention involves adopting a healthy lifestyle in terms of diet, physical exercise, weight control and regular medical check-ups, while also avoiding tobacco, alcohol abuse and illicit substances. If there are risk factors, such as high blood pressure, diabetes or coronary heart disease, prevention involves diagnosing and treating these conditions appropriately before the heart muscle becomes overloaded.

    "Kidney failure": {
        "What is it?": "Kidney failure is a disease caused by the progressive decrease in kidney function. Blood enters the kidneys through the renal arteries and passes to the nephrons which act as small filters. There are about a million in each kidney. This is where excess water and toxic products that form in the body are filtered from the blood. The \u201cclean\u201d blood returns to the bloodstream through the renal veins. Excreted toxins and excess fluid accumulate in the bladder in the form of urine. When the bladder fills, urine is eliminated from the body. If the kidneys become ill, their ability to remove toxins and water that accumulate in the body is reduced and kidney failure develops. Patients with chronic renal failure suffer a slow and progressive loss of kidney functions, that is, their ability to eliminate toxic substances produced by the body, to adequately maintain water and minerals in the body, and to manufacture hormones. Initially, the body adapts and compensates for this loss of function, so that symptoms only appear at a very advanced stage. Often, the first signs are related to anemia, typical in patients with kidney failure. When kidney function drops to 10% to 15%, it is not possible to live without replacement treatment, that is, dialysis or kidney transplantation. Kidney failure tends to affect both kidneys. In fact, a single kidney is enough to maintain completely normal function. It can be acute, when it appears suddenly, normally tending to recover, and chronic, when its failure occurs slowly and progressively, with fewer possibilities of recovery. In Portugal, it is estimated that 800,000 people suffer from chronic kidney disease and that there are around 16,000 people with kidney failure, including those who have already received a kidney transplant. Every year there are more than two thousand new cases of patients with kidney failure and around two thousand are on the waiting list for the possibility of a kidney transplant.",
        "Symptoms": "The kidney is an organ with great functional reserve, capable of adapting to the progressive loss of its function. This means that symptoms only appear when the decrease in function is very great. A chronic patient may be symptom-free until kidney function is at 15% to 20%. However, this situation does not mean that you should not consult a doctor immediately. An earlier diagnosis can slow the progression of the disease and maintain a good quality of life. Progressive tiredness, generalized weakness and fatigue when making small or moderate efforts are some of the symptoms that appear initially. They result from anemia, common in kidney failure. In other cases, insomnia occurs that requires the use of medication. In a more advanced stage, digestive symptoms appear, such as loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting. When there is kidney failure, there is a greater tendency for fluid accumulation (edema), more abundant on the legs at the end of the day and on the face in the early hours of the morning, upon waking up. Increased blood pressure is very common, occurring in around 90% of patients in advanced stages. There may still be a need to get up during the night to urinate several times (nocturia) or sleep with several pillows to improve breathing. Some patients still have generalized itchy skin and it tends to become drier and paler. Other, less common symptoms include menstrual changes in young women and a tendency to bleed into the skin or lose blood from the digestive tract. In acute kidney failure, where the kidneys suddenly stop working, signs include: Fluid retention;/ Internal bleeding;/ Confusion;/ Seizures;/ Coma;/",
        "Causes": "There are several diseases that can cause or contribute to kidney failure. For many, if there is an early diagnosis and adequate treatment, it is possible to avoid this evolution. Glomerulonephritis, pyelonephritis, polycystic kidneys, diabetes and high blood pressure are the most common causes if they are not properly controlled. Diabetes is, in fact, a frequent cause of chronic kidney failure, as well as other serious vascular, ocular, and neurological complications. Vascular kidney diseases are often the result of prolonged hypertension. It may also occur as a result of a urinary tract abnormality or an obstacle in the urinary tract (for example, a stone), or a chronic infection. Abuse of medications that are toxic to the kidneys also tends to lead to chronic kidney failure. The drugs most frequently involved are analgesics and anti-inflammatories, used inappropriately and for long periods of time.",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis is made by carrying out blood and urine tests that allow kidney function to be assessed. Tests that assess the general condition of the body and help understand the cause of kidney failure are also important. Among the analyses, creatinine and creatinine clearance stand out, which are very useful for measuring kidney function. The degree of anemia is measured from hematocrit and hemoglobin levels. It is important to know the levels of calcium and phosphorus in order to prevent bone problems. In diabetic patients, strict control of glucose levels is necessary. Urine analyzes make it possible to assess protein losses (proteinuria) in some patients, as well as the elimination of salt and other products.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment makes it possible to correct problems arising from poor kidney function and prevent kidney failure from occurring or, if it already exists, delay or stop its progression. Includes diet and medication. Diet helps control blood pressure and reduces the accumulation of substances such as urea, phosphorus or potassium, which diseased kidneys cannot eliminate in sufficient quantities. Medication helps control blood pressure, supply hormones that the kidney is unable to produce or relieve symptoms that may appear, such as vomiting and/or itching. There are general recommendations, valid for the general population, such as maintaining a healthy weight, avoiding tobacco and alcohol or regularly exercising. The amount of liquid you should drink varies according to the amount of urine you eliminate daily. There are kidney diseases where you urinate a lot and you need to drink a lot of water. In others, the amount is small and it is necessary to reduce fluid intake so that they do not accumulate. When blood pressure is high, salt should be eliminated and foods that contain it should be avoided. It is also important to control the protein, potassium, fat and sugar content in order to adjust them to the patient's needs. Anemia, bone problems and other diseases should be properly studied and controlled. Calcium and vitamin D may be useful in some situations. Hemodialysis is the method by which the patient's blood is taken, through an extracorporeal circuit, to an artificial semipermeable membrane through which toxic substances that have accumulated in the blood are removed. A hemodialysis session lasts an average of four to five hours and generally occurs three times a week. It can be done in a hospital establishment or in the patient's home. Peritoneal dialysis takes place inside the abdomen, through the membrane that surrounds the intestine (peritoneum). The liquid is placed and drained through a tube that is placed in the abdomen and remains there, allowing continuous use. This technique also allows the extraction of excess liquid and toxins accumulated in the blood and is repeated cyclically. Kidney transplantation is indicated in the most advanced forms of renal failure.",
        "Prevention": "Preventing kidney failure involves early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of conditions that can cause it, such as kidney disease, stones, infections, high blood pressure and diabetes. Correct use of medication, always under medical supervision, is very important because this is a possible cause of kidney failure. Adequate protection of the kidneys also includes a balanced diet, low in salt and fat, regular exercise, avoiding tobacco, restricting alcohol consumption and periodic medical evaluation. Urology Care Foundation, March 2013 Chronic Kidney Disease Management Platform, Ministry of Health, 2013 Portuguese Association of Kidney Insufficiency The Renal Association, 2013 American Kidney Fund, 2013 Dialysis Portal, December 2012 The kidney is a very important organ for the body's balance. Kidney diseases are usually silent, hence the importance of knowing the warning signs. A cause for alarm for anyone who encounters this problem, blood in the urine can be an indicator of several diseases, so it should not be ignored. Hypertension, stroke, dementia, osteoporosis, excess weight. Excess salt can increase the risk of several diseases. The key is moderation.

        "What is it?": "Food sensitivity can be divided into two parts: one is allergy and the other is intolerance. Intolerance to a food is an abnormal reaction, generally continuous and of low reactivity that can occur simply due to the lack of an enzyme necessary for the digestion of a component/part of a food, resulting in chronic inflammation.",

        "Causes": "Intolerances are usually linked to elements present in food, such as: Lactose, a natural sugar found in milk, cheese, and other dairy products;/ Sulfites, present in wines, preserved foods and soft drinks;/ Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, rye and other grains;/ Fructose, a natural sugar found in most fruits and corn syrup;/ Certain carbohydrates (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols) that attract water into the intestine during digestion;/",
        "Diagnosis": "Food intolerance can be difficult to diagnose as symptoms may be associated with just one component of a given food and may also depend on the quantity ingested. The patient's clinical history is essential to identify the foods that trigger complaints. The exclusion of suspected foods should improve symptoms and their reintroduction into the diet may restart complaints. Allergy testing can differentiate between the two distinct conditions.",
        "Treatment": "During the nutrition consultation, a nutritional assessment is carried out and a nutritional plan adapted to any clinical situation is drawn up.",

    "Food poisoning": {
        "What is it?": "Food poisoning is a common, sometimes serious and life-threatening problem. People infected with foodborne disease-causing pathogenic organisms may be asymptomatic or vary in complaints from mild intestinal discomfort to severe dehydration,\u00a0 bloody diarrhea, prostration, and severe changes in general condition and consciousness. The World Health Organization (WHO) has published data that are very enlightening regarding the importance of bacteria, viruses and parasites as causative agents of foodborne diseases. Diarrhea caused by contaminated food and unsafe drinking water is currently the leading cause of illness and death in developing countries, killing around 1.8 million people every year, mainly children. Gastroenteritis is the most prevalent disease worldwide. According to estimates, foodborne illnesses are 300 to 350 times more frequent than reported cases indicate, affecting one in every three people annually. These illnesses are mostly: food poisoning, a term used to encompass infections that occur when food contaminated with a pathogenic microorganism that is capable of growing in the gastrointestinal tract is ingested; and\u00a0 food poisoning, which results from the ingestion of food in which bacteria or other microorganisms previously grew that produced toxins that end up being ingested along with it. Since 2005, the reporting of foodborne outbreaks has been mandatory for all Member States of the European Union. In 2006, 24 countries reported a total of 5,710 outbreaks, involving 53,568 people, resulting in 5,525 hospitalizations and 50 deaths. When comparing the results for that year with those for 2005, there was a 6.6% increase in the number of reported cases. The main foods involved were eggs and egg products (17.8%) and meat (unspecified, responsible for 10.3%). They were followed by fish and fish by-products (17.8%) and dairy products (3.2%). In Portugal, as is the case in most industrialized countries, data on food-borne diseases are scarce, which translates into an underestimation of the real dimension of this issue and, probably, an incorrect perception of the relative importance of each of the pathologies. . Several factors contribute to this situation. Most victims of an infection or food poisoning do not consult a healthcare professional and, when they do, they are rarely subjected to analyzes that allow the responsible agent to be identified.",
        "Symptoms": "The incubation period is the time between consuming food and the appearance of the first symptoms. This can vary from a few minutes to hours and days, depending on the type of agent and the amount of food ingested. Another factor that can influence it is the fact that the symptoms are the result of poisoning or an infection. In intoxication, the signs appear more quickly because the toxin is already present in the food ingested, while in infection the incubation period is longer, as the microbes take some time to proliferate in the digestive system. During incubation, the microbes pass through the stomach and go to the intestine, attaching themselves to the cells in its wall, where they multiply. From that point on, they can invade the intestinal wall, produce toxins or pass into the bloodstream, invading other tissues in the body. The amount of the agent (virus, bacteria, fungus) that needs to be ingested to the point of causing symptoms is called \u201cinfectious dose\u201d. This may vary from person to person, depending on age and the type of agent causing the contamination. There are frequent cases in which several individuals eat the same food but only some become ill, either due to the quantity or the way the body reacts to the infectious agent. The main symptoms are vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, fever, headache, chills, muscle pain, weakness and general discomfort.",
        "Causes": "It is estimated that around 90% of foodborne illnesses are caused by microorganisms. These can be found in almost all foods, but their transmission results, in most cases, from incorrect practices in the last stages of their preparation or distribution. Although more than 250 different types of bacteria, viruses and parasites are known to cause foodborne illnesses, only a few appear frequently. Among the bacteria, Escherichia Coli stands out, which usually causes infection through ingestion of food or water contaminated by feces. Its main symptoms are diarrhea, nausea and fever, which generally appear six to 36 hours after ingestion. Salmonellosis is one of the most common poisonings, caused by the Salmonella bacteria, usually found in eggs, poultry, meat and milk. In most cases, the symptoms begin eight to 48 hours after ingestion, with the main symptoms being diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain and fever. This poisoning is not serious when treated properly, and on average, lasts two to five days. However, when diagnosed in babies, the elderly and debilitated patients or those with serious illness, Salmonellosis can be fatal. Brucellosis is caused by the Brucella bacteria. It is transmitted mainly through unpasteurized dairy products. As such, the main route of poisoning is the ingestion of milk and/or dairy products from animals infected with the bacteria. Symptoms include muscle pain, chills and fever. The incubation period ranges from five to 30 days. The bacterium Clostridium Perfringens is widely distributed in soil and in the intestinal tract of animals. This bacteria produces spores that survive normal cooking temperatures and multiply during cooling. Therefore, even when cooking the meat, potentially pathogenic bacteria still remain. The manifestations of the disease can take six to 24 hours to appear and the most common are abdominal cramps, diarrhea and nausea. Listeriosis is caused by the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes, which mainly affects pregnant women, people with weakened immune systems and newborns. It is often confused with the flu because of some symptoms such as body aches and fever, but it is also accompanied by nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. If the poisoning affects the nervous system, symptoms such as headaches, stiff neck, mental confusion and convulsions may appear. This bacterium is found in raw foods, such as meat and vegetables, and in processed foods, such as unpasteurised milk or cheese. Botulism is caused by a toxin produced by the bacteria Clostridium Botulinum, found mainly in poorly packaged, canned, preserved foods and in cases of inadequate handling and industrialization. In more serious cases, it can cause double vision, difficulty swallowing and speaking, and paralysis. Normally the incubation period is 12 to 72 hours. Poisoning caused by the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus also occurs, which can originate from people who handle food, as this bacteria lodges in the nose, throat or hands. It can also come from foods that are more susceptible to the production of staphylococcal toxin, such as refrigerated or incorrectly stored creams, sandwiches, inadequately refrigerated milk and prepared meats. The main symptoms are vomiting, nausea, diarrhea and abdominal pain. The incubation period is two to six hours. The most common bacterial cause of food poisoning is Campylobacter bacteria, found in raw poultry meat, unpasteurized milk, red meat and untreated water. As for viruses, they can be caused by Hepatitis A, transmitted by water and poorly processed food, and by Rotavirus, an important cause of childhood diarrhea, acquired through water, food, contaminated surfaces and from person to person. Some parasites, such as Giardiasis, cryptosporidiasis, trichiniasis, raw fish disease (caused by the fish parasite, Diphyllobothrium latum, through ingestion of raw or undercooked fish) are also responsible for food poisoning.",
        "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis involves clinical history and medical examination. It may be important to obtain a stool or vomit sample to check for blood or mucus. This is also sent to the laboratory where tests are carried out to find out the exact cause of the food poisoning. A urine sample may also be needed to see if there is an infection. In some cases, a tomography or abdominal x-ray and possibly blood tests are used to screen for other diseases.",
        "Treatment": "a doctor. However, medical help should be sought if the illness lasts more than a few days or if the stool contains blood or yellow or green mucus, or if the poisoning affects pregnant women, elderly people or babies. In some situations, antibiotics may be prescribed for certain types of bacterial infection. The recovery period depends on the type of pathogen, the age and physical condition of the patient. It is important not to eat other foods while symptoms persist. The stomach should rest for about an hour after vomiting, and small amounts of water should be consumed. In fact, hydration is an essential component in the treatment of these illnesses. It is also important to maintain personal hygiene to avoid passing the disease on to others.",
        "Prevention": "The main rules for preventing poisoning are: maintain cleanliness; separate raw foods from cooked ones; cook them well; keep them at the right temperatures; and use safe water and raw materials.

    "Ischemia": {
        "What is it?": "Ischemia is the medical term that designates the presence of inadequate blood and oxygen flow to a specific part of the body. It can occur anywhere, such as the heart, brain, limbs, intestines, eyes and usually results from a narrowing or blockage of the arteries that supply the affected area. This serious condition can cause tissue damage, loss of a limb, or even death.",
        "Symptoms": "The symptoms of ischemia depend on where it occurs and how quickly it sets in. When the process is gradual, the body is able to compensate by supplying blood to the affected area through other arteries. This mechanism keeps the patient free of symptoms for a long time. When it is sudden, the symptoms are more pronounced. When ischemia affects the lower limbs, the most common symptoms are pain, a burning sensation and muscle cramps when walking. These symptoms ease with rest, but can progress to severe pain at rest or even loss of tissue, with gangrene. This condition requires immediate medical attention. If the ischemia is sudden, the pain is more intense, the pulses are not palpable, the limb becomes cold and pale, and weakness and loss of sensation occur. It is mandatory to seek immediate medical attention. At the heart level, it leads to angina pectoris, characterized by pain in the chest region that occurs when walking or exerting yourself and that is relieved by rest. If cardiac ischemia is sudden, a myocardial infarction may occur. In the brain, it causes strokes in the acute form and more non-specific symptoms, such as memory loss or difficulty concentrating, when it sets in gradually. In the intestines, blockage of the arteries tends to occur gradually, causing abdominal pain after meals. The patient becomes afraid to eat to avoid the pain, which causes weight loss. In the acute form, intestinal gangrene may occur with sudden and intense pain that requires urgent medical attention. In the eyes, occlusion of the artery that feeds the retina causes sudden loss of vision that requires urgent evaluation.",
        "Causes": "The main causes and risk factors for ischemia are atherosclerosis, tobacco, advanced age, high cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, diabetes, a family history of cardiovascular disease, a sedentary lifestyle and obesity.",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis depends on the location, but symptoms are always the first source of suspicion. Tests include Doppler ultrasound, angiography, catheterization, magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography, depending on the case and the organs affected. Other tests may be requested to further study the ischemia and detect the risk factors associated with it.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment also depends on the affected area and its severity. In all cases, controlling risk factors is an essential aspect of treatment. In general, treatments aim to improve blood flow to the affected areas. In the specific case of lower limb ischemia, it has been shown that quitting smoking is crucial to prevent the progression of ischemia and prevent the loss of the affected limb. Various classes of medications with hypotensive, vasodilatory, cholesterol-controlling, analgesic or other effects can also be used. Properly advised physical exercise can be useful in lower limb ischemia and angina pectoris. It allows weight loss, control of blood pressure and diabetes and reduction of cholesterol. There are several surgical options for treating ischemia: angioplasty (dilation of obstructed arteries with a balloon and/or reinforcement of the artery wall), bypass surgery to create alternative irrigation routes for the affected areas, administration of drugs that dissolve clots directly into the arteries or surgery to remove atherosclerotic plaques.",
        "Prevention": "It should be based on the prevention of risk factors and their early identification and treatment. Therefore, controlling atherosclerosis, cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes and weight are essential. Smoking should be avoided and physical exercise encouraged.

    "Bunions": {
        "What is it?": "Bunions, or hallux valgus, are a deformity in the big toe, in which its alignment changes and begins to deviate towards the second toe. This deviation results in a bony formation - a bump - on the side of the foot, where the toe joins the foot. This area can become inflamed and cause pain. The term \"hallux\" refers to the big toe. As the hallux deviates from its axis pointing towards the little finger, we speak of a \"valgus\" deviation. This inevitably creates a bony protrusion on the foot, which is also known as a bunion. This defect disturbs the correct alignment of the fingers and, in some cases, the pressure exerted by the big toe can lead to deformation of the joint of the second finger, which in turn \u201cpushes\u201d the third finger and so on. Bunions tend to progress slowly and worsen over time and\u00a0are one of the most common foot deformities, and although anyone can develop them, they are more common among women. The higher prevalence in females is possibly due to the preference for tighter and narrower shoes and the fact that their ligaments are looser.",
        "Symptoms": "The symptoms of bunions only manifest themselves locally, in the area where this deformation is found, and include: Dor;/ Inflammation and redness;/ Burning sensation;/ Calluses;/ Numbness;/ Typically, symptoms occur when wearing shoes that are too narrow, which pinch the toe, forcing them to \u201cclump together\u201d. This happens, for example, with shoes with a pointy shape and high heels. Spending long periods of time standing can also result in worsening symptoms.",
        "Causes": "Bunions are often caused by some type of defect that already exists in the structure of the foot (which is usually genetic) and which increases the likelihood of the person developing them. This is why an individual whose parents or grandparents have bunions is more likely to suffer from this problem as well. Its appearance may also be due to the type of footwear used, for example, when the size is inappropriate or too tight. These can also develop when the big toe pushes against the second toe and causes the toes to cross, making walking difficult due to the pressure that shoes put on the toes. This problem tends to get progressively worse because, as the big toe is tilted, the tendons can no longer pull it in a straight line. Other factors that can contribute to the development of bunions are age, arthritis (such as rheumatoid) and playing sports.",
        "Diagnosis": "Simple observation allows you to check for bunions. However, to assess its severity and degree of deformation, the specialist may use x-rays.",
        "Treatment": "Faced with the existence of bunions, there are several possible scenarios: some people have large deformities that do not cause pain, but difficulties in terms of footwear, while others have small bunions, but which are very painful. Treatment will depend on these characteristics. The specialist - for example, a podiatrist - can recommend some strategies that, although they do not correct the deformation, alleviate the symptoms and prevent their exacerbation, such as: Performing specific exercises;/ Use of orthoses (which can be, for example, rigid to wear at night) and padded protectors;/ Choose suitable, comfortable footwear, preferably low and wider at the front, in order to avoid chafing;/ To relieve pain and inflammation, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, such as ibuprofen, may be prescribed, for example, and the application of ice several times a day may be recommended. When these measures fail and/or the pain interferes with daily activities, surgery can be carried out. This procedure can be performed using an open or minimally invasive (percutaneous) technique. The choice of technique will depend on factors such as the severity and size of the deviation, correction capacity, presence of osteoarthritis and associated pathologies, joint mobility, surgeon preference or length of the big toe in comparison to the others. In both cases, excess bone is removed and osteotomies (cuts in the bone) are performed to realign the finger. This is the only way to correct the deformation. Current anesthesia and pain control techniques have made these procedures faster and less painful, and can be performed on an outpatient basis, but the patient often remains in the hospital for at least one night.",
        "Prevention": "Some measures that you should adopt on a daily basis to prevent the development of bunions include: 1. Choose shoes that fit your feet, spacious enough so that your toes are not squeezed together; 2. Avoid wearing high-heeled shoes with an open heel; 3.Vary the height of your heels throughout the day; 4. If you wear high heels every day, wear ones that are no higher than 4 cm; and 5. Wear shoes that have a buckle over the instep, as this gives the foot more security and helps prevent it from slipping forward.

    "Respiratory function laboratory": {
        "What is it?": "From children to adults, respiratory diseases of the airways, generally chronic, affect more than a third of the population, such as asthma and allergic rhinitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the latter often related to smoking habits. Therefore, with a view to responding to emerging clinical needs, the Allergy Center is equipped with a Respiratory Function Laboratory, fully equipped with the most up-to-date resources to evaluate and diagnose pathologies of the upper and lower airways, in children from the first years of life and adults of any age.",
        "Types of evidence": "Respiratory function tests in infants Aware of the need, in particular clinical cases, to perform functional tests on infants, our Laboratory is equipped with the most sophisticated equipment that allows, under the supervision of highly qualified professionals, to perform respiratory examinations from the first months of life. The Respiratory Functional Testing Laboratory therefore has an unparalleled capacity to respond to all clinical situations in all age groups.  Respiratory function tests in preschool age Respiratory function tests in preschool age have the same methodological character as respiratory function in adults, however, they have important particularities in their technical execution that are fundamental both for the child's collaboration and for obtaining reliable results. and reproducible. The assessment of lung function in preschool age clearly depends on the child's motivation to collaborate, therefore, methodological and intuitive games are used that encourage the child to carry them out, thus completing the necessary respiratory maneuvers. Non-occlusion plethysmography is performed to assess specific airway resistances, and consists of regular breaths at a standard respiratory rate, inside a cabin.",
        "What do we do?": "Respiratory function tests are a set of techniques that allow evaluating the capacity of the lungs at rest and when stimulated by exercise or drugs (bronchodilators or bronchoconstrictors). These exams can be carried out from the age of 3 and allow for an early diagnosis of respiratory changes as well as monitoring their evolution and therapeutic response over the years. In order to also respond to some functional changes that occur during sleep, we also perform sleep tests on an outpatient basis. In our laboratory, the various techniques we have available to fully evaluate the respiratory system are: Spirometry;/ Pletismografia corporal total;/ Alveolar-capillary diffusion;/ Muscle pressures;/ Bronchodilation test;/ Inhalation provocation test;/ Respiratory effort test;/ Bronchial inflammation levels (FeNO);/ Cardiopulmonary exercise test;/ Altitude Tolerance Test;/ Transcutaneous oximetry;/ Night oximetry;/ Polygraphic register I am III;/ Actigraphy;/ Rhinomanometry;/",
        "Techniques": "1. Spirometry Spirometry is the study of lung volumes and flow rates. It is performed using a pneumotachograph, a device that measures airflow and describes it numerically, allowing the determination of several fundamental parameters in the evaluation of bronchial caliber. This is a non-invasive procedure, which is carried out through a forced expiratory maneuver and which encompasses the following phases: breathing at tidal volume, performing a maximum inspiration and culminating in a maximum forced expiration to the residual volume. As with most respiratory exams, there is no mandatory preparation, and you must follow the instructions of the attending physician, namely whether or not to suspend your medication before carrying out the exam.  2. Body Plethysmography (Ventilatory Mechanics) Body Plethysmography allows the assessment of lung volumes in a more detailed way than Spirometry, and is performed as a complementary procedure. Body Plethysmography, in addition to enabling the determination of airway resistance, provides us with access to non-mobilizable lung capacities and volumes, thus playing a crucial role in assessing the effectiveness of ventilatory mechanics. This technique is performed inside a cabin \u2013 Plethysmograph \u2013 where several respiratory maneuvers will be requested, of varying effort, which cause changes in pressure in the cabin and which allow the measurement of data relevant to the study of respiratory function. As with Spirometry, after a baseline study a new assessment can be carried out, either after the administration of a bronchodilator, or after the inhalation of a medication that can cause obstruction of the airways (methacholine), or even after performing physical exercise.  3. Study of Alveolar-Capillary Diffusion The functionality of the pulmonary alveoli may be compromised in various circumstances, which is why its determination is particularly relevant in the assessment of parenchymal lung diseases, in the assessment of pulmonary involvement of systemic diseases, in the evidence of desaturation during exercise, among others. The Diffusion Capacity Study makes it possible to evaluate the diffusion of gases - oxygen and carbon dioxide - across the alveolar capillary membrane. The Single Breath method is the most used and consists, succinctly, of inhaling a gas mixture composed of 10% He (Helium), 0.3% CO (Carbon Monoxide), 21% O2 (Oxygen ) and the rest of Nitrogen. In this technique, you breathe at tidal volume, proceeding with a complete exhalation, followed by a maximum inspiration. After a brief period of apnea, the gas is exhaled. Carbon monoxide, by competing with oxygen in binding to hemoglobin, makes it possible to quantify the alveolar surface available for gas exchange, through its concentration in exhaled air.  4. Nonspecific Inhalation Provocation Test with Methacholine The Non-Specific Inhalation Provocation Test is normally carried out in cases where the existence of bronchial hyperreactivity is suspected or when there is doubt in the diagnosis of immunoallergic pathology, such as asthma. It allows studying the reaction of the airways to a non-specific agent, generally a drug, such as Methacholine. This technique, in our Laboratory, includes the inhalation of different concentrations of methacholine and regular evaluation using flow-volume curves. The test, which may cause some symptoms, such as coughing or difficulty breathing, only ends after the clinical and functional return to initial conditions.  5. Respiratory Stress Test The respiratory effort test is an auxiliary means in the diagnosis of bronconstriction induced by physical exercise and can also be used to monitor the response to established control therapy. The assessment of the response to exercise is carried out by measuring the basal cardio-respiratory parameters and after effort, which is carried out on a treadmill with adjustable speed and incline for 6 to 8 minutes. Respiratory stress tests can be performed on children from the age of six.  6. Gasimetria arterial Arterial blood gas analysis (ABG) is an invasive test that provides us with relevant information about the adequacy of respiratory function (oxygenation, ventilation and acid-base balance), allowing, among other things, to determine the need for oxygen therapy, monitor ventilatory support and the severity of disease progression. This method consists of puncturing an artery, normally the radial artery, whose pulsations are easy to find, approximately 3 cm above the wrist. After collecting a small sample of arterial blood, it is analyzed.  7. Determination of Nitric Oxide in expired air Nitric Oxide (NO) in exhaled air is a very sensitive biochemical marker in the evaluation of bronchial (eosinophilic) inflammation in asthma. Assessment of the exhaled fraction of nitric oxide is a quick, non-invasive and painless method that consists of a single, slow exhalation through a mouthpiece. It is feasible for children from preschool age (3-4 years) to adults.  8. 6-Minute Walk Test The 6-minute Walking Test (PM6M) is an exam that allows the assessment of tolerance to small and medium efforts, useful for evaluating prognosis and/or evaluating therapeutic efficacy. The objective is to walk as fast as possible during the 6 minutes, on a previously defined route in a large space. In addition to other assessments, blood pressure, heart rate, peripheral oxygen saturation, dyspnea classification and arterial blood gas analysis must be monitored before and after PM6M. The distance covered and the evolution of transcutaneous oximetry during the test are recorded, with or without supplementary oxygen supply.  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a very disabling respiratory disease, but it can be prevented and treated. Know your symptoms. It is one of the main causes of hospitalization and death in Portugal. Around 150,000 cases occur every year and pneumonia can affect all ages. Usually caused by a virus, acute laryngitis is more common in winter and children between 3 months and 5 years of age are most affected.

    "Laparoscopy minimally invasive surgery": {
        "What is it?": "Laparoscopy is a minimally invasive surgical technique that allows surgical procedures to be performed in the abdominal and pelvic cavities. When applied to the thorax, it is called thoracoscopy. Nowadays, most general surgery procedures can be performed using the laparoscopic technique. It is a more modern and less invasive surgical technique than conventional surgery, which involves making small incisions (about five millimetres) and using a laparoscope (a high-resolution camera attached to a fibre optic cable), which allows the surgeon to view the different organs on a screen. Laparoscopy is defined as: being less aggressive, causing less pain, allowing for faster post-operative recovery, requiring a shorter hospital stay and, therefore, the patient being able to resume personal, family, social and professional activities sooner. It was in 1989, in Europe, that the first laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed. In Portugal it occurred in 1991.",
        "Advantages": "Laparoscopy is a minimally invasive surgical technique that offers clear benefits when compared to conventional open surgery, namely: minor surgical trauma;/ lower risk of intraoperative bleeding and infection;/ less postoperative pain;/ The hospital stay is significantly shorter (1 to 2 days), even in cases of more extensive surgeries, and some procedures can be performed on an outpatient basis (with discharge on the day of the intervention). This type of surgery also allows for a faster postoperative recovery and an earlier return to usual activities and work. It also has an unquestionable aesthetic benefit, as in laparoscopy the scars are very small (5 to 10 mm).",
        "Technique": "The laparoscopic technique uses fiber optic technology with a video camera and a light source to visualize the intra-abdominal anatomical structures. To do this, it is necessary to create an intra-abdominal space with pneumoperitoneum (by insufflating carbon dioxide into the peritoneal cavity). The surgical procedure through laparoscopy uses small incisions (approximate size of 5 to 12 mm) through the abdominal wall/skin. Depending on the surgery to be performed, these incisions are 3 to 6. Sometimes, to remove the \"operative part - diseased organ\", it is necessary to make a larger incision, which for aesthetic reasons we choose the region below the navel/supra pubis. Laparoscopy always requires general anesthesia, however, it does not alter the possibility of a short hospital stay and potential discharge within 24 hours.",
        "Procedures": "Laparoscopy is often used in the following surgical procedures: Correction of gastroesophageal reflux disease/hiatal hernia;/ Correction of achalasia;/ Obesity surgery;/ Cholecystectomy - Ex.: gallbladder stone surgery;/ Splenectomy - spleen surgery;/ Small bowel surgery - Ex.: Crohn's disease;/ Appendix surgery - appendectomy;/ Colon and rectal surgery - colon and rectal cancer, colon polyp and diverticular disease;/ Diagnostic laparoscopy - for biopsies, e.g. liver or lymph nodes;/ Oncological staging laparoscopy;/ Gynecological surgery - surgery of the ovaries, fallopian tubes and/or uterus. Ex: endometriosis surgery;/ Abdominal wall surgery - hernia treatment;/ Adrenal gland surgery;/  This technique can also be used in other procedures, namely: Stomach surgery - gastrectomy;/ Pancreas and liver surgery;/ Urological surgery;/  Performing laparoscopy in the best conditions requires operating rooms equipped with modern technology, competent and experienced surgical teams with adequate training, and the role of the surgeon is the decision-maker.",
        "Candidates": "Almost anyone can be a candidate for laparoscopy, but there are generally contraindications, such as: blood clotting disorders, severe liver disease, severe cardiopulmonary problems and/or multiple previous abdominal surgeries. And specific situations of the disease and the patient in which the decision to perform the procedure must be made by the surgeon. Sometimes laparoscopic surgery is converted - that is, the surgeon decides to convert the surgery into a laparotomy (larger skin incision), the reasons may be technical or anatomical, but they are always in the best interests of the patient.",
        "Other surgeries": "L.E.S.S. The single-port abdominal surgical technique - also known as L.E.S.S. or scarless surgery - is a minimally invasive technical approach par excellence. It differs from conventional laparoscopy in that it uses a single small port/incision within the umbilicus. This technique involves some specific instruments and devices, and current experience is limited to a few surgical procedures (such as cholecystectomy and some surgical procedures for colon diseases and obesity).  T.EM., T.E.O. eT.A.M.I.S. Transanal surgeries - known as T.E.M. (Transanal Endoscopic Microsurgery), T.E.O. (Transanal Endoscopic Operations) or TAMIS (Trans Anal Minimally Invasive Surgery) - are primarily minimally invasive surgical techniques. They provide excellent results in the surgical treatment of some lesions of the anal canal and rectum, particularly polyps and tumors/cancers. Ant\u00f3nio Manso and Nuno Bonito, CUF specialists, explain the importance of early diagnosis and surgical treatment in colorectal cancer. Watch the video. Laparoscopy is a less invasive surgical technique. However, it cannot be used in all cases and sometimes the best solution is conventional surgery.

    "Laryngitis": {
        "What is it?": "Laryngitis is a condition in which inflammation and edema of the larynx occurs, which is the respiratory organ where the vocal cords are located. The larynx plays a fundamental role in breathing, swallowing and speaking. It can be acute or chronic, although in most cases the condition is temporary and does not have serious consequences. It is a common situation and can become chronic in around \u2155 of the population throughout their lives.",
        "Symptoms": "Laryngitis can cause several symptoms: Hoarseness;/ Difficulty speaking;/ Sore throat;/ Low fever;/ Persistent cough;/ Frequent throat clearing;/ These symptoms begin suddenly and usually become more severe within two or three days. In uncomplicated situations, the clinical picture normalizes in about 7 days. Prolonging complaints involves further investigation to exclude the presence of other causes. Laryngitis is generally associated with other diseases that affect other levels of the airways, such as: tonsillitis, pharyngitis, cold or flu. The following symptoms may also manifest: Headache;/ Swelling and pain on palpation of the neck lymph nodes;/ Pain when swallowing;/ Fatigue and malaise;/",
        "Causes": "Acute laryngitis corresponds to colds. Chronic laryngitis can have several causes, the most common being acid reflux, smoking and allergies.",
        "Diagnosis": "The clinical picture of hoarseness and local discomfort, in the context of a respiratory infection or inhalation of irritating products, is suggestive of the diagnosis of acute laryngitis. In prolonged situations, direct examination of the vocal cords is essential to detect changes such as irregularities of the vocal cords, tumors, nodules and polyps. Direct observation of the vocal cords is performed by an otolaryngologist who will use a videolaryngoscope, a medical imaging device with a video camera on the end for direct viewing. If necessary or if malignant lesions are suspected, a tissue biopsy will be necessary to correctly diagnose the lesion.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment of laryngitis requires control of its triggering factors and, in some cases, surgery is necessary.",
        "Prevention": "Quit smoking and avoid secondhand smoke. Smoke is irritating to the lining of the larynx and the vocal cords.;/ Limit alcohol and caffeine intake;/ Drink plenty of water. Liquids help to thin the mucus in your throat.;/ Avoid eating spicy foods that cause heartburn or gastric reflux;/ Include whole grains, fruits and vegetables in your diet.

    "Knee cartilage injury": {
        "What is it?": "Knee cartilage injuries often refer to tears of the menisci, which are themselves cartilaginous structures.  The articular surfaces of long bones are covered by cartilage. When this cartilage suffers an injury, it is called a chondral injury or, if the injury also involves the bone, it is called an osteochondral injury.  These two types of injuries are common in people under 35 and over 60 years of age.  Cartilage injuries can occur in sports where rotation, twisting, deceleration, tackling, dribbling or direct contact movements occur.  There are several daily activities that affect the knee, given the complexity of its structure and the diversity of elements that make up this joint.  Knee cartilage injuries are difficult to treat given their reduced capacity for regeneration and the hostile environment that surrounds the knee joint, which is constantly subjected to countless efforts. As such, they tend to progress to disabling pain and early osteoarthritis.",
        "Symptoms": "As articular cartilages are not vascularized nor do they have nerve structures, pain is not a common symptom. However, some patients may report pain at rest that is aggravated by weight-bearing exercises.  If these injuries persist for a long time, knee weakness occurs related to loss of muscle mass and instability of the adjacent ligaments.  If one of the cartilage fragments becomes loose, it can block the movement of the joint.  In some cases, a stroke may occur.  Palpation of the knee is painful and pain is induced by active and passive movements. If the knee is unstable, these movements produce crepitus.",
        "Causes": "Trauma is the most common\u00a0cause of injury but this can also result from repeated exertion.  Rotational forces occurring in direct trauma are most frequently involved in articular cartilage injury.  It is rare for an isolated injury to the articular cartilage to occur, usually with injuries to the ligaments or menisci.  Osteochondral lesions are more common in adolescents.  Articular cartilage has little ability to regenerate, which is why these injuries lead to the formation of scar tissue, deficient in collagen and with less capacity to bear load. This deterioration can progress to chronic pain and loss of function and cause an early onset of osteoarthritis.",
        "Diagnosis": "Knee assessment always involves clinical history, medical examination and study using x-rays and/or magnetic resonance imaging.  Sometimes, it may be necessary to perform an arthroscopy, through the creation of small incisions, in order to directly observe the damaged structures.",
        "Treatment": "Diagnosis here can be delayed because symptoms are not always very obvious and patients do not remember any significant trauma.  When the injuries are recent, you must wait some time to assess the evolution of the cartilage and to check whether or not symptoms occur.  If the pain persists after the initial phase, surgery allows for better recovery and should not be delayed.  Conservative treatment is based on rest, with the use of crutches for the first 24-48 hours, application of ice for 20 minutes per hour for the first 48 hours after the injury, compression with an elastic bandage and elevation of the leg above the level of the heart.  The use of anti-inflammatory drugs or the injection of corticosteroids into the affected area are important complements to treatment.  When the pain and inflammation subside, it is important to increase the strength and range of motion of the knee in order to stimulate the healing potential of the articular cartilage. This objective is achieved by performing passive movements that stimulate the movement of synovial fluid, with better diffusion of nutrients to the affected cartilage, and that reduce the formation of scar tissue at the joint level.  Surgery is indicated for more extensive or symptomatic lesions and involves debridement of the cartilage, the use of grafts or the transfer of cells that stimulate cartilage regeneration.  Recovery from this type of injury is better when its size is less than 2 cm, when symptoms have lasted less than 18 months before surgery, if no previous surgery has occurred, in younger patients and in those who already practice sports.

    "Anterior cruciate ligament injury": {
        "What is it?": "The Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) is a band that connects the femur to the tibia, functioning as a pivot in movement and stabilizing the knee.  An ACL injury is one of the most common knee ligament injuries. It is often associated with meniscus injury. When left untreated, an ACL injury can lead to the development of early osteoarthritis of the knee.  The growing trend towards sports, combined with the complexity of different sports, has caused an increase in the number of knee joint injuries. The anterior cruciate ligament is among the most affected and is one of the structures that, when injured, makes it more difficult to return to sport.  The function of the cruciate ligaments is to ensure normal movement between the articular surfaces of the femur and tibia.  These ligaments, as the name suggests, cross each other forming an \u201cX\u201d and allow control of the anterior and posterior movements of the knee. The anterior cruciate ligament prevents the tibia from sliding forward on the femur and provides stability in the rotation of the knee.  Anterior cruciate ligament injuries are common and approximately 70% of these injuries occur during sports.  Between 70% and 90% of injuries to this ligament occur in situations without direct contact against the knee and are often associated with injuries to other structures (menisci, ligaments and cartilage), as isolated injuries are rare.  The sports most involved are basketball, football, volleyball, skiing and others where there is a high frequency of decelerations, rapid changes of direction and falls to the ground following jumps.  Most injuries to this ligament are secondary to one or more of the following maneuvers: the foot resting on the ground and the knee close to maximum extension, deceleration and sudden change of direction.  These injuries can be classified according to their severity: Grade 1: Mild injury in which the ligament is slightly stretched but is still able to keep the knee joint stable. Grade 2: here the strain is greater and the tendon becomes loose, which may result in a partial rupture. Grade 3: corresponds to a complete rupture of the ligament with instability of the knee joint.  Partial ruptures are rare, being almost always complete or nearly complete.",
        "Symptoms": "Most Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injuries are associated with sports injuries: sprains, falls, changes in direction or direct trauma.  An ACL tear is often described as a \"pop\" or \"snap\" associated with pain, effusion, and lameness of the knee, typically with decreased mobility. Patients often report a feeling of instability or giving way in the knee after the acute phase (first few weeks) if left untreated.  Swelling secondary to hemarthrosis (accumulation of blood in the joint) is observed a few hours after the injury, worsening painful symptoms and functional limitation. It is estimated that around 75% of injuries to this ligament are associated with acute hemarthrosis.  Feelings of instability, characterized by false steps, are common during attempts to return to sport and can also manifest themselves in daily life activities.",
        "Causes": "The main risk factors for the occurrence of this injury are often related to the equipment and the interactions between the footwear and the ground. They may also depend on the patient's anatomy (knee and hip angle, ligament laxity), hormonal and biomechanical factors (muscle strength, body movement, neuromuscular control). Body mass index, limb asymmetry, individual genetics, autoimmunity and metabolic disorders are also important.  The incidence of non-contact anterior cruciate ligament injuries in females has been estimated to be 6 to 8 times higher than in males competing in the same sports.",
        "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis is made through clinical history and physical examination. Some special tests may be used in the diagnosis of anterior cruciate ligament insufficiency.  X-rays are used to evaluate bone lesions, although magnetic resonance imaging is the most effective diagnostic imaging method.",
        "Treatment": "In the initial phase, painkillers and anti-inflammatories may be prescribed, together with an appropriate physiotherapy plan. Although they do not treat the ligament injury, they can relieve pain and improve function in less active patients.  In active patients, conservative treatment is insufficient, and ACL reconstruction (ligamentoplasty) through arthroscopy with tendon graft is indicated to restore function and prevent osteoarthritis.  The decision regarding the form of treatment must be considered based on the analysis of some variables such as the patient's age, level of activity (sedentary, recreational athlete, competitive athlete), degree of instability, associated injuries, willingness to participate in a program post-operative rehabilitation and future expectations.  The patient's level of physical activity is the single most important factor in the therapeutic decision for this injury. Sedentary patients, without a great appetite for sport, may be treated conservatively, with physiotherapy being important for the treatment of inflammatory symptoms (pain and swelling), complete restoration of movement, recovery from muscle atrophy and return to satisfactory functional conditions for daily life activities.  The indications for surgical treatment of anterior cruciate ligament injuries are patients with symptomatic instability in daily and sporting activities, the desire to maintain sporting activity and the ineffectiveness of conservative treatment.  Several surgical techniques have been developed to treat these injuries and the final results depend not only on the technique used, but also on the post-operative rehabilitation. The strategy to be adopted should always be appropriately individualized.  In general, the two portions of the ligament are sutured or the ligament is reconstructed using grafting techniques.  Surgery is performed using arthroscopy, which involves making small incisions, being less invasive, less painful and requiring a shorter hospital stay.  Recovery after surgery is slow, and it may take 6 months or more before you can resume sports activities. Physiotherapy is essential to gradually restore ligament flexibility and muscle strength.",

    "Posterior cruciate ligament injury": {
        "What is it?": "Posterior cruciate ligament injuries are usually caused by a blow to the front of the knee or by landing poorly on the leg during vigorous play.  This ligament is located at the back of the knee and prevents the tibia from moving backwards too much.  Posterior cruciate ligament injury requires violent trauma, such as a knee being struck against a car dashboard in a car accident or a football player falling onto a bent knee.  In fact, this ligament is stronger than the anterior cruciate ligament, making it more difficult to injure. When injury occurs, it tends to be more subtle and more difficult to assess than injuries to other ligaments. Like injuries to the anterior cruciate ligament, injuries to the posterior cruciate ligament are associated with injuries to other ligaments, cartilage and bones.  These types of injuries can be classified according to their severity: Grade 1: Mild injury in which the ligament is slightly stretched but is still able to keep the knee joint stable. Grade 2: here the strain is greater and the tendon becomes loose, which may result in a partial rupture. Grade 3: corresponds to a complete rupture of the ligament with instability of the knee joint.  Unlike the anterior cruciate ligament, partial tears are the most common here, with the potential for spontaneous regeneration.  Patients with this type of injury are usually able to resume sporting activity without knee stability problems.",
        "Symptoms": "These injuries manifest as pain and swelling that occur quickly after the trauma. The swelling increases the stiffness of the knee and can cause difficulty in walking. The knee becomes unstable, appearing to \u201cgive way\u201d during walking.",
        "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis involves a medical examination, x-ray and magnetic resonance imaging.",
        "Treatment": "This type of injury can be recovered without surgery, using rest, ice, compression and elevation.  The use of crutches provides additional protection, reducing the weight supported by the leg.  Physiotherapy allows the recovery of knee function and leg muscle strength.  Surgery will be necessary when there is damage to several structures and involves reconstructing the ligament using a graft, using the arthroscopy technique already mentioned.  The recovery process after surgery is slow, lasting several months, and requires physical therapy to begin 1 to 4 weeks after surgery.

    "Quadriceps tendon injury": {
        "What is it?": "This tendon works with the muscles on the front of the thigh, the quadriceps, and provides strength to the leg.  Its rupture is more common in middle-aged people and those who play sports that involve running or jumping.  These tears can be partial or complete. In the latter case, significant disability occurs and the knee cannot straighten when the quadriceps contracts.  Ruptures of this tendon are more common after the age of 40, with a peak incidence between 60 and 70 years of age. Men are affected 4 to 8 times more often than women.  This is an extraordinarily strong tendon and resistant to rupture, so its injury involves very violent trauma.",
        "Symptoms": "This rupture is associated with a \u201ctearing\u201d or \u201cclicking\u201d sensation followed by pain and swelling.  A depressed area may be noticeable at the location of the patella where the tendon is inserted, formation of a hematoma and difficulty walking.  The knee appears to be dislocated downwards and it is not possible to straighten the leg.",
        "Causes": "This rupture occurs when a heavy load is applied to the leg with the foot resting on the ground and the knee partially flexed. Other possible causes are falls, cuts and the application of a direct force to the front of the knee.  Weakness of the tendon makes it more likely to rupture. This weakness can result from tendonitis, which is common in athletes who put a lot of strain on the tendon (jumping, running).  Tendon weakness also occurs in diseases that affect muscle and ligament blood flow, such as chronic kidney disease, hyperparathyroidism, gout, leukemia, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus, diabetes, metabolic diseases, infections.  The presence of a rupture of both quadriceps tendons is strongly suggestive of the co-existence of a systemic disease.  The use of corticosteroids weakens both muscles and tendons and fluoroquinolones (a class of antibiotics) are also associated with quadriceps tendon injury.  Other possible factors are prolonged immobilization, which involves loss of strength and flexibility, and previous knee surgery.",
        "Diagnosis": "Clinical history and medical examination are essential and are complemented by radiography and magnetic resonance imaging.",
        "Treatments": "Treatment depends on the type and extent of the injury, the patient's activity level, and age.  Partial and small tears respond well to conservative treatment, using immobilization for 3 to 6 weeks and physiotherapy to regain strength and mobility.  Anti-inflammatory medications are also important.  Surgery may be important in some partial tears associated with tendon degeneration, especially in more active people. Surgery is equally important in complete ruptures and allows the tendon to be reinserted into the patella.  This surgery must be performed early to prevent scar tissue from forming and the tendon from shortening.  Recovery after surgery requires pain control with anti-inflammatories, ice and immobilization.  Physiotherapy will be essential in recovering strength and mobility.  Complete recovery takes an average of 4 to 6 months.",
        "Prevention": "Preventing injuries to this tendon involves avoiding running on very hard surfaces, avoiding climbing or jumping, stretching your knees before and after exercise, as well as adequately warming up before exercising.

    "Lateral ligament injury": {
        "What is it?": "The two lateral ligaments, internal and external, are located on the lateral regions of the knee. The internal ligament joins the femur to the tibia and the external ligament joins the femur to the fibula.  These ligaments control the lateral movements of the knee and provide restraint against abnormal movements.  Lateral ligament injuries can be classified according to their severity:  Grade 1: Mild injury in which the ligament is slightly stretched but is still able to keep the knee joint stable. Grade 2: here the strain is greater and the tendon becomes loose, which may result in a partial rupture. Grade 3: corresponds to a complete rupture of the ligament with instability of the knee joint.",
        "Symptoms": "These lesions cause pain and swelling, which will be in the inner or external region of the knee as a function of the affected lateral ligament.  The knee becomes unstable, creating the sensation that it is going to give way.",
        "Causes": "This type of injury is usually caused by a direct blow to the outside of the knee, as seen in contact sports (football, handball). Skiing is another sport associated with lateral ligament injury.  These injuries occur from any direct contact or from an intense muscle contraction, such as a quick change of direction.  A slight fall or a sudden movement caused by accidentally slipping are other possible causes.  The internal ligament is injured more frequently than the external ligament. Given the complexity of the anatomy of the external region of the knee, external ligament injury usually involves other structures.  Although injuries to the lateral ligaments usually result from a force that pushes the knee to one side, as happens in contact sports, this is not the only possible mechanism.  Injuries to the internal ligament result from trauma to the external region of the knee, and blows to the internal region injure the external ligament.",
        "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis involves a medical examination, radiographic studies and magnetic resonance imaging.  Although radiography does not identify the ligaments, it allows the presence of changes in adjacent bones to be assessed.",
        "Treatment": "Injuries to the lateral ligament rarely require surgery. If the external ligament injury involves other structures, treatment should include those structures.  Using crushed ice directly on the affected area (but not in direct contact with the skin) for 15 to 20 minutes at intervals of at least one hour helps the healing process.  It is important to protect the knee from lateral movement, which can be achieved by reducing daily activities, using a splint, and using crutches.  Physiotherapy allows you to perform extension exercises that restore knee function and strengthen the leg muscles.  Surgery will be necessary if the lateral ligament injury is very serious or if it is associated with injuries to other knee structures.  Surgery may involve repairing or reconstructing the affected ligament.",
        "Prevention": "Adopting preventive attitudes in sport and in daily life can prevent the incidence of ligament injuries.  According to some studies, adequate physical preparation reduces the risk of knee injuries by up to 88%.  Muscle strength is essential for knee stability. However, if the muscles are strong but do not work in harmony, instability can occur, which can lead to injuries.  As such, the most recommended exercises for developing good muscular balance are those that reproduce natural movements, such as squats, as all the muscles involved in the joint are used.  Proper training planning is also essential to avoid injuries. The lack of muscle recovery, the use of high and prolonged loads during training, can increase the risk of injury to a healthy structure or one that has already undergone surgery.

    "Ankle cartilage injuries": {
        "What is it?": "The cartilage of the ankle joint provides a smooth, firm surface that allows for smooth movement. Damage to this cartilage can lead to damage to the joint surfaces.  Ankle cartilage injuries can result from trauma or a degenerative process.  In young people, traumas occur in sports such as football or handball, often with associated sprains, and, in these cases, a fragment of cartilage (1 to 2 cm in diameter) detaches from the rest of the surface, leaving its edges intact. As long as the bone is intact and there is good capacity for regeneration, this type of injury responds very well to treatment.  Degenerative injuries, resulting from continued stress over a long period of time, have a more unfavorable outcome. In these cases, the cartilage initially softens, with the formation of fissures and a reduction in the thickness of the cartilage, which becomes fragile and friable.  Once this process sets in, a spontaneous recovery is no longer possible. Although the pain is not always significant, these situations are serious and must be treated in their early stages. In more advanced stages, treating the injury and relieving pain often requires the use of joint prostheses.",
        "Symptoms": "Cartilage lesions can vary in size, location and depth. Symptoms will vary depending on these parameters.  When cartilage damage is extensive, severe pain, swelling and stiffness of the joint occur.  If a fragment of cartilage becomes detached, it can become trapped between the joint surfaces, blocking their movement and causing pain and an inability to walk.",
        "Causes": "The ankle is frequently involved in workplace accidents and cartilage injuries occur following sprains. Therefore, the risk factors for these injuries are identical to those described for ankle sprains.  As this cartilage is poorly vascularized and has reduced potential for regeneration in adults, treatment is essential to control pain and swelling and achieve a full recovery.",
        "Diagnosis": "Medical examination and clinical history provide essential elements for diagnosis.  Radiography is important to exclude fractures but does not allow detecting changes on the cartilage surface.  These changes will be better evaluated through magnetic resonance imaging.",
        "Treatment": "Immobilization associated with the use of anti-inflammatory drugs is very useful.  Whenever possible, physiotherapy should be incorporated as soon as possible to speed up the return to work or sports. This physiotherapy includes strength and flexibility exercises and the use of ultrasound.  When inflammation is severe, cortisone injection into the ankle joint is very helpful.  If symptoms persist or if the cartilage damage is extensive and deep, with fragments trapped in the articular surface, surgery is indicated. Surgery makes it possible to remove loose fragments, repair the cartilage or, when this is not possible, stimulate a bone response so that a tissue that simulates cartilage is formed.  After surgery, there will be a period of immobilization and use of crutches for around two weeks, which will be followed by an entire physiotherapy program.  Returning to pre-injury activities is generally possible 4 to 6 weeks after surgery.  The prognosis for cartilage injuries is good, although progression to arthritis can occur, especially when there is loss of cartilage and formation of scar tissue.",
        "Prevention": "Since the causes of cartilage injuries are similar to those of sprains, prevention is identical and involves adequately maintaining the strength, flexibility and balance of the ankle joint.  In the case of sport, it is essential to warm up correctly and define specific training programs for each modality and to wear suitable footwear that must be replaced when wear on the sole is visible.  In the case of running, very uneven surfaces should be avoided.  Whenever signs of fatigue occur, rest is crucial.

    "Triangular fibrocartilage injuries": {
        "What is it?": "The wrist is a special joint, given its flexibility and strength. It allows for very wide movements and is stable enough to handle delicate or very heavy objects. The joints, bones, tendons and ligaments that make up the wrist depend on cartilage to protect these structures, thus preventing serious injuries from occurring. If this cartilage is damaged by a fall, improper twisting, repeated activity, or arthritis, the entire wrist and hand can be affected. If the problem is not diagnosed and promptly treated, it can cause chronic discomfort or even disability. Cartilage problems in the wrist generally occur after a fall in which the person tries to protect themselves by violently placing their hands on the ground. When the cartilage is stretched and ruptures, inflammation, swelling, intense pain and limited hand movement occur. One of the most common injuries is that of triangular fibrocartilage. The term \u201ctriangular fibrocartilage complex\u201d describes the close anatomical and functional relationship between the ulnar structures of the wrist. Instability of the joint between the radius and ulna is the most debilitating lesion seen in this complex. It is a structure made up of cartilage and ligaments and its function is to stabilize the wrist bones, cushion impacts and allow smooth movements.",
        "Symptoms": "These injuries cause pain in the wrist, especially when moving the hand toward the little finger or when rotating the hand upward. These movements may be accompanied by an audible click. The wrist tends to become swollen, unstable and weak, being unable to perform delicate movements.",
        "Causes": "The most common injury mechanisms are axial loading, ulnar displacement, or extreme rotation of the forearm. This structure can be injured in a fall, during sports or at work. Falls onto an outstretched hand are one of the most common causes. Twisting or pressing movements are other possibilities. Some of the associated sports are those that involve a bat or racket and these movements are also seen in some professional activities where the manipulation of instruments is necessary. On the other hand, these structures can undergo degenerative processes with subsequent rupture and difficult healing, given their reduced vascularization.",
        "Diagnosis": "During medical examination, there is pain on local palpation. Instability of the radioulnar joint may occur. Since most of the ulnar structures are soft tissue, conventional radiography is often normal and should be used in the evaluation of fracture injuries. Magnetic resonance imaging is the main means of diagnosis and arthroscopy allows concomitant evaluation and treatment. Arthroscopy can be useful when other tests are inconclusive. This examination uses a small instrument that is introduced through a small incision and allows direct observation of the injured structures.",
        "Treatment": "Injuries can be acute or chronic and acute surgical treatment is reserved for unstable or displaced fractures. Treatment depends on the symptoms present and the severity of the injury. In some cases a splint or bandage is sufficient. Cartilage injuries may cause less pain over time even if they do not heal. Elements such as ice, anti-inflammatories and local corticosteroid injections may be indicated in some cases. If symptoms do not improve, surgery will be indicated, generally using the less invasive technique of arthroscopy. This technique uses small incisions and allows the repair of cartilage injuries and is less invasive, allowing for faster recovery. This arthroscopic repair is possible in radial disinsertions with a 92% success rate. The classic approach is reserved for ulnar disinsertions and a tendon graft may be necessary. Recovery after treatment will depend on each case and will depend on an individualized physiotherapy program.",

    "Elbow injuries": {
        "Elbow injuries": "The elbow is the joint located in the median region of the arm where three long bones meet: the humerus, the radius and the ulna. The humerus is located in the arm and articulates with the ulna in the inner region of the forearm and with the radius in the outer region of the forearm. This joint allows rotation, flexion and extension movements of the arm. Flexion of the forearm is performed by the biceps and extension depends on the triceps. The outermost region of the elbow is called the external epicondyle and belongs to the humerus. Injury to the tendons that are inserted there corresponds to tendonitis or external epicondylitis (tennis elbow). The innermost region of the elbow is called the internal epicondyle. Injury to the tendons that are inserted there corresponds to tendonitis or internal epicondylitis (golfer's elbow). There is also a pocket filled with fluid (bursa) that reduces friction associated with movements. The elbow can be affected by inflammation of tendons or bursa, fractures, arthritis or irritation of nerve structures. The sports most associated with elbow injuries are tennis, golf, contact sports, martial arts and football. However, elbow injuries can occur in a large number of sports, the most relevant being those in which there is excessive use of the joint, such as sports with throwing movements (volleyball, baseball) or those in which sudden trauma can occur.

    "Shoulder injuries": {
        "Symptoms": "Shoulder pain is the most common symptom and may have certain patterns that are more typical of certain pathologies. For example, nighttime pain felt in the front or more lateral region is often associated with tendonitis or rotator cuff tears. On the other hand, pain that may persist throughout the day in the upper region and radiating to the cervical region may be related to contractures of the muscles around the shoulder, such as the trapezius or pectoral muscles. Pain that appears first thing in the morning and eases throughout the day may have an inflammatory cause, such as rheumatoid arthritis. Shoulder stiffness is another common symptom, characterized by loss of active and passive mobility, often accompanied by crepitus or a sensation of locking. Stiffness can be confused with limited mobility caused by pain, or the inability to actively move due to tendon ruptures that lead to loss of arm elevation. Instability is the opposite of stiffness. This symptom manifests itself as the sensation that the shoulder may come out of the joint, and can even occur in different circumstances, in the case of dislocation. More subtle manifestations of instability can also occur, such as a nonspecific and deep pain, a feeling of numbness in the arm or fatigue more easily with shoulder movements.",
        "What are the most common shoulder injuries?": "Shoulder injuries are common and can have a variety of causes. The most frequent are related to the rotator cuff tendons, whether degenerative tendonitis or ruptures, or calcific tendonitis. Shoulder osteoarthritis (primary or secondary) is another common cause of pain and functional limitation and is characterized by the progressive loss of articular cartilage. Other problems may be due to trauma or excessive strain on the shoulder, such as fractures of the proximal humerus and clavicle, shoulder and acromioclavicular dislocations, or traumatic rotator cuff tears.",
        "Diagnosis": "Assessment by an orthopedic doctor specialized in shoulder surgery will help to define the main hypotheses and which imaging methods are most suitable for diagnosing each patient. In general, the initial study consists of an X-ray of the shoulder with views appropriate to the diagnostic suspicions in question. This exam is usually complemented with more advanced imaging methods. Although ultrasound is useful for tendon injuries of the shoulder, magnetic resonance imaging is more accurate for characterizing injuries to tendons, ligaments and cartilage. Additionally, it can help understand the prognosis of certain injuries if repairs are attempted. Computerized axial tomography (CT) is useful in trauma situations or when an in-depth study of bone structures, such as osteoarthritis, is required. Currently, 3D reconstruction methods allow for highly reliable reproductions of anatomy and even allow the development of navigation solutions or simulation of implant placement, when necessary.",
        "Treatment": "Conservative treatment using analgesia and physiotherapy targeted to each patient can be the first line for most of these injuries. Infiltrations or other techniques that aim to reduce pain and disability can also be added, including preparations that stimulate regeneration, such as platelet-rich plasma. For some pathologies, minimally invasive treatment using arthroscopy (video surgery) allows the reconstruction of damaged structures and a faster recovery with less pain, through small incisions in the skin. Certain traumatic injuries or more advanced osteoarthritis situations may require conventional open surgery using joint prostheses or implants to fix the fragments. Advances in technology have allowed the development of increasingly personalized and individualized solutions for each patient, less invasive and with better results.",
        "Prevention": "The prevention of shoulder injuries is mainly suited to those that are due to overload or excessive efforts, in a professional, sporting or other activity context. Performing repetitive movements, especially with the arms above the head, must be complemented by muscle strengthening and coordination exercise programs that minimize overload. In certain sports that require throwing, it is also important to work on the back, abdominal and hip muscles, so that the entire movement is coordinated and carried out from a stable base. Inflammatory diseases that affect the shoulder, such as rheumatoid arthritis, can spare this joint if they are diagnosed at an early stage and there is a good response to the treatment implemented. Traumatic injuries, although unpredictable, can be minimized in older individuals. Anti-osteoporotic therapy and maintaining good physical condition to prevent falls can reduce the likelihood of proximal humerus fractures and other fractures in the shoulder region that frequently affect these age groups.

        "What is it?": "Foot and ankle injuries are very common and can occur in athletes or non-athletes, children and adults. They can result from physical or sporting activity or occur while walking or going down stairs. Ankle injuries account for about 25% of all sports injuries. For basketball, they correspond to 21% to 53% of total injuries and for football, around 17% to 29%. In children, most of these injuries occur during sports or after an accidental fall.",
        "Causes": "The risk tends to be greater in sports that involve jumping, such as basketball, or those where rapid changes of direction occur, such as football.\u00a0Dance and gymnastics are also associated with this type of injury. Loss of muscle mass and osteoporosis, more common in old age, increase the risk of foot and ankle injuries. Difficulties in vision and balance associated with age further increase this risk.",
        "Diagnosis": "Most of these injuries heal spontaneously. The high number of recurrent injuries and the long-term complications resulting from instability and the development of arthritis suggest that the approach to these injuries is not always ideal. Often, athletes resume activity too soon, which increases the risk of relapse and complications.  Load more;/ Cardiology and Sports Medicine are two specialties that \"work\" in synergy.

        "What is it?": "Wrist and hand injuries are among the most common in traumatology. Some of the sports that are associated with hand and wrist injuries are hockey, skating, cycling and boxing. Children and adolescents have more wrist injuries than adults. Of sports injuries, 3 to 9% involve the hand and wrist . In football, this percentage can reach 14% and in gymnastics, values \u200b\u200bbetween 46 and 87%. Although common, many athletes do not seek treatment and this delay can cause long-term problems.",
        "Causes": "Hand and wrist injuries can have a variety of causes, such as rheumatological diseases, metabolic disorders, tumors, infectious diseases and trauma. They can result from repeated microtraumas or single traumas.",
        "Treatment": "This type of injury needs to be treated and this treatment, carried out immediately after diagnosis, must be done aggressively in order to obtain the best results in the shortest possible time. To this end, diagnostic aids and surgical techniques must be used with the aim of achieving full recovery, which is essential for continuing to practice sports.",
        "Prevention": "The best prevention of hand and wrist injuries is the use of appropriate equipment that protects the hands and wrists.

    "Meniscus lesions": {
        "What is it?": "Intact articular cartilage is soft, smooth, uniform and covers the entire bone surface. Intense, repetitive and compressive movements caused by sports or falls can cause injuries and deterioration of the cartilage tissue. Injury or rupture of the meniscus is one of the most common knee injuries. This type of injury is also referred to as cartilage rupture. Each knee has two menisci: a lateral or outer meniscus and a medial or inner meniscus, which act as stabilizers and shock absorbers for the knee. The menisci are rigid and rubber-like in structure to keep the knee stable. Any accident associated with twisting the knee, with or without load, can cause a meniscal injury. An untreated meniscus injury can lead to the development of early knee osteoarthritis. This type of injury is very common, especially in contact sports, although it can occur at any age. The menisci can rupture in different ways and, frequently, these injuries are associated with changes in the cruciate ligaments or others.",
        "Symptoms": "Meniscal injury is associated with knee pain and lameness, typically with decreased mobility and/or joint effusion. When the meniscus ruptures, a noise may be heard. Most people can walk even with the rupture and many athletes continue to play sports. After 2 to 3 days, the knee becomes less mobile and swollen. The most common symptoms are pain, stiffness, swelling, a feeling of loss of control of the knee and a reduction in the range of motion of both extension and flexion. Without treatment, a fragment of the meniscus can break off and block the knee joint.",
        "Causes": "Meniscus injuries are often the result of a twisting movement, a sudden change of direction, deceleration or may be the result of a sudden impact. In this type of injury there is usually direct contact between two people while playing a sport. Age is a risk factor because degenerative changes occur in the cartilage, weakening it and making it thinner. In this context, a slight twist while getting up from a chair can cause a meniscus tear.",
        "Diagnosis": "The clinical history is very useful. Medical examination reveals that palpation of the joint and meniscus is painful. A useful test is the McMurray test, which consists of compression with rotation of the tibia in relation to the femur, which allows you to feel or hear a click in the joint line. Plain x-rays do not allow the meniscus to be visualized but do allow other causes of knee pain such as osteoarthritis to be excluded. Magnetic resonance imaging allows better characterization and classification of meniscus injuries.",
        "Treatment": "In the initial phase, painkillers and anti-inflammatories may be prescribed, together with an appropriate physiotherapy plan. Although these do not treat the meniscal injury, they can relieve pain and improve the patient's function. Conservative treatment is often insufficient, and knee arthroscopy is recommended to remove the injured part (meniscectomy) or repair it (suture of the menisci). Treatment options for meniscal injuries include non-operative treatment, partial removal of the meniscus, or repair. More recently, meniscal transplantation has become a treatment option in some centers around the world. Indications for non-surgical treatment include stable lesions, partial thickness lesions, asymptomatic degenerative lesions, or lesions whose symptoms are well tolerated by the patient. Surgical treatment of meniscal injuries is indicated in situations where symptoms persist after conservative treatment, pain persists or joint blockage occurs. Conservative treatment involves reducing or limiting sports activities, using analgesic and anti-inflammatory medications and physiotherapy. When the injury is small and occurs on the outer portion of the meniscus, it does not require surgery. The RICE (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation) protocol is useful in these cases. Rest from the activity that caused the injury is essential and it may be important to use crutches to reduce weight on the leg. Ice applied for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day, is a good help. Ice should not be applied directly to the skin. Compression reduces swelling and can be achieved by wearing a compression bandage. Elevating the leg above the level of the heart also reduces swelling. Anti-inflammatories fight pain and inflammation. Surgery will depend on the type, size and location of the meniscus tear. The outer third of the meniscus is richly vascularized and therefore heals more easily. The inner two thirds are poorly irrigated, which makes healing difficult and makes surgery more necessary. In addition to the location of the injury, it is important to consider age, activity level and the presence of other injuries. The surgery can be performed arthroscopically, through small incisions. After surgery, it is essential to immobilize the knee followed by a rehabilitation program, with exercises that improve knee strength and mobility.",

    "Extensor tendon injuries": {
        "What is it?": "The extensor tendons located on the dorsal surface of the hand, and connected to muscles in the forearm, allow us to straighten our fingers. As they extend to the distal part of the fingers, they become thinner and receive small tendons from the hand's intrinsic muscles at the level of the hand.  Common extensor tendon injuries Cuts to the back of the hand or fingers that affect the extensor tendons typically cause extension deficits in the affected finger in the joints distal to the cut. They are normally treated with tendon suturing and immobilization with a splint for long periods (4 to 7 weeks). The use of dynamic splints and physical therapy are often necessary after removing immobilization. Hammertoe refers to the fall of the last phalanx in the distal joint of the finger associated with a wound, bone tearing or tendon stretching, but the result is always the same: the tip of the finger cannot be stretched. Closed rupture, whether or not associated with a phalanx fracture, leads to prolonged immobilization with a splint; cutting the tendon requires surgical repair followed by an equal period of immobilization (7 to 8 weeks). Boutonniere deformity refers to flexion deformity at the proximal interphalangeal joint (in severe and prolonged cases associated with hyperextension at the distal interphalangeal joint) associated with a cut or rupture at the insertion of the extensor tendon at the base of the 2nd phalanx. Suturing of the tendon, reinsertion at the base of the phalanx and immobilization for a period of 5 or 6 weeks are the recommended treatments. Failure to treat this type of injury often leads to fixed flexion stiffness.",
        "Causes": "Their superficial location on the dorsum of the hand and fingers makes them particularly susceptible to injury by wound or other direct trauma. Wounds, crushing or simply abrupt flexion of the finger can lead to injury at the distal insertion of the tendon into the bone leading to flexion of the 3rd phalanx with the so-called \u201cmallet finger\u201d which will lead to a long period of immobilization with or without surgery.",
        "Treatment": "Tendon scarring can lead to adhesions to surrounding tissues (skin and bone), and the scar tissue that forms can prevent the tendon from stretching or flexing completely even under the best treatment conditions. Dynamic splinting and physical therapy may be necessary in these conditions.

    "Muscle and tendon injuries": {
        "What is it?": "Muscles, tendons and ligaments rupture when they are subjected to stress greater than their intrinsic strength. For example, they can get injured if they are too weak or stiff for the exercise you are trying to do. Joints are more prone to injury when the muscles and ligaments that support them are weak, as happens after a sprain. Bones weakened by osteoporosis can fracture more easily. Muscle injuries are the most common cause of physical disability in sport, accounting for around 30-50% of injuries. Generally speaking, injuries caused by sports are due to incorrect training methods, structural anomalies that strain certain parts of the body more than others, and weakness of muscles, tendons and ligaments. Chronic wear and tear is the cause of many of these injuries.",
        "Symptoms": "The pain that precedes many overuse injuries first occurs when a limited number of muscle or tendon fibers tear. Stopping exercise at the first sign of pain limits the damage to these fibers, allowing for faster recovery. Continuing to exercise while in pain causes more fibers to tear, aggravating the injury and delaying recovery.",
        "Causes": "Muscle injuries can be caused by direct blows, strains or lacerations. These injuries can be mild (grade I), with the presence of swelling and discomfort, moderate (grade II), with loss of function and formation of hematoma or ecchymosis, or severe (grade III), with complete rupture, intense pain and hematoma of the large dimensions. One of the biomechanical factors that cause most foot, leg and hip injuries is excessive inward rotation of the feet after they come into contact with the ground.",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis is essentially clinical and ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging and tomography complement this assessment well. Of these three, ultrasound is considered the ideal method.",
        "Treatment": "The principles of treating muscle injuries are based on the classic set: protection, rest, ice, compression and elevation. A good balance between initial immobilization and early mobilization is difficult and each of these phases has advantages and disadvantages that need to be evaluated from an individual perspective. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs help control pain and inflammation, and physical therapy helps restore strength and flexibility. Ultrasound is recommended for treating muscle injuries. Corticosteroid injections into the injured area or surrounding tissue relieve pain and reduce swelling. However, these injections can delay the healing process, increasing the risk of tendon or cartilage damage. Physiotherapy, with the application of heat, cold, electricity or ultrasound, contributes to the rehabilitation process. Its duration will depend on the severity and complexity of the injury. Although treatment allows for a good recovery in most cases, the consequences of these injuries can, in some cases, be dramatic, preventing a return to activity for weeks or months.",
        "Prevention": "The activity or sport that caused the injury should be avoided until it heals. Replacing activities that do not force the injured area is preferable to abstaining from all physical activity, as complete inactivity causes the loss of muscle mass, strength and endurance. As a rule, a week of rest requires at least two weeks of exercise to return to your pre-injury fitness level. Strengthening exercises help prevent injuries. Regular exercise does not significantly increase or strengthen muscles. The only way to strengthen muscles is to exercise them against increasing resistance in a progressive way, such as by playing an increasingly intense sport, lifting increasingly heavier weights, or using special strengthening machines. Stretching exercises do not appear to prevent injuries, but they lengthen muscles so that they can contract more effectively and function better. Using proper equipment is an integral part of preventing muscle and tendon injuries.

    "Leukemia": {
        "What is it?": "Leukemia is a cancer of the most primitive cells in the bone marrow \u2013 the stem cells \u2013 which are the cells that give rise to blood cells. The bone marrow is the organ where blood cells are formed; mature cells are formed from stem cells, which are more primitive. There are several types of leukemia, the most common being chronic lymphatic leukemia. Lymphocytes are the main cells of the immune system. Lymphocytes are white blood cells that are formed in the bone marrow. B lymphocytes are one type of white blood cell and are the cells of origin of chronic lymphatic leukemia. Chronic lymphatic leukemia is a disease in which too many abnormal lymphocytes accumulate. These lymphocytes do not multiply faster but survive longer, unlike what happens in acute leukemias. These lymphocytes appear normal under a microscope but function poorly. It is a disease that develops very slowly (from months to years even without treatment) and symptoms such as anemia, bleeding or infections can take years to appear. Symptoms appear when the number of diseased lymphocytes becomes too high, preventing the bone marrow from producing other healthy cells for normal blood functions. Treatment for this type of leukemia aims to reduce the number of white blood cells. In leukemia, the diseased cells that are produced in the bone marrow spill over into the blood and are found in circulation. There are several types of leukemia, the majority of which develop from the cells that will produce white blood cells. On this site we exclusively address chronic lymphatic leukemia.  Bone marrow is the soft, spongy tissue inside bones. Large, flat bones, such as the hip bones and breastbone, contain the most marrow. Bone marrow is responsible for producing different types of blood cells: white blood cells - the cells responsible for fighting infections;;/ red blood cells -the cells that carry oxygen to tissues throughout the body;;/ platelets \u2013 the cells that help control bleeding by forming blood clots.;/ To continually form blood cells, healthy bone marrow and dietary nutrients such as iron and some vitamins are needed. In their immature or primordial phase, bone marrow cells include stem cells or stem cells. Most blood cells mature in the bone marrow, later moving into the blood vessels. From a pluripotent stem cell, two cell lineages develop: lymphoid and myeloid. The myeloid lineage gives rise to the normal cells drawn below, and when diseased it gives rise to myeloid leukemias. The lymphoid lineage fundamentally gives rise to lymphocytes and plasma cells, and when diseased it gives rise to lymphoid leukemias and lymphomas.",
        "Prevention": "There are no prevention strategies\u00a0for chronic lymphatic leukemia.",
        "Risk Factors": "Any behavior or condition that increases your risk of having a disease is a risk factor. If one or more risk factors apply to you, it does not mean that you will necessarily develop chronic lymphatic leukemia. Likewise, chronic lymphatic leukemia can appear in individuals who have no known risk factors. It has not yet been possible to find the causes, but some risk factors are known. The main risk factors are: Age- Being over 60 years old is a risk factor, and the disease is rare in people under 40 years old.;/ Being male;/ Family history- having a first-degree relative with this disease;/ Having an autoimmune disease in which autoantibodies are made against red blood cells or platelets;/",
        "Symptoms": "The symptoms of chronic lymphatic leukemia are not exclusive and can appear in other diseases. Just because you have one or more of the symptoms described here does not mean you have chronic lymphatic leukemia. At the beginning of the disease, in many cases, there are no symptoms. This disease is often diagnosed because the patient has had a routine blood test or for some reason other than suspected leukemia. Half of people with chronic lymphatic leukemia have no symptoms. For a period of time that can be months to years, large numbers of abnormal lymphocytes can accumulate in circulation without causing problems.  Over time, abnormal lymphocytes fill the bone marrow, making it difficult to replace the normal blood cells that die. You should be alert and consult your doctor if you have the following symptoms: Anemia - occurs when the number of red blood cells in the blood drops. It can cause tiredness and shortness of breath. Patients may also become paler.;/ Hemorrhages \u2013 due to a reduced number of platelets in circulation, which can cause easy bruising, gum bleeding and the appearance of bleeding in the skin or mucous membranes.;/ Infections- Sick lymphocytes do not protect against infections, they are ineffective. Therefore, there is a lack of efficient white blood cells to fight infections.;/ Enlarged lymph nodes and spleen;/ Fever;/ Night sweats;/ Weight loss;/",
        "Who should I contact?": "If you suspect cancer, due to symptoms or a complementary diagnostic test that shows changes, you should consult a Clinical Hematologist. Meet our team of experts Make your contact request so we can follow up from the first moment. If you prefer, you can schedule an appointment via our toll-free line.  Pluripotent stem cells give rise to two cell lineages: alymphoid and amyeloid. The myeloid lineage gives rise to the normal cells drawn there, and when diseased it gives rise to myeloid leukemias. The lymphoid lineage fundamentally gives rise to lymphocytes and plasma cells, and when diseased it gives rise to lymphoid or lymphoblastic leukemias and lymphomas. Leukemias can also be classified as acute and chronic, according to their clinical presentation. Acute leukemias appear and progress quickly, while chronic leukemias are slow in their appearance and clinical course.  Thus, the main leukemias are: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia \u2013 is the most common type of leukemia in pediatric age;;/ Acute myeloid leukemia \u2013 affects both adults and children;;/ Chronic lymphocytic leukemia \u2013 mainly affects adults;;/ Chronic myeloid leukemia \u2013 mainly affects adults.;/",
        "Diagnosis and Staging": "In a patient suspected of having chronic lymphatic leukemia, tests may be ordered to diagnose the disease. To make the diagnosis of chronic lymphatic leukemia, in addition to collecting history and clinical history, the following tests are performed: -Blood cell counts, morphological analysis and classification of surface proteins; -Myelogram and\u00a0Bone Marrow Biopsy \u2013 this procedure consists of\u00a0\u00a0aspirating the contents of the bone marrow and removing a small fragment of iliac bone. It is a procedure performed by a hematologist or oncologist, with the individual lying face down, using local anesthesia; - Radiological examinations such as CT scan. Staging is the process by which we assess the extent of the disease and its impact on the body. The information obtained through the staging process determines the stage of the disease, which is essential for planning treatment. When confirming the diagnosis of chronic lymphatic leukemia, the next step is to stage it through clinical examination and imaging tests, namely a computed tomography. The stage classification is divided into stages A, B and C: Stage A- There are fewer than three regions of the body affected by expansion of the lymphatic structures; Stage B- There are three or more regions of the body affected by expansion of the lymphatic structures; Stage C- There is a decrease in the number of red blood cells and/or platelets.",
        "Treatment": "The multidisciplinary clinical team will assess the best treatment to follow. Options may include chemotherapy, immunotherapy and possibly radiotherapy. Stage A or early stage - most of these patients do not need treatment, because they have no symptoms and the disease is not aggressive and may never require treatment. Treatment can be started when symptoms appear or when analyzes show a faster increase in the number of lymphocytes; Stages B or C, advanced - the objective of treatment is to achieve normalization of the blood and marrow. This allows the marrow to function normally again and produce normal cells. The basis of treatment is chemotherapy, which can be associated with immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies. Radiotherapy can be given to larger lymph node areas. In exceptional cases, bone marrow transplantation may be indicated. The treatment of chronic lymphatic leukemia is always guided by a clinical hematologist and you must maintain follow-up at the hematology consultation, carrying out regular blood and imaging tests.

    "Hodgkin's lymphoma": {
        "What is it?": "Hodgkin's lymphoma is a type of hematologic cancer. Lymphoma is a generic term to classify cancers that develop in lymphocytes and, consequently, in organs of the lymphatic system. This disease resembles cancer in that the mechanism of its formation is equivalent. These abnormal lymphocytes, also called Reed-Sternberg cells, do not fulfill their function of protecting against infections and other diseases. If in the case of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma the cells of origin of this cancer are unequivocally lymphocytes, in the case of Hodgkin's Lymphoma the origin is not so clear. Since lymphocytes circulate throughout the body, anomalous cells can originate in any area of \u200b\u200bthe lymphatic system and can affect various parts of the body, although their spread usually occurs sequentially, affecting the group of nodes immediately following. This clinical condition in which the disease affects the body in a widespread manner is called systemic disease. Hodgkin's lymphoma is a disease that appears most frequently in young adults with enlarged nodes in the neck, chest or other locations. It can also appear in the elderly. This lymphoma can also be called Hodgkin's disease, because this type of lymphoma is a cancer that generally has a good prognosis. It can be cured if detected at an early stage.",

        "Diagnosis and Staging": "In a patient with a clinical history and clinical examination suspicious of Hodgkin's lymphoma, tests are used to diagnose the disease with the aim of understanding how many lymph node regions are affected by the disease, and whether it is in fact Hodgkin's disease. Diagnostic tests are: Detailed blood and urine tests;;/ Biopsy of the enlarged lymph node - a biopsy must be performed to remove the entire lymph node - excisional biopsy - since a simple biopsy by aspirating cells from the lymph node does not allow for a sufficient quantity to be obtained for the pathologist to diagnose Hodgkin's lymphoma;;/ Bone marrow biopsy \u2013 the doctor uses a needle to collect bone and marrow samples, using local anesthesia (myelogram);;/ Radiological examinations such as CT scan;;/ Nuclear Medicine exams such as oPET.;/ Only when the material collected through a biopsy is observed under a microscope is it possible to confirm the diagnosis of Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Staging is the process by which we assess the extent of Hodgkin's lymphoma to the various organs and systems. The information obtained through the staging process determines the stage of the disease, which is essential for planning treatment. Staging is done using imaging and nuclear medicine exams, namely TAC and PET, and bone marrow involvement is done through bone biopsy. Based on the tests performed, the staging of Hodgkin's lymphoma can be classified into stages I to IV. However, there is a staging complement that is related to the symptoms the patient has: Groups A, B, E and S: A: The patient does not have fever, weight loss or night sweats, this triad is called symptoms B;B: The patient has symptoms B;E: The patient has disease in a non-lymphoid organ but which may be contiguous to a conglomerate ganglionic. For example, the lung; S: The patient has spleen disease. Regarding the stages of Hodgkin's lymphoma, they are characterized as follows: Stage I- The disease covers one of these territories: A territory of lymph nodes;;/ Waldeyer's ring;;/ Timo;;/ Spleen.;/  Stage II- The disease involves two lymphoid territories that are on the same side of the diaphragm, that is, on the \u201cupper part\u201d of the body or on the \u201clower part\u201d of the body. Stage III- The disease involves two lymphoid territories that are on different sides of the diaphragm, that is, on the \u201cupper part\u201d of the body and on the \u201clower part\u201d of the body. Stage IV - The disease affects both sides of the diaphragm and other non-lymphoid organs such as the lung, liver, brain or bone marrow.  Regarding treatment, Hodgkin's lymphoma can be classified as follows: Favorable early stage - Stages I and II; Early unfavorable stage - Stages I and II but with one or more risk factors: Thoracic tumor with a diameter greater than 10 cm;;/ Disease outside the lymph nodes;;/ High sedimentation rate;;/ Three or more lymph nodes with cancer;;/ Presence of Symptoms B.;/ Favorable advanced stage - Stage III and IV disease with three or fewer of the following risk factors: Male;;/ Be over 45 years old;;/ Stage IV disease;;/ Albumin less than 4 g/dl;;/ Hemoglobin less than 10.5 g/dl;;/ White blood cells greater than 15,000 thousand;;/ Lymphocytes less than 600.;/ Unfavorable advanced stage - Disease in stages III and IV with four or more of the following risk factors from the list above.",
        "Treatment": "The multidisciplinary clinical team will assess the best treatment to follow. The same could include radiotherapy and systemic therapy: Favorable early stage \u2013 treatment options usually include chemotherapy and radiotherapy, or radiotherapy alone; Early unfavorable stage \u2013 treatment options include chemotherapy and radiotherapy; Favorable advanced stage - treatment options include chemotherapy and radiotherapy; Advanced unfavorable stage - treatment options include chemotherapy. Bone marrow transplantation may be a treatment option for some cases of Hodgkin lymphoma. This involves administering high doses of chemotherapy to the body to destroy the bone marrow, followed by the transplantation of dendritic cells (the primary cells formed in the bone marrow) from the donor, which will restore the patient's bone marrow. The transplant can be of two natures:  autologous \u2013 the marrow donor is the patient himself \u2013 the dendritic cells are harvested before the application of chemotherapy, and then reimplanted;;/  allogenic \u2013 the stem cells to be transplanted are donated by a donor. The donor may or may not be a family member, as long as they are compatible.;/  In general, autologous transplants are used in the case of Hodgkin's lymphoma. The treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma is always guided by a clinical hematologist and you should continue to follow up with your hematology consultation, carrying out regular blood and imaging tests.  The lymphatic system consists of a branched network of vessels that runs throughout our body, transporting lymph to all tissues, a fluid that contains white blood cells, particularly lymphocytes, responsible for fighting infections. Lymphatic vessels are connected to small masses of tissue called lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are small deposits of lymphocytes that act as filters for the lymph to eliminate bacteria or other harmful substances that circulate in it. In the body, we have clusters of lymph nodes in areas such as the armpits, groin, abdomen, neck and chest. Other constituent elements of the lymphatic system are the tonsils, spleen, great gland and bone marrow. Lymphatic tissue also exists in the skin, stomach and small intestine. The lymphatic system is closely linked to the blood vessels, with connections between the two systems, the circulatory and lymphatic. White blood cells are present in the lymph, but also in the blood.  Lymphocytes are the main cells of the immune system. Lymphocytes are white blood cells that are formed in the bone marrow, spleen and tonsils, and are then released into the bloodstream and lymphatic system, like other blood cells. Lymph nodes are also organs where lymphocytes are concentrated to mature, grow and divide after coming into contact with microorganisms. In short, these cells are dispersed throughout the body: they circulate and can be temporarily retained in various organs, mainly in the lymphoid organs and bone marrow.

    "Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma": {
        "What is it?": "Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is a type of hematologic cancer. Lymphoma is a generic term to classify cancers that develop in the lymphatic system. This disease resembles cancer in that the mechanism of its formation is equivalent. In the case of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, the cells that originate this cancer are lymphocytes. These abnormal lymphocytes do not fulfill their function of protecting against infections and other diseases. Since lymphocytes circulate throughout the body, anomalous cells can originate in any area of \u200b\u200bthe lymphatic system and can affect various parts of the body, although their spread occurs sequentially, affecting the set of nodes immediately following. This clinical condition in which the disease affects the body in a widespread manner is called systemic disease.",
        "Prevention": "There are no strategies for the prevention and early diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. You should adopt healthy habits and be aware of any symptoms.",
        "Risk Factors": "Any behavior or condition that increases your risk of having a disease is a risk factor. If one or more risk factors apply to you, it does not mean that you will necessarily develop non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Likewise, non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma can appear in individuals who have no known risk factors. It has not yet been possible to find the causes of Hodgkin's lymphoma, but some risk factors are known. The main risk factors are: -Age \u2013 although it can appear in young individuals, the probability of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma increases with age, especially from the 6th decade of life; - Being male - Be of Caucasian race - Suffer from the following diseases: Congenital immunodeficiency syndrome;/ Autoimmune disease;/ Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV);/ Infection with T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) or Ebstein-Barr virus (EBV);/ Infection caused by bacteria that infect the stomach and is called Helicobacter pylori;/ Hepatitis C;/ - Having undergone immunosuppressive therapy after a transplant - Exposure to pesticides - Diet rich in meat and fat - Hodgkin's lymphoma",
        "Symptoms": "The symptoms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma are not exclusive, they can appear in other diseases. Just because you have one or more of the symptoms described here does not mean you have non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. You should be alert and consult your doctor if you have the following symptoms: Enlarged lymph nodes in the neck, armpits and/or groin;/ Fever without reason;/ Night sweats;/ Huge tiredness;/ Weight loss for no reason;/ Skin lesions with or without itching;/ Abdominal, chest, bone or head pain;/ Swollen abdomen or feeling of fullness;/ Cough, difficulty breathing;/",
        "Who should I contact?": "If you suspect Hodgkin's lymphoma, due to symptoms or a complementary diagnostic test that shows an abnormality, you should go to a Clinical Hematologist. Meet our team of experts Make your contact request so we can follow up from the first moment. If you prefer, you can schedule an appointment via our toll-free line. There are several types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which can be grouped according to how quickly they form: Indolent lymphomas: tend to grow and spread slowly and cause few symptoms;;/ Aggressive lymphomas: tend to grow and spread quickly and patients are usually quite symptomatic.;/ Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common type of aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

    "Gallbladder lithiasis": {
        "What is it?": "Gallstone disease is the presence of one or more stones (commonly known as \"stones\") inside it. The gallbladder is a small sac located on the underside of the liver. It is where the bile produced in the liver is stored. After eating, the gallbladder contracts to release the bile into the small intestine through the bile ducts (a system of channels that drain bile from the liver) to aid in the digestion of fats. Gallstone disease is a common condition. In Europe around 10% of people have this condition. It is the most common disease of the bile ducts. In general, it is two to three times more common in women than in men. Age is important and the prevalence in females varies from 5% to 20% up to the age of 50 and from 25% to 30% after that age.",
        "Symptoms": "Around 80% do not present any type of complaints. Contrary to popular belief, \u201cpoor digestion\u201d with fat, heartburn, increased intestinal gas, nausea, vomiting or headaches cannot be attributed to gallstone disease. The main symptom is pain or cramping in the \u201cstomach\u201d region or under the ribs on the right, which can extend to the left side, back, chest or the rest of the abdomen. This starts suddenly, sometimes overnight, lasting minutes or hours. It may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, sweating and paleness. The pain results from obstruction of the cystic duct or bile duct by a stone. Complications may occur due to inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis), bile ducts (cholangitis) or pancreas (pancreatitis). In these cases, the pain may be more severe and last longer. Fever and jaundice (\u201cyellow eyes\u201d) may also occur. These complications generally require hospital admission and urgent treatment. Gallstone disease is associated with an increased risk of gallbladder cancer. However, this type of cancer is rare.",
        "Causes": "Most stones form in the gallbladder, which is a small sac located next to the liver, under the ribs on the right. It stores bile, produced in the liver. After meals, the gallbladder contracts and bile passes into the duodenum through the bile ducts. Bile contains bilirubin and cholesterol. These substances can \u201ccrystallize\u201d because the bile in the gallbladder becomes more concentrated. One can only verify the presence of multiple crystals which, when they come together, form stones. These can be as small as grape seeds or reach the size of golf balls. They can be single or multiple. Most are cholesterol; They are formed when the bile is too concentrated with this element or the gallbladder does not empty properly. It is thought that gallstones result from an imbalance in the various components of bile, especially when the bile contains too much cholesterol or too many bile pigments. Another cause is the malfunction of the gallbladder, with slow or incomplete emptying during digestion. Stones of different composition, for example bilirubin, can also form in certain diseases and situations. The main risk factors for the formation of stones are obesity, a diet with excess animal fats and few vegetables and fruit, lack of physical exercise, rapid weight loss that occurs in some obesity treatments, long periods of fasting, use of hormones and contraceptives. Other warning signs are age (over 60 years old), female gender, lithiasis in family members, pregnancy, diabetes, hemolytic anemia and liver cirrhosis.",
        "Diagnosis": "The best test for diagnosis is an abdominal ultrasound, but an abdominal CT scan may also be requested. However, many cases are diagnosed in tests requested for other reasons.",
        "Treatment": "Given that only 15 to 25% of patients with asymptomatic gallstone disease will experience symptoms or complications in the 10 to 15 years following diagnosis, these patients do not require treatment. However, treatment should be considered in the case of multiple small stones, given the risk of potentially serious complications, particularly associated with the migration of stones into the bile ducts. Patients with symptoms - biliary colic - must be treated. The therapy is also applied, even in the absence of manifestations, in diabetic patients or those taking immunosuppressants, in the presence of a calcified gallbladder, in the case of patients who reside or frequently travel to countries with poor health care, when there is rapid weight loss or when the stones are located in the bile ducts. Surgery to remove the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) is the ideal treatment for gallstone disease. It can be done classically (through a cut in the abdominal wall) or laparoscopically, in which the instruments enter the abdomen through small holes. This is recommended because it is less painful and easier to recover from. The lack of a gallbladder does not cause any major problems. Other modalities, but used very rarely, are their dissolution with medications or \u201cshock wave\u201d lithotripsy to fragment the stones. When these are in the bile ducts, treatment should be attempted by endoscopic examination of the bile ducts and pancreas.",
        "Prevention": "It involves preventing the formation of stones, which can be achieved by correcting risk factors such as obesity, a diet with excess animal fats and few vegetables and fruit, lack of physical exercise, rapid weight loss, long periods of fasting, use of hormones and contraceptives.

    "Kidney stones kidney stones": {
        "What is it?": "Kidney stones, or renal lithiasis, is one of the most common causes of renal colic. Stones can have different compositions, the most common being calcium oxalate and uric acid. They can cause blood loss in the urine (hematuria), kidney infections (pyelonephritis) or renal colic. In many cases nothing can be done to prevent its formation; However, it is important to study the situation, with analysis and evaluation of the diet, in order to try to identify the cause for its formation, such as a diet with excess protein and salt, or little water, or even some metabolic factor. (uric acid) and, in this way, prevent the formation of new stones. Kidney stones are a very common disease, with an estimated global incidence of 2% to 3%. It is the third most common pathology of the genitourinary system, surpassed only by urinary infections and prostate problems. The majority of kidney stones are of mixed composition, with around 30% being formed by a single type of mineral. The most common type is calcium oxalate. Men are twice as likely to develop stones as women and the first episode occurs around the age of 30. In females, there are two incidence peaks, at 35 and 55 years of age. Recurrence is high and it is believed that 50% of untreated patients return to have lithiasis within a period of five years. After a more or less long period in which they do not cause symptoms, the passage of one of these stones into the ureter (the channel that transports urine between the kidneys and the bladder) triggers an attack of intense pain, called renal colic. In addition to causing pain, these stones can cause urinary infections or reduced kidney function in the long term.",
        "Symptoms": "Most kidney stones do not cause symptoms until the stone moves into the urinary tract. At this point, the pain is very intense and disabling. As a rule, it starts on the flank and radiates towards the groin, varying depending on its location. The pain of renal colic generates great agitation and has no relief. It may be accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Because the stone can injure the walls of the ureter as it passes down, some blood loss in the urine is normal. Renal colic is also associated with urinary urgency and discomfort in the bladder region, both caused by the passage of the stone into the bladder. These symptoms are identical to those found in urinary tract infections. More rarely, fever may occur, especially if obstruction occurs and stone progression stops. Generalized infection, although rare, can occur, so adequate monitoring of these cases is essential. It is also worth mentioning that flank pain typical of renal colic can occur in other diseases, which is why medical evaluation is important to exclude other pathologies.",
        "Causes": "Kidney stones correspond to mineral deposits. In general, urine contains substances that prevent the formation of these crystals. When these mechanisms do not work, stones can form in the kidney, ureters or bladder. The causes for its formation are not always known, but genetic influence is important. Kidney stones are more common in people with other kidney diseases, hyperparathyroidism, renal tubular acidosis, urinary tract infections, obesity, certain intestinal diseases, and diets rich in protein, sodium, and sugar. Drinking too little fluid also increases the risk.",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of kidney stones, or renal lithiasis, involves medical evaluation, blood and urine tests and imaging studies. Most stones are visible on an x-ray, but sometimes a CT scan may be necessary.",
        "Treatment": "With good hydration and analgesics, stones smaller than five millimeters are eliminated spontaneously in 90% of cases. Hydration aims to reduce urine saturation by preventing the processes that lead to its formation. Fluid intake must be sufficient to provide a urine volume of more than two thousand milliliters per day. It is important to increase hydration two hours after meals, during physical exercise, before bed and possibly at night. In the absence of any other treatment, it has been shown that adequate fluid intake can reduce the formation of lithiasis by up to around 60%. For stones measuring one centimeter, the probability of elimination without surgery is less than 10%. In addition to hydration and painkillers, the use of muscle relaxants can be helpful. If symptoms persist, stone removal becomes necessary, and is usually done by inserting a catheter through the urethra. Lithotripsy is a technique that uses sound waves to fragment stones in the kidney or urinary tract. There are other surgical modalities for the treatment of specific cases of kidney lithiasis.",
        "Prevention": "In addition to hydration, diet is very important. Calcium stones are the most common type of stone, so a moderate calcium diet reduces the risk. It is also important not to restrict calcium intake too much to avoid changes in bone density and interference with oxalate absorption in the intestine. Calcium supplements are associated with a 20% increased risk of stone formation, and should therefore be avoided. It is recommended that you consume calcium (dairy products and their derivatives such as milk, yogurt and cheese) in moderation in your diet. Animal proteins and sodium are also important risk factors for stone formation, so it is essential to limit your sodium and protein intake. Depending on their composition, there are foods to exclude, which reinforces the importance of laboratory diagnosis and adequate nutritional monitoring in order to prevent the formation of new stones.

    "Lumbago": {
        "What is it?": "This term refers to the presence of pain in the lumbar spine region, generally between the last ribs and above the glutes. Low back pain is often accompanied by pain that radiates to the lower limbs. It is, therefore, a symptom and not a disease, which means that it can manifest the presence of different clinical conditions. Almost everyone suffers from low back pain at some point in their lives. This pain can be mild or intense and can have a variable duration. It is a very common and disabling symptom, estimated to affect, at least once, 65% to 80% of the population. Low back pain is also one of the most frequent causes of disability retirement, which clearly reflects its personal and professional impact. It can be classified as acute (sudden onset and duration of less than six weeks), subacute (between six and 12 weeks) or chronic (over 12 weeks). This classification is important because of the different impact it has on the affected patient, but also because of the different causes and treatments of these different types of low back pain. In most cases, it has a mechanical origin, but in others it is psychological in nature (psychogenic), making these more difficult to diagnose. The anatomy of the spine is complex and includes the vertebrae, intervertebral discs and a whole set of muscular structures, ligaments and nerves. There are several regions in the spine: cervical, thoracic, lumbar and sacral. In this last region, the vertebrae are fused together. The lumbar region comprises five vertebrae. Whenever we walk or run, the discs absorb the impacts and prevent the vertebrae from colliding with each other. They contribute to the movements of the spine and facilitate its flexion and twisting. Each disc is composed of a fibrous ring and a gelatinous nucleus that allows the absorption of impacts.",
        "Symptoms": "Low back pain varies greatly from person to person and in its intensity. It can have a slow or sudden onset, it can be intermittent or constant. Sometimes low back pain feels like a needle-like pain or can feel like a cramp. These characteristics depend on the underlying cause of low back pain. It may be accompanied by pain that radiates to the lower limbs. The pain tends to improve when lying down or at rest and is usually associated with morning stiffness. On the contrary, the pain becomes worse when sitting, bending the trunk or lifting weights. Standing and walking also accentuates low back pain. The patient may limp or report a lack of strength in one of the legs. Depending on the cause, other symptoms may appear that are important for assessing the severity of each case and that may be useful for diagnosis. Thus, low back pain may be accompanied by weight loss, fever, recurrent skin or urinary infections, among other possible manifestations. The most worrying cases are those in which symptoms do not improve after three months, those that do not respond to treatment and those that occur in patients with a history of neoplastic disease. In the case of non-specific low back pain, the cause is usually an imbalance between the load borne at work or in daily life and the spine's ability to handle this weight. In this situation, pain occurs, but no structural change in the lumbar spine is identified. Even so, it causes a marked limitation of daily activities and may imply an inability to work.",
        "Causes": "In the majority of cases, around 90%, a cause for low back pain is not found and it is referred to as non-specific. This type of injury can occur at any age - and degenerative changes in the spine begin at age 30 and increase the risk of low back pain - especially in people who carry out professional activities associated with heavy physical effort, such as lifting weights or repetitive movements. Low back pain frequently occurs in sports such as baseball, golf, running, football, rowing, weight lifting, among others. It is more common in females, given the smaller height, muscle mass and bone density of women and the greater fragility of their joints. The most common causes of low back pain are musculoskeletal disorders related to degenerative, inflammatory, infectious, tumoural, traumatic or postural processes. There are also congenital musculoskeletal disorders that are associated with low back pain. Other possible causes are some abdominal diseases (especially pancreas and kidney), vascular diseases (abdominal aortic aneurysm, for example), neurological diseases or diseases resulting from changes in the intervertebral discs. Some cases may have a psychological origin. Rheumatic diseases and osteoporosis can also cause low back pain, as can tuberculosis and brucellosis. Other risk factors are remaining in a standing or sitting position for prolonged periods, obesity and poor muscle mass development. Injuries to the intervertebral discs cause longer-lasting low back pain. These injuries can be small \u201ctears\u201d in the fibrous ring of the disc, which become more frequent with age and, in some cases, do not cause any pain. However, the pain is common and can last for months. Other disc injuries that are associated with low back pain are herniated discs, which can cause sciatica. Over the course of life, the discs lose their water content and reduce their size and may collapse, which allows the vertebrae to collide against each other. This friction process causes pain and stiffness and is called osteoarthritis. The aging process and the overload on the spine can make it difficult to maintain the vertebrae in their correct position, allowing them to slide over each other, thus compressing neighboring nerve roots. Narrowing of the spinal canal is another cause of pressure on the spinal cord and nerves. This narrowing may be a consequence of the growth of bone tissue, the spurs, stimulated by the collapse of the discs and osteoarthritis and whose function is to better support the vertebrae. These spurs eventually narrow the channel. Likewise, the process of osteoarthritis causes the ligaments to thicken, which also narrows the spinal canal. Scoliosis, which corresponds to an abnormal curvature of the spine, is also a cause of low back pain and leg-related symptoms if nerve compression occurs.",
        "Diagnosis": "The clinical history and medical examination are very important. Additional tests are selected based on this assessment and may consist of imaging studies (X-ray, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging), bone scintigraphy and/or laboratory studies. Osteodensitometry may be important to assess the presence of osteoporosis. X-rays may show arthritic changes in the spine such as collapse of the disc space, bone spicules (\u201cparrot\u2019s beak\u201d), hypertrophy of the interapophyseal joints or slippage of one vertebra over another (spondylolisthesis), but the specificity of these changes is limited since they are present in most people, even if they are asymptomatic.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment depends on the cause and its main objective is to relieve pain. For this purpose, analgesics, anti-inflammatories and/or muscle relaxants may be useful, and should be selected and prescribed by a doctor based on each case. In some situations, corticosteroids may be indicated, as well as joint injections. The use of heat or cold, massage, ultrasound or electro-stimulation may be important. Some extension, weight lifting or cardiovascular exercises help to regain mobility and strengthen the lower back muscles, which helps to alleviate pain. In some cases, containment straps are used to provide symptomatic relief. In chronic low back pain, depressive complaints may be associated and antidepressants may play a relevant role. In some cases, surgery may be indicated, but should only be considered six months to a year after the onset of symptoms. On the other hand, surgery should only be considered when the specific cause of the low back pain is known. Surgery may involve fusing the vertebrae so that they heal as a single bone, thus eliminating movement in that vertebral segment. This option is considered when movement is the cause of the pain, as is the case with scoliosis or severe degeneration. Another possibility is replacing a damaged disc, maintaining the flexibility and mobility of the spine.",
        "Prevention": "It is not always possible to prevent the development of low back pain. However, it is possible to control its risk factors, such as overexertion, obesity, osteoporosis and by diagnosing and treating associated diseases. Whenever you need to lift weights, it is important to bend your legs and keep your spine straight. Good posture and aerobic exercise, such as walking or swimming, combined with exercises that strengthen the muscles in your lower back and abdominal region are very helpful. Good weight control, not smoking and maintaining correct posture in all positions are essential.

    "Lupus": {
        "What is it?": "The word means wolf in Latin. This name was given due to the skin lesions that are very common in Lupus. It is an autoimmune disease, in which the immune system, instead of protecting the body, attacks it, causing inflammation and changes in the function of the affected system. Inflammation causes pain, heat, redness and swelling. There is no known cause for Lupus and there is no cure for this disease. It is a chronic pathology, even though there are inactive and reactive phases. It can affect many different organs and systems and there are very different forms of the disease. In fact, symptoms vary from patient to patient and even, in the same patient, from period to period. Lupus can be associated with serious complications, but, in general, the available treatments allow maintaining a good quality of life. Females are eight to ten times more affected, especially at childbearing ages, but men can also be affected. The most common ages for the onset of Lupus are between 18 and 55 years old, but this disease can begin at any age (children or the elderly). There are currently around four thousand cases of Lupus in Portugal. Family members of patients with autoimmune diseases (thyroiditis, type 1 diabetes) are more likely to be affected by this disease.",
        "What are the different forms of Lupus?": "Systemic, more generalized disease, which can affect any organ or system in the body;;/ Discoid, which is a form limited to the skin that can sometimes develop into systemic lupus.;/",
        "Symptoms": "Its manifestations are very variable. Among them are tiredness, loss of appetite and weight loss. Red or pink spots may appear on the skin of the face (especially on the cheeks and nose, in a butterfly shape), neck or arms. These correspond to discoid lesions. In these areas the skin becomes more raised and a scar may form. Patients report a lot of sensitivity to sunlight (photosensitivity) and there may be a change in the color of the extremities (fingers or toes) that become white or bluish, triggered by cold and/or emotions. Sometimes there is hair loss, ulcers in the mouth or nose, joint pain (fingers, wrists, knees, ankles or hips) predominantly in the morning and sometimes accompanied by stiffness and/or heat, redness, swelling and difficulty in movement, generally without joint deformities. Other systems can be affected, such as the respiratory system, with inflammation of the lining of the lungs (pleura), which is manifested by chest pain and coughing; cardiac, with inflammation of the lining of the heart (pericardium), also with chest pain, but with different characteristics; and renal, with loss of proteins or other substances in the urine. More rarely, convulsions, depression, increased susceptibility to infections, bleeding or easy bruising may occur due to a decrease in the number of platelets. Generally speaking, these symptoms are not present simultaneously, but rather at certain stages of the disease.",
        "Causes": "There is still no known cause, except for the rare forms that are caused by the ingestion of specific drugs. Lupus is related to conditions that give rise to a certain predisposition to the disease. These causes can be genetic, hormonal or environmental. Precipitating factors are situations that cause the pathology to manifest itself in the form of obvious symptoms and signs. These can be internal, such as physical stress, excessive fatigue, infections, sleep deprivation, trauma, pregnancy, or external, such as sunlight or artificial light and emotional stress.",
        "Diagnosis": "Its diagnosis is based on clinical and laboratory elements. Laboratory tests alone are not enough. However, in conjunction with the symptoms reported by the patient and the signs observed by the doctor, they are very helpful. In some cases the diagnosis is difficult because clinical data at that time are not sufficient. On the other hand, Lupus presents very varied forms. The diagnosis depends on the combination of clinical and laboratory elements (blood and urine).",
        "Treatment": "The goal of treatment is to prevent damage to vital organs and to keep the disease in an inactive phase. It may include medications, adequate exercise and rest, diet, and avoiding exposure to ultraviolet radiation and stress. Medication: Drugs are necessary for most patients and are the most effective way to treat severe forms. These may have to be changed according to the stages of the disease. The most commonly used medications are anti-inflammatories, which reduce inflammation and pain, and are useful during the acute phases of the disease; antimalarials, which help stabilize the immune system; corticosteroids, important in severe cutaneous and joint forms; immunosuppressants, which reduce the autoimmune inflammatory response that exists in Lupus; immunoglobulins and other newer drugs (biological therapies);;/ Exercise and physical therapy: A proper balance between exercise and rest is essential. Physiotherapy and appropriate aerobic exercise (especially in water) help relax and maintain muscle and joint function;;/ Diet: This can be a determining factor, especially when there is kidney involvement, and must be adjusted to each case;;/ Care and protection when exposed to the sun: It is essential to avoid exposure to ultraviolet rays (solar or artificial), both directly and indirectly, as this exposure can trigger flare-ups on the skin and other organs. The use of sunscreen (with a high protection factor) in all outdoor activities, whether in summer or winter, on exposed areas is essential. Avoiding the hours of greatest sun exposure during the hottest months and wearing appropriate clothing (long sleeves, wide-brimmed hats, light-colored clothing) can also be very important.;/",
        "Prevention": "There is no way to prevent it. It is only possible to avoid some of the precipitating factors.

    "Luxacao acromioclavicular": {
        "What is it?": "This injury is common and affects young athletes involved in motorsports and those involving throwing. It also occurs in contact sports (football, rugby), cycling and car accidents. It accounts for approximately 3% of shoulder injuries and 40% of shoulder sports injuries. It is more common in women and between the ages of 20 and 30. This joint connects the shoulder blade to the collarbone and is supported by several ligaments that can rupture when an injury occurs in this region. Injuries to this joint are classified into types I to VI, depending on the extent of the injury and the number of ligaments involved. The most common traumatic AC injuries are caused by direct forces on the superolateral border of the shoulder with the arm in adduction, usually in the context of a fall. In our reality, these injuries are typical of the 2nd and 3rd decade of life, in the context of contact sports (MTB, rugby, motocross, bullfighting) and affect men between 3 and 10 times more frequently. Thus, in grade I there is a partial stretching/rupture of the acromio-clavicular ligaments and in grade II a total rupture, without there being a radiographic translation of the injury. In grade III, there is a superior translation of the clavicle in relation to the acromion, due to rupture of the coraco-clavicular ligaments, while in grade IV, in addition to being superior, it is also posterior, into or through the fibers of the trapezius. In grade V injuries, the separation is even greater, with loss of integrity of the trapeziodeltoid fascia, with the lateral end of the clavicle becoming subcutaneous. Rare grade VI is characterized by passage of the clavicle below the coracoid process/joint tendon.",
        "Symptoms": "This injury manifests itself in the form of pain and swelling in the upper shoulder region. The pain is initially diffuse and later is localized in the area of \u200b\u200bthe acromioclavicular joint. A hematoma may form and the collarbone may become more prominent. Shoulder movements are limited, causing pain when raising the arm. The pain becomes worse at night, especially when the body turns towards the involved shoulder. More rarely, you may feel or hear a noise or crack in the joint region. The acromioclavicular joint, when injured, tends to suffer from painful arthritis processes.",
        "Causes": "The injury can be caused by a direct force, such as a fall on the shoulder, or indirect, when the fall is on the hand and the arm is extended.",
        "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis is based on clinical history and medical examination. The X-ray allows visualization of the joint involved. Magnetic resonance imaging is not always requested but can be useful in cases, especially in cases of persistent pain. The clinical diagnosis of acute AC injuries is relatively simple since the pain that accompanies them is easily localized, along with the direct impact mechanism. Conventional radiography is the best test for diagnosing dislocations above grade III. Soft tissue ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging are not routinely used, and when used, they are used to assess the extent of ligament injuries and trapeziodeltoid aponeurosis.",
        "Treatment": "This type of injury is very painful and affects joint mobility. As such, physiotherapy has an important role. Initial treatment includes the use of anti-inflammatories and, if necessary, corticosteroid injections in the affected area. Rest, use of ice, compression and elevation of the affected arm are also important. These measures should be started early, within the first 48-72 hours, and help reduce pain and bleeding within the joint. Ice should be applied for 20-minute periods every 2 hours. The arm must be immobilized for a period of 2 days to 6 weeks, depending on the severity of the injury. Surgery is indicated in the most severe cases (IV to VI) and involves reconstructing the damaged ligaments. If a fracture occurs, surgery may also play a role. After treatment is complete, return to sports activity depends on the absence of pain and swelling, the presence of 80% of shoulder strength capacity, full range of passive to active shoulder movements, and stability of the shoulder blade.",
        "Prevention": "Prevention involves the use of appropriate protections in contact sports, correct warming up and cooling down, frequency of training programs that develop strength, balance, coordination and flexibility, progressive increase in training intensity, adequate rest between training sessions, consumption of water before, during and after exercise and stop whenever you feel pain.

    "Shoulder dislocation": {
        "What is it?": "Shoulder dislocation is an injury that occurs when the head of the humerus moves out of its anatomical position in the joint. The shoulder is the most mobile joint in the body, which makes it the most susceptible to dislocation. The occurrence of a first episode of dislocation increases the risk of further episodes of dislocation - Recurrent Shoulder Dislocation/Shoulder Instability. Due to its characteristics, the shoulder joint is the most frequently dislocated. In fact, although it is very mobile, it is also very unstable and is maintained in its position by a set of ligamentous and muscular structures. Anterior displacement is the most common and accounts for around 98% of cases. In fact, anterior shoulder dislocation is the most common in hospital emergency services. Posterior dislocation may also occur, with the superior and intrathoracic variants being rarer and more complicated. One of the most common mechanisms is falling. Shoulder dislocation is more common in men aged 20-30 and in women aged around 60-80. There is a possibility of re-dislocation of about 50%. Shoulder dislocations are more common in adolescents than in children because in them the growth plates are more fragile and tend to break before dislocation occurs. In older adults, the ligaments that support the joint are weaker, making it easier for dislocation to occur. Between the ages of 18 and 25, sports activities are the main cause of shoulder dislocation. In the elderly, falls are the main factor involved.",
        "Symptoms": "Dislocations can occur as a result of falls, shoulder trauma or sports injuries, and are associated with pain, loss of arm mobility and deformity in the shoulder region. After correction of the dislocation, the patient may experience symptoms of instability: a feeling of imminent dislocation (apprehension) or other episodes of dislocation even with small movements or trauma to the shoulder. Patients with shoulder dislocation report severe pain and limited movement in the affected arm. The rounded shape of the shoulder takes on a more quadrangular shape. One of the complications of shoulder dislocation is the possibility of relapse. Shoulder dislocation can also be associated with fractures, damage to the axillary or radial nerve that may require surgery and vascular injuries that can compromise circulation in the arm. The presence of numbness in some areas of the shoulder, arm or hand should raise suspicion of nerve involvement.",
        "Causes": "Anterior shoulder dislocation results from an outward movement of the extended arm with external rotation, as occurs in volleyball. Falls on an extended arm are another risk factor. In general, all sports that involve throwing can be associated with this situation, as can contact sports. Good examples are combat sports, mountain climbing, handball, gymnastics and snowboarding. Throwing an object, catching an object, combing your hair, or turning in bed can all cause a shoulder dislocation. Posterior dislocations result from internal rotation with inward movement of the arm. Some possible causes are a fall, an epileptic seizure, an electric shock, or a direct impact.",
        "Diagnosis": "A medical examination is essential and allows for a diagnosis. Each type of dislocation presents different signs that the doctor can evaluate. It is important to evaluate the axillary nerve as well as other musculocutaneous nerves. The diagnosis of dislocation is carried out through an X-ray, which also allows the identification of other possible associated injuries, namely fractures. In cases of recurrent dislocation, the assessment should be complemented by Magnetic Resonance Imaging for a more precise definition of associated injuries, as well as for decision-making and treatment planning. Angiography and Doppler allow the assessment of potential vascular lesions and electromyography assesses the integrity of nerve structures.",
        "Treatment": "The initial treatment of the dislocation involves immediate correction of the dislocation. Subsequently, and for single episodes, the patient must be immobilized for a short period of time, medicated with anti-inflammatory drugs and directed to physiotherapy. In cases of recurrent dislocation, surgery is indicated to correct this pathology, as well as to prevent earlier progression to osteoarthritis. Treatment for shoulder dislocation consists of reducing it through a gentle but firm maneuver, performed under analgesia or sedation. After a successful reduction maneuver, it is important to immobilize the shoulder and perform a control x-ray.",
        "Prevention": "To prevent a relapse, it is important to avoid immediate participation in sports activities, as well as performing gestures that involve external rotation of the arm and its outward movement, such as combing hair.

    "Malaria": {
        "What is it?": "Malaria is caused by a parasite, Plasmodium, with Plasmodium falciparum responsible for the majority of serious or fatal cases. It is transmitted through the bite of a female mosquito. Once in the body, it multiplies in the liver, infecting red blood cells. According to the World Health Organization, around 3.3 billion people are at risk of contracting malaria during their lifetime, particularly in poorer countries. The annual incidence of this disease is estimated to be over 500 million new cases, accounting for more than one million deaths per year. Since the mosquitoes that transmit the parasite are abundant in tropical climates, these are the areas where malaria is most common. In Portugal, the disease remained endemic until around 1950, particularly in the Mondego, Sado and \u00c1gueda river basins, when the vector was eradicated. However, due to migration between Portugal and Portuguese-speaking countries located in endemic regions (Angola, Mozambique, Guinea, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe and Timor), malaria, in its imported form, continues to appear sporadically in Portugal. . In recent decades, the increase in the volume of international travel, notably to tropical destinations, has also led to an increase in imported cases. Although the majority has an external origin, it appears that the vector (mosquito) remains abundantly distributed throughout the national territory. Thus, its presence combined with the existence of imported cases and increasingly accentuated climate changes, make it possible for future infections to occur. In fact, climate change is one of the factors involved in the increase in the transmission of infectious diseases, and is related to the possibility of the re-emergence of malaria in some areas of the northern hemisphere.",
        "Symptoms": "The parasite initially enters the bloodstream and travels to the liver, where the infection develops before re-entering the bloodstream and invading red blood cells. It grows and multiplies within these blood cells, and at regular intervals the blood cells rupture, releasing more parasites into the blood. Infected red blood cells typically rupture every 48 to 72 hours. Whenever this rupture occurs, patients develop fever, chills, and sweats. The clinical presentation of malaria is very variable, and may present few symptoms or acute and very serious forms. Its evolution can be fulminant and cause death within the first few hours of the onset of the disease, which is why treatment must be instituted as early as possible in suspected cases. Symptoms include fever, headaches, vomiting and, in general, appear 10 to 15 days after the mosquito bite. If not promptly treated, it affects the irrigation of vital organs and can be fatal. About half of the world's population is at risk of contracting malaria. Most cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa. However, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and parts of Europe are also affected. The risk is greater in children who have not yet developed immunity against serious forms of the disease, in non-immune pregnant women (risk of miscarriage and death of the mother), in people infected with the HIV/AIDS virus and in international travelers without immunity.",
        "Causes": "There are several species of the parasite Plasmodium falciparum but only five cause malaria in humans: Plasmodium falciparum, responsible for the most severe forms of the disease;;/ Plasmodium vivax, which causes less symptomatic forms but can remain in the liver for up to three years;;/ Plasmodium ovale, which is rarer and can remain in the liver for years without causing symptoms;;/ Plasmodium malariae, very rare and only found in Africa;;/ Plasmodium knowlesi, also very rare.;/",
        "Diagnosis": "Early diagnosis of malaria is essential for its treatment. This should be done using a blood sample using a microscope or very rapid laboratory tests. An early and correct diagnosis not only allows for more effective treatment but also reduces the emergence of resistance to therapy.",
        "Treatment": "Recently, there has been an increase in resistance, both in mosquitoes to insecticides used and in parasites to antimalarials. Despite everything, it is a disease that can be treated and prevented. The main objective is to quickly eliminate the parasite from the patient's blood in order to prevent the progression of the disease and its complications. Another important goal is to prevent the transmission of the disease to other people. Treatment should only begin after the diagnosis has been confirmed. This is done using antimalarial drugs, the selection of which is the responsibility of the doctor. These drugs are administered orally. Chloroquine is useful for malaria caused by Plasmodium vivax, another species of this parasite. In severe cases, treatment should take place in a hospital setting.",
        "Prevention": "As general measures, it is recommended to avoid exposure during periods of greatest mosquito activity (at dawn and dusk); wear long clothing to avoid exposed areas of skin and wear closed shoes; use insect repellent on the skin and clothing; apply a mosquito net to the bed, if possible impregnated with insecticide; turn on the air conditioning to keep mosquitoes away from the room. Malaria prevention also involves the use of medications such as mefloquine, atovaquone and proguanil (Malarone\u2122), doxycycline, chloroquine or chloroquine and proguanil. The complexity of the parasite responsible for malaria makes developing a vaccine difficult. Currently, there are several under investigation. Portugal has been one of the countries where this study has been very intense. When the heat arrives, insects follow. Their bites are not usually serious, but they are annoying. Learn some strategies to protect yourself. There are several precautions to be taken to prevent any mishaps from ruining your stay in a tropical destination. Go to a traveler's consultation and ask about the risks. Being prepared is the best way to ensure that everything goes well on your vacation.

    "3D Mammography Tomosynthesis": {
        "What is it?": "Tomosynthesis is an advanced technology, which is part of the highest state of the art in breast imaging. It is a key exam in the early diagnosis of breast cancer, allowing to significantly improve the accuracy of the diagnosis with higher quality images and a lower dose of radiation. In this examination, multiple images of the breast are obtained, of thin thickness, from different angles, allowing the detection of increasingly smaller lesions (millimetric), which in conventional mammography could remain hidden due to the overlapping of the various breast structures.",
        "Its great advantage": "The equipment is similar to a common mammogram, but it uses an x-ray tube to record images from all angles, such as 1 mm thick slices of the entire breast. In addition to better definition of lesions and, consequently, greater success in the early diagnosis of breast cancer, tomosynthesis reduces the number of false positives and false negatives in conventional mammography.",

    "Contrast mammography": {
        "What is it ?": "Contrast mammography is a recent technique that uses the administration of iodinated contrast to visualize tumor neovascularization in a similar way to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with contrast. In contrast mammography, 2 minutes after intravenous administration of iodinated contrast, a dual-energy digital mammogram is acquired, providing two images per breast and per projection, one of low energy similar to digital mammography and another recombined in which the areas that capture contrast are highlighted, enabling a simultaneous morphological and functional evaluation.",
        "The big advantage": "Mammography and tomosynthesis identify anatomical changes caused by breast cancer and are the first-line exams in breast cancer screening and in breast studies of symptomatic patients. However, they are less effective in women with extremely dense breasts. MRI is superior in the evaluation of women with dense breasts and those at intermediate risk of breast cancer, and contrast-enhanced mammography is a less expensive and more accessible alternative to MRI for a wide range of women. Other advantages of contrast mammography are rapid acquisition (8-10 min) and interpretation, with an easy learning curve and good acceptance by users.",
        "Potential indications": "Contrast mammography is useful in resolving inconclusive mammography and tomosynthesis findings;;/ It can be used to assess the extent of breast cancer in preoperative staging as an alternative to Magnetic Resonance Imaging;;/ It can monitor the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast carcinoma;;/ In screening women with a history of breast carcinoma and dense breast (intermediate risk);;/ In high-risk women who cannot undergo MRI screening.;/",

    "Mastitis": {
        "What is it?": "Mastitis is a benign inflammation of the breast tissue, common during the first months of breastfeeding, especially in the first six to 12 weeks of breastfeeding. However, it can also appear in women who are not breastfeeding and in men. It is often the result of an infection and can cause pain and swelling in the breast. It most often affects just one breast, but can appear in both breasts. There are two types of mastitis: Puerperal (or breastfeeding) mastitis: This type of infection affects women who are breastfeeding and is the most common. It can make breastfeeding difficult. When you need antibiotic treatment, you can continue breastfeeding or expressing milk to give to your baby. Breast milk contains antibacterial properties that help protect the baby from infection.;/ Periductal mastitis: occurs when the milk ducts become thicker. The nipple of the affected breast may invert and produce a milky discharge. Menopausal or postmenopausal women and smokers are more likely to have this type of mastitis.;/",
        "Symptoms of mastitis": "Signs and symptoms of mastitis can appear suddenly and include: I miss my mother;/ Pain or burning sensation that is ongoing or during breastfeeding;/ Redness and swelling in the breast;/ Skin warm to the touch;/ Yellow nipple discharge;/ Feeling unwell;/ Fever;/ Body pains;/ Fatigue;/ Goosebumps;/  Some signs that you should seek medical advice for are: Inflammation or infection in the breasts that persists;/ I miss my mother;/ Sudden or severe symptoms;/ Red stripes on the chest;/ Breast milk with pus or blood;/ Symptoms do not improve within 24 hours;/ Symptoms do not improve after 48 hours of taking antibiotics;/ Having mastitis and not breastfeeding;/ Changes in the appearance of the breast and to the touch;/ Nipple discharge;/ Presence of a new nodule;/",
        "Causes": "Mastitis is a common problem in breastfeeding women and can be caused by the accumulation of milk and blockage of the milk ducts, resulting in infection. This can happen, for example, when the breast is not \u201cempty\u201d after each feed. However, women who are not breastfeeding (and men) can also get mastitis. In addition to breastfeeding, some risk factors for mastitis are: Having had mastitis while breastfeeding.;/ Cracked nipples and skin.;/ Wearing a bra that is too tight or putting pressure on your breasts, for example when wearing a seatbelt or carrying a heavy bag, which can restrict milk flow.;/ Improper breastfeeding technique or using only one position to breastfeed.;/ Being too tired or stressed.;/ Poor nutrition.;/ Smoking: Toxins in tobacco can damage breast tissue.;/ Nipple damage, such as piercings, or dermatological problems such as eczema.;/ Have breast implants.;/ Having a weakened immune system due to health problems such as diabetes.;/ Remove hair around the nipple with a razor or tweezers.;/",
        "Diagnosis": "Mastitis is diagnosed through a physical examination and by recording the symptoms and signs presented. In addition, a culture of a breast milk sample can help determine which antibiotic is most appropriate for each specific case, especially in cases of severe infection. Inflammatory breast cancer \u2014 which is a rare form of breast cancer \u2014 can also cause redness and swelling that may initially be mistaken for mastitis. To exclude this or other breast diseases, if mastitis occurs in a person who is not breastfeeding, the doctor may prescribe a mammogram and/or ultrasound. If symptoms persist even after taking antibiotics, a biopsy may be necessary to rule out other problems, including breast cancer.",
        "Mastitis treatment": "When mastitis is confirmed, the doctor may prescribe oral antibiotics to combat the infection and painkillers. The infection should disappear within ten days, however, there are situations in which it can last up to three weeks. Most of the time, mastitis during breastfeeding resolves without the need for medical treatment. Women who are breastfeeding and have breast inflammation can continue breastfeeding, starting with the breast that does not have symptoms, and after each feeding, empty the affected breast, either manually or using a pump. You can also apply cold compresses after breastfeeding, get a massage, wear a bra with good support, rest whenever possible and drink plenty of fluids. Some strategies that can be applied to breastfeeding for a more appropriate technique are: Avoid having an excessive amount of milk for a long time before breastfeeding. If necessary, express milk manually or with a pump between feedings.;/ Try to ensure that your baby is latching on correctly - something that can be difficult if your baby is engorged. Hand expressing a small amount of milk before feeding can help.;/ Massage the breast in circular motions while breastfeeding or pumping, starting at the affected area and moving down to the nipple to help the milk flow.;/ Make sure you drain your breasts completely while breastfeeding. Applying moist heat to your breasts before breastfeeding or expressing milk with a pump can make this easier.;/ Vary the breastfeeding position.;/",
        "Prevention": "To reduce the risk of mastitis, it is important to: Treat engorgement and cracked nipples early.;/ Make sure the baby attaches correctly to the breast.;/ Avoid tight clothing that compresses the breast.;/ Avoid compressing the breast excessively with your fingers while breastfeeding.;/ Do not use nursing pads or very tight bras that keep your nipples moist.;/ Air the breast after breastfeeding.;/ Breastfeed the baby on one side until the breast is empty of milk before switching to the other side.;/ Change the breastfeeding position so that all areas of the breast are completely empty.;/ Quit smoking (in the case of smokers).;/ American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology, julho de 2022 Cleveland Clinic, July 2022 Mayo Clinic, July 2022 NHS, July 2022 SNS24, July 2022 What is the best way to breastfeed, how to prevent problems, how to preserve breast milk.

        "What is it?": "Fear corresponds to an unpleasant emotion with physiological, cognitive and behavioral components. It occurs as a response to a consciously recognized cause of danger (real or imagined). All children have episodes of fear, with the highest incidence estimated to be between the ages of 2-6. The peak incidence occurs at 11 years of age, decreasing from that age onwards.

    "Melanoma": {
        "What is it?": "Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that starts in pigment-producing skin cells called melanocytes. These cells change and begin to grow uncontrollably and invade surrounding tissue. Although melanoma is less common than other types of skin cancer, it is arguably one of the most serious. Fortunately, melanoma can be cured if it is diagnosed and treated in its early stages, that is, when it is located only in the most superficial layer of the skin. In more advanced stages, melanoma can spread over a distance, a process called metastasis, through the blood or lymphatic system to other organs and bones, reducing the likelihood of a cure.  Melanoma grows in tissues in two ways: - radial growth (less invasive and earlier) - vertical growth, that is, deep in the dermis and close to vessels, with the capacity to cause metastases.  People with dark skin have the same number of melanocytes as people with paler skin. The difference lies in the amount of melanin that these same cells produce. Therefore, the greater the production of melanin, the darker the skin will be and vice versa.",
        "Prevention": "The number of people with melanoma has increased year after year, but there are ways to reduce your risk of developing the disease. Check your moles frequently and notify your doctor of any changes in them or your skin. If you have a lot of moles, you should see a dermatologist regularly.  You've probably heard that the most effective method of preventing melanoma is avoiding the sun. In fact, excessive exposure to the sun not only causes skin aging, but can also contribute to the development of skin cancer, particularly melanoma.  Reinforcing this association is the increased incidence of malignant melanoma in people with a history of sunburn in childhood.  However, exposure to sunlight in moderation is beneficial. In addition to the psychological effect, sun exposure is essential for synthesizing vitamin D in the skin. Vitamin D promotes joint and bone health, but it has also been linked to the prevention of certain types of cancer and autoimmune diseases. A healthy person needs 5 to 15 minutes of sun exposure most days, on their hands, arms and face, to produce a sufficient amount of vitamin D. During winter, they need 2 to 3 hours a week.  You should never use a solarium with the aim of synthesizing vitamin D. Solariums are artificial sources of ultraviolet radiation. Its use is associated with an increased risk of melanoma, particularly in people who started this practice under the age of 35. Early diagnosis leads, in most cases, to a cure of the tumor, but diagnosis in late stages leads to high mortality and morbidity, which is why it is important to increase the diagnostic reliability of melanoma This is the main reason why it is so important to detect melanoma before it affects the dermis. Most people can be cured if the melanoma is confined to the epidermis.",
        "Risk Factors": "The exact causes of melanoma are unknown. Everyone is at greater or lesser risk of developing melanoma. For this reason, monthly self-examination with the help of family members is recommended.  A risk factor is anything that increases the likelihood of developing a disease. Some risk factors are passed from parents to children through genes. Others are the result of a person's behaviors and activities. Several factors can increase the risk of melanoma. Having one or more risk factors does not necessarily mean that you will develop melanoma. On the other hand, melanomas can also occur in people without any known risk factors.  Family history of Melanoma Around 10% of melanoma patients have a family history of the same tumor.  Ultraviolet radiation Excessive exposure to UV radiation depends on the intensity of the radiation, duration of exposure and how the skin was protected. Blistering sunburns, especially during childhood, increase the risk of melanoma.  Many or atypical signs Moles are areas of skin with a lot of melanin. The existence of a high number of moles (>50) or with atypical characteristics constitutes a risk factor for melanoma. Although lighter-skinned people have a much higher risk, it is a myth that people with darker skin are immune to melanoma. Black individuals, for example, tend to develop melanomas on the palms of their hands and soles of their feet, places that are not so easily monitored.  Immunosuppression states, genetic syndromes, carriers of specific genetic mutations (CDKN2A, CDK4, MITF) They are less frequent groups of the population but with an increased risk of melanoma  It is important that you recognize your risk factors.\u00a0 This caution can help you make informed decisions about prevention and screening options.",
        "Symptoms": "Melanoma symptoms are not exclusive, they can appear in other diseases. Just because you have one or more of the symptoms described here does not mean you have melanoma.  The ABCDE rule is an easy way to remember how to distinguish healthy signs of Melanoma:  A \u2013 Asymmetry \u2013 half of the signal does not match the other half B \u2013 Irregular border \u2013 the edges of the mole are irregular, without pattern, blunt or poorly defined C \u2013 Color\u2013 the color of the signal is not uniform. There can be different shades of brown or black, and sometimes reddish, bluish or white. D \u2013 Diameter \u2013 the mole is larger than 6 millimeters \u2013 the equivalent of the eraser tip of a pencil. However, there are melanomas smaller than 6mm. E \u2013 Evolution  But, regardless of the characteristics of your signs, whenever you perform your self-examination or when you observe the signs of someone in your family or close to you, remember the following statements: I don't have any other sign like this;/ This sign is different from all the other signs I have;/ I've never seen a sign like this;/ I don't know anyone with a sign like this;/ This sign has changed in the last few years or months;/ I don't remember having this sign here;/ This sign did not exist and is growing;/ This sign was smaller than the others and now it is bigger and has a different color.;/",

The clinical subtypes of melanoma are superficial spreading melanoma, nodular melanoma, acral lentiginous melanoma, lentigo maligna, among others. The most common type of melanoma in white people is superficial melanoma, responsible for 70% of cases. It usually appears between 30 and 50 years of age, with the most common locations being the leg in women and the back in men. The 2nd most common type in white people is nodular melanoma, responsible for 15% of cases. It usually appears around the age of 50, in both sexes. Acral lentiginous melanoma is the most common type of melanoma in Asian/black populations, appearing around the age of 60-70, on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, mucous membranes or subungual.",
        "Diagnosis and Staging": "The first step in diagnosing malignant melanoma is for your dermatologist to examine your skin thoroughly. In addition to examining your skin, you will be asked about your past and present sun exposure, history of mole excision and skin tumors, and any family history of melanoma or other cancer (or other risk factors).  One tool your dermatologist may use is dermatoscopy. This non-invasive procedure involves the use of a dermatoscope, a device with a magnifying lens and a special light source, which is used to examine suspicious skin lesions. Digital images from the dermoscopy can be recorded and used for comparison in subsequent consultations. Dermoscopy allows the detection of very slight changes in existing signs and the easier detection of new signs of risk. Therefore, dermoscopy significantly increases the sensitivity of melanoma diagnosis. Although many melanomas can be recognized by their appearance with the naked eye and by dermoscopy, a definitive diagnosis is made with a biopsy. To perform a biopsy, the dermatologist will remove the entire suspicious lesion. This sample will be evaluated by a pathologist who will identify the cancerous cells. If the sample reveals the presence of melanoma, the dermatologist will determine the complementary diagnostic procedure to follow and the appropriate treatment, according to several factors such as the depth of penetration of the melanoma.  Sentinel lymph node survey One of the factors that determines the severity of melanoma is whether cancer cells have spread into the bloodstream. These cells may become lodged in the lymph nodes, which filter the lymph. Lymph node testing can help answer this question. In sentinel lymph node testing, a dye is injected into the site of the lesion and then travels through the lymphatic pathway to the lymph node that receives lymph from the site of the lesion, the \"sentinel\" lymph node. The \"sentinel\" lymph node is then removed and analyzed. If there are malignant cells in the sentinel lymph node, the remaining lymph nodes in that region are removed. Sentinel lymph node examination is an examination whose results provide an idea of \u200b\u200bthe patient's clinical prognosis. Its results, including any lymph node emptying, do not influence the patient's life expectancy.  Genetic testing Genetic testing can provide information about your risk of melanoma by looking for specific genetic mutations. If mutations that increase your risk of melanoma are found, your risk can be reduced by adopting prevention and early detection practices.  Genetic testing is indicated in the following situations: Personal history of melanoma and at least one close family member with melanoma;/ Two or more close family members with melanoma;/ Personal history includes three or more melanomas, even if there is no family history of the disease;/  Computerized axial tomography A computed tomography (CT) scan uses x-rays to obtain detailed images of structures inside the body. Unlike a conventional x-ray, a CT scan shows details in soft tissues and internal organs. This diagnostic test can help show whether lymph nodes or organs are enlarged, which could be due to melanoma growth. Staging is the process by which we determine whether cancer cells have spread from the skin to other nearby or more distant structures. The information obtained through the staging process determines the stage of the disease, which is essential for planning treatment. In addition to the information obtained by diagnostic biopsy, the following tests are used to stage the melanoma: blood tests;;/ imaging tests such as radiography, tomography, magnetic resonance imaging or PET.;/  Your doctor will also check the lymph nodes near the melanoma to see if they have increased in size and may take a sample of cells from them using a procedure called an aspiration biopsy. The sample will then be evaluated under a microscope by the pathologist.  Based on the diagnostic tests performed, melanoma staging can be classified as follows: Stage 0 \u2013 melanoma in situ \u2013 means that the cells are confined to the epidermis and are very thin; Stage I\u2013 in stage IA, the tumor is less than 1mm. Stage IB melanoma may be the same thickness but ulcerative, or 2mm thick but without signs of ulceration. In both cases, there is no cancer in the lymphatic tissues or distant organs; Stage II \u2013 this phase is divided into 3 groups \u2013 A, B and C \u2013 depending on the thickness of the tumor and/or the degree of ulceration. At this stage there is no cancer in the lymphatic tissues or distant organs; Stage III \u2013 At this stage, the melanoma has reached adjacent lymphatic tissues. Clinical staging includes tumors of any size with lymphatic metastases; Stage IV \u2013 Melanoma at this stage has spread to one or more organs in the body.",
        "Treatment": "Surgery The first-line treatment for primary melanoma is surgical removal of the tumor. The amount of tissue adjacent to the tumor to be removed depends on the thickness of the primary melanoma. Usually, widening of the surgical margins by removing adjacent normal tissue is performed in a second surgical procedure. The aim is to significantly reduce the likelihood of local tumor reappearance. Surgery is most effective if the lesion is thin - less than 1 mm thick - and if it has not spread to the lymph nodes. In some cases of melanoma at a very early stage, it is possible to remove the lesion with local anesthesia at a dermatology consultation. In any case, this procedure must be carried out by specialists in oncological dermatology. Our dermatology surgeons are supported whenever necessary by a multidisciplinary team, made up of specialists in Imaging, Pathological Anatomy, General Surgery, Plastic Surgery, Otorhinolaryngology, Oncology and nursing. If the melanoma is deep (more than 4 mm thick) or has spread to the lymph nodes, the likelihood of recurrence or metastasis of the disease is greater. In this case, adjuvant treatment - any therapy administered in addition to the main treatment - can be used after surgery, to increase the possibility of cure.  This procedure is generally recommended in cases where there is a high probability of melanoma metastasizing to the lymph nodes. The pathologist analyzes the removed lymph node to determine whether it contains cancerous cells. This additional knowledge helps the clinical team decide the next steps, such as whether further treatment is needed. The behavior of melanoma in more advanced stages is extremely aggressive, and can cause early distant metastases, either via lymphatic or hematogenous routes.  Recently, new drugs have emerged for the treatment of metastatic melanoma, which are immunotherapy and targeted therapies. These therapies can control the disease more effectively than classical chemotherapy. Immunotherapy;/ Immunotherapy has proven to be very effective in treating advanced melanoma, although not all people with melanoma respond to treatment in the same way. There are several forms of immunotherapy, the most common being called Check Point Inhibitors. These inhibitors release immune cells (T-Cells) that seek out and destroy tumor cells. Targeted Therapies;/ One approach to melanoma treatment involves the use of drugs (also called therapies) that can target and disable the cells with these mutations. This, in turn, can cause tumors to shrink or grow less rapidly. Researchers have identified several major genetic mutations associated with melanoma.BRAFmutations are the most common mutation found in tumor cells. Patients who have had melanoma should be periodically monitored by an oncologist or dermatologist in consultation. Blood tests as well as imaging tests of the liver, bones and brain may be requested.

It sometimes appears during pregnancy and is commonly known as \u201cpano\u201d or chloasma. People with darker skin are more likely to have it, such as those who have a family member with this type of blemish.",

        "Diagnosis": "In the vast majority of cases, the dermatologist makes the diagnosis directly from the observation of skin lesions. A skin biopsy may be justified in cases where the diagnosis is not clear and it is necessary to differentiate from other conditions. The examination may be complemented by the use of a Wood's light device to inspect the skin in detail.",
        "Treatment": "Melasma may gradually disappear without treatment when there is a triggering factor that stops, such as the pill or pregnancy.

    "Meningitis": {
        "What is it?": "Meningitis is a disease caused by inflammation of the meninges, which are the membranes that protect the brain and spinal cord. This inflammation is usually the result of an infection of the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Within infections, it is important to distinguish between the different strains: Viral meningitis, the most common and which tends to be less serious and which is caused by viruses such as enteroviruses;;/ Bacterial meningitis, in which the bacteria most frequently involved are Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus), Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) and Haemophilus influenzae type B and which are serious infections that can be fatal;;/ Fungal meningitis, which is rarer and can occur from inhaling fungi in the environment or in patients affected by diabetes, cancer or HIV/AIDS infection;;/ Meningitis caused by parasites, important in less developed countries.;/ When the meninges are inflamed, damage to the brain or spinal cord can occur. Meningitis in children is an important public health problem and, despite advances made in recent decades, mortality associated with this disease has remained practically unchanged. In fact, the majority of cases, around 70%, occur before the age of five.\u00a0Although there is also progress in terms of antibiotic treatment, the mortality rate inherent to this infection remains high, between 5% and 15%, and permanent sequelae, such as deafness and changes in psychomotor development, occur in around 25% of survivors.",
        "Symptoms": "It's not always easy to recognize your symptoms. In the early stages, they are similar to flu or gastroenteritis, but the disease\u00a0can progress quickly and be fatal within hours. In the case of meningococcal meningitis, the incubation period varies between one and 10 days, but, in general, does not exceed four. Meningitis may initially manifest as vomiting, nausea, muscle pain, fever, headache, cold extremities and skin rashes that persist under pressure. These begin as small spots and progress to resemble bruises, meaning that blood has passed from the vessels to the tissues under the skin. In babies, meningitis can be manifested by crying, a more prominent fontanelle,\u00a0difficulty waking up, limp or very stiff limbs, refusal to feed, difficult breathing and a skin rash. In older children, there may be stiff neck, joint pain, drowsiness or confusion, photophobia, chills with cold extremities, and rash.",
        "Causes": "Although the causes of meningitis are diverse, viral infections are, in fact, the most common. Bacterial meningitis is generally acquired from the environment through the airways and, as such, is very contagious. Other possible causes include trauma with skull fracture, brain surgery, some types of cancer, ear infections and mastoiditis, or the use of certain drugs. The type of bacteria that causes meningitis varies in different age groups. Streptococci and other gram-negative bacteria are common in newborns, but in older children, meningococcus and pneumococcus predominate. In Portugal, serogroup B of Neisseria meningitidis is the main responsible for the invasive disease. The introduction of the conjugate vaccine against meningococcus C in the National Vaccination Plan, in 2006, allowed an important reduction in the incidence of meningococcus C meningitis. The vaccine against meningococcus B is recommended by the Portuguese Society of Pediatrics, but is not yet mandatory, except for some risk groups. Other meningococci such as A, W and Y also have a vaccine that gives them protection. Pneumococcal meningitis is associated with a high mortality rate and serious sequelae. The pneumococcal vaccine has been available since 2001 and was included in the National Vaccination Schedule in 2015, which represents an important step in the fight against this disease. In\u00a0Portugal, there was a clear decrease in the number of cases of pneumococcal\u00a0disease caused by the serotypes included in the vaccine. Invasive disease caused by Haemophilus influenzae is caused by strains that belong, in most cases, to type B. After the start of universal vaccination, the incidence of this agent decreased significantly.",
        "Diagnosis": "It is based on the clinical history, medical examination and additional tests. Of these, the most important are blood tests and lumbar puncture, which allows the collection and analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid that circulates around the brain and spinal cord, under the meninges. This is by far the most important test.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment depends on age, severity of the disease, the causal agent and the presence of other associated pathologies. Viral meningitis, which is much more common, resolves quickly without any treatment. In bacterial cases, treatment is essential and involves hospitalization, antibiotics and supportive medications. This type can invade the bloodstream, causing a generalized infection (septicemia) and should be considered a medical emergency.",
        "Prevention": "There are several vaccines that prevent meningitis caused by meningococcus, pneumococcus and Haemophilus and that are administered in childhood. Some are included in the National Immunization Program, being free, and others must be purchased.

    "Menopause": {
        "What is it?": "Menopause corresponds to the end of spontaneous menstruation and can be confirmed after 12 consecutive months without any menstrual period. It is a natural and perfectly normal biological process in a woman's life. This period signals the end of fertility. In the Western world, the average age at which women reach menopause is 51.4 years, and it can occur between 40 and 58 years. Some cases occur very early, around 30, and others occur later, around 60 years of age. It is estimated that the average age at which spontaneous menopause occurs in the Portuguese population is around 48 years. Although average life expectancy has increased, the age at menopause has remained constant. This is a reduction in the activity of the ovaries, which stops releasing eggs monthly. At the same time, estrogens begin to be produced in smaller quantities. This new hormonal environment, when it occurs suddenly, causes more intense symptoms than if it occurs gradually, more slowly. The first expression of a significant reduction in the function of ovarian follicles is the appearance of menstrual irregularities, which can last for several years. Initially, the cycles become shorter, maintaining some regularity; later, they become irregular, with cycles of very variable duration occurring. Amenorrhea (i.e., absence of normal menstruation) appears after some time, when ovarian failure occurs, due to the total consumption of its follicles. Although it is a normal process, the changes associated with menopause have an important impact on several aspects of a woman's life, and can make this stage a very difficult period.",
        "Symptoms": "The symptoms result, fundamentally, from the lack of estrogen that manifests itself in various organs and systems. The earliest ones result from vasomotor, psychological and genitourinary disorders. Vasomotor disorders correspond to \u201chot flashes\u201d and sweating and are the most common complaints, affecting around 60% to 80% of women, and tend to be more intense in the first two years, ending spontaneously five years after menopause. Hot flashes manifest as a wave of heat that mainly affects the upper half of the body followed, after a few minutes, by cold sweats. They are accompanied by an increase in frequency and can be associated with vertigo. They are neither controllable by the woman nor predictable. Psychological disorders include difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep, as well as morning insomnia. There may be symptoms of depression, although an association between depression and menopause has not yet been clearly defined. Genito-urinary disorders result in atrophy of the vaginal mucosa with dryness that causes irritation and pain associated with sexual intercourse. There is also a greater tendency to urinary infections. This situation can reduce a woman's libido and self-esteem, harming life as a couple. Later symptoms of menopause occur at the brain, skin, joint, cardiovascular, bone and weight levels. These include a higher incidence of Alzheimer's disease and strokes, less elasticity of the skin, with the more intense appearance of \u201cwrinkles\u201d, more joint complaints, especially in the hands, a higher incidence of acute myocardial infarction in women From the age of 50, there is an increase in the occurrence of osteoporosis and weight gain. Decreased estrogen levels further increase the risk of retinal disease, glaucoma and colon cancer.",
        "Causes": "This is a normal process related to age. However, there are several factors that can influence its onset. Smoking, lack of pregnancy, exposure to toxic chemicals, antidepressants and epilepsy are other factors associated with early menopause. On the other hand, having several pregnancies, being overweight and having a high IQ in childhood are related to the later onset of menopause. Genetics can play an important role in this entire process. Radiotherapy, chemotherapy, premature ovarian failure, in which a woman stops producing hormones before the age of 40, smoking and hypothyroidism are other causes of earlier menopause.",
        "Diagnosis": "This diagnosis is essentially clinical: a woman between 45 and 52 years of age, with no normal menstruation for at least one year, with no identifiable cause for this amenorrhea, or with menstrual irregularities and vasomotor disorders, is certainly in the menopause phase. Hormone levels are of limited value, as hormones are secreted in peaks and present large variations at this stage. However, they are important in specific cases.",
        "Control symptoms": "For many women, no treatment is necessary because the symptoms tend to go away on their own or because they can tolerate them without much discomfort. Controlling the symptoms of menopause involves the use of low-dose contraceptives that reduce hot flashes, vaginal dryness and mood swings. In addition to hormonal treatments, medications from other classes can be used to control symptoms. The choice of medication should always be individualized and defined by the doctor. Introducing changes in lifestyle and diet, practicing physical exercise, and reducing stress levels are some strategies that can alleviate typical symptoms. It is important to stop smoking, as smokers begin menopause one to two years earlier than non-smokers. Tobacco also contributes to heart disease and osteoporosis. Taking calcium and vitamin D supplements can protect against osteoporosis. When menopause occurs before the age of 40, it is considered premature, which can happen for genetic reasons or other factors. It is necessary to understand the reasons that lead to the absence of menstruation in a woman of childbearing age, as amenorrhea can be a symptom of a health problem. Abnormal uterine bleeding can occur at any age, but it requires proper evaluation and treatment due to the risk of anemia and other complications.

    "Ringworm": {
        "What is it?": "Mycoses are infections caused by fungi that affect the skin, nails and hair and are present in all places, and can be found in soil and animals. Even on human skin there are several species of fungi that, under normal conditions, do not cause disease. Keratin is a substance that is present on the surface of the skin, nails and hair, and constitutes a source of nutrients for these fungi which, whenever they find conditions favorable to their growth, reproduce and start to cause the disease. These conditions, which alter the balance between the fungus and its host, can be heat, humidity, a decrease in defenses or the long-term use of antibiotics. Basically, they are opportunistic infections, because these fungi only cause disease when the host is weak. There are several types of superficial mycoses, the most common being pityriasis versicolor, ringworm, candidiasis and onychomycosis. Apithyriasis versicolor is a chronic disease that appears and disappears cyclically and is universally distributed. The fungus that causes it belongs to the Malassezia genus and is more common in adolescents and young people. The typical appearance of pityriasis versicolor is the presence of white patches on the skin, with scaling, located on the upper part of the arms, trunk, neck and face. These can be grouped or isolated. More rarely, these spots are dark or reddish. In these cases, it is possible that the skin does not recover its normal pigmentation or that it takes many months after treating the infection for this to happen;;/ Mycoses are another set of superficial mycoses caused by different types of fungi. They can affect the feet (athlete's foot), scalp, nails, beard or any other part of the body and appear in the form of red, peeling spots with a well-defined contour and the formation of blisters or crusts. The most common complaint is itching, which can be very intense or even painful. Injuries caused by scratching can infect them;;/ In the case of Candidiasis, the infection is caused by fungi of the Candida genus. This genus can cause superficial and deep mycoses, which are more serious. Some of its forms of presentation are \"thrush\" in newborns, which takes the form of whitish plaques on the oral mucosa, fissures in the corners of the mouth, more common in the elderly, or the formation of delimited red plaque lesions that present a whitish exudation with fissures at the level of the skin folds, such as the inframammary, axillary or inguinal folds. These infections are also referred to as intertriginous or intertrigo. Mycoses caused by fungi of the genus Candida tend to cause itching or burning. When this fungus affects the nails, it tends to grow at their base, causing painful inflammation with the formation of pus. Nails may turn white or yellow and stand out from the finger.;/ Onychomycosis can affect toenails and fingernails. They are more common after the age of 55 and are rare in childhood. Infected nails have a different color and become deformed and thickened, and may become detached from their bed.;/",
        "Symptoms": "Often, the first signs of mycosis are very subtle and can result in the appearance of spots, blisters, cracks, scales or itching. The development pattern then depends on the type of fungus, its location and the general condition of the patient.",
        "Causes": "These fungi are present in the most diverse places, including on human skin where, under normal conditions, they do not cause any disturbance. When these fungi find favorable conditions for their growth, they reproduce and cause disease. It is therefore an opportunistic infection, in which anything that can reduce the host's defenses becomes a potential cause of mycosis. Diabetes, prolonged use of oral antibiotics and any pathology or treatment that affects the normal functioning of the immune system stand out due to their frequency.",
        "Diagnosis": "The initial diagnosis of mycosis results from the clinical history and medical examination, but it is the direct examination of samples obtained from lesions on the skin, nails or mucosa that allows a more accurate diagnosis that can guide treatment. This material can be cultivated in the laboratory for a better characterization of the fungus involved, but the process is slow.",
        "Treatment": "It depends on the type and severity of the mycosis: Treatment of pityriasis versicolor can be done with topical or oral antifungal medications;;/ For ringworm, it is done with antifungal creams. The most common active ingredients are miconazole, clotrimazole, econazole and ketoconazole;;/ Superficial Candida mycoses are easily cured by using antifungal creams or lotions. The cream should usually be applied for seven to 10 days. As this is an opportunistic infection, it is essential to identify the underlying factors and try to correct them in order to prevent further episodes.;/ In onychomycosis, local or oral medications are used. These nail mycoses are the most difficult and time-consuming to treat, and can last more than 12 months. Stopping treatment prematurely can lead to failure.;/",
        "Prevention": "Adopting adequate hygiene habits is important in this prevention. Given the widespread presence of these fungi and their opportunistic nature, it is essential to take measures that, on the one hand, avoid direct contact with the fungus and, on the other, reduce the development of conditions conducive to its multiplication. Therefore, after bathing, the skin must be thoroughly dried, especially the skin folds and toes, in order to avoid moisture that facilitates the growth of fungi. For the same reason, it is important to avoid keeping wet clothes on for long periods, avoid hot, tight clothing and closed shoes in the summer, not wear other people's clothes or personal objects, not use manicure materials that are not properly disinfected and not go barefoot on damp floors or where other people frequent. The use of antibiotics must be subject to medical prescription and the duration of use must be respected. Diabetes control is also essential. And if there are pets, it is important to detect and treat any changes to their skin or fur. Finally, whenever moving on land, gloves should be worn.

    "Multiple myeloma": {
        "What is it?": "Multiple myeloma (also known simply as myeloma) is a cancer originating in the plasma cells of the bone marrow. Mutations in plasma cell genes can turn them into myeloma, and unlike normal plasma cells, myeloma cells produce new cells that are not needed and do not die when old or damaged. Myeloma cells successively make more copies of themselves. As a result, a group of myeloma cells is formed, all with the same genetic defect. Myeloma cells are diseased plasma cells that still produce immunoglobulins. These immunoglobulins are ineffective, they are all the same and are called monoclonal because they originate from the same clone, accumulate in the blood and are eliminated through the urine. Therefore, in a patient with multiple myeloma, a blood test is very important to find these immunoglobulins.",
        "Prevention": "There are no prevention or screening strategies for multiple myeloma. Your doctor will be monitoring your routine blood tests and any symptoms you may have.",
        "Risk Factors": "Any behavior or condition that increases your risk of developing a disease is a risk factor. Just because one or more risk factors apply to you, it does not necessarily mean that you will develop multiple myeloma. Similarly, multiple myeloma can occur in individuals who have no known risk factors. The causes of multiple myeloma have not yet been found, but some risk factors are known. The main risk factors are as follows: Age - The majority of multiple myeloma diagnoses occur in individuals over 65 years of age; Being male - The incidence is higher in men, although the reasons for this are not known; Personal history of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance - This pathology is not malignant in nature and is a laboratory finding of an abnormal immunoglobulin, and occurs when some plasma cells produce immunoglobulins that are all the same (monoclonal). It may evolve into myeloma over years or decades. It is not treatable and the level of immunoglobulins should be monitored; Family history of multiple myeloma - Studies indicate that the risk increases if you have direct family members with a history of the disease.",
        "Symptoms": "The symptoms of multiple myeloma are not exclusive, they can appear in other diseases. Just because you have one or more of the symptoms described here does not mean you have multiple myeloma. In healthy individuals, there are enough normal blood cells to produce antibodies. In a patient with myeloma, there is a deficit of normal blood cells produced when the marrow is full of myeloma cells. Likewise, normal antibodies are fewer in quantity than the defective monoclonal antibodies produced by myeloma cells. Symptoms of myeloma may include: Fatigue and lack of strength \u2013 fatigue and lack of strength are symptoms of anemia, or a low number of red blood cells. Anemia can be caused by the bone marrow being occupied by too many myeloma cells, which reduces the production of red blood cells;;/  Bruising or bleeding easily from wounds or other trauma \u2013 Platelets help repair wounds and stop bleeding by creating clots. Bruising or bleeding easily is a symptom of low platelet counts.;/  Frequent infections and fever \u2013 Fever is a sign that the body is trying to fight an infection. Fevers and frequent infections are symptoms of altered immunity that can occur due to a low number of white blood cells, or due to changes in the quantity and quality of monoclonal antibodies that do not effectively combat infections;;/  Bone injuries and pain \u2013 myeloma can cause injuries to the bones and these can be painful and cause fractures. The regions most frequently affected by myeloma are the spine, skull and pelvis. And the most frequent location of fracture is in the vertebrae;;/  Kidney malfunction- the kidneys are a pair of organs that filter the blood in order to remove metabolic waste, and are often affected by the immunoglobulins produced by myeloma.;/  Intense thirst, nausea and/or constipation \u2013 symptoms that can be caused by poor kidney function, as mentioned in the previous item;;/  Weight loss \u2013 a common symptom of oncological diseases in general.;/",
        "Who should I contact?": "If myeloma is suspected, due to symptoms or a complementary diagnostic test that shows changes, a Clinical Hematologist should be consulted. Meet our team of experts Make your contact request so we can follow up from the first moment. If you prefer, you can schedule an appointment via our toll-free line. It is important to distinguish between isolated or solitary plasmacytoma and multiple myeloma. Plasmacytoma is an accumulation of diseased plasma cells in a single bone location, usually a vertebra. Multiple myeloma is a disease in which there are diseased plasma cells that cause multiple bone lesions, in addition to changes in the functioning of the bone marrow, caused by the occupation of the marrow by these diseased cells.",
        "Diagnosis and Staging": "The tests most frequently used to diagnose multiple myeloma are: Blood tests \u2013 the aim is to measure the level of dysfunctional immunoglobulins in the blood, the level of red blood cells to identify anemia, white blood cells and platelets. The level of calcium in the blood and creatinine are also analyzed, as an indicator of kidney function; Urine analysis \u2013 to identify the presence of abnormal immunoglobulins in the kidneys; Skeletal imaging exams \u2013 imaging exams, namely radiography, are used to check for possible fractures or reduction in thickness; Iliac bone biopsy and myelogram \u2013 these procedures that can be done together consist of removing a small fragment of iliac bone or aspiration of bone marrow contents. It is a procedure performed by a hematologist or oncologist, with the individual lying face down, using local anesthesia. It is not a very painful procedure and is essential in diagnosing this disease. Only observation under a microscope of the cells collected in the biopsy and myelogram by Pathological Anatomy can confirm the diagnosis of multiple myeloma. Staging is the process by which we assess the extent to which myeloma has spread to various bones and the impact the disease has on the body. The information obtained through the staging process determines the stage of the disease, which is essential for treatment to be planned. When the diagnosis of multiple myeloma is confirmed through a bone biopsy and a myelogram, the next step is to stage the disease through blood tests that include analysis of albumin and beta 2 microglobulin, as well as imaging tests such as CT scan and Magnetic Resonance Imaging to assess the state of the bone structure. Based on the diagnostic tests performed, myeloma staging can be classified as follows: Stage I - multiple myeloma causes the first symptoms; blood tests show mild anemia and the presence of low levels of dysfunctional immunoglobulin; calcium levels are normal and radiological examinations of the bones do not indicate any lesions; Stage II \u2013 multiple myeloma has progressed, presenting symptoms intermediate between stage I and stage III; Stage III \u2013 blood tests indicate anemia below 8.5, high calcium levels and high levels of dysfunctional immunoglobulins; radiological examinations show more than 3 lesions in the bones.",
        "Treatment": "The multidisciplinary clinical team will assess the best treatment to follow. Treatments for multiple myeloma may include systemic therapy such as chemotherapy, thalidomide therapy, cortisone, radiotherapy and bone marrow transplant. The modalities to be used vary from case to case, but generally all patients receive systemic therapy. Most patients under the age of 65 are candidates for bone marrow transplants, and in some cases radiotherapy can be used to treat a more affected bone. If the patient has subclinical or Stage I multiple myeloma, he or she may decide with his or her doctor not to undergo treatment before showing symptoms, but rather maintain surveillance. Although this decision may avoid or delay treatment, it increases the risk of not being able to control the disease before it progresses. The patient should discuss the pros and cons of it with their doctor and decide the best option for their case. Monitoring for multiple myeloma includes consultations with the doctor who treated you and blood tests. Multiple myeloma is generally treated and followed by hematologists. Imaging tests and myelogram or bone biopsy may be necessary to make sure that the myeloma remains inactive. Blood is composed of plasma and three types of elements: platelets, red blood cells and white blood cells. Platelets help prevent bleeding, red blood cells carry oxygen to all areas of the body and white blood cells are cells that form our immune system and help fight infections. Blood cells are produced in the bone marrow - a tissue of the blood system that lies at the centre of most bones. It is in the bone marrow that the so-called stem cells and all the other blood cells in various stages of formation are found, from which all blood cells are produced. Many classes of white blood cells are formed from a stem cell. One such class is B lymphocytes, which become plasma cells when a bacterium or virus (microorganism) invades the body. In a healthy person, fewer than 5 out of 100 cells in the bone marrow are plasma cells. In normal bone marrow there are plasma cells, cells that produce antibodies - also called\u00a0immunoglobulins\u00a0-\u00a0which are proteins that cling to bacteria and viruses in order to help the body eliminate them. Each type of plasma cell makes only one \u00a0antibody against a specific antigen, designed to attack a specific type of microorganism that is causing a disease. There are 5 types of antibodies, and they all differ from each other in the way they fight infections. Some are more present in the blood, others are more present in other places, such as secretions. Without the necessary diversity of plasma cells to produce antibodies, the body cannot fight infectious diseases.

    "Myoma": {
        "What is it?": "A uterine fibroid (also called fibroid, leiomyoma or fibromyoma) is a benign tumor that grows in the tissue of the uterus and is very rare to become malignant. It may be isolated or several small ones may appear, occurring in around 20% to 50% of women of childbearing age. Depending on the location, fibroids can be intramural, subserous or submucosal. The first, which grow in the wall of the uterus, are the most common. The second are located in the endometrium, and tend to cause more blood loss. The third ones grow on the outer wall of the uterus. In many cases, myoma can go unnoticed without manifestations. In around 30% of women, they cause symptoms such as abnormal uterine bleeding, very heavy and prolonged periods, which can lead to anemia. The risk of developing them increases with age, family history, eating habits and obesity. In Portugal, uterine fibroids affect between 30% and 60% of the female population in general. In women of reproductive age the incidence is between 20% and 40%. But it is estimated that around two million have this condition.",
        "Symptoms": "The most common symptoms are pain in the back of the legs, a feeling of pain or pressure in the pelvic region, heavy and prolonged menstrual periods and blood loss between periods, constipation or gas due to compression of the abdomen, an increase in volume that can be confused with excess weight or pregnancy, pain during sexual intercourse, pressure in the bladder with a constant feeling of needing to urinate, incontinence or inability to empty the bladder. Sometimes, they can cause polyps to grow in the endometrium, which worsens pain and menstrual bleeding. If these are abundant and prolonged, anemia can occur, with fatigue, difficulty breathing and paleness. Fibroids can interfere with the implantation of fertilized eggs, causing infertility. During pregnancy, they can affect the blood flow to the placenta, causing miscarriage or premature birth. Pregnancy has a variable and unpredictable effect on the growth of fibroids, but they rarely increase during pregnancy.",
        "Causes": "Its causes have not yet been identified. It is known that they develop in women of reproductive age and that they do not appear before the body is capable of producing estrogens. Fibroids grow faster when the body receives additional doses of estrogen. After menopause, they stop growing and begin to reduce their size, due to the loss of this hormone. All of these elements suggest that the hormonal environment is important in the development of this disease. Genetic factors also play an important role in the development of uterine fibroids. In fact, first-degree relatives of women with fibroids have a two and a half times greater risk of developing them.",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis is based on a gynecological examination and tests such as ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging, which make it possible to confirm the presence, location and size of the fibroid.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment depends on several factors, such as age, general health, severity of symptoms, personal history and location of the fibroids. In the absence of symptoms, the doctor may decide not to treat and maintain regular monitoring. In the past, the most common treatment was removal of the uterus (hysterectomy). There are now other options. As a rule, therapy is indicated when the fibroid grows to the point of compressing other organs, such as the bladder, when it grows very quickly, when it causes abnormal bleeding or when it is associated with infertility. Treatments may include hormones that, used in combination, help to reduce its size before surgery. Fibroids can be removed through the uterus (hysteroscopy), by laparoscopy (insertion of surgical instruments through small holes in the abdomen) or by open surgery, when they are larger. In this case, the walls of the uterus may become weakened, making it necessary to have a caesarean section in a subsequent pregnancy. Removing the fibroid while preserving the uterus is important for women who wish to become pregnant, but in about 25% of cases, the disease may reappear. When it is necessary to remove the entire uterus (hysterectomy), the woman can no longer become pregnant.",
        "Prevention": "Although researchers continue to study their causes, little scientific evidence is available on how to prevent them. Preventing uterine fibroids may not be possible. However, by making healthy lifestyle choices, such as maintaining a normal weight and eating fruits and vegetables, you can lower your risk. Some studies suggest that the use of oral contraceptives may be associated with a lower risk of fibroids. Mayo Clinic Yes, they can, but not always. There are several types of uterine fibroids and not all of them influence a woman's ability to get pregnant. Abnormal uterine bleeding can occur at any age, but it requires proper evaluation and treatment due to the risk of anemia and other complications.

    "Myopia": {
        "What is it?": "Myopia, like astigmatism and hyperopia, corresponds to a refractive error, that is, a change in the morphology of the eyeball that affects the way images are formed and transmitted to the brain. In this case, the eyeball is larger than normal or the cornea, its most anterior layer, is more curved than it should be. In either situation, the images focus in front of the retina and become blurred. This\u00a0refractive error is very common, affecting around 20% to 30% of the world's population. Its prevalence varies with age, race and sex. It increases\u00a0in the first decades of life, particularly during late childhood and adolescence. It is present in 1% of children at age five, increasing to 8% at age 10 and 15% at age 15. It is slightly more common in females. In Portugal it is estimated that around 20% of children and half of the adult population suffer from significant refractive errors, including myopia and astigmatism.",
        "Symptoms": "Myopia determines a reduction in the quality of distance vision. In a child, this decrease may go unnoticed, especially if it affects only one eye. Near vision is not achieved, except in cases of very high myopia. Children may complain of headaches, tiredness, their school performance may suffer and they tend to get too close to the television or objects. As in many situations these symptoms are not noticeable, it is essential to have an ophthalmology consultation around the age of three to detect the presence of astigmatism, myopia or hyperopia and, if necessary, correct it. In adults, complaints are more obvious because visual difficulties are easily detected and correspond to headaches, eye fatigue or fatigue when driving.",
        "Causes": "Its exact cause is not known. As a rule, it is present from birth and is almost always associated with astigmatism. Although its basis is essentially genetic, myopia can appear after trauma or eye surgery. Some eye diseases, such as keratoconus, in which the cornea becomes progressively thinner, are associated with high degrees of myopia. There are several risk factors for its appearance in a child. A family history is a very important indicator. Its prevalence in the presence of a myopic parent is 20% to 40% and with both myopic parents it is 30% to 60%. Excessive use of near vision, which includes frequent and regular reading, apparently also constitutes a risk factor, although this fact has not been fully proven and is still quite controversial. In most cases it presents in a simple form that increases during childhood and adolescence at a variable rate, not exceeding six diopters. Degenerative myopia is rarer, corresponds to values \u200b\u200bgreater than six diopters and is associated with greater visual difficulty and changes in the retina that can cause complications, such as detachment. Glaucoma is also more common in these patients.",
        "Diagnosis": "In an ophthalmology consultation, there are several devices that allow for rapid detection and quantification of myopia. Even in children who do not yet cooperate with normal vision tests, there are alternatives that allow for an accurate diagnosis. In this consultation, the entire eyeball is assessed in order to study its characteristics and to exclude possible causes of myopia as well as other eye diseases.",
        "Treatment": "Mild forms, which do not significantly interfere with vision, do not require treatment. When it is high and/or when it affects the quality of vision, it is important to correct it using glasses, contact lenses or refractive surgery. Glasses are the ideal solution for children up to the age of 15. For people over 40, progressive lenses with different graduations across their surface may be necessary. Contact lenses can be used from the age of 15 as long as there are no contraindications, such as the presence of allergies, lack of tears, intense exposure to smoke or very dry environments. Its use requires rigor, hygiene and discipline, and regular medical monitoring is important to ensure the prompt detection and correction of any anomalies resulting from its use. There are several types of contact lenses and selecting the most appropriate one always depends on a prior medical evaluation. Both glasses and contact lenses compensate for refractive error but do not cure it or prevent its progression. Refractive surgery is recommended for people with myopia who are over 18 years old and have had a stable prescription for at least 12 months. Not everyone can undergo this type of intervention, so a prior medical study of each case is essential. This surgery, when performed using a laser, allows the surface of the cornea to be shaped and surface errors corresponding to myopia to be corrected. This is a simple procedure, carried out under local anesthesia, lasting 15 to 20 minutes and allowing normal vision in less than 24 hours. Even in the presence of a combined condition of astigmatism and myopia or astigmatism and hyperopia, this surgery allows reliable and safe results. An alternative to laser is the placement of a lens inside the eyeball to compensate for myopia.",
        "What is the prognosis for myopia?": "Although myopia can change over time, making it necessary to update your glasses or contact lens prescription, it is a benign process with no permanent implications for vision. The exceptions are cases of degenerative myopia, which can be associated with complications such as glaucoma or retinal detachment and which, therefore, deserve more regular observation. Children under the age of five or six are an exception. If there is significant myopia present from the first years of life and not corrected until that age, a condition called amblyopia, the common \u201clazy eye\u201d, may occur, which implies interruption of the normal development of vision. This interruption, after this age, tends to become permanent and irreversible. Hence the need for a first consultation for all children around the age of three, in order to ensure that any type of refractive error is promptly diagnosed and corrected before the onset of amblyopia.",
        "Prevention": "It is present from birth and although its exact cause is unknown, it is known that there is a genetic basis for its occurrence. Therefore, it is not possible to prevent it.

    "Molluscum contagiosum": {
        "What is it?": "Molluscum contagiosum is a common and contagious skin viral infection caused by a virus, very common in children, especially those with atopic eczema, although it can sometimes also appear in adults. It causes raised nodules or papules with a depressed center, similar to pearls, white, pink or yellowish in color. The virus mainly affects children under 15 years of age. The papules are usually painless and do not itch. They can affect any area of \u200b\u200bthe skin, but are usually found on the trunk, arms and legs. They usually heal without intervention within six to 12 months and do not leave scars. In less common cases, it can take up to four years for the cure to occur. It is not serious or has any impact on general health and, therefore, is not included in the legal list of diseases that result in mandatory school exclusion.",
        "Symptoms": "Molluscum contagiosum manifests itself through the appearance of small, skin-colored or slightly yellowish spots. The size varies between the head of a pin and three millimeters. They can affect any location, face, trunk or limbs, and vary in number between half a dozen and dozens of lesions.",
        "Causes": "Molluscum contagiosum is contracted through direct contact, usually in humid environments such as swimming pools or changing rooms. Humidity softens the skin and facilitates the penetration of the virus.",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of molluscum contagiosum is based on the characteristic appearance of the lesion. In case of doubt, a skin biopsy can be performed to confirm the diagnosis.",
        "Treatment": "There is no specific treatment. Normally the initial approach is with corrosive products. Its application is intended to destroy the molluscs and cause some irritation around the lesions. This will help the child's body to create defenses against the virus, facilitating its elimination and protecting it from future reinfections. If this method fails, local anesthesia is performed with the application of anesthetic creams and the molluscs are removed by scraping.",
        "Prevention": "This condition can be prevented by avoiding direct contact with the skin lesions of an infected person. Treating the underlying eczema in children can help prevent the spread of molluscum contagiosum. Sharing towels and bathing suits should be avoided. In situations of sexual transmission, prevention must be carried out with the use of condoms.

    "Open bite": {
        "What is it?": "Open bite is a type of malocclusion characterized by misalignment and lack of contact between the upper and lower dental arches when the mouth closes. Open bite malocclusion is one of the most challenging orthodontic problems. Its prevalence varies from 1.5% to 11% according to chronological and dental age. It is a type of malocclusion with a multifactorial cause and its approach is not limited to strict mechanical treatment. This condition is based on muscular, bone and dental changes associated with incorrect habits.",
        "Symptoms": "The main characteristic of this condition is the alteration of dental alignment conditioned by the anterior projection of the upper and lower incisor teeth associated with the impossibility of closing the space between both arches when the mouth is closed.",
        "Causes": "Open bite is mainly caused by four factors: Sucking your thumb or pacifier, creating tension forces that cause misalignment of the teeth;/ Speaking or swallowing by pushing the tongue between the upper and lower front teeth;/ Temporomandibular joint disorders that can cause chronic jaw pain;/ Change in the facial skeleton that is the result of non-simultaneous growth of the upper and lower jaws. This factor is generally influenced by genetics.;/",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of open bite is based on the evaluation of the jaws and upper and lower dental arches, observation of the dynamics of mouth opening and closing and inspection of the oral cavity. The evaluation involves: Complete clinical and dental history;/ Clinical examination of the oral cavity and facial skeleton;/ X-rays of the teeth and jaw;/ Study of dental alignment made with molds;/",
        "Treatment": "As many treatments are available, it is up to the specialist to recommend specific therapy taking into account age and the presence or absence of baby teeth. Methods include: Behavioral modification;/ Mechanical treatment, such as braces or Invisalign;/ Surgery;/ When open bite occurs in children who still have most of their baby teeth, it may resolve on its own by stopping the causative factors such as prolonged pacifier use and thumb sucking. If it occurs when permanent teeth are replacing baby teeth but the process is not yet complete, behavior modification may be the best recourse. It involves therapy to correct the pressure of the tongue on the jaw. If the adult teeth are growing in the same open bite pattern as the baby teeth, the placement of custom orthodontics devices may be indicated. For people with fully grown adult teeth, a combination of braces and behavior modification is often suggested. In severe cases, jaw surgery may be recommended to reposition the jaw. Other treatments include wearing a special appliance to limit the tongue's ability to push against the front teeth and wearing a guard that applies tension to pressure the jaws into realigning into the correct position.",

        "What is it?": "Anterior crossbite is defined as a malocclusion resulting from the posterior retroclination (in the lingual direction) of the upper incisor teeth in relation to the lower incisor teeth that are vertical. It may have a muscular and skeletal component. Different techniques have been used to correct it.",
        "Symptoms": "Patients with anterior crossbite present occlusion alterations resulting from poor upper vs. lower dental alignment. The cause may originally be dental or skeletal, the latter being the most frequent (e.g. mandibular prognathism or developmental alterations in the midface).",
        "Causes": "There are several causes of an open bite: Genetics;/ Delayed change of teeth or abnormal eruption of permanent teeth;/ Prolonged thumb or pacifier sucking;/ Anomalies of swallowing dynamics;/",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of crossbite involves the assessment of changes in jaw and dental alignment carried out by an oral and dental health specialist.",
        "Treatment": "Depending on the changes diagnosed, several treatment methods are available to correct anterior dental crossbite. The most common are fixed or removable palatal expanders associated with dental alignment devices.",
        "Prevention": "Following the causes of crossbite, prevention essentially involves changing finger or pacifier sucking habits, as well as changing the habit of projecting the tongue against the teeth during swallowing.

    "Narcolepsy": {
        "What is it?": "Narcolepsy is a neurological disease characterized by episodes of daytime hypersomnia accompanied by sleep disturbances. It is a type of hypersomnia. It corresponds to a neurological change in which sleep and wake control are affected. It is characterized by excessive sleepiness during the day, with intermittent and uncontrollable episodes of falling asleep. Although, in itself, it does not have serious health consequences, it is associated with feelings of fear and anxiety and increases the risk of potentially fatal accidents. As such, its impact on quality of life is very significant. The diagnosis of this pathology is often late and patients are labeled with other disorders, particularly psychiatric or neurological. Its prevalence in Europe is three to five per 10,000 inhabitants, and is most common between the second and third decades of life. The manifestations of narcolepsy usually begin early, in adolescence or young adulthood, and tend to persist throughout life.",
        "Symptoms": "In narcolepsy, patients experience sleep attacks at any time and are only temporarily able to resist the urge to sleep. These episodes can occur during any type of activity and at any time, but attacks are more likely to occur in monotonous situations, such as uninteresting meetings or long drives on the highway. Awakening from this narcoleptic sleep is as easy as from normal sleep. The person may feel good when they wake up and go back to sleep a few minutes later. There may be one or several attacks per day and each one is not very long, lasting an hour or less. Sometimes, momentary paralysis without loss of consciousness (cataplexy) occurs in response to sudden emotional situations. In these cases, the patient's extremities appear weak, and they may drop what they are holding or fall. Another manifestation of narcolepsy is the occurrence of sporadic episodes of sleep paralysis in which the patient feels, immediately after waking up, that he or she wants to move but is unable to, which gives rise to feelings of fear and anxiety. Visual or auditory hallucinations may occur at the beginning of sleep or, less frequently, upon waking, which are similar to those experienced during normal sleep, although more intense. In general, few patients with narcolepsy, around 10%, present all of these symptoms; most report only a few.",
        "Causes": "The cause of narcolepsy is a deficiency of the neurotransmitter orexin (also called hypocretin) in the hypothalamus. A deficiency of this neurotransmitter leads to excessive sleepiness. This disorder usually occurs in people with other cases in the family, which suggests a genetic predisposition. On the other hand, some tests have revealed the presence of anomalies in various brain regions in these patients that may contribute to the development of narcolepsy symptoms. The most common secondary causes of narcolepsy are: Head injuries;/ Multiple sclerosis;/ Parkinson's disease;/ Sarcoidosis;/",
        "Diagnosis": "Although the diagnosis is usually based on symptoms, it is important to emphasize that their presence does not necessarily indicate the presence of narcolepsy. Cataplexy, sleep paralysis and hallucinations are common in young children and sometimes in healthy adults who do not have other sleep disorders. If the doctor has doubts about the diagnosis, the patient may be referred to a sleep study laboratory. Recording the electrical activity of the brain through an electroencephalogram can help with this diagnosis. Before proceeding with other studies, objective and subjective sleep monitoring should be performed for 1 week (sleep diary). Narcolepsy is a disease in which no structural changes in the brain or abnormalities are observed in blood tests, so this type of test will not be useful.",
        "Treatment": "Although there is no cure for narcolepsy, some lifestyle changes may be helpful: going to bed and waking up at the same time every day; keep the room dark, at a pleasant temperature, with a comfortable bed and pillow; avoid caffeine, alcohol and heavy meals before bed; do not smoke; try to relax (hot bath, read a book) before bed; practice physical exercise regularly. Taking short naps during the day when you are most tired can also be beneficial. It is important to inform teachers or colleagues of the existence of this condition and, if necessary, try to obtain psychological support to reduce the stress associated with narcolepsy. It may also be safer not to drive. For relief from narcolepsy, stimulant medications such as ephedrine, amphetamines, dextroamphetamine, and methylphenidate are sometimes prescribed. All of these drugs must be subject to strict medical control when starting treatment. Imipramine, an antidepressant, is the drug of choice in the treatment of cataplexy.",
        "Prevention": "Narcolepsy cannot be prevented, but treatment can reduce the number of attacks. On the other hand, it is important to identify and avoid any situations that may trigger your attacks.

    "Femoral head necrosis": {
        "What is it?": "Osteonecrosis, also known as avascular necrosis or aseptic necrosis, is a disease in which there is compromised blood circulation to the femoral head. Bone necrosis leads to weakening of the bone structure and eventually to the sinking of the femoral head and loss of its sphericity.  This problem affects individuals over the age of 30 and can have a major impact on quality of life, as many of the patients are young, so they need to change their work and leisure activities after diagnosis.  5% to 12% of total hip arthroplasties are performed in patients with NACF in which there is collapse and loss of sphericity of the femoral head.",
        "Symptoms": "The most common symptom is mechanical pain, referred to the groin, and may also be referred to the buttock or trochanteric region.",
        "Diagnosis": "An early diagnosis of osteonecrosis allows treatment at an early stage.  As with any other diagnosis, clinical history is decisive. A high level of suspicion is essential, especially if the patient has risk factors for this pathology.  Plain radiography should be the first step. Radiographic changes become visible some time after the onset of the disease and include cysts, sclerosis, or a crescent sign (sign of subchondral collapse of the necrotic segment) of the femoral head. Visualization of these changes is easier on the lateral view of the hip.   Bone scintigraphy with technesium 99 was widely used in high-risk patients with negative radiographic examinations. However, recent studies have shown that bone scintigraphy has limited value and is less sensitive than MRI.  Magnetic resonance imaging, due to its high sensitivity and specificity, is currently the imaging method of choice for the early diagnosis of osteonecrosis.  Computed tomography (CT) can identify collapse of the femoral head.",
        "Treatment": "The ultimate goal of treatment for avascular necrosis of the femoral head is preservation of the native hip. The etiology and progression of the disease is highly variable.   The non-surgical methods described are hyperbaric oxygen therapy and pharmacological therapy with bisphosphonates.  Possible surgical methods include decompression of the femoral head, vascularized fibular graft, osteotomies, non-vascularized graft and arthroplastic techniques. The aim of decompression of the femoral head is to reduce intraosseous pressure and stimulate vascular flow and bone regeneration at the femoral head by creating perforations in the femoral head through the neck. This technique is indicated in the early stages of the disease and before there is collapse of the femoral head.",
        "Causes": "Osteonecrosis may be associated with traumatic or non-traumatic causes.  Osteonecrosis of the femoral head secondary to trauma almost always involves a decoapted fracture of the femoral neck or a dislocation of the hip.  Osteonecrosis of a non-traumatic nature is associated with several situations: Use of corticosteroids;/ Excessive alcohol consumption;/ Hemoglobinopathies;/ Disbarismo;/ Gaucher disease;/ Intraosseous lipid deposition;/ HIV infection;/ Retroviral treatment;/ Hypersensitivity reactions;/ Situations related to the release of thromboplastin such as pregnancy, malignant tumors and inflammatory bowel diseases.;/ Having a cast on your arm or leg helps you recover from fractures and reduces pain.

    "Nephritis": {
        "What is it?": "It is a term used to refer to the presence of inflammation of the kidneys. This is generally caused by an immunological reaction, when the body tries to defend itself against some aggression. Nephritis is responsible for 50% of kidney diseases. The kidneys are the organs that filter the blood, removing excess water, salts and metabolic products, maintaining proteins. When there are disturbances in its function, proteins are lost and tissue fluid accumulates. According to the level of severity, there are two types of nephritis: acute and chronic. In the first case, because it is a milder manifestation of the disease, with a tendency to spontaneous recovery. In the chronic form, there is progressive damage to the renal glomeruli. It can also result from an infection, such as pyelonephritis. The signs of nephritis depend on the type, location, and intensity of the immune reaction. However, the various disorders that damage the kidneys can produce different lesions, symptoms, and consequences. In general, inflammation does not affect the entire kidney. The resulting disease depends on inflammation basically affecting the glomeruli (the first part of the kidney's filtering system), the tubules and tissues surrounding the glomeruli or the infrarenal blood vessels, causing vasculitis.",
        "Symptoms": "Its main symptoms are abdominal pain and fever, reduced urine volume and the presence of blood. There is also high blood pressure, edema (swelling in a region of the body or an organ caused by the abnormal accumulation of fluids), mainly in the eyes and/or legs, extreme fatigue, difficulty sleeping, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, itching and dry skin. Cramps may occur, especially at night.",
        "Causes": "One of its main causes is infections caused by any microorganism that forms a complex known as antigen-antibody that attaches to kidney tissues. Malaria, typhus, salmonella, toxoplasmosis, herpes, and other viruses and bacteria can cause these infections. Inappropriate use of antibiotics, anti-inflammatories and medications containing lithium, gold or captopril is another possible cause. Nephritis occurs more frequently in diabetics and in the presence of autoimmune pathologies, such as Lupus.",
        "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis begins by identifying symptoms and clinical examination. Laboratory studies allow us to characterize the type and severity of nephritis and can provide information about its cause. Kidney biopsy is the most effective and conclusive diagnostic method and should be performed whenever there are doubts or when the patient does not show clinical improvement. Imaging studies, such as ultrasound, may also be useful. Renal scintigraphy is used in some cases.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment is different for the acute form and the chronic form of nephritis. In the case of acute cases, rest and some caution regarding excess water and salt are generally sufficient. If it is caused by an infection, the use of an antibiotic may be important. In chronic forms, it is very variable, depending on its type, its severity and the presence of other associated diseases. In some cases, the use of corticosteroids or other medications is very important. As well as a diet with restricted protein, potassium and salt. Likewise, blood pressure control is relevant for all forms of nephritis in order to prevent deterioration of kidney function. When there is fluid retention, diuretics may be helpful.",
        "Prevention": "An early diagnosis helps prevent many of its complications. Adequate control of blood pressure, diabetes and weight are essential aspects, as is not smoking and maintaining a healthy diet. It is very important not to take medications without a prescription, as many cases of nephritis are due to the effects of drugs. ProRim, 2013 Manual Merck online Charles M.

    "Vagus nerve": {
        "What is it?": "The vagus nerve (or pneumogastric nerve) is part of the autonomic nervous system - which controls involuntary bodily functions - and is one of many nerves that transmit messages between the brain and other parts of the body, such as the heart and digestive system. This nerve, which is the longest in the human body and the tenth of the 12 cranial nerves (cranial pair X), originates in the brain stem, passing through the neck, thorax and abdominal area to the intestine. From its origin, it divides into the right vagus nerve, which passes through the right side of the body, and the left vagus nerve, which passes through the left side. In general, the vagus nerve regulates different organs and systems of the human body, monitoring their autonomous and involuntary functioning. Involuntarily - that is, in a way that is not possible for the person to consciously control - the different branches of the vagus nerve are responsible for the increase in heart rate or the feeling of a stomach \"churning\" when faced with a threat or stress, but also for the opposite: the slowing of breathing and the relaxation of the body.",
        "Functions": "The vagus nerve controls involuntary functions of the body and, since it contains both sensory and motor fibers, it is responsible for sensations and movements and manages bodily functions such as: Heart rate and blood pressure;/ Breathing;/ Immune system;/ Digestion;/ Swallowing;/ Humor;/ Sensations in the skin and muscles;/ He speaks;/ Palate;/ Urination;/ Production of saliva and mucus;/  By managing these bodily functions, the vagus nerve ensures the body's safety, keeping the body alert in case of danger and, consequently, the person safe, even before they are aware of the existence of a threat. If this is the case, it triggers a \"fight or flight\" response. On the contrary, it also reacts to safety situations and, in these cases, provides a feeling of calm and tranquility.",
        "Illnesses": "There are diseases that can somehow involve the vagus nerve, for example: Gastroparesis: This occurs when damage to the vagus nerve makes it difficult for food to pass from the stomach to the intestines. This type of damage can result from problems such as viral infections, diabetes, abdominal surgery, and scleroderma.;/ Syncope (fainting) or vasovagal crisis: occurs when the vagus nerve, which is connected to the heart, overreacts in certain situations, such as extreme heat, anxiety, stress, hunger or pain. This type of fainting is the result of a very sudden drop in blood pressure or heart rate, causing a feeling of dizziness or fainting.;/",
        "Warning symptoms": "Depending on the cause and the area of \u200b\u200bthe nerve that is affected, problems with the vagus nerve can cause symptoms such as: Changes in heart rate, blood pressure or blood sugar;/ Abdominal pain and swelling;/ Nausea and vomiting;/ Gastroesophageal reflux;/ Difficulty swallowing or loss of gag reflex;/ Dizziness or fainting;/ Hoarseness, tired voice;/ Loss of appetite, feeling that the stomach is full quickly;/ Weight loss for no apparent reason;/",
        "Diagnosis": "When there are health problems related to the vagus nerve, the attending physician may prescribe tests related to the affected organs, such as: Echocardiogram, Holter, if there are changes in heart function;/ Computerized tomography (CT) scan or MRI scan, if there are bowel problems;/ Abdominal X-ray, ultrasound and/or digestive endoscopy if there are gastrointestinal changes;/",

    "Morton's neuroma": {
        "What is it?": "Morton's neuroma is defined as a benign swelling of the interdigital nerve (in the space between the metatarsals). Its treatment is surgical and consists of neurectomy (excision of the neuroma). This condition can be described as an \u201cirritation\u201d and/or \u201cswelling\u201d of the sensory nerve located near the metatarsal heads, between two toes. The neuroma is most common in the third intermetatarsal space (between the 3rd and 4th metatarsals) and less common in the second space. It mainly affects women and sometimes appears on both feet. This \u201cirritation\u201d may be due to external mechanical factors, such as bursitis, arthritis or metatarsal-phalangeal arthrosis or overload. And this is the reason why Morton's neuroma is often associated with hallux valgus (bunion).",
        "Symptoms": "Typically patients with Morton's Neuroma complain of intense plantar pain, described as a kind of electrical discharge between two fingers. Typically, the pain appears only when walking and especially when wearing tighter shoes, relieving when barefoot and with the feet on a cold surface. Some patients also report pain radiating backwards along the metatarsals. In some cases, they feel tingling and numbness (paresthesias) in the fingers affected by the affected sensory nerve.",
        "Causes": "The cause of Morton's neuroma is unclear. Its genesis appears to be associated with irritation, pressure or injury to one of the nerves that innervate the toes; recurrent trauma stimulates the appearance of thickening of the nerve leading to the development of the neuroma. A high percentage of patients with Morton's neuroma are women who wear high-heeled or narrow shoes. Conditions and situations that can cause nerve trauma to the bones of the toes include: High heel shoes;/ Shoes with a pointed or tight toe box that compresses the toes;/ Pes cavum (arched);/ Flat feet (commonly called flat feet);/ Bunion;/ Hammertoe, a deformity in a joint of the second, third, or fourth toe that causes it to be permanently flexed;/ High-impact sporting activities such as running, football, tennis, karate and basketball;/ foot injury or trauma;/ The impact of high-heeled shoes and pointe shoes likely explains why the condition is more common in women than men.",
        "Diagnosis": "If there is clinical suspicion, an X-ray of the foot and an ultrasound scan should be requested. If doubts persist, an MRI scan can confirm the diagnosis.",
        "Treatment": "Considering that the basis of Morton's Neuroma is repeated \u201cirritation\u201d of the nerve, treatment methods are based on reversing this mechanism. Modifying footwear or using insoles and unloading orthoses should be the first line of treatment. Corticosteroid infiltration can provide symptomatic relief, at least temporary. If conservative treatment fails, surgery is indicated. The neuroma is first freed from the fibrosis surrounding it and is then usually removed.

    "Neuralgia": {
        "What is it?": "This is an episode of very intense pain, similar to a cut, shock or burn, that occurs in association with nerve damage. This can be located anywhere on the body, but is most common in the face and neck. The cause of the injury may be a disease, such as diabetes or multiple sclerosis, an infection or aging itself. Sometimes, the causes are not identifiable. The most common types of neuralgia are those that occur after an infection by the Herpes virus (post-herpetic), trigeminal neuralgia and glossopharyngeal neuralgia.",
        "Symptoms": "Symptoms depend on the affected nerve. In the case of postherpetic neuralgia, the nerve can be virtually any nerve. It usually occurs after the vesicle phase and can last for months or years. Trigeminal pain is associated with pain along the path of this nerve, which extends from the brain to one of the faces (very common in the elderly). In general, this case results from compression of the nerve by a blood vessel. In the glossopharyngeal region, which is in the throat region, the pain affects the neck and throat. This type of thing is not that common. In addition to pain, neuralgia may be accompanied by increased sensitivity of the skin along the path of the damaged nerve, so that any touch is felt as more painful. On the other hand, numbness may also occur along this path and the muscles that receive the impulse from the affected nerve may show signs of weakness or even total paralysis.",
        "Causes": "Each nerve is protected by a coating (myelin). If this protective layer is damaged, neuralgia occurs. The most common causes are infections, such as those caused by the Herpes virus, Lyme disease, HIV, and syphilis. Multiple sclerosis is a disease that results from the degradation of myelin and, for this reason, one of its multiple symptoms is neuralgia, often in the facial region. Pressure on a nerve is another common cause. It can be exerted by a bone, ligament, blood vessel or tumor. For example, the trigeminal nerve is often caused by pressure exerted on this nerve by a dilated blood vessel. Diabetes is another reason why excess sugar can damage the myelin sheath. Other possible causes are chronic kidney disease, porphyria, some medications, trauma, previous surgery, chemical irritation.",
        "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis involves a medical and neurological examination and an MRI scan to rule out multiple sclerosis. Whenever necessary, other tests are requested to help identify the location and cause of the problem.",
        "Treatment": "Once the cause has been identified, treatment involves addressing the triggering factor. In other cases, it is essential to achieve adequate pain control. Treatment may involve surgery to relieve nerve compression, blood sugar control in diabetes, physiotherapy or nerve blockage using an injection that \u201cturns off\u201d pain signals and reduces inflammation. Analgesics, anticonvulsants, antispasmodics or antidepressants may also be prescribed, depending on the doctor\u2019s assessment.",
        "Prevention": "Treating the diseases that can cause it can prevent its development. In the case of Herpes virus infection, antiviral therapy can prevent nerve damage and subsequent neuralgia.

    "Nystagmus": {
        "What is it?": "Nystagmus is a disorder of eye movements resulting in a succession of rhythmic, involuntary and combined movements of the eyeballs, consisting of alternating slow and fast phases. It is conventionally defined by the direction of the fast phase and its direction: horizontal, vertical, rotary, multidirectional (mixed).",
        "Symptoms": "Nystagmus is a condition characterized by rapid, uncontrollable eye movements. The movements may alternate between fast and slow. It usually occurs in both eyes and may occur in just one eye. Eye movements may worsen with certain eye directions. It may be associated with balance disorders. In children, objects may appear blurry. In adults, there is a constant sensation of objects moving when they look around. Nystagmus can also affect vision. It may be difficult to see in the dark or there may be sensitivity to light. Problems with balance and dizziness are also associated, which worsen when the patient is tired or stressed.",
        "Causes": "Nystagmus can be a sign of another eye problem or medical condition. It can be present at birth or develop over the course of a lifetime. Some of the known causes are: Genetics;/ Other eye problems, such as cataracts, strabismus, and difficulty focusing;/ Stroke, multiple sclerosis or M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease;/ Albinism (lack of pigment in the skin);/ Inner ear problems;/ Certain medications, such as lithium or anticonvulsants;/ Alcohol or drugs;/",
        "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis is made by observing eye movements and by additional diagnostic tests that include: Detailed eye examination to characterize eye movements;/ Ear examination;/ Neurological examination;/ Brain MRI;/ CT scan of the brain;/",
        "Treatment": "Treatment for nystagmus varies depending on the underlying cause. If an individual developed the condition as an adult, small steps can be taken to lessen its effects. Sometimes, it is necessary to stop taking medication or avoid alcohol and drugs. Wearing contact lenses or glasses with the appropriate prescription can improve vision and prevent other eye problems, although it does not cure nystagmus. Surgery may be an option, as may anticonvulsant drugs, anticoagulants, muscle relaxants and Botox. For people who are very nearsighted, laser surgery can help improve vision.

    "Solitary nodule of the lung": {
        "What is it?": "A solitary lung nodule is a solid, rounded lesion with more or less well-defined contours, less than three centimeters in diameter and surrounded by normal lung. On the x-ray, it appears as a small, lighter spot in the surrounding lung field.",
        "Causes": "Lung nodules can originate from different pathologies or diseases: Infections (bacterial, fungal);/ Scar lesions from old infections (sequelae lesions);/ Benign tumors or malignant tumors, in an early stage;/",
        "Diagnosis": "Its importance and severity must be assessed with determination and persistence by your doctor. Sometimes very small nodules can go unnoticed on conventional x-rays, which makes it necessary to order a Computed Axial Tomography (CAT), which is much more sensitive for detecting lung nodules. The differential diagnosis of pulmonary nodules is a complex process that requires more sophisticated tests and procedures, which can sometimes take a long time. In most cases, there is no need to waste time in determining the origin of the nodule. A simple assessment such as age, sex, background and especially habits is very important. Active smokers or people exposed to smoke (passive smokers) have a higher risk of cancer and should be investigated in detail. A biopsy is the most important procedure in the investigation of a solitary lung nodule. There are several different procedures for obtaining a biopsy, which will be chosen based on the characteristics and location of the nodule. The aim of a biopsy is to determine the definitive diagnosis of a lung nodule, in order to decide on the most appropriate treatment. The greater the possibility of the nodule being malignant, the more important and urgent the biopsy becomes. In patients where this possibility is high (smokers and those with nodules with malignant or undetermined characteristics), we should proceed with a biopsy without delay. In those where the possibility of cancer is remote (young, non-smokers and not exposed to smoke or other carcinogens, with nodules that appear benign), close clinical monitoring is acceptable. In the rare cases where the characteristics of the nodule are clearly benign, there may be no need for further investigation, but monitoring should not be dispensed with.

    "Vocal cord nodules": {
        "What is it?": "Vocal cord nodules are benign fibrous formations (calluses) that result from poor placement and excessive use of the voice during exertion. That is, they are small benign lesions that grow because the vocal cords rub against each other with too much force while vibrating. They usually develop on the free edge of the vocal cords in the transition from the anterior third to the posterior two thirds, and are usually bilateral. Women between 20 and 50 years old and children are more prone to these nodules - especially those who talk a lot and loudly - but men can also be affected.",
        "Symptoms": "Vocal cord injuries generally manifest as hoarseness, changes in vocal timbre, frequent interruptions in sounds, vocal fatigue and a reduction in the range of sounds. It is sometimes associated with dry cough, phlegm and tiredness.",
        "Causes": "The main cause of vocal cord nodules is inadequate vocal effort which can also cause polyps which are different entities. Voice misuse is often associated with certain activities such as strained singing, sports cheerleading, teachers and coaches, and other professionals who use their voices professionally. Tobacco and the abuse of alcohol and hot drinks also favor the appearance of nodules.",
        "Diagnosis": "Clinical history is decisive in characterizing hoarseness complaints: when and under what circumstances it began, whether it is permanent or associated with vocal efforts, how the voice is used and whether there are accompanying symptoms. The otolaryngologist evaluates the patient's vocal cords using a videolaryngoscope, which is a fiberoptic device with a camera built into the tip and allows direct visualization of the entire larynx, the movements of the vocal cords, and the detection of lesions. Additional tests and treatments are determined based on this initial examination.",

    "Obesity": {
        "What is it?": "In Portugal, almost 50% of the population is overweight and almost one million adults suffer from obesity. This disease, considered an epidemic by the World Health Organization, negatively affects our longevity and quality of life. It is important to control obesity, as it is itself a risk factor for the development and/or worsening of other pathologies, such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiovascular diseases, some types of cancer, among others. Obesity is defined by an excess of adipose tissue (fat) in relation to lean mass (muscle, bones and organs), in a proportion that can affect health. From the point of view of fat distribution, obesity is divided into two types: Gynoid: is characterized by a pear-shaped body, with greater accumulation of fat below the waist. It is more common in women, has a lower impact on cardiovascular risk than male obesity, and is more associated with the appearance of varicose veins and joint diseases.;/ Android: with fat located in the waist and upper region of the body, it is associated with an apple-shaped body. More common in men, it can favor the onset of diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases.;/",
        "Causes": "This chronic disease - which therefore requires continuous care to keep under control - occurs when the number of calories ingested is greater than those expended. When this happens, the energy balance is said to be positive and, as a result, the body stores the extra calories in the form of fat mass. This is associated, for example, with the adoption of sedentary lifestyle habits and a diet rich in refined grains, sugars and saturated fats. Obesity has multifactorial causes (environmental, metabolic, genetic) and can have cultural, psychological and behavioral influences.",
        "Diagnosis": "Calculating the Body Mass Index (BMI) is the most widely used technique to assess the degree of obesity in adults. This index is obtained by dividing the weight (in kilograms) by the height (in meters) squared: overweight BMI= 25;/ pre-obesity BMI= 25 \u2013 29.9;/ obesity BMI = 30 class 1 = 30 \u2013 34.9 class 2 = 35 \u2013 39.9 class 3 = 40;/ class 1 = 30 \u2013 34.9;/ class 2 = 35 \u2013 39.9;/ class 3 = 40;/ Waist circumference: an important measurement that can be used to assess nutritional status and the risk of cardiovascular events. Waist circumference measurements associated with significant risk: women: equal to or greater than 88 cm;/ men: equal to or greater than 102 cm;/",
        "Treatment": "Obesity treatment always includes dietary re-education, lifestyle changes and control of complications, such as diabetes and hypertension. In more serious cases, it may be necessary to use surgical procedures such as bariatric surgery (sleeve, bypass, minibypass, duodenal switch or SADI-s) or the placement of a gastric balloon. The treatment of obesity must have a multidisciplinary approach: FGM doctor, endocrinologist, nutritionist, psychiatrist and eating behavior psychologist and general surgeon.",
        "Prevention": "One of the most important rules for avoiding overweight and obesity is to maintain calorie expenditure (the calories we spend on a daily basis) equal to or greater than the amount of calories ingested, adapting calorie intake to daily expenditure. Some recommendations must be followed for weight control: Follow the recommendations of the Food Wheel, adopting a balanced and varied diet, rich in vegetables, whole grains, fruit and fish and low in sugar and saturated fats - present, for example, in industrially processed fats (hydrogenated), red meat, butter, and full-fat dairy products.;/ Know your food: know what type of nutrients you are providing your body with and what your calorie profile is.;/ Eat every 3 to 4 hours: divide your meals throughout the day, in an amount that allows you to feel full, avoiding hunger at the next meal. A good trick is to start your main meals with vegetable soup without potatoes.;/ Stay active: do a physical activity that you enjoy regularly (if possible, daily).

        "What is it?": "Obesity is a chronic and complex disease, with increasing prevalence throughout the world and considered by the World Health Organization to be the global epidemic of the 21st century. The Cosi study, carried out in Portugal in 2008/2009, involving children in the 1st cycle of basic education, detected overweight in 32%, with 14% being obese. In 2012, the EPACI study, with children in the first three years of life, found around 32% of children overweight and 6.4% obese, already at 12 months of life. This high prevalence in Portugal and at such early ages has been the subject of attention from health, education and society professionals in general.",
        "Symptoms": "Unfortunately, the complications of obesity appear at a very early age, the most common being dyslipidemia (increased cholesterol and/or triglycerides), high blood pressure, glucose intolerance with subsequent progression to type 2 diabetes (previously this pathology was rare in pediatric age), sleep problems, orthopedic problems and very worrying psychosocial problems (these children are often victims of bullying). Many of these complications are important cardiovascular risk factors, with a negative impact on health and risk of premature death.",
        "Causes": "It is known that obesity results from the excessive accumulation of fat due to successive positive energy balances, i.e. the amount of calories ingested is greater than the amount expended. This is due not only to genetic, metabolic and behavioural factors, but also to environmental (social and cultural) factors.",
        "Diagnosis": "To know if a child/adolescent is obese, it is necessary to assess their weight and height to determine the Body Mass Index (BMI). With the BMI we can check whether there is excess weight or obesity, using tables appropriate for age and sex.",
        "Treatment": "When obesity sets in, resolving this situation has to involve dietary re-education and the practice of more physical exercise. Pharmacological or surgical therapy should only be considered in very specific cases. Overweight/obese children must first be identified and evaluated by a pediatrician or attending physician. However, if obesity persists, they should be referred to a Childhood Obesity Consultation or a Pediatric Endocrinology Consultation, where objectives (dietary, physical exercise) appropriate to each child are established, with the support of a multidisciplinary team (nutritionist, psychologist) .

Morbid obesity is considered when there is an extreme amount of body fat and a body mass index (BMI) greater than 40. BMI (dividing the weight in kilograms by the square of the height in meters) is a very useful indicator in assessing weight versus height: BMI values: Normal: 19,0 \u2013 24,9;/ Overweight: 25.0 \u2013 29.9;/ Obesity stage 1: 30.0 \u2013 34.9;/ Obesity stage 2: 35.0 \u2013 39.9;/ Morbid obesity, stage 3: 40.0 or higher;/",
        "Symptoms": "A patient with morbid obesity has extreme body fat, difficulty walking, difficulty breathing and a BMI greater than 40 kilos per square meter.",
        "Causes": "Being overweight means that calorie intake is much greater than the amount of calories burned, so the surplus is stored as fat. Anyone can become obese but there are certain conditions that facilitate obesity: personal habits: lifestyle, choice of food type, level of physical activity;/ genetic factors: some families have a greater tendency;/ mental factors: stress, anxiety, depression;/ Sleep habits: lack of sleep can contribute to weight gain;/ female sex: related to hormonal factors such as menopause and pregnancy;/ some diseases and medications: corticosteroids, Cushing's disease, etc.;/ aging: decreased metabolism and more sedentary lifestyle;/",
        "Diagnosis": "Objective assessment of the patient, eating habits, exercise practiced and assessment of BMI and abdominal perimeter.",
        "Treatment": "There are several treatment options for a person with morbid obesity that include: Diet and exercise;/ Medication;/ Surgery;/ For surgery to be performed, the patient must be in the following conditions: Having made several attempts to lose weight, duly guided by a doctor, without success;/ Absence of severe pathologies that condition the surgical procedure;/ Have a BMI greater than 40 kg/m2;/ Have a BMI between 35 and 40 kg/m2, if you already have associated illnesses related to your obesity;/ Some psychiatric pathologies may be a contraindication for surgery if they are not properly controlled and when the psychiatrist treating the patient does not agree. When indicated, it is a means by which obese individuals can lose weight and maintain the weight they have lost. There are several surgical techniques that are divided into restrictive, which limit calorie intake; malabsorptive, in which the absorption of ingested food is reduced; and mixed techniques that reduce intake and also reduce absorption. Before undergoing surgery, the patient must undergo tests, not only to try to find out if there is any reason for their obesity but also to check their health status and whether it is necessary to take measures to ensure that the surgery goes smoothly.

The patient does not always need to follow a pre-operative diet, but in those who have central obesity, in which the liver is enlarged, making the surgery more complex and even impossible to perform, it is mandatory to follow a low-calorie diet for at least a period of three weeks before the surgery, in which they must lose between 10 and 20 kilos. Normally, these interventions are performed laparoscopically, however, it should be borne in mind that when reintervention surgeries are performed, the probability of using the classic method increases greatly, because there are already adhesions that increase surgical difficulty. Enlarged livers, complications such as bleeding, perforation or others that could put the patient's life at risk cannot be performed by laparoscopy.",

    "Constipation": {
        "What is it?": "Constipation is a difficulty in regulating the progression of stool or the total inability to have a bowel movement. In the presence of this condition, the stool becomes harder and drier. Its degree varies from person to person, and may last for a short time or be chronic, causing pain, discomfort and affecting quality of life. Normally, constipation is considered if there is persistent difficulty in evacuating, if the evacuation requires great effort, if it is necessary to resort to digital maneuvers to help the stool pass out, or if there are two or fewer bowel movements per week (or if there has been a recent reduction in the usual number of evacuations). Constipation is a common problem that affects people of all ages, and is a symptom rather than a disease. Almost everyone experiences periods of constipation, with an unbalanced diet being the main cause. Most cases are temporary and not serious. It can affect babies, children and adults, with women being more affected than men. It is also more common in older people than in younger people, probably due to their diet, lack of exercise, use of medication and poor bowel habits. Around 40% of pregnant women report constipation during pregnancy.",
        "Symptoms": "In general, the stools are hard and fragmented, there is a persistent feeling of malaise and discomfort in the abdomen and there is often a need to resort to medications or enemas to help evacuation. Constipation, when not properly treated, can cause hemorrhoids, fecal incontinence or fecal impaction, which results in the accumulation of dry, hard feces in the rectum.",
        "Causes": "It is not always easy to identify its cause. The risk is greater when you eat little fiber (fruits, vegetables, cereals), change your routine, ignore or delay the stimulus for defecation, drink little fluid, if you have anxiety or depression or if you take some types of medication. Stools are made up of the unassimilated part of food, mainly composed of fiber that has the ability to absorb water from the intestine. The time they remain there determines their water content and, whenever there is a longer delay in intestinal functioning, they become harder, causing constipation. Its appearance may also be due to pathologies that affect the intestine, such as some neurological diseases (multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injuries) and metabolic diseases (diabetes, hypothyroidism, kidney failure). Constipation can also be caused by diseases of the intestine or anus, such as inflammation, narrowing areas, tightness in the intestine, tumors, anal fissure, among others.",
        "Diagnosis": "A detailed assessment of the complaints and a complete medical examination can provide important data to clarify the situation. An anorectal examination (proctological examination) is quick, painless and very informative. Blood tests, a barium enema or a colonoscopy may be necessary.",
        "Treatment": "It is very important to discipline your eating habits, eating foods with fiber and drinking plenty of fluids. These measures take some time to take effect. However, you should: Eat foods rich in fiber, such as: cereals (bran, flakes, whole-grain bread and crackers); fruit (plums, peaches, pulpy fruits, tropical fruits); vegetables (cabbage, beans, chickpeas, peas, broad beans);;/ Do regular physical activity (walking, gymnastics, swimming);;/ Review current medications to see if they are causing constipation.;/ Use laxatives, always with a medical prescription, in more prolonged situations;;/ More rarely, surgical intervention may be indicated.;/",

    "Lacrimal duct obstruction": {
        "What is it?": "After being produced, tears are drained from the inner portion of the eyelids into the nasal cavity. Sometimes this pathway can become obstructed, leading to persistent complaints of tearing (in these cases called epiphora). Excess tears may, however, be caused not by poor drainage but rather by an increase in tear production, associated, for example, with ocular surface pathology. Therefore, if you complain of excessive tearing or a sensation of \u201cwet eyes\u201d, it is important to have a detailed examination by an Ophthalmologist to identify the cause.",
        "Types of obstruction": "There are 2 types of tear duct obstruction Acquired \u2013 this is the most common form, it develops in adulthood and can have multiple causes (infections, inflammation, chronic use of eye drops, chemotherapy, degenerative tissue changes, etc.) Congenital \u2013 Affects children after birth and is secondary to incomplete development of the lacrimal system, usually due to the persistence of a membrane in the transition to the nasal cavity.",
        "Symptoms": "Variables. The most common symptom is persistent or intermittent tearing that can worsen in certain conditions (wind, air conditioning...), sensation of \u201cwet eyes\u201d, blurred vision, eye irritation. In some cases there is a history of several episodes of red eye and discharge, diagnosed as conjunctivitis, which medical treatment (drops) only temporarily relieves. In the case of chronic or recurrent conjunctivitis, it is therefore important to exclude an obstruction of the lacrimal pathway. One of the complications of permanent obstruction of the lower lacrimal duct is the development of a secondary infection of the lacrimal sac or dacryocystitis. It is identified by the appearance of a painful inflammatory swelling in the inner region of the lower eyelid and requires systemic antibiotic treatment.",
        "Treatment": "Congenital obstruction of the lacrimal duct resolves spontaneously in most cases during the first year of life. Massages in the region of the lacrimal sac are useful during this period. When this does not occur, a probing of the lacrimal duct (minimally invasive opening of the lacrimal duct) may be indicated, with other procedures being assessed on a case-by-case basis. In adults, after ruling out other causes of excessive tearing, treatment depends on the location/cause of the obstruction of the tear duct and may include: Punctoplasty: opening of the lacrimal points on the inner portion of the eyelids; Dacryocystorhinostomy: procedure that aims to restore the tear drainage circuit to the nasal cavity when there is a distal/low obstruction, located in the final portion of the lacrimal drainage system; Conjunctive-dacryocystorhinostomy: classically known as the placement of a \u201cJones Tube\u201d, it consists of placing a device between the inner corner of the eyelids and the nasal cavity, and is used in situations of proximal/high obstruction, located in the initial portion of the lacrimal drainage system.   Myopia, astigmatism and hyperopia often lead to the use of glasses or contact lenses. LASIK surgery can restore good vision. Do you wear contact lenses?

    "Retinal vein occlusion": {
        "What is it?": "Retinal vein occlusion consists of a total or partial obstruction of the retinal veins and is the second most common cause of retinal vascular disease. Obstruction of the retinal venous system leads to engorgement and dilation of the retinal veins, hemorrhages, optic disc swelling, edema and retinal ischemia. Retinal occlusions can be divided into central retinal vein occlusion\u00a0and branch venous occlusion. Branch venous occlusion is more frequent (around 80% of cases) and has a better prognosis.",
        "Symptoms": "Symptoms depend on the affected location and the severity of the occlusion. Typically, as initial symptoms, patients report a unilateral, sudden and painless decrease in visual acuity accompanied by changes in the visual field.",
        "Causes": "The etiology of venous occlusion is multifactorial. Initially, a thrombus forms at the level of the central retinal vein or in one of its branches and then endothelial proliferation and an inflammatory reaction. Known risk factors are high blood pressure, advanced age, dyslipidemia, coagulation disorders, glaucoma, among others. It usually occurs in patients over 50 years of age with high blood pressure. When present in young patients without known risk factors, other causes should be investigated.",
        "Treatment": "The choice of treatment should be made taking into account visual acuity and the severity of the clinical condition. Currently, we have several treatments available, namely intravitreal injections of antiangiogenic drugs, laser photocoagulation and corticosteroids. Considering the diversity of treatments available, each patient must be considered individually and the therapeutic orientation must be tailored to each clinical situation. It is important to highlight the importance of investigating systemic risk factors, according to the patient's age group and their control, thus preventing reocclusion and involvement of the contralateral eye.

    "Dry eye": {
        "What is it?": "Dry eye or dry eye syndrome is a very common condition in which tears lose the ability to adequately lubricate the surface of the eye. It can happen when not enough tears are produced, when the tears produced are of poor quality, or both. Dry eye, in addition to reducing patients' quality of life, increases the risk of infections and injuries to the surface of the eye.",

        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis is based on clinical observation of the ocular surface in conjunction with the patient's clinical history. Additional tests may be performed to directly or indirectly assess the quantity and quality of the tears.",
        "Treatment": "When it is possible to identify a condition that is causing dry eye, treatment consists first of all of the treatment to resolve that specific problem. For example, if the patient is taking a medication that has the side effect of reducing tear production, it may be necessary to consider replacing the medication. Dry eye treatment can be medical and/or surgical and aims to increase the available tears and/or their quality depending on what is causing the dry eye in each case. Most cases, however, are controlled only with the frequent application of artificial tears and modification of some lifestyle habits.",

    "Red eye": {
        "What is it?": "We use the term \u201cred eye\u201d when the conjunctiva, the membrane that covers the surface of the eye, takes on a red or pinkish hue. The majority of red eye conditions correspond to benign situations, however a persistent red eye should be observed by a doctor as soon as possible, especially if accompanied by other symptoms/signs, and referred to an Ophthalmologist specialist whenever necessary.",
        "Symptoms": "Red eye may be accompanied by other symptoms, which, although they may vary according to the cause, are not always sufficient for a differential diagnosis. Some of these symptoms - such as pain or reduced vision - are more concerning and warrant close clinical observation. Other possible associated manifestations are the sensation of \u201csand\u201d, secretions or a glued \u201ceye\u201d, burning, itching, or an abnormal sensitivity to light.",
        "Causes": "The classic symptom of a non-painful red eye is subconjunctival hemorrhage. It is often spontaneous, with no other symptoms and no previous history of trauma, and may be noticed by others or by the person looking in the mirror. Possible triggers include physical exertion, vomiting, and a sudden rise in blood pressure. When recurrent, it may justify investigation of an unknown systemic vascular cause (high blood pressure, diabetes, coagulation disorders). Among the causes of red eyes, the following stand out: Infection (viral, bacterial) \u2013 develops relatively quickly, over a few days, and is accompanied by watery exudate (more indicative of a viral infection) or purulent exudate (bacterial infection). In most cases, it starts unilaterally but can become bilateral after a few days.;/ Allergy \u2013 usually bilateral, evolves over a few hours/days, itching (pruritus) and swelling of the eyelids are common.;/ Intraocular inflammation (uveitis) \u2013 most often unilateral, accompanied by severe pain, sensitivity to light, reduced vision (learn more) add link;/ Inflammation of the eyelids (blepharitis) \u2013 prolonged evolution (weeks/months), associated with a sensation of stinging, burning, tearing.(learn more) add link;/ Dry eye syndrome \u2013 a sensation of \u201csandy eyes\u201d, burning, tearing is common, progresses over months/years (learn more) add link;/ Keratitis \u2013 inflammation in the most anterior region of the eye, generally associated with intense pain, sensitivity to light, reduced vision, an important cause of red eye in contact lens wearers;/ Trauma/foreign body \u2013 sudden onset (seconds) of red eye and pain due to injury caused by direct trauma, contact with chemical or entry of foreign body.;/",
        "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis requires a detailed clinical history: type and progression of symptoms (sudden/indolent, unilateral/bilateral), history of trauma, previous ophthalmological surgeries, complaints of red eye in close people, use of contact lenses; associated with a thorough physical examination. The development of persistent red eye and/or accompanied by warning signs such as pain, reduced vision, sensitivity to light, should be evaluated promptly.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment depends on the cause. Most cases of red eye are treated with eye drops and resolve after a few days.

    "Thyroid orbitopathy": {
        "What is it?": "Thyroid Orbitopathy, or Graves' Orbitopathy, manifests itself in the context of an autoimmune disease that develops against the thyroid gland (generally associated with a state of hyperthyroidism), but also against the tissues around the eye, especially muscles and fat. In most cases, manifestations are mild and improve spontaneously over several months. In some patients, however, manifestations can be serious, with a risk of irreversible vision loss. Smoking is directly related to the severity of the disease, and smoking cessation is essential. The disease progresses in two phases, and after an initial inflammatory period (which can last between a few months and 2 years), the disease enters a stable phase, where sequelae such as exophthalmos (protruding eyes), eyelid retraction (which gives an expression of astonishment), strabismus (deviation of the eyeball from its normal position) or fat pads in the upper and/or lower eyelids may remain. After thyroid function has stabilized and the inflammation has resolved, these changes can be corrected surgically.",
        "Symptoms": "They depend on the phase of the disease: active inflammatory or late inactive. Complaints are variable and usually bilateral, but may be asymmetrical. The initial active phase is the most symptomatic; the patient notices that the eyes are red and the eyelids are swollen, especially upon waking. One or both eyes may become more prominent or \u201cprotruding\u201d (exophthalmos), and one of the most characteristic signs may develop, retraction of the eyelids, which gives an air of \u201csurprise\u201d. Other possible symptoms are double vision or a sensation of pain or pressure that worsens with eye movements. It is common to feel eye irritation, sensitivity to light and, in the most severe cases, decreased vision. These cases should be monitored by an Ophthalmologist with experience in the area, together with an Endocrinologist.",
        "Treatment": "The treatment of Thyroid Orbitopathy depends on the phase (active/inactive) and severity. Smoking cessation is a fundamental aspect, and these cases are always observed in a multidisciplinary way in conjunction with Endocrinology, which monitors the normalization of thyroid function. Active orbital disease can be monitored in most (mild) cases, but more severe forms of the disease may require systemic anti-inflammatory therapy. Surgery may be indicated during the inflammatory phase if there is a risk of visual impairment, or later in the inactive phase to correct exophthalmos (protruding eyes), strabismus or eyelid retraction. These symptoms (protruding eyes, retracted eyelids, strabismus) can undoubtedly become emotionally distressing, and lead to self-esteem problems and social isolation. Several procedures are available to reverse these changes \u2013 orbital decompression (which aims to widen the space around the eyeball), eyelid surgery to correct the retraction, strabismus surgery. These are delicate surgeries, and should be performed by an ophthalmologist with experience in the field.  Myopia, astigmatism and hyperopia often lead to the use of glasses or contact lenses.

    "Ortopantomografia": {
        "What is it?": "Orthopantomography is a type of panoramic radiography, in which low-level radiation is used, which allows the visualization of various structures of the face and oral cavity - such as teeth, both those present in the mouth and those that are included, jaws and joints. temporomandibular joint (the one that connects the jaw to the skull) - in just one image. This is a quick, comfortable and painless diagnostic method, being one of the most used complementary diagnostic tests in the practice of dentistry.",
        "What is orthopantomography for?": "Orthopantomograms are x-rays used in diagnosis and planning dental treatments. Some concrete examples of its use include: Have an overview of the person's dental health - number of teeth, position of teeth, bone level, among others;/ Diagnosis of periodontal disease;/ Diagnosis and evaluation of the evolution of orthodontic treatments;/ Detection and evaluation of wisdom teeth growth and development;/ Monitoring the development and growth of teeth in children;/ Diagnosis of sialolithiasis (presence of stones in the salivary glands);/ Identifying the location of foreign bodies;/ Detection of lesions such as root cysts and other lesions affecting the bone structures of the jaws;/ Planning of dental extractions and implant placement surgeries;/ Use in Forensic Medicine as a method of age estimation;/  It is important to indicate that there are more specific cases, in which a more detailed image of the tooth is desired, in which oral health professionals resort to intraoral x-rays.",
        "Preparation": "Preparation is similar to any other X-ray examination. Before the examination, the patient must remove all metal objects, such as jewelry (earrings, necklaces, piercings and hair accessories) and glasses.",
        "How is orthopantomography performed?": "Orthopantomography is a short examination, taking only a few seconds. The patient must remain standing, biting on a support and with the head stabilized, to avoid movements during the examination. Movements can interfere with the quality of the image obtained, and the examination may need to be repeated. The device has two pieces at opposite ends - one that emits X-rays and the other that captures the images - that rotate around the person, starting at one side of the jaw, then passing across the front of the face and ending at the jaw on the opposite side.",
        "Potential risks": "Like any other imaging test, orthopantomography uses ionizing radiation to detect and transform the structures of the mouth into images. However, the level of radiation to which the patient is exposed is low, so this is considered a safe test. In the case of pregnant women, for example, it is always recommended that they consider performing this type of examination, but it is not an absolute contraindication.

    "Osteoarthritis": {
        "What is it?": "Osteoarthritis is one of many rheumatic diseases and is by far the most common. It is a degenerative pathology that involves the entire joint. The word osteoarthrosis means degeneration of the joint. Osteoarthritis, commonly called osteoarthritis, is a disease that fundamentally affects articular cartilage, which is an elastic connective tissue found at the ends of bones that articulate with each other. Articular cartilage is nourished by joint fluid or synovial fluid, so called because it is produced by the synovium, a membrane rich in vessels that lines the interior of the joints. This liquid helps to lubricate the joint, facilitating its movements, and allowing the cartilages in healthy joints to slide over each other without friction, that is, without wear. In osteoarthritis, cells (chondrocytes) die and produce fewer proteoglycans and collagen. As a result of this, the articular cartilage ulcerates and the bone underneath the cartilage reacts, thickening and giving rise to bone excrescences called osteophytes. These are known as \u201cparrot beaks\u201d, because some of them, on x-rays, give images that resemble the beak of this animal. In this degenerative process, joint inflammation phenomena often occur, which causes pain and increased joint volume. Hence the term \u201carthritis\u201d is also used for these clinical conditions. Osteoarthritis is not synonymous with joint aging (there are elderly people without osteoarthritis and young adults with this disease), although it is more common in older individuals who, naturally, have had more years to wear out their joints. Osteoarthritis is the most common pathology and will continue to increase, given its association with aging. In Portugal there are around half a million patients with osteoarthritis and pain, although, in fact, this number is close to one million, as many have osteoarthritis and have no complaints. In fact, over the age of 60, 90% of people have osteoarthritis. The disease is rare before the age of 40 but, from then on, it becomes increasingly common. The association with age is very evident, largely because the risks that cause the problem accumulate and because older joints have more difficulty adapting and regenerating compared to younger ones. Osteoarthritis is a very important cause of disability in the elderly and one of the most common causes of permanent disability and early retirement. The disease affects both genders equally, although after the age of 50 there is a slight predominance in women. It is a pathology that appears in all climates and in all races. The environment is not a cause of osteoarthritis, although cold and humidity worsen these patients' complaints, and warm weather relieves pain. There are joints in which osteoarthritis is more common: the knees, hands, hips, spine and feet. In the hands, the joints of the fingers and, in the wrist, at the base of the thumb are the most common. In the spine is the cervical and lumbar region. On the feet it is the base of the first toe, which when deformed is often called a \u201cbunion\u201d. In Portugal, the joints most frequently involved are the spine, in particular the cervical and lumbar segments, the knees, the joints of the hands and the base of the big toe. On the contrary, those on the wrists and ankles are rarely affected by osteoarthritis.",
        "Symptoms": "There is no correlation between the degree of joint damage and the intensity of pain. Many patients have advanced osteoarthritis and little pain, while others complain a lot even though their osteoarthritis is not very advanced. The main symptoms are pain, stiffness, limitation of movement and, in more advanced stages, deformities. The pain has a rhythm characterized by the fact that it worsens throughout the day, with movement and effort, and improves when the patient rests, especially when lying down. As a rule, patients with osteoarthritis do not have pain at night and sleep well, although in very advanced cases of osteoarthritis of the hips and knees, pain may also appear during the night. Complaints relating to osteoarthritis generally evolve very slowly and sometimes in spurts. This means that patients can go for months or years without symptoms. The most common signs are joint pain during use of the joint, particularly when there is overload. Short-term pain or stiffness may also occur when starting to move after a period of inactivity. The limitation of mobility progressively worsens as the disease progresses. Periods of swelling of the joint may occur due to inflammation. This situation takes the form of nodules on the fingers of the hands and fluid can accumulate on the knees, which coincides with a worsening of the complaints. During the course of the disease, the joint increases in size, which is common to notice in the knees or fingers. Pain is not always located at the level of the diseased joint. In hip osteoarthritis (coxarthrosis), the pain, which is almost always located at the level of the groin and radiates down the anterior surface of the thigh to the knee, can appear exclusively at the level of this last joint. In other words, the patient has pain in the knee and the osteoarthritis is located in the hip. This pain is called referred pain. The pain is often radiated, as happens, for example, with pain in the lumbar spine and cervical spine. In fact, in low back pain the pain can spread to the lower limbs and in neck pain it can be felt in the head, chest and upper limbs. Stiffness appears, above all, when starting movements, for example, in patients who are sitting and getting up, and also in the morning when waking up. The stiffness of osteoarthritis is short-lived, lasting no more than 30 minutes. Limitation of movement can appear early, unlike what happens with deformations, which, as a rule, occur late. Limited movement can cause great disability in these patients. For example, patients with osteoarthritis in the upper limbs, particularly in the shoulders, may have great difficulty getting dressed and eating. On the other hand, osteoarthritis in the lower limbs can make walking difficult and make certain tasks such as putting on shoes difficult or even impossible. Joint deformities sometimes take the form of nodules of bone consistency, as occurs in the hands, more specifically in the joints of the fingers. Unlike inflammatory rheumatic diseases, arthrosis is a condition that affects only the joints, does not affect the internal organs and is not accompanied by other symptoms such as fever, lack of appetite, fatigue and weight loss. During the process, the cartilage becomes worn down, becoming thinner and gradually more destroyed. As it is essential for the movement of the joint, the pain becomes more intense and movements become increasingly compromised. The pain prevents mobility, resulting in muscle atrophy. The joint becomes unstable, unable to perform its function, without cartilage, and with the bone developed around its periphery. Patients become increasingly limited, to the point where they are unable to move the joint without great effort and with severe pain.",
        "Causes": "All those who expose their locomotor system to overloads or excessive work \u2013 such as athletes and obese people, and those who have malformations of the joints or limbs, such as deformities of the knees, hips or feet \u2013 will tend to develop the problem more early. Some professions can cause osteoarthritis more frequently in certain joints. For example, footballers have more osteoarthritis in their knees (gonarthrosis), ballet dancers in their ankles, construction workers (who use pneumatic hammers) in their elbows, and dockworkers in their spine (spondyloarthritis). Osteoarthritis can be primary and secondary. The primary ones do not have a known cause, unlike the secondary ones which may be due to trauma, in particular repeated microtrauma, the incongruity of the articular surfaces, old fractures, infectious, inflammatory and metabolic diseases that have previously affected the cartilage. Primary osteoarthritis is more common in women, affects small joints more often and is more common in certain families than others. Secondary osteoarthritis tends to involve large joints. The causes of osteoarthritis are multiple. In general, overloading a normal joint or normal use of a diseased joint are the causes of osteoarthritis. Thus, it is common to encounter traumas in the past (large or small, these are usually very repeated), such as those resulting from sporting or professional activities, excess weight, as well as other rheumatic diseases or malformations that have previously deteriorated the joints. However, there are many cases in which no cause is apparent or in which only heredity is identified.",
        "Diagnosis": "Contrary to what occurs in inflammatory rheumatic diseases, osteoarthritis does not lead to changes in blood and urine tests. Radiographs in these patients are very typical, showing a reduction in the joint space, that is, the space between the two articulating bones, sclerosis of the subchondral bone, that is, reinforcement of the bone located underneath the articular cartilage, and osteophytes also called \u201cparrot beaks\u201d.",
        "Treatment": "Osteoarthritis has no cure, and the patient should know this, but its treatment can allow the maintenance of a completely normal life in most cases. The objectives of therapy are to alleviate and, if possible, suppress pain, improve functional capacity, that is, increase the mobility of affected joints, prevent atrophy of the muscles related to said joints and, finally, prevent the worsening of existing injuries. . Osteoarthritis cannot be treated with medication and physiotherapy alone. The patient's commitment is essential and without it the treatment plan will not be successful. The basic treatment measures include patient education, relative rest and an exercise plan. Education should include teaching the general rules for protecting the locomotor system and correcting posture. In fact, incorrect postures trigger and/or aggravate pain and lead to excessive support on areas of the articular cartilage, which will therefore wear out more in these areas. Here are some examples of general principles that may be useful in controlling or preventing osteoarthritis: sleeping on a hard bed, preferably on your back; do not sleep with a pillow; do not remain in the same position for a long time, especially in standing or sitting positions, in order to reduce the burden on the spine, in particular the lumbar spine, hips and knees; do not use sofas or armchairs that deform the spine, preferably a hard chair, with the back well supported and the feet firmly placed on the floor; keep your neck extended and never flexed; avoid picking up heavy objects, to avoid overloading the spinal joints; avoid flexing the vertebrae, and whenever it is necessary to pick up an object from the floor, it is important to bend your knees; wear simple, practical clothes and shoes with sturdy heel counters and low heels. In some cases, the doctor may need to temporarily prescribe devices that limit joint mobility, such as a cervical collar or an orthopedic belt. Patients with osteoarthritis, who are almost always elderly, often suffer from other health problems (obesity, diabetes, hypertension, etc.) and these conditions must be well controlled. In addition to pain, it is important to monitor inflammation. In more advanced forms of the condition, joint prostheses may be fitted. Symptomatic treatment is based on general joint protection measures, such as rest, rules for lifting and carrying loads and the use of physical agents (ice, heat through hot water or infrared and drugs).\u00a0 Medications for these cases are analgesics such as paracetamol and, in more serious situations, in combination with weak opioids. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories are also used which, although they must be administered with precautions, can be very useful in controlling signs of inflammation. In addition to oral forms, topical forms can also be effective, especially if applied repeatedly and to superficial problems where penetration of the medicine can be ensured. Sometimes, intra-articular injections of hyalorunans (derivatives of hyaluronic acid present in cartilage and synovial fluid) can be used, which can provide relief to the patient for several months, and injections with corticosteroids into peri-articular structures (tendons, ligaments, synovial bags) which often become inflamed causing severe symptoms. In addition to symptomatic treatment, it is of utmost importance to try to prevent the progression of the disease. There are drugs taken orally that, in addition to alleviating the symptoms of the problem, have a proven effect on delaying the progression of knee osteoarthritis, such as glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate. Muscle relaxants are used when muscle contracture is the cause of pain or contributes to its worsening, as happens, for example, in acute attacks of lumbago, sciatica, or torticollis. Orthopedic surgery, by correcting deviations and deformations but above all by performing arthroplasties, that is, placing joint prostheses to replace those that are already very deteriorated, constitutes an important therapeutic advance, almost always with very satisfactory results.",
        "Prevention": "To be able to delay the progression of osteoarthritis, all measures that avoid overload or misuse of the joint are essential, such as maintaining a healthy weight or inhibiting certain professional or recreational activities.

    "Osteodensitometria": {
        "What is it?": "Osteodensitometry is an examination carried out using X-rays (low dose of radiation) that allows the assessment of bone density.  This test uses X-rays to measure the amount of calcium and other bone minerals in a given bone.  Osteodensitometry assessment is performed at the level of the femur and lumbar spine. Measurement at the forearm (radius) is only reserved for cases in which assessment in the anterior anatomical regions is not possible or reliable.",
        "Advantages and benefits": "It is still today one of the complementary means that best allows for the diagnosis, assessment of fracture risk and therapeutic control of osteoporosis.  However, osteodensitometry should not be seen as a universal screening method for use in all postmenopausal women.",
        "Methodology": "On the day of the exam, fasting is not necessary, but it is important not to take calcium supplements in the 24 hours before.  After the age of 65, osteodensitometry of the proximal femur offers the greatest guarantee of accuracy and, as such, this is the preferred location.  During the examination, the patient lies comfortably on a table, while the device scans the area to be assessed.  As noted, exposure to X-rays during this exam is extremely low. However, as with all radiation procedures, a woman considering the possibility of being pregnant should inform her doctor.  After correct positioning, the examination itself should take between 1 and 4 minutes for each region studied.",
        "Indications": "Identifying a reduction in bone density before a fracture occurs;/ Determining fracture risk;/ Confirmation of a diagnosis of osteoporosis after a fracture;/ Monitoring osteoporosis treatment;/ Cases in which there is a loss of height greater than 4cm;/ Spontaneous fractures or fractures after minor trauma;/ Use of medications that can cause osteoporosis (corticosteroids, for example);/ After a transplant (due to the medication used);/ When there is a decrease in hormone levels, such as in menopause or during some treatments (e.g. prostate cancer).;/  Osteodensitometry is also indicated for: Women over 65 years old and men over 70 years old;/ Postmenopausal women under 65 years of age;/ Men over 50 years of age if they have risk factors;/ Premenopausal women;/ Men under 50 years of age if there are known causes of osteoporosis or risk factors.;/",

    "Osteoporosis": {
        "What is it?": "It is characterized by decreased bone mass and deterioration of bone architecture, leading to an increased risk of fracture. This definition is essentially based on the quantification of bone mineral density assessed by appropriate diagnostic means (DEXA). Osteoporotic fractures most frequently affect postmenopausal women and elderly individuals and represent a serious public health problem due to their high prevalence, the medical consequences they entail, the decreased quality of life and the economic and social costs they entail. These types of fractures result, as a rule, from low-energy trauma, most often caused by a fall in the same plane. In the case of vertebral fractures, there is usually no obvious trauma. In Portugal, it is estimated that osteoporosis affects around 500 thousand people. Postmenopausal women are the most affected. One in two women and one in four men will suffer one or more fractures as a result of osteoporosis. These fractures have a significant impact on the health and autonomy of affected patients, representing an enormous cost for the individual and society.",
        "Symptoms": "Osteoporosis is a \"silent\" disease, which can progress without any symptoms or discomfort over the years until the first fracture appears. In general, osteoporosis manifests itself through the occurrence of fractures with minor trauma (especially of the vertebrae, hip and wrist). In severe cases, even minor efforts are enough to fracture a bone weakened by osteoporosis. Symptoms only appear when the disease is very advanced, so early diagnosis is essential to prevent its progression. Some signs may be manifested by the appearance of changes in the body, such as the loss of height of more than 2.5 centimeters, the appearance of kyphosis (marked curvature of the back) or shoulders falling forward, making the waist wider and the abdomen more prominent. Sudden, intense and unexplained back pain is also common.",
        "Causes": "Although it is more common in postmenopausal women and in older men and women (over 65 years old), there are risk factors that increase its likelihood. Some of these are related to unhealthy lifestyles and can be modified, while others cannot. Non-modifiable risk factors are the following: Feminine gender;/ Age over 65 years;/ Caucasian or Asian race;/ Family history;/ Small stature;/ Excessive thinness;/ Modifiable risk factors are: A diet low in calcium;/ Excessive alcohol consumption;/ Smoking;/ Sedentary life;/ Some diseases (hyperthyroidism);/ Drug use (cortisone);/ Prolonged immobilization;/ Premature menopause;/",
        "Diagnosis": "All postmenopausal women and all men over the age of 50 should be questioned about the presence of risk factors. A medical examination is important and should be used to look for signs that may suggest the existence of causes for secondary osteoporosis or vertebral fractures. Tests include bone densitometry, the most important for your diagnosis, as it allows you to measure bone density, which is directly related to bone mass. This test is painless and quick, using radiation at a much lower dose than that used in a chest x-ray, and is very reliable. Densitometry is recommended for women after age 65 and for men after age 70, or in both cases after age 50 if there are risk factors. If the presence of the disease is confirmed, a laboratory evaluation is important to identify the most common causes of secondary osteoporosis or other causes of fracture, and an x-ray of the dorsal and lumbar spine to verify the existence of vertebral deformation.",
        "Treatment": "Its treatment involves regular physical exercise and the use of medications to increase bone mass, painkillers and calcium and vitamin D supplements. Drugs that increase your bone mass, that is, the amount of bone, are the most important, because they will reduce the risk of fracture. There are several drugs - such as anti-estrogens (SERMs), calcitonin, bisphosphonates, or strontium ranelate - that work in this way, and it is up to the doctor to select the most appropriate one in each case. Some of them slow down bone loss and others increase its formation. Calcium and vitamin D supplements are particularly useful if the diet does not contain the necessary amount of calcium. These can come in various forms (tablets, chewable tablets, powder to dissolve) and should be taken after meals. In the case of patients with kidney stones, it is important to drink plenty of water to prevent calcium in the urine from being harmful.",
        "Prevention": "Its prevention aims to obtain good levels of bone mass and must be done through the early identification and correction of modifiable risk factors, especially those related to lifestyle (eating habits and physical activity). Nutrition is essential and must ensure adequate dietary intake of calcium and vitamin D, maintain protein intake according to needs, and avoid excessive consumption of caffeine and alcohol.;/ Tobacco should also be avoided;/ Physical activity should be encouraged at different stages of life, and it is important to include high-impact exercises.;/ In postmenopausal women and the elderly, it is very important to ensure an adequate dietary intake of calcium and vitamin D.;/ For older people at higher risk of falling, individually adapted exercise programs should be designed that focus on walking, muscle strengthening, posture and balance.;/ National Association Against Osteoporosis Brazilian Society of Osteoporosis and Metabolic Bone Diseases Portuguese Society of Rheumatology Viviana Tavares et al., Recommendations for the Diagnosis and Therapy of Osteoporosis, Acta Reum Port. 2007;32:49-59 Portuguese Institute of Rheumatology National Osteoporosis Foundation, 2012 Load more;/ Also called premenopause, perimenopause is a period of transition to menopause and a phase in a woman's life that requires special health care.

    "Pelvic organ prolapse": {
        "What is it?": "The pelvic organs are supported by muscles and ligaments that attach to the bones of the pelvis. When these supporting tissues (called the pelvic floor) are weakened, organs such as the bladder, uterus and bowel can protrude through the vaginal wall, causing prolapse. It is a very common pathology, with an estimated 40-50% of women experiencing some type of prolapse, being more common in older patients. There are several risk factors for its occurrence: aging of the pelvic floor associated with menopause and genetic factors that cause changes in the supporting tissues, obesity, chronic cough, pregnancy, childbirth and heavy work throughout life.",
        "Types of prolapse": "There are several forms of prolapse, depending on the organ that has \u201cdropped\u201d and often, in the same patient, it is possible to find more than one type: Cystocele (bladder), Hysterocele (uterus), Rectocele (rectum), Prolapse of the vaginal vault (\u201ctop\u201d of the vagina).",
        "Symptoms": "Symptoms vary depending on the severity of the prolapse. Patients are often asymptomatic and the diagnosis is made during gynecological examination. There are some symptoms that may suggest that you are dealing with a genital prolapse, namely, the sensation of discomfort in the pelvic region and of a \u201cball\u201d inside or outside the vagina, especially after long periods of standing or exertion, tending to improve when lying down. The externalization of the organs can lead to difficulty in hygiene and bleeding, often preventing a normal life. Patients may experience urine loss and fecal incontinence; others report constipation and a feeling of defecation obstruction. This type of pathology can also affect sexual performance, due to psychological changes, in a woman's self-image, in addition to discomfort during penetration.",
        "Diagnosis": "Gynecological observation is generally sufficient for diagnosis; in other situations, the doctor needs to perform tests to complement his observation and decide on the most appropriate treatment (ultrasound, pelvic magnetic resonance imaging, urodynamic study, among others).",
        "Treatment": "Patients with no symptoms or mild symptoms generally do not require any intervention and should avoid situations that may increase the risk of worsening their prolapse, such as lifting weights. Treatment of constipation and weight loss are essential. In more serious cases\u00a0there are some options to consider, and in some cases\u00a0a combined approach is advised: - Medications: the vaginal application of estrogen creams\u00a0improves the quality of the mucosa, reduces irritative symptoms, as well as contributing positively to postoperative recovery; - Pelvic floor exercises: therapy that involves a joint activity with Physiotherapy, usually for 6 to 8 weeks, whose objective is to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles. They can help improve or prevent worsening in the early stages of the disease. They require time, motivation and adequate technique. - Pessaries: devices, usually made of silicone, that are inserted into the vagina, and whose function is to provide mechanical support to prolapsed organs, relieving symptoms. Pessaries come in different shapes and sizes. They are suitable for situations where surgery is to be postponed or avoided. They need to be adjusted by a doctor in order to find the most suitable type and size for each patient. They should be removed and replaced every 3 months or when necessary, to prevent infections and to reassess the situation. - Surgery: in symptomatic women with significant changes in their quality of life, surgery is the most effective approach. There are different ways to approach pelvic reconstruction (vaginally, laparoscopically or abdominally), with and without the use of prostheses. The choice depends on a number of factors, such as the patient's age, general health, previous surgeries and the severity of the prolapse. The surgeon's experience and the patient's preference are also important factors. A long-term cure rate of 75-90% is estimated. Recurrent prolapse may be due to the persistence of the factors that caused the initial prolapse, such as physical exertion, constipation and tissue weakness itself. Abnormal uterine bleeding can occur at any age, but it requires proper evaluation and treatment due to the risk of anemia and other complications.

    "Respiratory function tests": {
        "What are they?": "Respiratory function tests can detect respiratory diseases and provide a detailed assessment of lung function.  There are different types of tests and each one assesses a different aspect of lung function.  In general, these tests make it possible to measure air retention capacity, inspiratory, expiratory and oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange capacities.  As a rule, these tests are adequate to determine the type and severity of lung disorders but do not allow defining the specific cause of the disease. However, they are used to diagnose some diseases such as asthma.  Respiratory function tests include lung capacity and output velocity (spirometry), output-volume testing, assessment of muscle strength, and measurement of diffusion capacity.",
        "Advantages and benefits": "The main advantage of these tests is their simplicity, easy understanding and interpretation.  The results obtained are reproducible and reliable and are an integral part of the evaluation of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, for whom spirometry before and after the use of a bronchodilator is the basic diagnostic and staging test.",
        "Methodology": "Often, assessment of respiratory disease consists of looking at how much air the lungs can hold, how much they can exhale, and how quickly they can do so.  All of these measurements are performed using a spirometer, an instrument that consists of a mouthpiece and a tube connected to a recording device. In spirometry, the patient inhales deeply, then exhales forcefully and as quickly as possible through the tube while measurements are taken.  During the examination, the volume of air inhaled or exhaled and the duration of each respiratory movement are recorded and subsequently analyzed. The examination is often repeated after the administration of a drug that dilates the airways of the lungs (bronchodilator).  A maximum flow counter is a simpler instrument that allows you to measure the speed of air exhalation. As in spirometry, after taking a deep breath, the person blows forcefully into this small manual device. It is a low-cost device that allows asthmatic patients to control their disease at home.  Lung capacity measurement reflects the degree of stiffness or elasticity of the lungs and rib cage. These values \u200b\u200bare abnormally low in disorders such as pulmonary fibrosis and spinal deviations (kyphoscoliosis).  Disorders that cause loss of lung elasticity or reduce movement of the rib cage are called restrictive disorders.  Measuring respiratory output serves to determine the degree of narrowing or obstruction of the airways. Records are abnormal in diseases such as bronchitis, emphysema and asthma. These processes are called obstructive disturbances.  The most modern spirometers can assess lung capacity and measure exhaled air during a forced inhalation test. Flow-volume recordings can be particularly useful for detecting changes that partially obstruct the larynx and trachea.  Respiratory muscle strength can be measured by asking the person to inhale and exhale intensely against a pressure gauge. A disease that weakens muscles, such as muscular dystrophy, makes breathing difficult, resulting in low inspiratory and expiratory pressures. This test also helps determine whether the person who is connected to an artificial respirator is able to breathe on their own when they stop using it.  The carbon monoxide diffusion capacity test can determine how effectively oxygen is transferred from the alveoli into the bloodstream. In this technique, a person inhales a small amount of carbon monoxide, holds it for 10 seconds, and then exhales it into a carbon monoxide detector.  With normal lungs, carbon monoxide from inspired air is well absorbed. When the test shows otherwise, it means that the exchange of oxygen between the lungs and the blood is abnormal. Abnormal diffusing capacity is characteristic in people who suffer from pulmonary fibrosis, emphysema, and other disorders that affect the blood vessels in the lungs.",
        "Indications": "The diagnosis of bronchial obstructive syndrome is one of the main applications of respiratory function tests in medical practice.  Early diagnosis of chronic airflow limitation, detecting individuals at risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, allows the doctor to try to convince them to give up the smoking habit, at a stage in which the structural changes are less extensive.  Spirometry is indicated for the diagnosis of some diseases and for assessing their severity. It also allows the evaluation of the effect of a treatment or exposure to certain occupational or environmental elements.  It is useful in the diagnosis of various lung diseases, in the presence of lung symptoms (shortness of breath, wheezing), changes in the medical examination (abnormality of the thoracic cavity); in quantifying the severity of diseases already diagnosed (cystic fibrosis, asthma, heart and neuromuscular diseases); in evaluating the effects of occupational or environmental exposure (smoke, dust), the use of certain medications (bronchodilators and corticosteroids), and the risk in lung surgery.  They are also indicated in the assessment of disability or invalidity.",
        "Care to be taken": "There are several factors that can alter the results of spirometry. As such, some precautions must be taken before performing the test: Stop taking bronchodilators 6 to 48 hours before the exam;/ Eat well, avoiding large meals, teas or coffee;/ Do not smoke 4 to 6 hours before the exam;/ You should wait approximately two weeks after a respiratory infection and 7 days after a hemorrhage before performing the test.;/  As these tests involve more forced and rapid breathing, the patient may experience some difficulty breathing after the exam or a headache. This discomfort is only temporary.  The risks of lung function tests are minimal. Very rarely, a pneumothorax (collapse of a lung) can occur in patients who already have lung disease.  These tests should be avoided in patients who have recently suffered a myocardial infarction or who have some types of heart disease.

    "Psoriasis": {
        "What is Psoriasis?": "Psoriasis is a chronic skin disease, autoimmune in nature, which means that it appears when the immune system emits abnormal signals that accelerate the normal growth cycle of skin cells. Psoriasis is quite common and is not contagious. This aspect is important, because there may be a fear of contracting this pathology when swimming in a pool or through contact with affected people. There are five types, the most common form being the one that appears as raised, reddish plaques covered with a whitish area (which corresponds to dead skin cells). A particularly disabling form is one that affects the joints and occurs in about 10% of patients. It is called psoriatic arthritis and causes pain and deformity of the joints in the hands, feet, limbs or spine. Although psoriasis can present at any age, most cases occur between the ages of 15 and 30, and it is also common between the ages of 50 and 60. It affects 1% to 3% of the population and can appear anywhere on the body, being associated with diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and depression. The most affected areas tend to be the elbows, knees, scalp, nails and lower back.",
        "Symptoms of Psoriasis": "The manifestations of psoriasis can be mild, moderate or severe, depending on the extent of skin affected. Mild forms correspond to an impairment of less than 3%, moderate forms between 3% and 10% and severe forms are those in which more than 10% of the skin is affected. Fortunately, the mild form is the most common (80% of cases). However, even this can have a very negative impact on quality of life, especially when it appears on the palms of the hands or soles of the feet. The symptoms of this disease depend on its type and location. As a rule, a patient has only one type of psoriasis at a time.\u00a0Plaque is the most common, accounting for around 80% of the total, and causes itching and, when scratched, the plaques become thicker. Nails become fragile and brittle. There are other types such as: guttate (small, individual red spots); inverse (occurs mainly in skin folds); pustular (formation of blisters with pus surrounded by reddened skin); and erythrodermic (more intense inflammation of the skin, resembling a burn; affects large areas of skin and is accompanied by intense itching, pain and accelerated heart rate), requiring urgent medical observation.",
        "Causes of Psoriasis": "Although its origin is still poorly understood, there appears to be a genetic basis for this alteration of the immune system. As such, it is common for psoriasis to appear in several members of the same family. It is often triggered by a stressful event, tonsillitis, the use of certain medications (beta-blockers, antimalarials, some anti-inflammatories), a cut on the skin, sunburn or cold, dry weather. This means that, generally speaking, psoriasis depends on the existence of a genetic predisposition associated with an external stimulus.",
        "Diagnosis of Psoriasis": "There are several diseases with symptoms similar to psoriasis, and therefore the diagnosis should always be established by clinical observation by a dermatologist. In some cases, confirmation with a skin biopsy may be necessary. The doctor also seeks to learn about the patient's family history and better understand their daily activities in order to rule out triggering factors.",
        "Psoriasis Treatment": "There are many treatment options. Since the skin has different characteristics in different parts of the body, the treatment must also be different. In general, phototherapy or creams are used in limited areas of the affected area. Oral or injectable medications are useful when the impact of psoriasis on quality of life is significant. In many cases of plaque psoriasis, moisturizing creams, ointments or shampoos are enough to control the disease. These local treatments control inflammation and reduce the rate at which skin cells multiply. Phototherapy involves exposure to ultraviolet A or B rays, which can also slow down the multiplication of these cells. In other situations, exposure to sunlight can be beneficial, and it is always important to evaluate the best options with your dermatologist. Another option is to combine a medication, psoralen, with sun exposure, to achieve better results. Finally, it may be necessary to resort to laser therapy or medication administered orally or by injection.",
        "Psoriasis Prevention": "There is no way to prevent this disease, but it is possible to reduce the number of outbreaks by keeping your skin dry and well cared for, avoiding stress, anxiety and medications that can trigger it. It is also helpful to reduce alcohol and tobacco consumption, as these can increase the severity of flare-ups.

    "Eyelid ptosis": {
        "What is it?": "Eyelid ptosis corresponds to the drooping of the upper eyelid. It is usually caused by a dysfunction of the upper eyelid elevator muscle, responsible for its elevation. Ptosis, in addition to the aesthetic impact, may cause a restriction of the upper visual field or even occlusion of the visual axis. Ptosis should not be confused with the presence of a redundant fold of skin (dermatochalasia), which frequently develops at older ages.",
        "Types of Eyelid Ptosis": "Eyelid ptosis can be unilateral or bilateral and, depending on the age of onset, it can be divided into congenital or acquired: Congenital ptosis: It is present from birth. Changes during the development of the eyelid elevator muscle lead to a deficit in its function and an inability to normally elevate the eyelid. When the upper eyelid occludes the visual axis, there is a risk of amblyopia (limitation in vision development), and its correction must be discussed. Acquired ptosis: Develops later and is divided into aponevrotic, traumatic, mechanical, neuropathic or myopathic. A detailed clinical history associated with a complete objective examination usually allows the cause to be identified. Aponeurotic or involutional ptosis is the most common, occurring progressively at more advanced ages due to laxity and stretching of the insertion tendon of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle. There are other factors that may be associated with eyelid drooping, for example direct trauma (traumatic ptosis), or the presence of a lesion that, due to its weight, can limit eyelid movement (mechanical ptosis). Neuropathic aptosis is due to dysfunction in the innervation of the muscle and is associated with cases of third cranial nerve palsy, Horner's syndrome, multiple sclerosis, Guillian-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, among others. Myogenic aptosis results from a dysfunction of the muscle itself and is often associated with changes in eye movements in the context of pathologies such as progressive external ophthalmoplegia, myotonic dystrophy, myasthenia gravis, among others.",
        "Symptoms": "In ptosis, in addition to the drooping appearance of the eyelid, there may be a reduction in the upper visual field. The eyebrow rises on the same side as the ptosis in an attempt to indirectly elevate the eyelid, and in more advanced and mainly bilateral cases, there is a need to elevate the chin and tilt the head back in an attempt to improve vision.",
        "Treatment": "Surgical elevation of the affected eyelid(s). Techniques vary according to the type and severity of ptosis as well as the function of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle, and can be divided into 3 types: advancement of the aponeurosis of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle, suspension of the eyelid to the frontalis muscle or resection of the Muller muscle, located on the posterior surface of the eyelid.  Myopia, astigmatism and hyperopia often lead to the use of glasses or contact lenses. LASIK surgery can restore good vision. Do you wear contact lenses?

    "Pubalgia": {
        "What is it?": "Pubalgia results from excessive and repetitive use of the pubic symphysis and can involve prolonged interruption in physical activity. This entity is also known as pubic osteitis, since it causes pain and inflammation of the structures around and over the pubic symphysis. The pubic bone is the site of insertion of several muscles, whose tendons become inflamed due to repetitive stress in the pubic symphysis region. Many athletes, sportspeople, football players, long-distance runners, among others, feel uncomfortable pain in the region close to the pubic symphysis, caused by overload, overuse, direct trauma or a blow that produces inflammation and pain.",
        "Symptoms": "The pain only increases in intensity as the disease worsens. The onset of pubalgia is insidious, progressively increasing until movement becomes limited. Over time, the pain that was previously concentrated only in the hip migrates to other parts, such as the lower abdomen and groin. This disease can easily be confused with other problems, such as inguinal hernias, ruptures, urinary infections and tendonitis in the adductor muscles. The symptoms are identical to those of a muscle strain, with pain occurring during running, abdominal exercises and squats. Pain may also occur in the lower abdominal region, radiating to the inner thigh. Pain may also be felt at the insertion of the rectus abdominis. Lateral movements, heading movements, hip and trunk flexions can be painful. This pain worsens with exercise, effort or certain postures, and can also be felt when climbing stairs or pushing the hips forward. Pain can also radiate to the perineum and testicles and can cause low back pain when associated with a sacroiliac injury.",
        "Causes": "Athletes are often subjected to a large number of games and training sessions, often lacking the necessary time for rest or an adequate stretching program, which predisposes the appearance of this entity. The lack of or inadequate stretching of the adductor muscles of the thigh, combined with the excessive abdominal exercises that athletes perform, can cause muscular imbalance in the pubic symphysis and, consequently, pubalgia. Pregnancy is also a risk factor for pubalgia. On the other hand, there are risk factors that are intrinsic to each person, such as congenital or acquired anomalies of the abdominal wall, especially in its lower locations, such as anomalies of the inguinal canal or inequalities in the length of the lower limbs, which are very common, although unapparent, and which generate pelvic instability. The quality of the ground and footwear used (hard floors and use of footwear with little shock absorption) can also contribute to the development of pubalgia.",
        "Diagnosis": "Diagnosing pubalgia can take a long time, given the large number of disorders that affect this region of the hip, which can mask the symptoms of pubalgia and delay an accurate diagnosis. In general, the diagnosis is clinical and is confirmed by an X-ray of the pelvic area, to observe the presence of instability of the pubic symphysis of more than 2 mm. The X-ray also reveals the presence of signs of bone thickening, a sign that indicates the presence of inflammation. Nuclear magnetic resonance allows the study of soft tissues.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment involves rest, the use of ice and oral anti-inflammatories. After the acute phase, hot water compresses can be used on the region, which promotes vasodilation, which is beneficial for reducing pain and relaxing the adjacent muscles. Once the pain has subsided, stretching exercises for the inner thigh muscles, abdominal and lower back strengthening exercises, exercises to strengthen the adductors, abductors, hip flexors and extensors, and exercises to stabilize the trunk and spine can be started. Return to sporting activity may occur in milder cases after 3 to 5 days. In more severe cases, rest and treatment should last 3 weeks to 3 months, and may take up to 6 months. If, after 3 months, conservative treatment is not effective, surgical treatment should be considered.",
        "Prevention": "Prevention involves programmed and progressive training and the prevention and treatment of all predisposing factors. The abdominal muscles must be well worked and muscle stretching must be done in all training sessions, in order to achieve correct dynamic balance of the pelvis.

    "Keratoconus": {
        "What is it?": "It corresponds to a progressive change in the shape of the cornea, the most superficial layer of the eyes, which develops progressively and asymmetrically, in which the central portion assumes a conical shape, while the periphery remains relatively normal. As the disease progresses, the cornea becomes increasingly prominent, irregular astigmatism develops, scars form, and visual acuity decreases. Its prevalence is around 54.5 cases for every 100 thousand inhabitants, although it is admitted that there is a higher number, due to unreferenced cases. It is usually diagnosed in adolescence, however, it can manifest itself earlier, and tends to progress until the third or fourth decade of life, when it usually stops. It usually starts in one eye and then affects the other, and there does not appear to be a significant difference in incidence between the right and left eyes. It is a more common disease in males.",
        "Symptoms": "Symptoms vary depending on the stage of the disease. As the cornea is the transparent layer of the eye that allows light to enter, any anomaly on its surface significantly affects vision, making simple tasks very difficult and tiring, with a strong impact on the quality of life of those affected. The most common complaints are reduced visual acuity, even with glasses, fluctuating vision, need to change glasses frequently, double vision, \u201cghost\u201d images, blurred or distorted vision, eye fatigue, sensitivity to light and perception of halos around the eyes. around the lights. Corneal distortion associated with keratoconus also causes reduced contrast sensitivity.",
        "Causes": "It is a genetic disease. Around 6% to 12% of patients mention having other family members with the same pathology. Keratoconus can be associated with the act of rubbing the eyes vigorously, with other eye diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa, retinopathy of prematurity or allergic conjunctivitis. It is more common in patients with Down syndrome and has been associated with prolonged contact lens wear.",
        "Diagnosis": "Although clinical observation allows us to suggest the diagnosis, topographic maps that evaluate the curvature and surface of the cornea are the best instruments to confirm its presence and define its morphology, even when the disease does not yet present characteristic signs. Early detection is becoming increasingly important, given the progressive expansion of laser refractive surgery to correct myopia, hyperopia and astigmatism. In the presence of this pathology, these surgical interventions could lead to future complications and, as such, early diagnosis is essential.",
        "Treatment": "Your treatment depends on the stage at which you are diagnosed, its severity and its impact on vision. In some cases, the use of glasses is enough to compensate for visual difficulties. In others, contact lenses of different types are used to provide more stable vision. In more advanced stages, surgical techniques are recommended to alter the curvature of the cornea and reduce the cone that has formed. There are also other, more recent, treatment modalities that aim to strengthen the structure of the cornea. In the most serious situations, a cornea transplant becomes necessary. This procedure is necessary in around 15% of cases.",
        "Prevention": "There are no known preventive measures for keratoconus.

    "Sacrococcygeal cyst": {
        "What is it?": "It corresponds to a chronic inflammatory process that occurs in the sacrococcygeal region, and is generally associated with the presence of hair. It is an abnormal pocket of skin filled with cellular debris, sebaceous and sweat glands, and hair. These folds of skin form during embryonic development and are normally eliminated. Some may remain hidden and are called embryonic clefts. When they are large enough to become inflamed or visible to the naked eye, they are called a dermoid cyst. The fact that this cyst contains sweat glands inside explains why the lesion worsens with heat, which stimulates the production of sweat that accumulates in the skin fold, causing inflammation and/or infection. In general, this cyst forms following the eruption of a hair follicle that becomes \u201cingrown\u201d under the skin. When it becomes infected, an extremely painful abscess forms. It is more common in men than in women, three to one, especially at the beginning of the third decade of life, and tends to occur more than once. It is more common in people who spend a lot of time sitting, such as drivers of heavy vehicles.",
        "Symptoms": "The disease presents in a variety of ways, from a small, painless nodule to a large, painful inflammatory mass. When infected, it takes on the appearance of an abscess with pain, redness, spontaneous drainage of blood and pus with a foul odor through the skin. The first symptoms appear in adolescence or early adulthood in the form of inflammation in the sacrum region, with a feeling of discomfort, especially when sitting for a long time. As the condition progresses, a nodule becomes evident, usually measuring one to five centimeters, with a soft consistency and which may present inflammatory signs, such as pain, heat and redness. Very rarely, a chronic and infected pilonidal cyst, if not treated properly, can develop into a skin carcinoma.",
        "Causes": "They often appear to be caused by hair penetrating the skin. Friction and pressure (tight clothing, prolonged sitting, etc.) push the hair into the skin, which reacts as if it were a foreign body, creating a cyst around it. Another possible explanation is that stretching of the skin and movement of its deeper layers causes a hair follicle to rupture, which then forms a cyst around it. There are some risk factors that increase the susceptibility to the formation of these cysts, such as obesity, a sedentary lifestyle, a profession or sport that requires many hours of sitting, excessive or very thick body hair, as well as poor hygiene.",
        "Diagnosis": "This injury can be diagnosed based on its characteristics and medical examination. As a rule, laboratory or imaging studies are not necessary.",
        "Treatment": "Traditionally, these cysts were surgically removed, leaving the wound open, without stitches, so that it would heal by secondary intention. Nowadays, with a better understanding of their cause, they are removed and closed surgically, which allows for faster healing and recovery. This closure can only be performed if there is no inflammation or infection, which is why the ideal time for surgery is when the lesion is silent, without symptoms. When there are manifestations, it is preferable to resort to an initial treatment with antibiotics and partial drainage, scheduling the surgery for another stage. Post-operative care is very important. The operated area must be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected and it may be necessary to remove adjacent hair so that it does not enter the wound.",
        "Prevention": "The main preventive measures are good hygiene, weight loss, avoiding sitting for long periods of time and not wearing tight clothing. In cases where a pilonidal cyst has already formed, it is useful to remove hair from the sacrococcygeal region regularly to prevent a new episode.

    "Cervical radiculopathy": {
        "What is it?": "The roots of the cervical nerves from C1 to C8 exit the spine above the vertebra with the same number with the exception of C8 which exits the cervical spine below the C7 vertebra. The nerves then divide to innervate all the muscles of the shoulder, arm, forearm and hand giving them motor function and sensation. When any of these nerves is subject to an irritative process through compression or inflammation, the symptoms of tingling, pain and decreased sensitivity and decreased muscle strength along the path and in the territory of the innervation of this root appear with greater or lesser intensity. The symptoms of cervical radiculopathy may appear intermittently at first, with ups and downs, but it can also appear more or less suddenly. The pain can be felt in a single location (pain in the shoulder or elbow) or along a path radiating distally to the hand and fingers. These symptoms can affect grip strength, as well as changing the type of handwriting. During these phases of more intense pain, the mobility of the cervical spine is greatly reduced due to the risk of worsening local or radiating pain. Some patients feel relief from pain when lying down with their arm raised and their hand behind their head, as this indirectly reduces tension in the inflamed root.",
        "Causes": "Any situation that compresses or causes irritation of the nerve root can cause cervical radiculopathy. The most common causes are: Cervical disc herniation. If the interior material of the intervertebral disc comes into contact with the nerve root (due to rupture of the fibrous ring on the periphery of the disc), it causes irritation, inflammation and compression of the nerve, leading to all the symptoms described. In a young adult, this is perhaps the main cause of cervical radiculopathy.;/ Stenosis (tightening) of the Cervical canal. As part of the degenerative process of the cervical spine, changes in the \u201cwear and tear\u201d of the posterior interapophyseal joints can contribute to the reduction of space available for the neurological structures within the cervical canal and thus cause tightening of the various cervical roots and the spinal cord itself. This is the reason why this type of symptomatology is more common in patients over 60 years of age.;/ Degenerative disease of the cervical discs. When a disc in the cervical spine undergoes degeneration, the disc becomes narrower, and obviously less mobile (more rigid) and overloads the posterior interapophyseal joints, a fact that often explains the pain reflex in the region of the scapulae or trapezius at the posterior base of the neck, often associated with difficulty in supporting the weight of the head. The narrowing of the cervical discs will also lead to a narrowing of the foramina (holes through which the cervical nerves exit the spine). In these situations, inflammation and irritation of a cervical nerve is common, which is why this cause of radiculopathy is more common in patients over 50 years of age.;/",
        "Diagnosis": "If the symptoms do not regress with initial symptomatic therapy, the doctor should request imaging tests \u2013 static and dynamic X-rays + Magnetic Resonance Imaging and a computed axial tomography scan. In some cases, an electromyogram (EMG) should be requested to clarify the nerve root involved in the process.",
        "Treatment": "Conservative treatment should always be attempted initially through medication, moist heat and immobilization with a cervical collar in the acute phase. However, if symptoms persist after 6 to 12 weeks then surgical treatment should be considered. However, if severe pain persists or if neurological signs such as decreased muscle strength worsen then surgery should be considered as an alternative treatment. However, the vast majority of cervical radiculopathies resolve without surgery. Most common types of surgical treatment: Anterior cervical discectomy and interbody fusion. This is perhaps the most common type of surgery \u2013 see additional information on Anterior Cervical Spine Arthrodesis;/ Cervical disc arthroplasty. As an alternative to interbody fusion/arthrodesis, the possibility of replacing the torn disc with a hernia with an artificial disc has emerged in recent decades \u2013 see additional information \u2013 cervical disc arthroplasty.;/ Cervical surgery to reduce radiating pain or decrease strength in the upper limb has a success rate that, according to the literature, can be around 80 to 90%.

    "X-ray": {
        "What is it?": "Different types of medical examinations that allow visualization of different structures of the human body using X-rays.  The use of radiography in Medicine is very old and allows, among other applications, the diagnosis of multiple structural alterations, diseases or the presence of foreign bodies.  In these techniques, X-rays are emitted through the human body. This radiation will be absorbed or reflected by the internal structures and the remaining radiation will be transmitted to a detector, creating an image that can be studied. This recording can be on film but, increasingly, it is done on electronic media.  By their nature, the images obtained are static. There are other diagnostic methods that correspond to variations of the radiograph. One example is contrast studies, in which a radiopaque contrast agent is introduced into the body in order to differentiate certain structures. These studies are useful for evaluating blood vessels, the digestive tract and the bile ducts.",
        "Advantages and benefits": "Radiography is a simple exam to perform, relatively inexpensive and allows an effective diagnosis of numerous conditions.  The radiation dose received by the patient will depend on the purpose of the examination but, in general, it is lower than that emitted in contrast studies or tomography.",
        "Methodology": "The radiography methodology will depend on the type of examination to be performed. Considering that, within radiographic studies, there are different modalities depending on the structures to be studied, the methodology is also very variable and will be explained to each patient in a detailed manner and adapted to their case.",
        "Indications": "Dental exams;/ Verification of correct placement of surgical markers prior to an invasive procedure;/ Mammography;/ Orthopedic evaluations;/   As a rule, it is the most readily available imaging method and, as such, is the first imaging method indicated in the evaluation of the extremities, chest, and sometimes the spine and abdomen.  It is also a first-line method for evaluating fractures, lung infections or intestinal occlusions, allowing the collection of very useful elements for diagnosis.",
        "Care to be taken": "The most significant risks associated with radiography are the possibility of inducing neoplasia or cataracts and, in the case of a pregnant woman, it may cause changes in the development of the fetus.  As such, it is always important to consider in each case whether the benefits of a radiographic examination outweigh these risks, which, although reduced, are significant.  On the other hand, it is important to always use the lowest possible dose of radiation and to only take the necessary images.

    "Cervical screening": {
        "What is it?": "Cervical screening is done by cytology, that is, a \u201cPap smear\u201d test on a slide (conventional method) or liquid-based cytology. Opportunistic screening, that is, not organized and carried out in a gynecology consultation, is part of the secondary prevention of cervical cancer, like organized screening. Primary prevention includes HPV vaccines. There are two types of vaccine, the bivalent, which covers two types of HPV viruses (16 and 18) and the quadrivalent, which also prevents HPV 6 and 11, responsible for condylomas. There are national and international indications for screening, with cytology, which we will present:",
        "Tracking": "Screening should be done at the age of 21, regardless of whether you have been sexually active for a longer period of time. If the woman has not had any disease of the cervix (CIN 2 or CIN3 lesions) she can finish screening\u00a0between the ages of 65 and 70. According to some authors, at age 65, if cytology results have been normal in the last 10 years. If you had a hysterectomy, that is, extraction of the uterus and the cause was not due to pathology of the cervix, you can suspend the cytology tests.",
        "Types of cytology": "Liquid-based cytology or conventional cytology.;/ The advantage of the liquid medium is the possibility of performing viral typing in the remaining liquid medium, in the event of altered cytology or at the request of the attending physician. The request for cytology (+) HPV typing, called \u201cCoteste\u201d should not be made to women under 30 years of age. Cytology with \u201cAS-CUS\u201d changes indicates HPV typing if the woman is over 26 years old. The evaluation of this screening method by the attending physician will be important in preventing cervical cancer. Repeating the tests will depend on the results, age and clinic and must be explained to each patient. Women who have had a hysterectomy resulting from CIN2 and/or CIN3 should continue to have cytology of the vaginal vault. Only after three consecutive negative cytology tests can you discontinue the test. This interruption is not advised by ACOG (American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology). Regardless of the frequency of cytology tests, women should have an annual gynecology appointment. Women who received the HPV vaccine also need to continue undergoing cytology tests according to the proposed schedules. Abnormal uterine bleeding can occur at any age, but it requires proper evaluation and treatment due to the risk of anemia and other complications.

    "Hearing rehabilitation": {
        "What is hearing?": "The ear can be divided into three parts - the outer ear, the middle ear and the inner ear.  The Outer Ear is made up of the pinna (ear) and the external auditory canal, acting as an antenna that captures sound waves from the environment and channels them to the eardrum.  The Middle Ear consists of an air-filled space and encompasses the tympanic membrane and the three smallest bones in the human body (the malleus, the anvil and the stapes). When sound reaches the eardrum, it vibrates (transformation of acoustic energy into mechanical energy), and this vibration is transmitted by the ossicles to the inner ear.  The Inner Ear is made up of the cochlea (hearing organ), vestibule and semicircular canals (balance organs). The cochlea is made up of a bony tube in the shape of a snail, containing liquid and a \u201ccarpet\u201d of hair cells. When the vibration transmitted by the ossicles reaches the cochlea, it triggers waves in this liquid with movement of the hair cell filaments. These movements generate electrical stimuli that will be conducted by the auditory nerve to specific areas of the brain, where they will be understood as sound and processed so that they can be understood and used in language.  Hearing loss affects around 10% of the Portuguese population, and is estimated to affect around 500 million people worldwide. The cause of this extraordinary increase is due to the fact that we are increasingly exposed to noise in our daily lives. This also means that hearing loss is not just a problem that comes with age. More and more young people are suffering from hearing problems. Hearing difficulties can affect professional activity, social life and quality of life. On average, it takes about 7 years for a person to seek help for their hearing problem. Therefore, it is extremely important to treat the problem as quickly as possible, as the sooner you act, the greater the chances of hearing rehabilitation. For this reason, you should not let too much time go by without having a hearing assessment.",
        "Most common hearing problems at each age": "At the beginning of school, one in three children suffers from hearing loss. The main causes of these cases include genetic origins, otitis media and childhood illnesses. Main symptoms: If your child watches television very close to the device and with the sound turned up loud, if they are asked to repeat what has been said several times, or if they have problems concentrating at school, you should consult your ENT doctor and carry out an evaluation auditory. Many adults suffer from hearing problems without realizing it, which has implications for their personal, social and professional lives. If you experience this type of difficulty, we advise you to have your hearing capacity assessed by consulting an ENT doctor. Progressive hearing loss occurs with age, due to aging of the auditory function (presbycusis), with its manifestation being more noticeable after the age of 55. This appears earlier and more pronounced in men than in women. Constantly asks for what was said to be repeated;/ Tends to speak louder;/ Listen to television and radio at very high volume;/ Have difficulty following group conversations;/ Do you feel any intolerance to loud sounds?;/ There are three possible approaches, depending on the type of hearing problem: Medical treatment;/ Surgical Treatment;/ Hearing Aid and Auditory Rehabilitation, when there is no medical or surgical solution;/",
        "Hearing rehabilitation": "In cases where it is not possible to treat the disease that causes deafness, it is possible, however, to improve hearing through electronic devices. These devices capture ambient sound and process it, then stimulate the auditory pathway. Depending on the type of stimulus they use, they can be divided into three groups: Hearing Aids, Middle Ear Implants, Osteo-Integrated Implants and Cochlear Implants. These devices capture ambient sound through a microphone and amplify it by emitting, in the form of sound applied to the external auditory canal, a more intense stimulus to the structures of the middle ear. They are the most used devices despite it being estimated that less than 25% of people who would benefit from hearing aids use them. Certain conditions (skin diseases in the ear canal, chronic ear infections,...) may prevent the use of these devices. When deafness results from the loss or damage of a large number of hair cells in the cochlea, greatly increasing the intensity of sound sent to the ear can create an uncomfortable sensation without improving speech understanding. A medical consultation and hearing tests (simple pure tone audiometry and vocal audiometry with and without hearing aids) may demonstrate the inability to rehabilitate deafness through hearing aids and recommend other more effective electronic devices. There are currently implantable electronic devices that capture ambient sound, processing it and stimulating the auditory pathway through vibration (mechanical energy). Osteo-integrated implants;/ These devices transmit sound to the skull bone, which will conduct this vibration directly to the inner ear. They require a simple surgical intervention to place a small titanium screw in the bone behind the ear, an intervention similar to that used in the placement of dental implants. Because it leaves the auditory canal free and does not require transmission through the chain of ossicles, it can be indicated for people with absence or severe pathology of the external auditory canal, destruction of the eardrum and/or ossicles and in patients with active infection of the middle ear. Active Middle Ear Implants;/ In these implants, mechanical energy is used to directly stimulate structures in the middle ear, thus achieving powerful auditory stimulation without the inconvenience of the blocked ear sensation described by hearing aid wearers and without the risk of damage to the skin of the ear canal by the prosthesis mold. Cochlear Implants;/ Cochlear implants are electronic devices that convert environmental sound into electrical signals and transmit them directly to the auditory nerve through electrodes surgically implanted inside the cochlea. Electro Acoustic Stimulation;/ With electroacoustic stimulation, a hearing aid and a cochlear implant are used simultaneously in the same ear. You will once again have ease in understanding conversations;/ You will hear soft sounds without louder sounds becoming uncomfortable;/ You can choose the device that best suits your needs.;/ We offer a wide range of hearing aids, in various sizes and colors;/ We have qualified professionals to carry out your hearing rehabilitation;/ We guarantee technical assistance for your hearing aids allowing you to get the maximum benefit from your hearing aid;/ All this with the guarantee of the world's leading hearing aid manufacturer Widex High Definition Hearing Aids  It takes a few weeks to adapt to hearing aids, but in some cases it may take longer to feel comfortable with your new hearing. It is a process that requires patience. Don't give up! In addition to adapting to a foreign body in the ear, the brain and the ear itself will have to get used to receiving an entire universe of sound again. It requires patience and persistence. It is often necessary to adjust the device until a satisfactory result is achieved. It is important to use the hearing aid regularly so that it becomes easier to get used to it.

    "Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction": {
        "What is it?": "The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is a ligament located between the femur and the tibia, responsible for the stability of the knee joint. A ruptured ACL can make the knee unstable, preventing you from performing more demanding daily or physical activities and increasing the risk of suffering other injuries to the joint (menisci and cartilage).",
        "Surgical Indication": "Patients with a formal surgical indication are those who intend to practice sports that contain the aforementioned movements (Football, snow skiing, handball, tennis, dancing, etc.). Likewise, all patients who present symptoms of instability (feeling of failure or insecurity) in activities of daily living. Surgery should generally not be performed immediately after an injury, as this increases the risk of joint stiffness and pain in the postoperative period. Physical therapy may be necessary 2 to 6 weeks before surgery to allow the knee to regain nearly full mobility and muscle mass.",
        "Technique": "ACL reconstruction, or ligamentoplasty, aims to anatomically reproduce the damaged ligament and is a technique performed using arthroscopy (by introducing an imaging camera and specific instruments through small incisions in the skin). To replace the ACL, tendons from the knee region are used, obtained through complementary incisions measuring approximately 6 to 10 cm (OTO: central 1/3 of the patellar tendon or IT: semitendinosus and internal rectus on the proximal anterointernal surface of the leg). introduced into tunnels made in the femur and tibia and fixed to the bone by suspension devices or screws (titanium or absorbable), sometimes associated with a metal clip. All of these systems are biocompatible and do not require removal, allowing nuclear magnetic resonance to be performed. In the same surgical procedure and using the same technique, associated injuries to the menisci (suture/repair or partial resection) and articular cartilage are treated. In some cases, it may be necessary to add reinforcement of ligament stability, with an extra-articular procedure (anterolateral ligament). This surgery is usually performed with locoregional anesthesia, depending on the patient's wishes and the evaluation in an Anesthesiology consultation.",
        "Complications": "Possible, but rare, complications include sensory changes in the area of \u200b\u200bscars, joint stiffness, infection and neurovascular injury.",
        "Physiotherapy": "Physiotherapy is extremely important for the final result of the surgery. The work of gaining range of motion, muscle strengthening and joint balance training are the main factors that prevent the rupture of the new ligament. In the postoperative period, weight-bearing of the operated lower limb is limited to 50% of body weight for 2 to 4 weeks in the OTO technique and 4 to 6 weeks in IT reconstruction. Flexion is limited to 90 to 110 degrees for approximately 4 weeks. The \u201cnew ligament\u201d is in a particularly fragile period between 4 and 12 weeks, so all activities must be performed with caution. The total recovery time for resuming sporting activity usually varies between 6 and 9 months. Having a cast on your arm or leg helps you recover from fractures and reduces pain.

    "Breast reconstruction": {
        "Goals": "With Breast Reconstruction, the aim is to reconstruct a breast that comes close to the patient's expectations, whether from a psychological or aesthetic point of view, taking into account several parameters, namely with regard to symmetry (volume and shape) with the opposite breast, projection ptosis and level of the inframammary fold. The priority criteria that arise from the understanding of the disease as a solution to the continuity of a state of balance that is not only psychological but also socio-psycho-emotional mean that the only acceptable criterion for excluding a patient from the breast reconstruction program is refusal after adequate clarification or a situation in which the reconstructive act itself significantly increases the patient's risk. From this situation, fears that reconstruction may camouflage recurrence must be excluded, in light of current imaging techniques and information that all clinicians must have about these procedures and their semiological repercussions. Likewise, it must be stated that reconstruction does not harm or invalidate the indication of any of the ancillary oncological therapeutic methods subsequent to its implementation. Reconstructive surgery is a personal decision, as only a woman who has had a mastectomy or is about to undergo one can assess the significance of this surgery. However, if we look not only at the aesthetic aspect, but above all at helping to rebalance and psychologically reunite the woman as a \u201cwhole\u201d, we see that the result is often positive and that in almost all cases this additional effort is worth it.",
        "Timing": "In the patient's treatment plan, the timing of Breast Reconstruction must be taken into account, as it can be started at the same operative time as the Mastectomy. This therapeutic attitude must, however, be considered on a case-by-case basis. Immediate Reconstruction, when performed on selected patients and by a well-organized multidisciplinary team, has considerable benefits. We believe that it is currently not necessary for the patient to live with the Mastectomy deformity to adequately appreciate Breast Reconstruction and understand its limitations. In any case, we cannot and should not forget that this reconstructive process is long and slow and can take around 1.5 years in certain clinical situations.",
        "Methods": "There are several breast reconstruction techniques. It cannot be said that a given technique is better than another, but rather that one is more suitable for a given case. Almost all women can begin reconstruction at the same operative time as the Mastectomy. Except for patients with certain pathologies or with a certain type (histological) of tumors, they may not be able to undergo Breast Reconstruction. Breast Reconstruction involves at least three other surgical procedures in addition to the Mastectomy. It begins with the Reconstruction of the breast and chest wall, requiring two operative times (one of these times may be at the time of the Mastectomy); Reconstruction of the nipple-areolar complex occurs at a later stage. At this time and/or initially, modifications can also be made to the opposite breast with the aim of achieving the most appropriate symmetry possible. Additional operating times for aesthetic refinement cannot be ruled out. The methods commonly used can be:  Breast implant;/ Expansion (tissue expander) and Breast Implant;/ Musculoskeletal flaps:;/ The broadest back (L. D.);/ Rectus abdominis (T.R.A.M. ou Hartramph);/ Microsurgical methods (Gluteus maximus, T.R.A.M., L.D. D.I.E.P., S.G.A.P., etc.);/ The selection of a given method depends on the overall clinical status, the patient's expectations and tolerance, the condition of the contralateral breast, as well as obtaining a Reconstruction that can approach the aforementioned objectives.",
        "Techniques": "It is technically the simplest reconstruction; it consists of introducing an implant under the muscle and fascia of the chest wall. This type of Reconstruction has few complications; The most frequent problems, such as insufficient size of the prosthesis, are not true complications of the intervention, but limitations of its indications, in addition, both size and shape can be improved in subsequent interventions. As with other methods using breast implants, a fibrous capsule will develop, which the patient must be aware of and take the measures suggested by the surgeon to counteract its development. This method is a variation of the previous technique; uses the principle of gradual distension of tissues that will be used to cover the Breast Implant. The tissue expander is a device formed by a reservoir (\u201cbag\u201d or \u201csac\u201d) that has an integrated valve through which saline solution is introduced weekly with the aim of increasing the volume of the reservoir and thus distending the overlying soft tissues. This is the most common method in Immediate Reconstruction. In the first surgical intervention, the expander is inserted and will be kept for a few months (2 to 3 months for the expansion and more than 3 months after the expansion) and in the subsequent intervention (second intervention) it will be removed and replaced by the implant. As in the previous method, one of the problems may be the development of symptomatic capsular contracture, in addition to implying additional surgical intervention and weekly follow-up in an Outpatient Clinic during expansion. The patient must be aware that this method is slow and involves several surgical interventions. Breast Reconstruction with Tissue Expansion has more complications than that performed only with the introduction of a Breast Implant. In addition to those that occur in this type of Reconstruction, those related to Tissue Expansion may also arise, but the result is usually rewarding. Musculocutaneous flaps are used to provide additional tissue for breast reconstruction in cases where there is a shortage of tissue and these are more complex techniques. The most commonly used flaps are the Latissimus dorsi and Rectus abdominis (T.R.A.M.). In rarer cases, Gluteus Maximus can be used. The Latissimuos dorsi Flap uses skin and muscle from the posterior side of the chest; may be useful when axillary filler is desired or a Radical Mastectomy has been performed in thin patients, with thin or irradiated skin and in patients with sensitive upper limb lymphatic drainage disorders. The most frequent complications are seroma in the donor area and partial (< 5%) or total necrosis of the flap. The scarring sequelae of the elongated dorsal donor area is not negligible. The Rectus Abdominis Flap (T.R.A.M. - transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous flap or Hartrampf Flap) uses skin, subcutaneous tissue and adipose tissue from the lower abdomen. This flap involves a very significant physical and emotional effort, which is why it should only be performed on motivated patients who are prepared for major surgery with a long convalescence period. In addition to the complications associated with the flaps, problems related to the weakness of the abdominal wall may occur, with the possible development of hernias or eventrations. There is also the possibility of using microsurgical techniques to perform breast reconstruction and using other flaps such as D.I.E.P. and S.G.A.P. Reconstruction of the Areola - Nipple Complex is an integral part of Breast Reconstruction and the objective is to reconstruct an Areola - Nipple Complex similar to that on the opposite side, both in terms of symmetry and in terms of color and texture. Reconstruction of the Areola-Nipple Complex should only be performed when breast symmetry is achieved; in general, it is performed 2 to 3 months after Breast Reconstruction. Nipple Reconstruction can be done at the expense of the opposite nipple or at the expense of local flaps. Areola reconstruction can be done with: Areola on the opposite side;/ Full skin graft from the inner thighs, armpits or scars;/ In general, it is necessary to tattoo the reconstructed Areola Complex - Nipple to obtain a similar tone to that of the opposite breast. In most cases, it is necessary to perform surgical techniques to achieve symmetry with the contralateral breast in order to achieve the best possible result. There are cases in which a mammoplasty is performed on a healthy breast, which could be an increase, a reduction or a mastopexy (lift) so that the result in terms of the size and shape of the breasts is as symmetrical as possible, always knowing that they will never be the same. Every year, 4500 new cases of breast cancer appear in Portugal, being the malignant lesion that most affects women. Mammography allows for early diagnosis. Although breast cancer screening is recommended from 50 to 69 years of age, there are cases diagnosed outside these ages. It can be a nervous moment when a woman feels a \"lump\" or \"bump\" in her breast. But not all lumps are breast cancer. Learn more about benign lumps.

    "Gastroesophageal reflux": {
        "What is it?": "It is defined as the passage of gastric contents into the esophagus, in the absence of vomiting. When this becomes pathological and capable of producing symptoms and lesions in the esophagus, we begin to speak of gastroesophageal reflux disease. When the signs do not refer to the esophagus but to organs such as the oropharynx and lower respiratory tract, we are in the presence of extraesophageal reflux. Over time, inflammation of the esophagus can cause complications: Esophageal stricture - inflammation of the esophagus can cause scarring that causes the esophagus to tighten and make it difficult for food to pass through;/ Erosions and ulcers in the esophagus - acid can injure the lining of the esophagus and the presence of ulcers can cause pain, bleeding or difficulty in swallowing;/ Barrett's esophagus - after several years of exposure to acid, the lining of the esophagus can undergo a transformation, changing its appearance. This change, called Barrett's esophagus, carries a significant risk of developing esophageal cancer: about 1% per year;/ Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a very common condition, with 12% to 54% of people living in Western countries expected to experience reflux symptoms at some point in their lives. It often occurs in healthy adults without causing disease. However, when reflux causes symptoms and/or damage to the esophageal wall, we are in the presence of GERD. The reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus is a physiological process that occurs in practically everyone, several times a day, especially after meals, and asymptomatically. When it is symptomatic, it is associated with heartburn and/or acid regurgitation, interfering with patients' quality of life. It is a chronic condition, which requires prolonged maintenance treatment to prevent relapses and/or esophageal injuries. In most cases, it is a benign condition, easily controllable with therapy combined with general prevention measures. Some patients with more severe esophagitis may require more regular monitoring and appropriate medical or surgical treatment. It is important to note that, if not properly treated, gastroesophageal reflux causes erosive esophagitis which can, in some cases, develop into esophageal cancer.",
        "Symptoms": "Heartburn is its most frequent manifestation and corresponds to a burning sensation in the middle of the chest, which can radiate towards the neck and which generally appears less than an hour after meals and which can worsen when lying down or leaning forward. Regurgitation corresponds to the sensation that food is returned to the mouth, without the effort of vomiting. There may also be difficulty swallowing and chest pain behind the breastbone, which can be confused with heart problems. Other possible symptoms include coughing, shortness of breath, hoarseness, earache or gingivitis. Sometimes there may be iron deficiency anaemia or, more rarely, vomiting blood. In some cases, complications may arise, such as ulcers, strictures and the transformation of the oesophageal mucosa into an intestinal-type lining.",
        "Causes": "It results from an imbalance between the defense and aggression factors of the esophageal mucosa. The factors that attack it are some foods (tomato products, citrus juices, chocolate, caffeinated drinks), tobacco, alcohol, some medications (nitrates, estrogens, oral contraceptives, calcium channel blockers, alendronate), and the acidic contents of the stomach and bile, when bile reflux occurs. If there is a hiatus hernia, a situation in which a portion of the stomach passes through the diaphragm into the thoracic cavity, the lower esophageal sphincter may become dysfunctional, increasing reflux. In fact, these two clinical conditions are closely associated. Increased intra-abdominal pressure (tight clothing, pregnancy, coughing, obesity, sudden physical exercise, constipation) is another common cause.",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis is based on an assessment of symptoms and clinical evaluation. Tests such as an upper digestive endoscopy, an X-ray of the esophagus, stomach and duodenum or a 24-hour measurement of esophageal pH may be requested.",
        "Treatment": "General measures are useful in treating the condition, such as eating small meals, avoiding certain foods (such as fats, chocolate, citrus fruits or tomato-based stews), as well as carbonated and caffeinated drinks, not eating in the two or three hours before going to bed, not smoking, losing weight, not wearing tight clothing and avoiding activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure immediately after meals. It is also worth raising the head of the bed by about 15 centimetres while sleeping. Medications are important because they allow us to control stomach acid secretion. These drugs belong to the proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole, pantoprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole and esomeprazole) and have shown high efficacy in relieving symptoms and healing mucosal lesions. In some cases, anti-reflux surgery may be indicated, performed via laparoscopy.",
        "Prevention": "Although it cannot be prevented, it is possible to avoid or minimize the symptoms associated with it. The general measures mentioned in the treatment are also very useful in preventing the typical complaints of reflux.

    "Reflux laryngopharyngeal": {
        "What is it?": "Laryngopharyngeal reflux is a condition in which acid produced in the stomach flows back up through the esophagus into the throat, causing changes in the mucosa. Stomach acid can travel up the esophagus to the pharynx and larynx, causing chemical damage to the mucosa, which, unlike the esophagus, has no protection. Therefore, laryngopharyngeal reflux may be present without the classic symptoms and without any changes in the endoscopy exams usually performed.",
        "Symptoms": "This reflux laryngitis is manifested by hoarseness, a feeling of irritation or mucus in the throat, coughing and recurrent clearing of the throat.",
        "Causes": "This condition often starts after an upper respiratory infection. Mucosal inflammation is aggravated by contact with acid that comes from the stomach through the esophagus. The amount of acid that causes this mucosal irritation is small, which explains why many patients do not feel burning or heartburn. The individuals most likely to develop the pathology are those who have: insufficiency of the lower esophageal valve;/ digestion problems with slow emptying of the stomach;/ hiatal hernia;/ changes in esophageal contractility;/ Major risk factors include: Eating large amounts of food and being overweight;/ Excessive consumption of alcohol, soft drinks, and spicy and fatty foods;/ Smoke;/ Pregnancy;/",
        "Diagnosis": "Laryngopharyngeal reflux is diagnosed by endoscopy, and other tests are sometimes necessary. It is a common but underdiagnosed disease that can cause symptoms for months or years before being identified.",

    "Skin rejuvenation with co2 laser": {
        "What is it?": "Fractional CO2 laser resurfacing is a technique used for skin rejuvenation. Guaranteed effectiveness in: treatment of superficial/medium wrinkles;/ facial blemish treatment;/ acne scar correction;/ treatment of other scars and stretch marks;/",
        "Procedure": "The CO2 laser causes a rapid increase in tissue temperature, destroying the epidermis (correcting surface imperfections), and inducing collagen remodeling in the dermis (with consequent improvement in wrinkles and sagging skin). The fact that it is fractionated allows these effects to be obtained on the skin while maintaining micrometric \u201cislands\u201d of intact epidermis and dermis between the treated areas. This technological advancement enables an extremely fast full recovery after treatment (3-4 days) without compromising its effectiveness. For example, fractional CO2 laser resurfacing provides results comparable to those of a medium peel with TCA or glycolic acid, with recovery times around three times shorter. Analysis of the most recent studies suggests that periodic resurfacing with fractional CO2 laser, combined with other care such as sun protection, will prevent aging, avoiding the need to resort to surgical techniques such as facelifts in the long term. Fractional CO2 laser resurfacing is a relatively painless procedure performed under local anesthesia.",
        "Post-treatment": "In the immediate post-treatment period (3-4 days), moderate pain, swelling, erosions and scabs may occur, which can be reduced with medication. Transient brownish hyperpigmentation and persistent redness (up to 2-3 months) are less frequent complications. Infections and scarring are rare complications. To avoid the complications mentioned, resurfacing with fractional CO2 laser should be carried out during the winter and medical recommendations should always be followed (prophylaxis of infections with topical antibiotics and oral antivirals, sun protection, among others).",
        "Advantages": "There are other techniques that allow improving skin texture and/or collagen remodeling in the superficial dermis, alone or simultaneously. However, most of them do not provide an equally immediate and evident effect as that observed with fractional CO2 laser resurfacing, associated with a relatively quick recovery.

    "Eyelid and eyebrow rejuvenation": {
        "What is it?": "The peri-ocular region is where many of the signs of aging are concentrated. Periocular wrinkles, excess skin and fat pockets on the upper eyelids, and dark circles and bags (puffiness) on the lower eyelids can give a permanently tired and aged appearance. Rejuvenation of the periocular area is perhaps one of the most beneficial procedures for improving the face as a whole. All techniques used, whether surgical or not, must be selected individually, according to the needs and desires of each patient. It is important that the assessment and correction of these changes are carried out by a specialist with experience and in-depth knowledge of the anatomy of this region, who can contribute to the recovery of a more youthful look in a way that is safe for vision.",

    "Magnetic resonance imaging": {
        "What is it?": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a medical technology that uses a magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of the body. It constitutes a harmless imaging method that does not use ionizing radiation. MRI has the ability to show the body's organs and tissues in great detail, allowing the doctor to make an accurate diagnosis.  In general, MRI is an excellent diagnostic test for studying the brain, spine, joints and soft tissues of the limbs. It is also very useful for studying the heart, blood vessels and abdominal organs.",
        "Methodology": "The examination is carried out with the person lying on a bed that enters a tunnel open at both ends, with the part of the body that will be examined inside the machine.  Throughout the examination, you can communicate with healthcare professionals via intercoms. Healthcare professionals will be attentive during the examination and can observe you through a window.  During image acquisition, the machine emits a noise, similar to hammering noise. Whenever the machine is acquiring images, it makes this noise. It is very important that you remain still, as body movements will affect the examination.  You may need to inject a small amount of contrast medium. In this case, you may feel a slight warm sensation in your arm.  An examination takes, on average, about 30 minutes and is painless, with some discomfort resulting from the position. It is essential that you remain calm and still, without making any movements that could hinder the examination.",
        "Precautions": "In the MRI room there is a magnetic field that can attract metallic objects and interfere with electronic devices such as pacemakers.  You should wear the suit provided to you and leave all your clothing and personal items in the changing room, which will be locked during the examination. You should not take anything with you when you enter the examination room. Remove any prosthetics you are wearing (e.g. hearing aids, dental prostheses or limb prostheses). Remove glasses, rings, hairpins or other personal items.  The Intrauterine Device (IUD) and the \"lead\" in teeth are not contraindications for the MRI exam, as well as objects made of gold or other precious metals.  If the examination is performed under anesthesia or after taking a tranquilizing medication, the patient will not be able to drive or use machines and must be accompanied.  There are no known risks to the fetus, but as a precaution, it is necessary to consider the need for an MRI scan during the first trimester of pregnancy.",
        "Conditions": "Cardiac pacemaker (or \"heart battery\") - is an electronic device that helps regularize the heart rhythm. A patient with a cardiac pacemaker cannot undergo an MRI exam.  Cardiac defibrillator - is an electronic device similar to a cardiac pacemaker, which delivers an electrical discharge when the heart begins to beat abnormally. Patients with a cardiac defibrillator cannot undergo an MRI examination.  Cranial aneurysm clips- these are small springs used to close an aneurysm that ruptures inside the brain. Some older clips are attracted to the magnetic field and patients with these types of clips cannot undergo MRI examination.  Neural or spinal stimulation system - these are electrodes implanted in the brain or spinal cord that, through small electrical discharges, aim to treat certain diseases, such as Parkinson's disease.  Cochlear implant or metal tubes in the ears - these are small devices implanted inside the ears that aim to improve hearing.  Insulin infusion pump- is a small electronic device used by diabetics to administer insulin automatically.  Vascular access port or catheter - these are devices that are used for the repeated administration of medications, used, for example, in patients undergoing chemotherapy, and that may contain metallic parts.  Filters, needles and other metal implants - are used, for example, to treat stenosis in the arteries of the heart.  Metal fragment in the eyes or body - these are fragments that can move and result in injury.  Surgical staples, clips or metallic sutures; plates, screws, rods or wires in the bones - if the surgery was performed more than 4 months ago, they do not constitute a contraindication.  Tattoos, makeup and medicated dressings - Some of the products used in tattoos and makeup contain metals that can irritate the skin during the test. Some medicated dressings can cause the same reaction and should be removed before the test.  Piercing and acupuncture needles - The jewelry used for piercings and acupuncture needles may be made of metal that is attracted to the magnetic field.",

    "Retinitis pigmentosa": {
        "What is it?": "Retinitis pigmentosa (also known as retinitis pigmentosa) is a group of rare genetic disorders that affect the ability of the retina - the layer of light-sensitive cells (the photoreceptors) that \"lines\" the deep part of the eye - to process light. In these situations, the photoreceptors (the cones and rods) are no longer able to process light, resulting in the gradual loss of vision. Normally, in the initial phase, the rods are affected, causing loss of night and peripheral vision. As the disease progresses, the cones, the most central cells, are affected, causing loss of central vision and color perception. It is estimated that, worldwide, retinitis pigmentosa affects around one in every 40,000 people.",
        "Symptoms": "Symptoms of retinitis pigmentosa usually appear in childhood. The most common and initial ones are difficulty seeing at night (night vision) and the loss of peripheral vision (on the sides) due to rod degeneration. The loss of these photoreceptors later leads to degeneration of the cones, and in later stages of retinitis pigmentosa, patients tend to gradually narrow their field of vision, developing tunnel vision (which means the person cannot see to the side without turning the head). Photophobia - eye discomfort when exposed to very bright light - is another symptom associated with retinitis pigmentosa. The progression of the disease varies greatly from person to person, as there are several types of genetic mutations involved. Most patients with retinitis pigmentosa lose most of their vision in young adulthood and by the age of 40 are often considered blind. These symptoms can affect patients' lives, preventing them from performing tasks such as reading, driving, walking without support and even recognizing people and objects.",
        "Causes": "Retinitis pigmentosa is an inherited disease - that is, it is passed down from parents to children - that can cause changes in any of a list of 50 genes. These genes carry the instructions for producing proteins that are needed by the cells of the retina and, sometimes, they are severe and can prevent the gene from producing these proteins. Other possible mutations can lead to the production of a protein that is toxic to the cell or even proteins with anomalies that consequently do not function correctly. Regardless of the case, the result is damage to the photoreceptors of the retina.",
        "Diagnosis": "The first step in diagnosing retinitis pigmentosa is observing the retina. To do this, the doctor uses an instrument called an ophthalmoscope. A sign associated with retinitis pigmentosa is the presence of dark, abnormal pigment deposits in the retina. Other tests used in the diagnosis of this disease are: Electroretinogram, which measures the electrical activity of photoreceptor cells.;/ Visual field tests, to determine the degree of vision loss.;/ Genetic testing.;/",
        "Treatment": "There are some strategies that can make life easier for people who have retinitis pigmentosa. For example, children with this disease may benefit from using instruments that allow them to maximize vision, such as lenses that increase central vision, expand the field of vision, and eliminate glare. There are also computer programs that read text aloud as well as portable flashlights that adjust to the light present in the location, allowing the person to see better. The use of a guide dog may be advised. Wearing sunglasses is also important, as it helps patients cope with light sensitivity and protects the eyes from harmful ultraviolet rays, which can accelerate vision loss.  There is no cure for retinitis pigmentosa, however, some options exist to slow the progression of the disease and even recover some vision: Acetazolamide: in more advanced stages, the area in the center of the retina may have edema (swell) and consequently reduce vision. This medication may be indicated to improve the quality of vision.;/ Vitamin A: this vitamin can slow the progression of the disease over the years, however, in very high quantities it can be toxic.;/ Retinal implant: in advanced stages of the disease, some patients may be candidates for a retinal implant that can partially restore vision.;/ Optogenetic therapy: currently (2021) a treatment is in the clinical testing phase that allowed a patient with retinitis pigmentosa to partially and gradually recover his vision. Optogenetic therapy consists of the intraocular injection of a compound that is combined with the use of specific glasses that use light to stimulate the retina.;/",
        "Ophthalmological surveillance": "It is very important that patients maintain routine appointments with their doctor in order to assess the progression of the disease.

    "Rheumatism": {
        "What is it?": "This definition includes numerous diseases with very different locations and characteristics, which affect the joint and muscle structures of the body. They are degenerative diseases, closely related to aging, and therefore their frequency has been increasing, given the increase in average life expectancy. Currently, more than 150 different types of rheumatic diseases are known. Available estimates indicate that, at any given time, around 2.7 million Portuguese people suffer from some type of rheumatic complaint, which is equivalent to 25.7% of the population. And 10% have the disease in a serious and disabling state. Women tend to be more affected, accounting for around 60% of all cases. Although they affect the elderly more, children can also have them. For example, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupuserythematosus or ankylosing spondylitis affect young people of working age. According to the Brazilian Society of Rheumatology, the notion of \u201csuffering from rheumatism\u201d is incorrect because all rheumatic diseases have a specific diagnosis and treatment. One can, however, find some elements common to these various pathologies: they are painful, sometimes throughout life, they limit functional capacity and they are \u201cinvisible\u201d, in the sense that the pain, if there is no visible joint deformation, is generally not understood by people, not even by the patient's family.",
        "Symptoms": "The most common complaint of rheumatism is, without a doubt, pain. It tends to vary in its intensity, rhythm and location depending on the type of rheumatic disease, and these characteristics are relevant for diagnosis. For example, it is important to distinguish mechanical pain, which arises with effort on the diseased joint, from inflammatory pain, which is more intense upon waking. Other common symptoms are heat and swelling of the joints and the feeling of weakness or stiffness when performing minimal activities, such as buttoning a shirt or writing. Patients may also report severe fatigue, lack of energy, or a feeling of malaise. As they can affect other organs, the manifestations depend on the locations affected. The most common rheumatic disease is osteoarthritis, which affects both the cartilage and the bone in the joints, causing pain, stiffness and limited movement. Osteoarthritis becomes more common as people age, accounting for 80% of occurrences in people over 60 years of age, although only 20% present complaints. Other well-known diseases are rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, systemic lupus erythematosus, agout, polimyalgia rheumatica or astendinitis.",
        "Causes": "The causes vary depending on the different rheumatic diseases. In general, the most common are degenerative forms, in which the locomotor system gradually loses its original characteristics, as occurs in arthrosis and osteoporosis; inflammatory forms, such as rheumatoid arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis; infectious forms; immunological forms, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and scleroderma; and metabolic forms, such as gout. A genetic predisposition to the various forms of rheumatic diseases has also been identified.",
        "Diagnosis": "It can be difficult because the symptoms of rheumatism occur in many other pathologies. In general, the rheumatologist reviews the patient's medical history, observes the patient and orders a series of laboratory tests as well as imaging studies. Some of the most important tests are antinuclear antibodies, C-reactive protein, creatinine, sedimentation rate and rheumatoid factor. It may be worthwhile to examine the synovial fluid for inflammatory cells, bacteria or viruses.",
        "Treatment": "As a rule, there is no cure, with infectious forms being the exception. However, this does not mean that having a rheumatic disease implies a constant source of mandatory suffering. The available treatments allow, in many cases, the maintenance of a good quality of life. As there are dozens of different rheumatic diseases, their treatment varies from case to case. Currently, there are several effective medications to control or even cure some of these pathologies. The evaluation and diagnosis process must be carried out by a rheumatologist. Importantly, the sooner you go, the more likely you are to effectively control any of the rheumatic diseases. Available treatments include rest, exercise, an adequate diet, physiotherapy, hydrotherapy, medications, containment devices and, in some cases, surgery. It is often important to combine several treatments in the same case. The prescribed medications can be analgesics, anti-inflammatories, corticosteroids or biological medications, which act on the progression of the disease.",
        "Prevention": "It is important to protect the locomotor system, conserving energy, protecting the affected joints, not overloading them, performing exercises that improve mobility and, in general, staying active. Other aspects to consider are a balanced diet, weight control, adopting correct posture, and choosing suitable shoes and a mattress. According to the recommendations of the Portuguese Society of Rheumatology, the presence of pain, stiffness or swelling in a joint, for a period longer than 15 days, requires a visit to the doctor. In this way, an earlier diagnosis, more effective treatment and a less compromised quality of life are possible.

        "What is it?": "Rhinitis is one of the most common causes of nasal obstruction. It is caused by an inflammatory process in the nasal mucosa and consequently a reduction in the area through which air passes. It is a very common condition in the population.",
        "Symptoms": "The typical symptoms of rhinitis are: Frequent sneezing;/ Itchy nose or throat;/ Runny nose or runny nose;/ Nasal congestion or stuffy nose;/ These can be intermittent or persistent, and can range from mild to severe. Eye allergy or allergic conjunctivitis is often associated with allergic rhinitis.",
        "Causes": "Rhinitis may be associated with allergic or non-allergic factors. It may only appear during certain seasons of the year (seasonal), or remain throughout the year (perennial). Allergens such as dust mites, pollens, fungi, animal epithelia, latex, among others, are the most common cause of rhinitis.",
        "Diagnosis": "Among all allergic diseases, it is, without a doubt, the most common. However, its diagnosis is, in most cases, delayed because it is interpreted as a common infection (cold). In prolonged and uncontrolled situations, it can become complicated by sinusitis, nasal polyposis, otitis or bronchial asthma.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment of rhinitis depends on the type and underlying mechanism, namely whether the cause is allergic, infectious, occupational or hormonal. In allergic rhinitis, the use of oral or inhaled antihistamines, as well as intranasal corticosteroids, are useful and well-tolerated medications that effectively treat itching and mucus production, stabilizing allergic manifestations. Eye drops also reduce itching, redness, and swelling of the eyes, and are often used in conjunction with other medications. In more serious situations, the use of short-term oral corticosteroids allows good therapeutic results. If it is possible to identify which is the predominant allergen causing the complaints (e.g. pollen, dust mites, animal dander, etc.) it is recommended to proceed with specific immunotherapy which consists of the gradual desensitization of the immune system to the allergens that trigger the symptoms. providing prolonged relief.",

These cavities that communicate with the nose are four - the maxillary sinuses, which are two, the ethmoid sinuses, the frontal sinus and the sphenoid sinus.",
        "Symptoms": "It can manifest as nasal obstruction, anterior/posterior rhinorrhea, headaches, a feeling of heaviness in the head, disturbances in smell and taste, and nasosinusal polyposis. In this situation, there is a polypoid degeneration of the nasosinusal mucosa, leading to the filling of the ostiomeatal complex and nasal cavity with inflammatory-looking tissue, with polyps.",
        "Causes": "The most common causes include: Viral upper respiratory tract infections are the common precursors to bacterial sinus infections.;/ Respiratory allergy causes chronic inflammation of the nasal mucosa with edema and mucus production that facilitate sinus drainage and consequently create conditions for secondary infections.;/ Exposure to irritants and tobacco;/ Nasal polyposis associated or not with asthma and aspirin sensitivity;/ Certain medications and nasal constrictor abuse;/ Immunological alterations: cystic fibrosis, HIV;/ Hormonal changes such as in pregnancy;/",
        "Treatment": "Its treatment is medical. In some situations, where it is associated with anatomical changes that cause obstruction of the drainage or ventilation ostia of these cavities, surgical correction of the anatomical defect is performed. Nasal surgery aims to provide adequate ventilation of the nasosinusal cavities and nasal cavity, reversing nasal obstruction and rhinosinusitis. At the same time, any defects in the nasal pyramid can be corrected: hump, saddle, lateral deviations of the pyramid or nasal valve insufficiency.",
        "Prevention": "Identifying and treating the underlying cause is the main way to prevent the disease. Monitoring in otorhinolaryngology and allergology is important for curing or improving this condition.

    "Rhizarthrosis": {
        "What is it?": "Trapeziometacarpal osteoarthritis (Rhizarthrosis) is more common in women over 40, but anyone can have it. It usually affects both thumbs. Osteoarthritis is a disease that causes inflammation, stiffness and destruction of the joints. In a normal joint, cartilage covers the ends of the bones, allowing them to move smoothly and without pain. The joint at the base of the thumb is formed by one of the carpal bones (trapezium) and the first of the three thumb bones (metacarpal). This joint (trapezium-metacarpal) allows the thumb to move and grip with the other fingers. In osteoarthritis, the cartilage layer deteriorates and the bones rub against each other. It often affects the joint at the base of the thumb, also called the trapezium-metacarpal joint. Trapeziometacarpal osteoarthritis (rhizarthrosis) slowly destroys the joint. The pain caused by this osteoarthritis can be very disabling for daily activities. Joint Destruction by Osteoarthritis The tops of the bones are covered with cartilage. This covering acts as a cushion, allowing the bones to move smoothly. Osteoarthritis destroys the cartilage and the bones start to move against each other when you move your thumb, making the joint inflamed and painful. Over time, the bones can collapse or dislocate, causing deformity and stiffness, preventing you from straightening your finger.",
        "Symptoms": "Rhizarthrosis causes pain at the point where the thumb connects to the wrist and worsens with effort, such as trying to unscrew the tightly closed lid of a jar or trying to turn a key stuck in a lock. Time can also worsen pain. The joint can become inflamed and over time become stiff or deformed.",
        "Causes": "Rhizarthrosis is the result of wear and tear of the joint. It occurs more frequently, and at a younger age, if there has been trauma with ligament damage or a fracture of the thumb. Repetitive pinching, twisting or rolling movements between the thumb and fingers can aggravate osteoarthritis.",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of this osteoarthritis is based on the symptoms and physical examination of the hand, confirmed with x-rays of the thumb, which will indicate the more or less advanced degree of the osteoarthritis.",
        "Treatment": "Non-surgical treatment If arthritis is diagnosed at an early stage of the disease, it may respond favorably to non-surgical treatment. Your doctor may place a splint to immobilize your thumb for 3 to 6 weeks. This limits movement and reduces inflammation. It may be associated with the oral intake of an anti-inflammatory drug, such as aspirin or gerarn. If symptoms do not improve, your doctor may suggest a joint injection of an anti-inflammatory drug, such as cortisone. If non-surgical treatment does not relieve pain and stiffness, or if the arthritis is already at a more advanced stage with joint destruction, your doctor may recommend that you consult a specialist in hand surgery to assess the indication for surgery and the technique. most correct for your case. Surgical Treatment If the hand surgery specialist recommends surgery, the diseased joint will be removed, usually by removing the base of the 1st metacarpal and the trapezius and the reconstruction is carried out with a prosthesis or a tendon graft taken from your forearm and wrist. . This type of surgery can be performed under general anesthesia (which involves 24 hours of hospitalization) or under local regional anesthesia of the branchial plexus, in which only the arm is anesthetized (which does not involve hospitalization). The Recovery Initially the hand has a relatively bulky bandage and a splint. After removing the stitches, you will only have a splint to immobilize your thumb for a total of 6 weeks, from the date of surgery. This splint will keep the thumb stable while healing occurs. Once the splint is removed, the surgeon will give you guidance on the movements to be made and will send you to a physiotherapist to help you with mobility, making the new joint more flexible and the muscles stronger and more elastic. It will take some time before you regain full use of your thumb. Once recovered, you will have little or no pain \u2013 as long as you don't overdo your thumb activities. Ensure that you continue to do the exercises prescribed by your surgeon or hand therapist to improve the activity of the new joint. Your thumb may never fully recover like a new finger, but you will be able to resume most of your daily activities with virtually no complaints. Having a cast on your arm or leg helps you recover from fractures and reduces pain. Know what to do in this situation.

It is often confused with acne, eczema or allergies. It appears to be most common among middle-aged women with fair skin. Although the causes are not fully understood and there is no cure, there are several ways to alleviate its symptoms. It is characterized by redness, dilated vessels and a sensation of heat in the central region of the face. As the disease progresses, swelling and pustules may appear. Sometimes it even reaches the eyes. At an initial stage, it appears for short periods but, over time, the situation tends to become permanent. It has a higher incidence in adults between 30 and 50 years old and is more common in women with fair skin.",
        "Symptoms": "Symptoms vary from patient to patient but most cases present these symptoms and signs: Flushing: redness is generally persistent and located in the central region of the face. There may be dilation of cutaneous vessels that become visible and are called telangiectasias.;/ Inflammatory rosacea: skin lesions can become large and hard like pimples, papules and pustules. These lesions are painful and often contain pus-filled exudate.;/ Thickening of the skin of the nose (rhinophyma): as the disease progresses, the skin lining the nose becomes thickened and deforms the nose, which becomes bulbous. This condition is more common in men.;/ Ocular rosacea: the eyelids may become red and swollen and the eyes may become dry and inflamed. It usually precedes the appearance of skin changes.;/",
        "Causes": "Its cause is unknown, but factors that trigger or worsen the condition are known: hot environments, fireplaces, sunlight, cold and wind, hot drinks, alcoholic drinks and spices, as well as emotional factors.",
        "Diagnosis": "There is no specific clinical test for rosacea. Examination of the skin and the context of the appearance of the lesions, location, type of lesions, associated with the patient's clinical history, facilitate diagnosis. Early diagnosis and immediate treatment significantly reduce the risk of disease progression.",
        "Treatment": "There are several therapies available but their prescription depends on the severity of the disease. There is currently no cure. The skin of people with rosacea is extremely sensitive and care must be taken when selecting hygiene and cosmetic products. Regular application of sunscreen is also important. Pulsed light treatment (IPL) is the best solution in cases of redness and dilated vessels. When pustules are present, antimicrobial and antiparasitic therapies are often effective. Sometimes it is still necessary to resort to drugs with isotretinoin.",
        "Prevention": "Since its cause is not known, the condition cannot be prevented.

    "Rotator cuff rupture": {
        "What is it?": "The rotator cuff is made up of four tendons that lie on the joint capsule, which surrounds the shoulder joint. These tendons are called: Subscapularis (in front), supraspinatus (top) and infraspinatus and small teres at the back. Through the action of the respective muscles, the tendons work together to control shoulder movement (see article on conflict syndrome). Rupture of the rotator cuff corresponds to a rupture in the insertion region of these tendons at the level of the head of the humerus. Due to external (trauma) and/or internal actions, these tendons undergo changes in their structure and quality. Thus, a fall can lead to a rupture of one of these tendons, but also the aging process of the tendon combined with daily efforts can wear the tendon so much that it causes a rupture. Also, a worn tendon, although not ruptured, can rupture more easily due to a low-energy trauma. Although these situations lead to ruptures, they have different characteristics and as such should be viewed differently.",
        "Symptoms": "Rotator cuff tears can occur in association with activities involving repeated overhead movements, as well as as part of the aging process. Clinically, patients may present with pain (typically nocturnal), loss of mobility and loss of strength in the affected upper limb.",
        "Diagnosis": "During the consultation, we sought to find out if there were any complaints about the shoulder, whether or not there was trauma and how intense it was, whether the complaints started immediately, what intensity and type of pain you have and how incapable you are of moving your shoulder. During medical observation we look for signs of muscle atrophy and decreased strength to be able to assess what we will find in complementary exams. Diagnosis can be made through Ultrasound and/or Magnetic Resonance Imaging. The X-ray must be performed simultaneously to assess the state of the joint, given its therapeutic implications. X-rays show bone changes and provide indirect signs of tendon injury, and are therefore an important examination. Ultrasound is the only examination that can show the action of tendons in movement, however its quality is highly dependent on the person performing it and does not provide information about the quality of the tendon and muscle. Computerized Axial Tomography (CT) is of very little interest in this pathology. Magnetic Resonance Imaging can show the size of the tear, its location, and the quality of the tendon and muscle, and is the most important examination in cases where a rotator cuff tear is suspected.",
        "Treatment": "In the initial phase, analgesics and anti-inflammatories may be prescribed, which, together with an appropriate physiotherapy plan, provide pain relief and improve joint function, although they do not treat the tendon rupture. If symptoms persist, surgical treatment is necessary, usually using minimally invasive techniques such as arthroscopy. When analyzing the situation, consultation with your doctor is essential. In conjunction with complementary exams, he is able to present you with the different types of treatment and advise which, in your case, has the greatest chance of reducing/ending your pain and improving your function in a lasting way. When the pain is very severe, preventing you from sleeping at night, for example, your doctor may recommend that you undergo an infiltration. In addition to reducing your pain, it also helps you understand whether your difficulty in making movements with your shoulder is largely due to pain or whether it is mainly due to tendon rupture. In ruptures that occur in tendons that are already diseased and in ruptures of part of the tendon's thickness or complete ruptures but of small dimensions (less than 1cm), physiotherapy can be a good solution. The objectives are, in the initial phase, to reduce pain and subsequently optimize the functioning of all the muscles and tendons of the shoulder girdle, to explore the possibility of mechanically balancing your shoulder and allowing a quality life. However, there are situations in which we know in advance, through statistical analysis of the patients treated, that physiotherapy is not the best solution. In a traumatic rupture of a good quality tendon, surgical option is the best. Nowadays, surgical repair of the rotator cuff is performed arthroscopically. In experienced hands, this technique made it possible to understand the characteristics of the rupture and, accordingly, choose the best and most stable way to repair it. This fact allows for earlier and safer physiotherapy and, according to several comparative studies, leads to better results even in tendons with less good quality. When the quality of the tendons and muscles prevents the rupture repair from leading to a good result, other options become necessary. In patients under 55 years of age, muscle transfers may be a good option. These are technically very complex surgeries that consist of placing a tendon in an anatomical position that allows it to have an action similar to that of the irreparable tendon. The results for supraspinatus and infraspinatus tears are good and consistent. The association of two tendon transfers gives less consistent results. In older patients and with massive ruptures, the solution most likely to reduce pain and provide function compatible with an independent and quality life is a special prosthesis (inverted) that allows the arm to be lifted without the cuff tendons. This is a solution that was designed for patients in the seventh decade of life, and the prosthesis was designed specifically to solve this problem. The vast majority of patients, although they do not have full mobility, have acquired comfort and autonomy that makes them very satisfied with the result. In summary, hood rupture is a multifaceted entity.

    "Ligament rupture": {
        "What is it?": "A ligament tear is an injury usually resulting from trauma, in which the ligaments that join the bones of the body are completely torn. Ligaments are made up of collagen fibres, arranged parallel or closely intertwined with each other. They are malleable and flexible to allow freedom of movement, but they are strong, resistant and elastic (so they do not easily give in to the action of forces). Like tendons, they play a role in stabilising the skeleton during movement, and both can be injured. Ligaments tend to become more fragile with age, and tears become more common as we get older.",
        "Symptoms": "Ligament injuries are usually accompanied by pain at the site of the injury and difficulty in moving the affected limb.",
        "Causes": "Sports practice;/ Trauma (falls, blows);/ Muscle weakness due to a sedentary lifestyle;/",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis is based on clinical observation of the patient and imaging tests such as MRI of the affected area are often necessary.",
        "Treatment": "Ligamentoplasty is a surgical procedure that consists of reconstructing a stable joint using flaps from nearby ligaments.",
        "Prevention": "Risk factors must be avoided to prevent ligament rupture.

    "Patellar tendon rupture": {
        "What is it?": "The patella tendon works together with the muscles on the front of the thigh, the quadriceps, to strengthen the leg.  Although anyone can injure this tendon, tears are more common in middle age or in athletes involved in running or jumping sports.  Ruptures of this tendon can be partial or complete. When a complete rupture occurs, the disability is very significant and requires reconstructive surgery. In these complete ruptures, it is impossible to extend the knee.  This tendon often ruptures at its insertion point in the kneecap and, when it ruptures, can fracture a small bone fragment.",
        "Symptoms": "Rupture of this tendon causes a \u201cclicking\u201d or tearing sensation followed by pain and swelling.  You can see a depression in the lower part of the kneecap, which corresponds to the place where the tendon ruptured.  It is common for a hematoma to develop and the knee may move towards the thigh as it is no longer anchored to the tibia.  It is not possible to straighten the knee and walking becomes very difficult due to the instability of this joint.",
        "Causes": "For trauma to rupture this tendon, significant force is required. This rupture can result from a fall with a direct impact on the front of the knee, a blow with a sharp instrument or a jump in which the knee is flexed and the foot lands violently on the ground.  If the tendon is weakened, due to tendinitis for example, the risk of rupture is greater.  This tendon may be weakened in some chronic diseases that interfere with blood flow to the tendon, such as chronic kidney disease, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus, diabetes, metabolic diseases or infections.  The use of corticosteroids and anabolic steroids can increase muscle mass but weakens both muscles and tendons.  Previous surgeries in the knee region increase the risk of ruptures.",
        "Diagnosis": "The clinical history is important to understand whether a trauma has occurred and its context and to rule out diseases that may weaken the patella tendon.  The medical examination allows the presence of a rupture to be assessed and identified.  An x-ray can reveal that the patella has moved from its position and an MRI allows you to accurately study the tendon.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment depends on the type and extent of the injury, the patient's activity level, and age.  Partial and minor tears are treated conservatively, using immobilization, keeping the knee straight, and using crutches to reduce the load on the knee. This immobilization may be necessary for 3 to 6 weeks.  Physiotherapy helps you regain strength and increase your range of motion.  Surgical treatment allows the tendon to be reinserted into the kneecap. When surgery is indicated, it must be performed early to prevent the formation of scar tissue and shortening of the tendon.  Recovery after surgery requires pain control with anti-inflammatories, ice and immobilization. After 2 to 4 weeks, the leg can support about 50% of the body weight and, after 4 to 6 weeks, it will be able to support the entire weight.  Physiotherapy will be essential in recovering strength and mobility.  Generally speaking, the complete recovery process takes about 6 to 12 months.",
        "Prevention": "Preventing these injuries involves sensible effort management. As soon as you feel pain in your knee while carrying out a sporting activity, you should stop and apply ice.  While the pain persists, it is important to avoid activities that put pressure on the patella tendon.  Having strong thigh muscles helps to cope with the stresses exerted on the patella tendon.  Finally, using proper techniques in each exercise is essential to prevent this and other injuries.

    "Elbow tendon rupture": {
        "What is it?": "The biceps muscle is located in the anterior part of the arm and allows flexion of the elbow and rotation of the forearm. It also guarantees shoulder stability. Tendons connect muscles to bones. If the biceps tendon tears near the elbow, strength in the arm is lost and you cannot rotate your palm up and down. When this rupture occurs, the tendon does not regenerate or heal. As such, appropriate treatment is essential. These ruptures can be complete or partial. Complete ruptures are the most common. At an early stage, the other muscles in the arm may replace the function of the injured tendon. However, if the injury is not repaired, there will be a loss of strength in the arm of between 30 and 40%. This type of injury is rare, especially in women.",
        "Symptoms": "This type of rupture causes the muscle to rise towards the shoulder, creating a protrusion on the upper part of the forearm and a more depressed area close to the elbow, resulting from the absence of the tendon. It is common to see a bruise in the elbow region. The pain is intense at first but becomes less intense after a week or two. Swelling may also occur in the anterior region of the elbow, loss of strength when flexing and twisting.",
        "Causes": "The most common cause of this injury is sudden trauma when the elbow is forced into extension. Although more rarely, this tear can occur when the elbow is flexed while lifting a heavy load. When you try to lift a very heavy weight, your biceps and tendons try to keep your arms flexed, but the excessive weight forces your arms into an extended position. As you try to counteract this resistance, the pressure on your biceps increases and the tendon can rupture. The most common risk factors are male sex, age over 30 years, nicotine (affects tendon nutrition) and the use of corticosteroids (weaken muscles and tendons). Fighting and contact sports increase the risk of this type of injury.",
        "Diagnosis": "In most cases, a medical examination and clinical history allow a very accurate diagnosis. X-rays, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging allow an assessment of the type and severity of the rupture.",
        "Treatment": "As a general rule, all tendon ruptures benefit from the approach represented in English by the acronym RICE (rest, ice, compression, elevation), that is, rest, ice, compression and elevation of the affected limb. Conservative treatment can be considered for older, inactive patients or when there is an associated disease that increases the risk of surgery. In general, this decision must be carefully considered, because surgery performed later may not allow full recovery of arm function. This non-surgical treatment is more effective in the case of partial ruptures. In fact, it is important that the tendon is repaired within the first 2 to 3 weeks after the injury. After this time, the tendon and biceps begin to retract and fibrose. The surgery aims to reinsert the tendon. Complications from surgery are rare, affecting 6 to 9% of patients and result in a feeling of weakness or numbness in the forearm, growth of new bone at the site where the tendon was reinserted, causing limited movement and requiring new surgery, new rupture after complete healing. After surgery, a period of immobilization is important and, subsequently, physiotherapy will be necessary, with resistance exercises. As a rule, recovery from this type of injury takes 2 to 3 months, during which time the elbow must be spared all excessive strain. Some surgeons prefer not to operate because they consider that this type of tear does not significantly interfere with muscle function. For this reason, it is important that each case is properly analyzed in order to decide on the best solution.",
        "Prevention": "In the case of sports, preventing this type of injury involves correctly conditioning and preparing the muscles, improving their strength and flexibility, and warming up before starting each activity. In everyday life, it is important to measure the effort applied when lifting a heavy load, not exceeding the limits of individual resistance and strength. It is important to note that elbow tears can affect tendons and ligaments simultaneously. In fact, a hyperextension movement of the elbow can affect several ligaments and tears can also be partial or complete. As a rule, treatment involves rest, use of ice, immobilization, compression and the use of anti-inflammatory medication.

    "Shoulder tendon rupture": {
        "What is it?": "Shoulder tendon injuries occur in several common sports, such as tennis or other racquet sports and swimming. The mechanism of tendon injury may result from a process of hypertrophy or inflammation that increases the volume of the muscle and tendon and affects their mobility or from a reduction in the available space in the joint related to the formation of bone spurs. Another possibility is that the weakness of a tendon increases joint instability, thus increasing the risk of injury. Of the various tendons that can be injured in the shoulder, the most important is the biceps tendon. This muscle is located in the anterior region of the arm and inserts into the elbow and shoulder. When a tear occurs in the shoulder, the strength in the arm is lost and it becomes impossible to flex it. The biceps muscle inserts into the shoulder via two tendons. The longer tendon is more prone to rupture, as it is more vulnerable along its path. Ruptures of the shorter tendon are very rare, and for this reason, in many cases it is still possible to use this muscle even with a complete rupture of the longer tendon. Depending on the extent of the rupture, treatment may be merely symptomatic or surgical. These tears can be partial or complete and can occur simultaneously with injury to other structures of the shoulder. Often, the process is gradual, with rupture occurring when trying to lift a heavy object.",
        "Symptoms": "A ruptured shoulder tendon causes sudden, intense pain in the upper arm, sometimes with an audible pop. A hematoma may form on the upper arm and extend to the elbow. There is a loss of strength in both the shoulder and elbow and it is difficult to rotate the palm up and down. The rupture of the tendon does not allow the maintenance of tension on the biceps muscle, forming a protrusion above the elbow, which is known as the \u201cPopeye muscle\u201d.",
        "Causes": "Tendon ruptures in the shoulder can occur from direct trauma or overuse. The trauma may be a fall onto an outstretched arm or an attempt to lift a very heavy object. Excessive use occurs progressively and is aggravated by age. There are some risk factors that need to be considered, such as age, activities that involve movements above the head, such as lifting weights, sports such as tennis and swimming, tobacco (affects the nutrition of the tendons) and use of corticosteroid medications (increase the weakness of the tendons). muscles and tendons).",
        "Diagnosis": "Medical observation allows the type of rupture to be assessed, and various tests are performed. The clinical history also helps to guide the diagnosis. Partial tears tend to be more difficult to diagnose. X-rays do not allow the tendons to be seen, but they can be useful in identifying other problems in the shoulder. Ultrasonography is also a test of interest in these cases. Magnetic resonance imaging allows images of the tendons to be obtained and enables the diagnosis of a partial or complete rupture.",
        "Treatment": "As noted, pain resulting from a rupture of the long biceps tendon improves over time. The lesser force or deformation of the arm may not be uncomfortable for older or less active patients. In these cases, treatment involves applying ice for 20-minute periods several times a day in order to reduce swelling and alleviate pain. It is best to never apply ice directly to the skin. Rest and the use of anti-inflammatories control pain and inflammation. A period of immobilization may be important. Physiotherapy helps restore flexibility and strength in the shoulder area. Surgery is rarely needed on a long tendon rupture. However, for athletes or professionals, surgery allows the tendon to be repaired and reinserted into the shoulder. Surgery is also useful for patients whose complaints do not improve with medical treatment. After surgery, the shoulder must be immobilized and a physiotherapy plan must be defined.",
        "Prevention": "Preventing overuse injuries is very important. This prevention is achieved through stretching and strength exercises and a proper warm-up program.

It can indicate several pathologies: poor voice placement, laryngopharyngeal reflux, inflammatory processes, benign and malignant tumors, among others. Hoarseness can be classified as functional or organic. Functional hoarseness is due to a change in the voice itself, with no anatomical changes to the vocal cords. Organic hoarseness involves lesions in the vocal cords caused by cysts, nodules or laryngopharyngeal reflux.",
        "Symptoms": "Hoarseness or dysphonia is not a disease but a symptom that can be present in different pathologies. It is a general theme that defines the change in the quality and power of the voice. The voice becomes less clear, with a lower tone and less audible. Generally benign, it tends to normalize within a few days. If it persists for more than two weeks, a medical consultation is recommended.",
        "Causes": "Viral infection of the upper respiratory tract, common in colds;/ Excessive use of voice;/ Gastroesophageal reflux: presence of stomach acid that refluxes through the esophagus and irritates the vocal cords;/ Smoking and other chemical irritants;/ Allergies, thyroid gland diseases, neurological disorders, rheumatoid arthritis and vocal cord trauma;/ Other conditions that should be excluded:benign and malignant tumorsmucosal dysplasiapapillomatosislaryngeal dystonia;/ benign and malignant tumors;/ mucosal dysplasia;/ in papillomas;/ laryngeal dystonia;/",
        "Diagnosis": "A complete history of hoarseness and the patient's general health is essential to characterize this condition and guide the diagnosis. Laryngoscopy is performed comfortably with a fiber optic device that incorporates a video camera that allows direct visualization of the larynx, vocal cords and neighboring structures involved in phonation. Laboratory tests, biopsy, X-ray or thyroid function tests may be requested depending on the clinical situation.",
        "Treatment": "It varies depending on the condition that causes it. It can be treated simply by resting your voice or by changing your vocal habits. Smoking cessation is a very important measure in the treatment of this condition. For all patients, it is recommended to avoid exposure to smoke and drink plenty of fluids. Surgery may be recommended if there are nodules, polyps or tumors in the larynx.",
        "Prevention": "Quit smoking;/ Avoid agents that dehydrate the body, such as alcohol or caffeine;/ Avoid second-hand smoke;/ Drink lots of water;/ Humidify the house;/ Be careful with your diet, avoiding spicy foods;/ Manage your vocal effort well;/ Cleveland Clinic Given the period we are living in and the request to stay at home, with our children collected and protected, we all have to play different roles.

    "Sacroileite": {
        "What is it?": "Sacroiliitis is an inflammatory lesion of the sacroiliac joints, which correspond to the articular junction between the sacrum bone of the spine and the iliac bone of the pelvis, connecting the lower part of the spine with the pelvis. This type of injury can trigger debilitating low back pain in amateur and professional athletes. This joint is not very mobile and its main function is to transmit force from the lower extremities to the spine. Your injury is the most common cause of low back pain in skiers.",
        "Symptoms": "In sacroiliitis, a local inflammatory process characterized by pain may occur, which can extend from the lumbar region to the thighs and legs, with stiffness and decreased range of motion. This pain can involve the groin and even the feet and worsens with standing for long periods of time, an imbalance of weight supported by both legs, climbing stairs and running. When associated with rheumatic diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis, sacroiliitis can be associated with complications such as difficulty breathing, spinal deformities, lung infections and heart problems.",
        "Causes": "Sacroiliitis can occur for a variety of reasons, such as trauma, after spinal surgery, rheumatic diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis or osteoarthritis, or infectious processes. The cyclical overload on the lower limbs transmitted to the pelvic region during the practice of impact and long-lasting sports, such as long-distance running, can affect this joint. A sudden impact trauma, such as a car accident or a fall, is another cause of sacroiliitis. During pregnancy, the sacroiliac joint tends to relax and stretch, which creates overload. Being overweight also increases the risk of developing sacroiliitis.",
        "Diagnosis": "Sacroiliitis can be difficult to diagnose, as it can be confused with other causes of low back pain. Diagnosis is made through physical examination, the patient's clinical history and imaging tests such as simple X-ray, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. The images can reveal the presence of bone sclerosis of the sacrum and iliac bone, irregularities in the joint contours, bone erosions and, in more advanced degrees, pseudo joint enlargement and even total ankylosis (fusion of the sacroiliac joint). Other imaging methods can also contribute to obtaining the diagnosis, such as bone scintigraphy.",
        "Treatment": "In general, treatment is conservative and involves physiotherapeutic measures, the use of analgesics, muscle relaxants, regional muscle strengthening exercises to prevent relapses, as well as the use of anti-inflammatories and corticosteroids, in specific situations, or even surgery. The type of treatment will depend on the severity of the symptoms and the cause of the sacroiliitis. If there is an associated rheumatic disease, it will be important to prescribe specific medications to treat that disease. Rest is important as well as performing exercises that provide joint stability and muscle strength. Other possible treatments include corticosteroid injections into the affected joint, the use of radiofrequency to destroy the nerve that causes the pain, electrical stimulation to reduce pain and surgery, with fusion of the joint in order to reduce its mobility and to reduce pain. This procedure is rarely used in sacroiliitis.",
        "Prevention": "The presence of sacroiliitis is not a reason to prevent you from practicing sports. The important thing is to know which exercises are most appropriate and which should be avoided. A good warm-up for 5 to 10 minutes before practicing sports is essential to prevent sacroiliitis from worsening. This warm-up can be done on a treadmill, an elliptical, or just walking. Performing extension exercises strengthens and increases joint flexibility. Low-impact exercises put little pressure on the joint. Good examples are swimming, walking on a treadmill or elliptical trainer, and water aerobics. Regular exercise helps reduce pain and improves general health, contributing to weight maintenance, preventing osteoarthritis, cancer, heart disease and diabetes. One possibility is to do one of the suggested physical activities for 30 minutes a day, five days a week.

    "Measles": {
        "What is it?": "Measles is one of the most contagious viral infections, it is transmitted when a person inhales microdroplets that are suspended in the air after being expelled by the cough of an infected individual. A person with measles is contagious two to four days before the rash appears and continues until it disappears. It is almost always a benign disease, although in some cases it can be serious or even fatal. Unvaccinated people who have never had contact with the virus have a high chance of contracting the disease. Given that its transmission is exclusively inter-human and the existence of an effective and safe vaccine, measles is a disease that can be eradicated, a fact that occurred on the American continent in 2002. The World Health Organization set 2007 as the target year for its elimination in Europe. In 2005 this target was changed to 2010 and the European Programme for the Elimination of Measles and Rubella and Prevention of Congenital Rubella was launched. Despite these efforts, the situation has worsened in recent years, with outbreaks occurring in most of the 29 European countries, totaling more than 32,000 cases in 2011. Currently, measles outbreaks typically occur in previously immunized adolescents and young adults, in children who have not been immunized, or in babies too young for the vaccine (less than 12 months of age). A woman who has had measles or who has been vaccinated passes this protection on to her child, and it lasts for almost the entire first year of life. After this time, susceptibility to the virus is high. However, the first infection protects the person for the rest of their life.",
        "Symptoms": "The incubation period for measles is eight to 13 days. Therefore, it is possible to be a carrier of the virus without knowing it. Contagion occurs approximately six days before and four days after the appearance of the first red patches on the skin. The initial symptoms are: Fever;/ Nasal congestion;/ Throat irritation;/ Dry cough;/ Redness of the eyes;/ After two to four days, tiny white spots (Koplik spots) appear in the mouth, which are not always detectable. After three to five days, measles causes a skin rash associated with mild itching, mainly on the ears and neck, with the appearance of irregular, flat, red surfaces that grow rapidly. After a day or two, this rash spreads to the trunk, arms, and legs, and begins to disappear from the face. At the peak of the disease, the patient feels very prostrate, the rash is extensive and the fever can exceed 40\u00baC. After three to five days, the temperature decreases, the symptoms ease, and the remaining spots disappear quickly.",
        "Causes": "It's Morbillivirus. Man is the only host of this virus, which is transmitted through the spread of droplets or through contact with secretions from the nose and throat of infected people (coughing and sneezing). Indirect transmission is difficult due to the low survival of the virus outside the host. In healthy, well-nourished children, measles is rarely serious. However, it can be complicated by bacterial infections, such as pneumonia (especially in babies), or a middle ear infection. Rarely, the number of platelets in the blood may decrease, resulting in bruising and bleeding. Brain infection (encephalitis) is a serious complication that occurs in about one in every 1,000 to 2,000 cases, causing high fever, seizures and coma, usually between two days and three weeks after the rash appears. This encephalitis can be brief, with recovery after about a week, but it can also cause brain damage or even death.",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of Measles is based on typical symptoms and the rash. No special tests are performed, except in cases of doubt, in which laboratory studies can be used.",
        "Treatment": "There are no specific medications to treat measles. The goal of treatment is to provide comfort and relief until symptoms disappear, which takes about two to three weeks. Therefore, it is important to control fever and muscle aches with acetaminophen, paracetamol or ibuprofen, rest, drink plenty of fluids, use a humidifier to relieve coughing and take vitamin A supplements. If a secondary bacterial infection develops, an antibiotic should be prescribed.",
        "Prevention": "The vaccine is one of the immunizations that are administered systematically in childhood, usually in conjunction with mumps and rubella. This is administered into the thigh muscle or upper arm. Currently, the first dose is recommended at 12 months and the second at five/six years, before compulsory schooling.

    "Sepsis": {
        "What is it?": "Sepsis is an extreme immune response to an infection, which can lead to organ failure and even death. In other words, it is our body's toxic and hyperactive response to a serious infection. Our immune system usually fights bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites to control infections. When infections take hold in our body, we often need antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals or antiparasitics to fight the infectious disease. However, sometimes the immune system cannot control the invading organisms and a generalized infection develops. This is the beginning of sepsis. Thus, in a person with sepsis, when faced with a serious infection, the immune system fights against itself, which can cause fatal damage to the body's tissues and organs. According to data from the Directorate-General for Health, 22% of admissions to Intensive Care Units are due to sepsis, resulting in an overall hospital mortality rate of around 40%. Mortality from the most severe forms of sepsis, such as septic shock, is around 51%.",
        "Symptoms": "Sepsis is diagnosed through a set of signs and symptoms during a serious infection: Fever above 38\u00baC;/ Profuse sweating (perspiration);/ Increased heart rate;/ Increased respiratory rate - panting;/ Chills or prostration;/  Sepsis can progress to a more serious form of the disease, in which the symptoms are: State of mental confusion;/ Nausea and vomiting;/ Decreased/absent urine output;/ Pale or blotchy skin;/ Changes in liver function;/ Lower than normal blood pressure;/  The sooner treatment for sepsis begins, the greater the chance of a successful cure.",
        "Causes": "It is not yet fully understood why the immune system can respond differently to an infection. It is thought that it may have to do with certain factors related to the patient in question and also the organism causing the infection, which may originate from: Bacterial infections (most common);/ Fungal and parasitic infections;/ Viral infections;/  The pathogen can enter the body through a wound or infection that may initially go unnoticed because it does not cause many symptoms. The most common initial sites of infection are the lungs, brain and urinary tract, but it can also affect the skin and other organs.",
        "Diagnosis": "In the diagnosis of sepsis, clinical and laboratory criteria are used in conjunction with severity indices, such as the criteria for Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS): body temperature above 38\u00baC or below 36\u00baC, increased respiratory rate, more than 20 breaths/minute, increased heart rate, more than 90 heartbeats/minute or a significant increase or decrease in the number of leukocytes in the blood; and the SOFA index - Sequential Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment, an assessment tool that focuses on organ dysfunction: respiratory failure presented, number of platelets in the blood, bilirubin, creatinine, cardiovascular rate, Glasgow coma scale classification and urine output. Although it is essential to treat sepsis as quickly as possible, early diagnosis is challenging, as many of the symptoms, such as fever, for example, occur alongside many other illnesses. The doctor should therefore try to know the patient's history, including any recent infections, any symptoms, and laboratory tests needed to identify the disease.",
        "Treatment": "After diagnosis, treatment of sepsis is based on treating the original cause of the infection, using: Antibiotics, if the infection is bacterial;/ Intravenous fluids and oxygen to ensure blood flow to organs;/ Supportive ventilation or other means of assisted breathing, if necessary;/ Surgical removal of damaged tissue if necessary;/  Among the groups most at risk of sepsis during an infection are the elderly, chronically ill people, newborns, and people with weak or compromised immune systems. For the elderly, the treatments to be administered can also prevent pressure ulcers or deep vein thrombosis. In Portugal, the use of protocols such as Via Verde da Sepsis allows for more effective diagnosis and therapy, such as hemodynamic stabilization of patients in septic shock. In this severe stage of sepsis, pharmacological substances such as fluid therapy are used to control hypotension.",
        "Prevention": "Taking steps to prevent infections or treating them promptly if they arise\u00a0can reduce your risk of getting sepsis. Preventing wounds or disinfecting them correctly if they occur, as well as washing your hands thoroughly and seeking immediate medical help if there are signs of a worsening infection. Early treatment of sepsis can be effective, but the disease can progress, becoming difficult to treat. Patients who have suffered from sepsis may also experience long-term effects on their health, such as tiredness and inability to perform different activities.

    "AIDS human immunodeficiency virus": {
        "What is it?": "AIDS is a clinical condition resulting from HIV infection, of which two types are known: HIV 1 and HIV 2. It is a disease that is transmitted through blood and sexual contact - which is why anyone can be infected - in which HIV invades the blood cells responsible for defending the body against other infections and some tumors, compromising them. a. In a patient with greatly reduced defenses, even a simple infection can become fatal. The first cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) were reported in the 1980s and, currently, according to the World Health Organization, it is estimated that there are around 36.9 million people infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Regarding the national panorama, \u201cby the end of 2017, 57,913 cases of HIV infection were cumulatively diagnosed in Portugal, of which 22,102 reached the AIDS stage\u201d - HIV and AIDS Infection Report from the Reference and Epidemiological Surveillance Unit of the Department of Infectious Diseases from the National Institute of Health Doutor Ricardo Jorge, in collaboration with the National Program for HIV Infection and AIDS of the Directorate-General for Health.",
        "Symptoms": "HIV infection at the beginning is barely noticeable because the symptoms are mild and can be confused with the flu or a common virus. In around 30% of cases, a short, feverish period with no special characteristics occurs 10 to 15 days after infection, as if it were the flu. After infection, AIDS has a long period of silent evolution without causing the slightest disturbance or complaint. This is the period during which the virus takes hold, begins to invade and destroy lymphocytes (the cells responsible for our defences) and to multiply. During this phase, the body compensates for this loss of cells by increasing its production and trying to eliminate the virus. Its duration is very variable (on average 8 to 10 years) and depends on the intensity and severity of the infection, the body's defence capacity and the occurrence of other diseases that reduce the defence capacity. During this period, the patient is referred to as being a carrier of the virus or HIV-positive, since the tests carried out at this stage can identify its presence. Even without signs of illness, an HIV carrier can infect anyone with whom they have sexual contact. At the end of this long silent phase, the body's defenses collapse and all the complications that define AIDS appear: Infections caused by common microorganisms that are more serious here;/ Infections by rarer agents;/ Some types of cancer that, under normal conditions, would not be able to develop;/",
        "Causes": "For HIV to develop and proliferate and thus cause disease, it must have access to the bloodstream, since outside, outside the cells, it is quickly destroyed. The main forms of transmission of this virus are as follows: Blood products and derivatives. This route is currently very rare because all blood donors undergo laboratory tests for this virus.;/ Use of contaminated needles. This scenario is impossible in healthcare facilities, where all needles are disposable, but it can occur in the context of drug addiction through the sharing of syringes and needles. Thanks to various information measures, this route of transmission has been substantially reduced.;/ Sexual contact. Any unprotected sexual relationship, heterosexual (the most common form of transmission in Portugal, which corresponds to around 60% of cases) or homosexual, can be a form of transmission of this virus.;/ Pregnancy. It is possible for an infected pregnant woman to transmit the virus to her children. Appropriate treatment during pregnancy significantly reduces this risk. Infection at the time of birth or during breastfeeding is much less likely.;/",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis is simple and is based on the analysis of saliva or blood where antibodies against HIV can be found. Generally, these tests are still negative in the first few weeks after infection. However, new tests have been developed that allow for faster diagnosis, in the first few days after infection, which is important, as the earlier the infection is detected, the more effective the treatment will be. In addition to confirming the presence of infection, laboratory tests are important in defining the progression of AIDS and selecting the best medications to treat it.",
        "Treatment": "There is still no cure for AIDS. It is a virus with an enormous capacity for multiplication and which undergoes numerous mutations that make treatment difficult because they often make the virus resistant to current medications. The number of medications available to control this infection is currently very significant and, in most cases, it is possible to maintain a good quality of life for a long time. The effectiveness of the treatment depends on the early diagnosis and regular medical control that makes it possible to assess, at each moment, the maintenance of the response to the selected medications.",
        "Prevention": "There is still no effective vaccine against this virus. In prevention, risk groups should not be considered, but rather risk behaviors, and therefore, correct information and the use of common sense allow, in many cases, to keep this virus at bay. Prevention includes adopting measures such as: Condom use;/ Avoid direct contact with blood or blood products;/ Take the HIV test;/ AIDS Portugal, 2013 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, abril de 2012 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, agosto de 2012 National Institute of Health Dr. Ricardo Jorge National Program for HIV/AIDS Infection RSV infection can progress to bronchiolitis or pneumonia.

    "Syphilis": {
        "What is it?": "Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. It initially manifests itself as small ulcers on the skin, located on the genitals, mouth or anus, but can remain without signs for a long time after infection, which makes it easier for sexual partners to spread the disease. Syphilis represents a public health problem, being a notifiable disease, which also causes restrictions on blood donation, due to the risk of contamination of donated blood. Syphilis has three phases, separated by variable periods of latency, and if left untreated it can cause serious complications in the heart, brain, eyes and other organs. However, if the diagnosis is made early in the infection, treatment is curative. In pregnant women, screening is essential, due to the risk of transmission to the baby, in the form of congenital syphilis, which can cause miscarriage, premature birth and serious illness at birth, including deafness, neurological changes and bone deformities in the baby.",
        "Stages and symptoms of syphilis": "1.After infection, the primary phase of syphilis is one of the most important for diagnosis. The first signs appear between one week and three months after contact with the bacteria and, sometimes, are not noticed by the person himself. Injuries or ulcers - sometimes just one - do not cause pain or discomfort and can be underestimated. If treatment is not given, after a few days or weeks the lesions disappear, giving a sense of false security: syphilis is still present, progresses to the secondary phase and can continue to be transmitted to other people. Laboratory diagnosis and treatment to eliminate the infection are always necessary, although there may be no visible lesions.  2. The secondary phase of syphilis appears between one and six months after the disappearance of the initial lesions. It is characterized by areas of irritation or rash that can appear on any part of the body, including the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. It can also be manifested by small pimples or warts in the mouth, genitals or anus, usually accompanied by other symptoms: Fever;;/ Fatigue and muscle pain;;/ Weight loss;;/ Headaches;;/ Hair loss;;/ Inflammation of the lymph nodes.;/  Secondary phase rashes may also not cause severe pain or discomfort, especially if there are no associated symptoms, and disappear after a few weeks. However, syphilis remains transmissible for up to two years or more after initial infection. Symptoms may appear and disappear several times over this period, making diagnosis and treatment essential. If treatment is not given, the disease enters a latent phase that can last for several years, reaching more than two decades.  3. Tertiary syphilis, which appears if the infection is not treated or is not eliminated by the immune system itself, progresses to more serious and, sometimes, irreversible symptoms and consequences. 20% or more of untreated patients progress to the tertiary phase. Once the bacteria settles in certain organs, if the infection reaches this level, its manifestations directly affect the affected organs. Thus, in addition to the treatment for tertiary syphilis being more complex, there may be serious sequelae, with slow progression: Neurological damage, dementia or cognitive problems;;/ Heart disease;;/ Motor difficulties and muscular problems;;/ Seizures or neurological disease;;/ Vision problems or blindness.;/",
        "Causes of syphilis": "Sexual intercourse without the use of barrier protection methods, such as condoms, is the main way of transmitting syphilis vaginally, anally or orally. The infection can also arise through cuts in the skin or mucous membranes, through contact with skin lesions or genitals of infected patients, through blood with contaminated blood and transmission from mother to child during pregnancy or during childbirth. When a person with the disease has a small lesion caused by syphilis, contact between this affected area and their partner allows the bacteria to pass to a new organism, spreading through the bloodstream. After the initial stages, syphilis can remain dormant for decades, or slowly deteriorate the organs where the infection has taken hold. Blood contamination is another risk associated with bacterial infection, which is why blood donation is not allowed when there is a positive diagnosis, or suspended in the case of suspicion, until complete treatment or diagnostic tests are carried out.",
        "Diagnosis": "Accompanied by research into each person's medical and sexual history, the doctor diagnoses syphilis based on laboratory analyzes (it does not depend on the existence of symptoms of the disease) that confirm infection with the bacteria Treponema pallidum. Blood tests are the most common method of diagnosing syphilis. There are also rapid blood tests that are used to rule out this disease and HIV infection, given that co-infection is frequent. Given the danger of contagion, anyone can and should be tested for syphilis after risky sexual activity, such as unprotected acts, or if they are suspected of having an infection. As the consequences for babies are serious, during pregnancy, screening for syphilis (and other diseases, STIs or not) is always carried out both at the beginning and at the end of pregnancy.",
        "Syphilis treatment": "In the initial phase of the infection, syphilis is treated with antibiotics, particularly penicillin. The longer the infection progresses - especially in the tertiary phase - the longer antibiotic treatment should be continued. During treatment, the patient must abstain from sexual intercourse, and after this time there is also a period of abstinence prescribed by the doctor. Furthermore, as the contagious period is around two years, all sexual partners must be informed, so that they can also undergo tests, receive treatment if necessary, and inform other people in order to break the chain of transmission. Like other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), combating syphilis is a public health issue.",
        "Syphilis prevention": "As there is no vaccine to prevent syphilis, reducing the risk of this and other STDs essentially involves taking extra care in sexual relations and avoiding risky behaviors. Sexually active people should always use condoms correctly and test themselves for the disease in case of suspicion or diagnostic information from a partner, in order to reduce the risk of contagion.

    "Bilateral upper thoracic sympathectomy": {
        "30-minute surgery ends excessive sweating and facial flushing": "Thoracic sympathectomy is the only definitive treatment for hyperhidrosis, a disease that consists of an exaggerated and unnecessary increase in sweating and affects the hands, feet and armpits. It is estimated that around one and a half (1.5%) percent of the population suffers from this disease in Portugal. Many of the patients also suffer from pathological facial flushing, which is characterized by the uncontrolled and involuntary appearance of facial flushing, described by patients as an explosion of heat, with a negative impact on their professional activity and social relationships. The definitive treatment for hyperhidrosis and facial flushing is performed through bilateral upper thoracic sympathectomy, a simple surgery performed by videothoracoscopy, in a minimally invasive way, with a single incision less than 1 cm below the armpit, with ablation of the sympathetic nerve in cases of hyperhidrosis and with the new technique for treating facial flushing, Endoscopic ThoracicSympathectomy by Clamping (ETS-C), in which a titanium clip is applied to the sympathetic nerve. The surgery is performed in the operating room under general anesthesia, lasts less than 30 minutes and the patient can return to their daily and professional activities after two or three days.

    "Economy Class Syndrome": {
        "What is it?": "Economy class syndrome describes the clinical situation of deep vein thrombosis that occurs during or after a long flight, with little space for movement of the lower limbs, causing a blood clot that obstructs a deep vein. The clot formed can partially or completely block blood flow in the vessels and most often occurs in the lower leg, thigh or pelvis. Less frequently, it can also occur in other areas such as the arm, brain, intestine, liver or kidney.",
        "Symptoms": "Symptoms may include swelling, pain and tenderness, and redness of the skin, usually on the legs. If a severe case of pulmonary embolism develops, shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain, feeling faint, rapid heartbeat, sweating and coughing may occur.",
        "Causes": "In air travel, factors other than prolonged immobility may be involved (but it has not been definitively proven that they are): reduced pressure in the cabin, lower oxygen levels in the plane and mild dehydration due to not drinking enough water. It must be emphasized that the vast majority of travelers do not experience any problems.",
        "Diagnosis": "In addition to examining the patient and their complaints and clinical history, additional diagnostic tests include: Venous ultrasound (shows blood flow in the veins and any blood clots);;/ Venography (contrast material is injected into the veins so that the clot can be seen on the X-ray).;/  Other tests include: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or magnetic resonance venography (MRV);;/ Computed tomography (CT).;/ The\u00a0diagnosis of DVT in the abdomen or in the pelvis and lung can also be used. Following the investigation, blood tests may be necessary.",
        "Treatment": "Most of the time, medication is sufficient and includes anticoagulant drugs (which can prevent the clot from developing or getting worse). In severe cases, hospitalization is necessary.",
        "Prevention": "The risk of DVT caused by travel is small, however it is sensible to try to reduce it, particularly if you have a known risk factor. When traveling intercontinentally, particularly by plane, you should exercise your leg muscles regularly (every half hour), stretch and curl your toes and the foot itself while sitting; walk along the plane's aisle when the crew allows it; drink plenty of water (to avoid dehydration); do not drink too much alcohol; consider using elastic stockings; and some people at high risk may be advised to take hypocoagulant medication.

    "Stiff person syndrome": {
        "What is it?": "Stiff person syndrome is an extremely rare autoimmune neurological condition - although its exact incidence is unknown, it is estimated to affect about one person in every million. Two of its most characteristic symptoms are muscle stiffness and muscle spasms associated with pain. There are different types of stiff person syndrome, defined based on their physical and clinical manifestations, but the most common is classic stiff person syndrome. This syndrome appears most frequently between the ages of 30 and 60, but cases have been recorded in both children and older adults. It can affect people of both sexes, although women have twice the risk of developing the syndrome compared to men. Stiff person syndrome is associated with other autoimmune diseases, such as: Celiac disease;/ Type 1 Diabetes;/ Pernicious anemia;/ Autoimmune thyroid disease;/ Vitiligo;/",
        "Symptoms of Stiff Person Syndrome": "The severity of symptoms of stiff person syndrome varies from case to case and, although the most common age for symptoms to develop is between 30 and 40 years of age, they can appear at any stage of life. They can also develop over a period of months to years and in some people the symptoms remain unchanged for years. In addition, symptoms can slowly worsen over time, limiting the ability to perform daily routine activities. Stiff person syndrome has as its main symptoms muscular stiffness and repeated episodes of painful muscle spasms. Spasms can involve the entire body or just one region and occur without any defined cause or be triggered by situations/events such as: Unexpected or very loud noise;/ Physical contact;/ Temperature changes, such as cold environments;/ High stress situations;/  Muscle spasms can be so severe that they dislocate joints or cause bone fractures and/or last only a few seconds, minutes, or occasionally a few hours. Because muscle spasms can be unpredictable, some people with stiff person syndrome develop anxiety and agoraphobia (an extreme fear of, for example, leaving the house or going to places with lots of people). However, it is important to note that initial symptoms may include discomfort with associated pain, stiffness (which may come and go, gradually becoming constant) or pain, especially in the lower back or legs. In most cases, the first area of \u200b\u200bthe body to be affected by stiffness is the trunk (i.e. the abdomen, back and chest). As stiff person syndrome progresses, stiffness develops in the leg muscles and neurological stiffness, which is typically asymmetrical (i.e., more pronounced in one leg). Other possible symptoms of stiff person syndrome include: Posture changes;/ Mobility difficulties;/ Stress anxiety;/ Potential respiratory complications;/",
        "Causes": "The exact causes of stiff person syndrome are not known, but the scientific community describes it as an autoimmune condition (that is, where the immune system attacks healthy cells for unknown reasons). Many people with stiff-person syndrome have been found to produce a type of antibody, glutamic acid decarboxylase, which plays a role in the production of a neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid, which helps control muscle movement. However, the exact role of this antibody in the development and progression of stiff-person syndrome is not yet understood, nor does its presence necessarily indicate disease. In addition, there are other types of antibodies that may be associated with stiff-person syndrome, such as the glycine receptor. Another scenario is that of having stiff-person syndrome but not having detectable antibodies that are already known. Research into potential antibodies is ongoing.",
        "Diagnosis": "Because it is rare and involves symptoms similar to other diseases\u2014such as tetanus, ankylosing spondylitis, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, fibromyalgia, anxiety, psychosomatic illness, and other autoimmune conditions\u2014stiff person syndrome is difficult to diagnose. In fact, it takes an average of seven years to diagnose. There is no single test that allows diagnosing this condition and, therefore, in addition to asking questions about the symptoms and carrying out a physical and neurological examination, the attending physician may use several tests to confirm the diagnosis, such as: Blood tests to detect glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies, which are present in around 70-80% of people with this syndrome. Blood tests can also be used to detect other relevant antibodies as well as other signs that can confirm the diagnosis or exclude other diseases. However, it is important to take into account that the presence of high levels of these antibodies does not alone determine the diagnosis of stiff person syndrome.;/ Electromyography: is an exam that studies the electrical activity of muscles.;/ Lumbar puncture: consists of collecting cerebrospinal fluid to check for the presence of glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies.;/",
        "Treatment of stiff person syndrome": "There is not yet a cure for stiff person syndrome, but treatment can help not only manage individual symptoms, but also slow the progression of this problem. If left untreated, stiff person syndrome can progress, causing difficulty in moving around and significantly impacting the performance of daily tasks. It can also lead to serious complications. The clinical team that monitors the patient is multidisciplinary and may include specialists such as neurologists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists and mental health specialists, such as clinical psychologists. The treatment of stiff person syndrome is symptomatic and has the main objective of promoting mobility and comfort. In some people, their symptoms stabilize with medication, which aims to help reduce stiffness and painful muscle spasms. Medications may include: Benzodiazepines: These are used to treat muscle stiffness and episodic spasms.;/ Muscle relaxants: These can help relieve muscle spasms.;/ Medications for neuropathic pain.;/ Anticonvulsants: medicines traditionally used in diseases with seizures and which can help with pain management.;/  Medications such as tricyclic antidepressants, opioids and serotonin reuptake inhibitors should be avoided.  Immunotherapy can also be a therapeutic option and consists of the use of medication or other interventions that target specific abnormalities in the functioning of the immune system. There is some evidence to show that intravenous treatment with immunoglobulin (natural antibodies that the immune system produces and which, for this therapy, are obtained from donors with healthy immune systems) can, in some cases, improve symptoms.  Other non-pharmacological therapies that may also be helpful: Physiotherapy;/ Stretching;/ Massage;/ Hydrotherapy;/ Heat therapy;/ Acupuncture;/ Yoga;/ Meditation;/  Additionally, psychotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy or medication may be prescribed to treat anxiety and depression. The prognosis of the disease varies from person to person based on a number of factors, including: Severity of symptoms;/ Speed \u200b\u200bof disease progression;/ Treatment effectiveness;/  Over time, walking may become progressively more difficult and some patients may need the assistance of a cane, walker or wheelchair. There may also be a gradual increase in difficulty in performing daily tasks and an increased risk of falls. Starting treatment soon after the onset of symptoms is essential to prevent or slow the progression of stiff person syndrome and avoid long-term complications, improving patients' quality of life.",

    "Restless Leg Syndrome": {
        "What is it?": "It is a chronic and progressive disease with a significant impact on patients' quality of life. It is not always well defined by patients who may refer to it as a feeling of discomfort in the legs, not painful, accompanied by an irresistible desire to move them. In some cases, complaints also affect the arms. There are two types of restless legs syndrome. The most common is primary, with no identifiable cause and probably with a genetic component. This tends to be chronic. Over time, symptoms worsen and occur more frequently. In milder cases, there may be long periods of asymptomatic time. The secondary type is caused by another disease or medical condition and some medications. Symptoms usually disappear when the patient recovers from the underlying illness or stops the medication that caused restless legs syndrome. The prevalence of this syndrome is not well known, with studies suggesting values \u200b\u200bbetween 0.1% and 15.3%. This incidence tends to increase with age. The severity of the complaints and the speed of their progression appear to be greater when the disease first manifests itself later in life. It is more common in females and more common in pregnant women, especially in the last three months of pregnancy, generally improving or disappearing a few weeks after giving birth. In some cases, symptoms may persist.",
        "Symptoms": "Symptoms generally appear or worsen when the patient is at rest and tend to disappear with movement. This means that they worsen at night, especially when the patient lies down, and movements of the feet and fingers are also visible when the patient is sitting. This restlessness can be falsely interpreted as nervousness. Sometimes, this disorder can also be confused with certain rhythmic and repetitive movements that occur when the person is distracted or tense. These symptoms can cause difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep. Around 80% of people with this syndrome experience periodic limb movements during sleep that tend to occur every 20 to 30 seconds, causing awakenings that interrupt sleep and affect its quality. As a result, tiredness and drowsiness during the day, increased irritability, difficulty managing stress, symptoms of depression, and difficulty concentrating and remembering are common. Given the need to move the legs, tasks such as long journeys and leisure activities become almost impossible. Movements usually occur bilaterally, but may be predominant on one side. More rarely and in more serious situations, this complaint may appear in other parts of the body such as the hips, trunk, arms and face.",
        "Causes": "The most common causes are pregnancy, terminal renal failure and iron deficiency anemia - this deficit causes changes in dopamine synthesis with consequent changes in the functioning of neurons that use dopamine as a neurotransmitter. Other diseases associated with this syndrome are diabetes, Parkinson's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, magnesium deficiency, sleep apnea, thyroid disease, Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome and celiac disease. On the other hand, there are aggravating factors, such as the consumption of alcohol, nicotine, coffee, and some medications (antiemetics, antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, antihistamines, among others).",
        "Diagnosis": "This syndrome is usually diagnosed only after several years of symptoms in middle-aged adults. Some of them already had symptoms since childhood that may have been interpreted as growing pains or hyperactivity. The diagnosis tends to be clinical and is based on a set of symptoms: an irresistible urge to move the legs, worsening with rest, temporary relief with movement and worsening in the late afternoon and early evening. However, there are additional tests that can help confirm the condition and rule out other conditions. Some laboratory tests may be requested, with particular emphasis on those that assess iron metabolism, which analyse fasting blood glucose, magnesium, urea and creatinine, and a pregnancy test. Sleep studies can detect abnormal and periodic movements of the limbs, which helps confirm the diagnosis, especially since this disease is usually accompanied by sleep disorders, as the patient has difficulty initiating sleep and/or maintaining a restful sleep.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment for this syndrome should be adjusted on a case-by-case basis, depending on the associated factors and the severity of the symptoms. Therapy should aim to alleviate its manifestations and improve the quality of life of people with this clinical condition. Good sleep hygiene (find the best time to sleep and wake up and try to maintain it every day), physical activity, massages and hot baths, avoiding stimulants such as caffeine, tobacco and alcohol as well as the use of medications that worsen symptoms are some important aspects of treatment. If there is an iron deficiency, it must be treated. In this case, it is important to combine vitamin C to improve absorption. There are several medications that can be useful in treating this disease. Its selection must always be made by the doctor, depending on each situation. Some of the drug classes of interest are dopaminergic agents, opioids, anticonvulsants, and benzodiazepines.",
        "Prevention": "It is a chronic condition that cannot be prevented and for which there is no cure. The treatments and general measures indicated help to minimize manifestations and increase asymptomatic periods. However, symptoms can worsen with age.

        "Symptoms": "It manifests itself in the form of a vast set of physical and psychological characteristics, of which the following stand out: Delay in motor acquisition (sitting, walking);/ Difficulty walking with an unbalanced gait (legs spread apart and stretched out);/ Absence of speech;/ Lack of attention and hyperactivity;/ Affectionate nature with easy and frequent laughter;/ It sounds choppy and difficult;/ Reduction in the size of the head and flattening of its posterior portion, large mouth with protruding tongue, prominent chin, thin upper lip, separated teeth;/ Reduced skin pigmentation, with fair skin, fine blond hair and light eyes;/ Strabismus;/ Deviation in the spine (scoliosis);/ Epileptic seizures, especially absences;/ Throughout life, these patients become less excitable and sleep problems tend to improve, but intellectual deficits, speech difficulties and seizures tend to persist. Life expectancy is normal.",
        "Causes": "The cause of this syndrome is the absence or dysfunction of a gene, called UBE3A. In most cases, it is not inherited from the parents and the genetic abnormality that causes it occurs by chance. However, there are families with more than one affected member, which suggests that this disorder can be transmitted. In around 10% to 15% of situations, the cause is not known and may result from anomalies in other genes or chromosomes.",
        "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis is determined by genetics and medical and neurological examination. However, this syndrome can be confused with other disorders, such as childhood autism or cerebral palsy. Electroencephalogram, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging can provide some additional elements, but genetic studies are the most important, allowing in around 80% of cases to confirm the existence of a deficiency in one of the chromosomes 15. In the remaining 20%, it is based only on clinical data and other complementary exams, with the genetic study not being conclusive. An early and correct diagnosis allows us to anticipate the occurrence of some of the problems characteristic of this disease, such as sleep disorders and seizures, enabling better control. It also helps to define the most appropriate rehabilitation measures (physiotherapy, speech therapy, occupational therapy) for each case. Another advantage is that it provides guidance to parents regarding the risk of this syndrome recurring in the family.",
        "Treatment": "There is no cure, but some of the symptoms can be minimized. Epilepsy can be controlled through medication, and physiotherapy can stimulate the joints and prevent stiffness. Occupational therapy helps improve fine motor skills, and speech therapy can help improve vocal performance.",

    "Asperger's syndrome": {
        "What is it?": "Asperger syndrome is considered an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) with a milder expression. It is noteworthy that in the latest revision of the most accepted diagnostic manual for neurodevelopmental disorders (DSM-5, 2013), the designation Asperger syndrome disappeared as a diagnosis. However, the concept continues to make sense. Children with Asperger syndrome share the challenges in communication, social interaction and behavior that characterize ASD. However, they do not have significant language delays and show normal or even above-average cognitive levels in some areas. This syndrome is much more common than classic autism. While this affects about four in every 10,000 children, Asperger's syndrome affects 20 to 25 in every 10,000. In Portugal it is estimated that there are around 40 thousand people with this syndrome, which is more common in boys than in girls (around 10 to one).",
        "Symptoms": "The most typical manifestations of Asperger's syndrome are: Difficulty maintaining comfortable eye contact and using it dynamically in conjunction with other forms of communication;/ Challenges in decoding messages beyond explicit verbal content, in relation to tone of voice, second meanings, irony, humor, facial and body expression. These signals are fundamental clues to inferring other people's thoughts, feelings and intentions.;/ There may be little initiative in communication and/or communication may be too focused on topics of interest and one's own perspective, with little opportunity for others to participate. The person with this condition has difficulty assessing the other person's real interest in the conversation, which may become too long and boring for the listener; great importance may be given to details that are of no interest to most people.;/ There are frequent topics of marked interest, which dominate conversations or activities;/ Routine is appreciated and changes can cause anxiety and some instability in behavior.;/ Sensory sensitivities may exist, particularly in relation to noise, with discomfort with sounds that do not affect most other people;/ Some degree of motor incoordination is common, which affects dexterity and involvement in sport;/ It should be noted that the expression of Asperger's Syndrome in females takes on slightly different characteristics, such as: they have greater ease with eye contact, they use more specific adjustment strategies to mitigate/disguise discomfort in social situations, they have an easier time imitating socially acceptable behaviors and can take refuge in a fantasy world. Some girls prefer to get involved in games that are more active from a motor point of view and not so dependent on communication and language (more difficult), and can be considered \u201cboys\u201d. In both sexes, there is a higher prevalence of other neurodevelopmental conditions such as attention deficit, tic disorder, anxiety and depression, which need to be recognized and treated. Over time, the challenges faced by children and young people with Asperger Syndrome interfere with their relationships and integration with peers, the development of friendships and, later, their integration into the workplace.",
        "Causes": "The causes of Asperger's Syndrome are not specifically known, assuming the preponderance of genetic factors, already present at birth, as occurs in ASD in general. The genes that have been identified are involved in brain development, influencing the transmission of signals between neurons and the way information is processed.",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of Asperger's Syndrome is clinical, that is, it is based on the history and observation of the individual's behavior, using developmental assessments and structured interviews. It is important that this assessment is careful and carried out by professionals with experience in the area, otherwise it could produce excessive diagnoses in people who only have a few different behavioral traits (a certain \u201cway\u201d), but without enough symptoms or repercussions to receive a diagnosis. .",
        "Treatment": "Treatment for Asperger's Syndrome aims to help individuals and those around them to achieve better adjustment by developing social skills, understanding their own emotions and those of others, diversifying interests, coping better with change and managing anxiety and behaviors. The context and way in which the intervention program is organized depends on the profile and needs of the individual, as well as the resources available. When there are associated conditions such as attention deficit, anxiety disorders or obsessive rituals, specific medication may be indicated in order to obtain better control of symptoms and greater success in other interventions. In general, the support and understanding of family, friends, teachers and colleagues is essential, as well as maintaining a structured environment.",

    "Guillain-Barre Syndrome": {
        "What is it?": "Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome is a rare autoimmune disease that can lead to damage to myelin, the insulating layer of nerves (demyelination), or, in peripheral nerves, to degeneration of axons - the part of the nerve responsible for conducting nerve impulses. As it is an autoimmune disease, the reason for its occurrence is not fully known. The main symptoms are tingling and lack of strength in the hands, feet and legs and, if this condition progresses, it can lead to paralysis of the muscles throughout the body and the inability to breathe. This means that Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome is, in its most severe form, a hospital emergency and requires admission to the intensive care unit for treatment. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome can affect anyone, of any age or gender, although it is more common in adults and the elderly than in children. It is estimated that it affects one in every 100,000 people per year, and although there is no cure, treatment of this syndrome offers full recovery for the majority of patients.",
        "Symptoms of Guillain-Barre syndrome": "The symptoms of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome usually begin as mild, with a tingling sensation in the limbs - most commonly in the legs. The evolution of symptoms can take hours, days or weeks and in the most serious cases cause total paralysis of the muscles. Symptoms include: Tingling in the hands, feet, fingers, ankles and wrists.;/ Flaccid paralysis, that is, paralysis or muscle weakness and loss of muscle tone for no apparent reason.;/ Areflexia, that is, absence of reflexes.;/ Difficulty walking and climbing stairs or unsteadiness in the way you walk.;/ Difficulty performing facial movements, such as chewing and swallowing or speaking.;/ Inability to move the eyes or double vision.;/ Incontinence or problems controlling the bladder and bowel system.;/ Difficulty breathing.;/  The death of a small percentage of patients at an early stage of the disease is due to organ failure or dysautonomia, a situation in which there is a lack of control over the functions of vital organs (for example, heartbeat, temperature control, etc.). The causes of death in late stages of the disease's development usually arise following complications related to prolonged immobilization and bacterial infections.",
        "Causes": "The cause is not fully known and is described as autoimmune. However, two-thirds of patients with this syndrome have had an infection (e.g. respiratory, gastrointestinal, Zika virus or COVID-19 virus) in the previous six weeks. In rare cases there is a relationship between the onset of the disease and taking a vaccine. In these cases, symptoms appear a few weeks after vaccination, however, evidence shows that it is more likely (within the rare prevalence of this syndrome) to develop this syndrome from flu than from flu vaccination.",
        "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis depends mainly on clinical evaluation. Since the symptoms are similar to those of other diseases (such as botulism, polio, metabolic neuropathies, among others), tests can be performed to rule out infectious diseases and immune dysfunction (tests for hepatitis, HIV). Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is also important, as patients with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome have higher levels of protein and fewer white blood cells in this fluid than normal \u2014 this information may only become relevant in the ten days following the onset of symptoms. Electromyography is also a fundamental test in the diagnosis of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, but may present normal results at an early stage. As the clinical picture progresses, electromyography should show slowing of nerve conduction and increased latency or even absence of responses. The suspected diagnosis of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome requires the patient to be hospitalized and undergo nerve conduction tests and electromyography (electrodiagnostics). In this examination it is found that the reflexes in the knees and, sometimes, in the arms cease to exist because the nerve signals that travel through the nerves are slow.",
        "Treatment of Guillain-Barre syndrome": "There are effective treatments for Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, although full recovery may take some time. However, 80 to 85 percent of patients make a full recovery. Constant monitoring of the patient and support of vital functions are important and, as such, the patient is generally monitored in intensive care. The following can be used in treatment: Immunomodulation, i.e. administration of intravenous immunoglobulin. If performed early, it produces a beneficial effect up to one month after the onset of the disease. The presence of more immunoglobulin in the blood leads to a decrease in the immune system's aggression towards the nervous system. The advantage of immunomodulation, in relation to plasmapheresis, is that it is easier to apply, being a less invasive procedure.;/ Plasmapheresis, or the separation of the liquid and solid components of the blood to replace the liquid component of the blood. This treatment is usually chosen when the administration of immunoglobulin has not been effective. Removing and replacing the plasma slows the progression of the disease, reduces the length of hospital stay, the mortality rate and the possibility of permanent paralysis.;/  Once the patient is stabilised, physiotherapy plays an important role in strengthening the muscles, preventing or minimising after-effects. Even during hospitalisation, physical therapy work is carried out by doctors and the physiotherapy team, which involves, for example, changing the posture and position of the limbs and moving the joints manually, to avoid major after-effects. Recovery after hospitalisation allows the patient to regain quality of life after the illness.",
        "Prevention": "As the cause of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome is not completely known, there is no prevention, but it is important to emphasize that, with the first symptoms, it is essential to consult a doctor, so that the disease does not progress to a serious condition.

    "Raynaud's syndrome": {
        "What is it?": "Called Raynaud's syndrome or Raynaud's disease, it especially affects the capillaries in the fingers and toes. This pathology is manifested by vasospasm, in response to cold or stressful situations: the capillaries narrow and the circulation of blood or oxygen in these areas decreases. As a result, the fingers, or other affected areas, turn white and can then evolve into a bluish hue. These episodes are reversible, taking, on average, around 15 minutes for the blood vessels to dilate again and blood circulation to be reestablished. It is possible to distinguish between two types of Raynaud's syndrome depending on whether or not there is a disease, condition or lifestyle that causes Raynaud's syndrome.  Most of these cases are diagnosed in childhood or adolescence and the episodes are not serious, as they do not cause damage to the capillaries or the skin in the affected area. When the patient has high blood pressure, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease or diabetes, the episodes of vasospasm may be aggravated.  It is rarer and most cases are diagnosed after the age of 30. It is linked to autoimmune or vascular occlusive diseases. Secondary Raynaud's is characterized by episodes of vasospasm of greater intensity, painful and capable of causing ischemic injuries, that is, problems arising from blood and oxygen deprivation in that area (skin ulcers and gangrene, which can result, in extreme cases, in amputation). digital).",
        "Symptoms of Raynaud's syndrome": "Vasospasm episodes are triggered by cold or stressful situations. The body's natural response to cold is increased vasoconstriction as a strategy to conserve heat in the body. However, during an episode of vasospasm, vasoconstriction in the toes, hands, and sometimes the nose, ears, lips, and tongue is extreme, causing: Change in skin color: As blood circulation stops and resumes, the affected area may turn white, blue, and pink. Some people only go through one or two of these stages and not all three.;/ Cold and numb skin: when a certain area of \u200b\u200bthe body does not receive blood or oxygen in ideal quantities, it becomes cold and has little sensitivity. Some people describe this situation by saying that this area of \u200b\u200bthe body has \u201cfallen asleep\u201d.;/ Tingling: when blood circulation and oxygen supply resume, some stinging sensations are felt on the skin, a kind of tingling sensation.;/ Skin ulcers or gangrene: in the most severe cases (associated with secondary Raynaud's), long and severe episodes may occur, which are probably painful. Skin lesions, ulcers and even the death of some tissues may occur, causing gangrene.;/",
        "Causes": "Primary Raynaud's syndrome is not linked to any specific cause. Cases show that it affects mostly women and people with a family history of Raynaud's syndrome. The condition is also more common in people who live in cold climates. Secondary Raynaud's syndrome is linked to diseases, conditions or the patient's lifestyle. Some of the factors are: Autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, overlap syndrome, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, undifferentiated connective tissue disease and vasculitis, CREST syndrome, mixed connective tissue disease).;/ Occlusive vascular diseases (arteriosclerosis, atheroembolism, thromboangiitis obliterans).;/ Other diseases such as polycythemia, paraproteinemia and cryoglobulinemia, carpal tunnel syndrome.;/ Use of certain medications or drugs (beta blockers, bleomycin, cisplatin, cyclosporine, nicotine, vinblastine, amphetamines, cocaine).;/ Vibrations such as those caused by the use of pneumatic hammers.;/ Vascular trauma or frostbite.;/  In both cases, episodes of vasospasm can be triggered by: Exposure to cold weather or strong air conditioning.;/ Contact with the inside of a freezer or with cold or icy objects.;/ Anxiety stress.;/",
        "Diagnosis": "In addition to the effects reported during episodes of vasospasm and the patient's history, some tests are necessary to confirm the diagnosis of Raynaud's syndrome and to distinguish between primary and secondary Raynaud's. The most commonly used tests for diagnosis are: Nailfold capillaroscopy: essential for diagnosis and for distinguishing between the two types of Raynaud's syndrome. It is a non-invasive imaging technique that observes microcirculation and microvascular patterns.;/ Blood tests: to detect the presence of autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases or others (through the counting of anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), inflammatory markers (VS - and CRP).;/  If there is a suspicion that a blood vessel may be blocked, a Doppler ultrasound may be necessary after the patient has been exposed to cold.",
        "Treatment of Raynaud's syndrome": "In relation to primary Raynaud's, treatment first involves identifying the situations that trigger the episodes and avoiding them. In the case of secondary Raynaud's, this is also a fundamental strategy, helping to reduce the severity of outbreaks. Some strategies are essential such as: Use of warm gloves and socks.;/ Avoid sudden changes in temperature.;/ Stop smoking (which narrows blood vessels) and avoid medications such as nasal decongestants, amphetamines or ergotamine.;/  However, to improve the quality of life of some patients with both types of Raynaud's, medications may be necessary, such as: Calcium channel blockers.;/ Serotonin antagonists.;/ Prostaglandins (in severe cases).;/ Nitroglycerin ointments to treat skin lesions.;/  When none of the previous treatments have any effect, sympathectomy may be suggested, a surgery that blocks some nerve connections close to the most affected capillaries. As a consequence, the nervous system does not emit stimuli for the capillaries to contract further. This surgery may not be permanent, but it will alleviate symptoms for at least one to two years. It is worth mentioning that, for the relief of secondary Raynaud's syndrome, the treatment of the condition or disease to which it is linked contributes.",
        "Prevention": "It is not possible to prevent Raynaud's syndrome, but it is possible to understand what triggers episodes of vasospasm and avoid them. This is, in fact, the first treatment indicated for primary Raynaud's patients. Cleveland Clinic, March 2023 MSD Manual, March 2023 Mayo Clinic, March 2023 NHS, March 2023 Brazilian Society of Internal Medicine, March 2023 Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is the most common type of arthritis in children.

    "Carpal canal syndrome": {
        "What is it?": "There is a space on the front of the wrist known as the carpal tunnel where the median nerve and nine tendons pass from the forearm into the hand. Carpal tunnel syndrome occurs when increased pressure within the tunnel causes compression of the nerve, which is very sensitive. When the compression is high enough, it causes changes in nerve function, which can lead to numbness, paresthesias, and pain in the hand and fingers.",
        "Symptoms": "Symptoms are usually pain, numbness, tingling or a combination of the three in one or both hands. Numbness and tingling affect the thumb, index finger, middle finger and part of the ring finger in most situations. The signs usually appear at night, but can appear during daily activities, such as driving or reading a newspaper. Patients notice that they have decreased grip strength and may drop objects from their hands. In the most severe cases, sensitivity may be completely absent and the muscles at the base of the thumb may be atrophied (thenar eminence atrophy).",
        "Causes": "Usually the cause is unknown. Edema of the tendon sheath, known as tenosynovitis, can increase pressure within the canal. Bone dislocations, fractures, and arthritis can narrow it, but they are not as common. Fluid retention during pregnancy can in some cases cause edema in the canal, which normally disappears after birth. Some diseases such as hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes and kidney failure may be associated with this syndrome.",
        "Diagnosis": "A detailed history of the type of hand activity, any previous trauma, and previous symptoms are important. An x-ray may be ordered to check for other causes, such as arthritis or an underlying fracture. In some cases laboratory studies may be necessary if there is a suspicion of an associated disease. An electromyogram is usually performed to confirm the diagnosis and exclude any compression of the median nerve at a level other than the wrist, such as the forearm, shoulder, or cervical spine.",
        "Treatment": "Elimination of symptoms can sometimes be achieved without surgery. Changing activities to reduce repetitive, strenuous use of the hand or keeping the wrist in a neutral position can help reduce swelling within the canal, creating more space for the nerve. Wearing a splint at night can reduce complaints that prevent sleep. Anti-inflammatory medications, either taken orally or injected directly, can reduce swelling and pressure. When symptoms are very severe or do not improve, surgery may be necessary to widen the carpal tunnel. The objectives of this intervention are to increase the space within the canal and reduce pressure on the nerve. After surgery, the painful sensation around the scar may persist for a few weeks or months. The numbness and tingling may disappear quickly, but it may take some time for wrist and hand mobility to return to normal. Symptoms may, in some cases, return and resuming heavy or repetitive work may be a cause of recurrence.",
        "Prevention": "The condition can be caused by so many different activities that prevention can be challenging. Changes in your workstation\u2014such as correct posture and proper hand and wrist positioning\u2014can help reduce some risk factors. Other preventive methods include: Sleep and work with your wrists straight;/ Keep your wrists straight when using tools;/ Avoid flexing and extending your wrists repeatedly.;/ Decrease repetitive pressure with the wrist in a flexed position;/ Rest frequently from repetitive activities;/ Perform warm-up and stretching exercises before and after physical activities;/ Appropriately monitor and treat medical conditions related to carpal tunnel syndrome;/ Medical News Today Load more;/ There are few children who decide to wash their hands of their own free will.

    "Sindrome do colon irritavel": {
        "What is it?": "It is a disorder of the digestive tract that causes a wide range of chronic or recurrent digestive symptoms (abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, feeling of gas and abdominal distension) in the absence of a detectable organic cause. Its designation is due to the fact that, in these patients, the muscular tissue of the intestine is more sensitive and reacts more intensely to habitual stimuli, such as food and stress. This dysfunction can cause delay or acceleration in bowel movement and, consequently, changes in the frequency, shape or consistency of feces. There are four subtypes of this dysfunction, based on the consistency of the stool: irritable colon with constipation, irritable colon with diarrhea, mixed forms and unclassifiable forms. Irritable bowel syndrome is commonly known as \"nervous colitis\", \"spastic colitis\", \"irritable colon\" or \"functional bowel disease\". In developed countries, it is estimated that approximately 10% to 20% of the population suffers from this disease. Women are affected twice as often as men and it can occur before the age of 45.",
        "Symptoms": "The most common manifestations are abdominal pain or discomfort, associated with diarrhea, constipation or both. As a rule, abdominal pain or discomfort must be associated with two of the following three symptoms: starting with bowel movements that occur more or less frequently than usual; begin with the presence of less consistent and more watery stools or, on the contrary, stools that are harder than usual; and improve with evacuation. Irritable bowel syndrome can also cause diarrhea, with a feeling of urgency to defecate; constipation; a feeling of incomplete evacuation; the presence of mucus in the stool and flatulence (elimination of gas). Abdominal pain is often triggered by eating and relieves after defecation or passing gas. The pain is usually located in the lower abdomen. Distension and a feeling of abdominal gas may also occur. Patients often experience several of these symptoms for long periods of time. Symptoms can be worsened by stress and anxiety. The presence of blood in the stool, weight loss or fever should raise the suspicion of a diagnosis other than irritable bowel syndrome.",
        "Causes": "Its origin is not fully understood. It is believed that it may be the result of a combination of physical and psychological problems. Some of the possible causes are changes in the signaling between the brain and the intestine, leading to changes in bowel habits, pain and discomfort; changes in gastrointestinal motility, causing diarrhea, constipation or intestinal spasms; intestinal hypersensitivity, with increased reactivity to distension caused by gas or feces; psychological problems such as anxiety, depression, panic attacks, post-traumatic stress, history of sexual abuse; bacterial gastroenteritis; excessive bacterial proliferation in the small intestine that produces gas, diarrhea and weight loss; changes in neurotransmitter levels; genetic factors; sensitivity to certain foods, such as those rich in carbohydrates, spicy foods, coffee and alcohol.",
        "Diagnosis": "It is based on the presence of abdominal pain or discomfort starting more than 6 months ago, in the absence of another disease or injury that could explain this pain. The study of feces, blood tests, colonoscopy, are some of the tests that may be necessary. Colonoscopy is important after age 50 for colon cancer screening.",
        "Treatment": "There is no cure but symptoms can be alleviated through a combination of dietary changes, medication, use of probiotics and treatment of associated psychological problems. Foods that are low in fat and rich in carbohydrates, such as pasta, rice, cereals, fruits and vegetables, should be preferred. Foods that tend to worsen symptoms should be avoided, such as foods rich in fat, dairy products, coffee, alcohol, artificial sweeteners, beans and cabbage. Fiber can reduce constipation but increase gas formation, so it must be introduced in a controlled manner. Within medications, the alternatives depend on the symptoms and can be fiber supplements, laxatives, antidiarrheals (loperamide), antispasmodics or antidepressants. Sometimes antibiotics can be helpful, especially in cases where the presence of bacterial flora overgrowth in the small intestine is demonstrated. Probiotics are live microorganisms, generally bacteria, similar to those that normally exist in the intestine. Their administration tends to improve the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. Addressing psychological problems is an essential aspect of controlling this syndrome. Reducing stress, resting and exercising can help reduce the frequency and severity of symptoms, positively influencing the disease. The improvement or resolution of your symptoms is a slow process, which can last six months or more. Therefore, patience is essential and the role of the doctor-patient relationship is fundamental in order to prevent frustration or abandonment of treatment.",
        "Prevention": "Prevention involves dietary control, adopting healthy lifestyle practices and avoiding all factors that can trigger crises. Knowing the disease well and knowing how to identify what makes it worse is the best way to prevent its symptoms. Physical exercise and stress control are two equally very important aspects.

        "What is it?": "It is one of the most common endocrinological disorders, affecting approximately 6% of the female population of reproductive age. It is an important syndrome because it affects a large number of women of childbearing age. Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have a hormonal imbalance that interferes with normal reproductive processes. The first changes appear at puberty and manifest as menstrual changes and hormonal variations. This condition is often associated with infertility, a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases and a higher prevalence of endometrial cancer at an early age.",
        "Symptoms": "The most characteristic symptoms are irregular menstrual cycles, excess body hair, hair loss usually in the temporal region, acne, obesity, high blood pressure and changes in glucose metabolism. It is still the most common cause of infertility and may be associated with an increased cardiovascular risk in the case of obesity, high blood pressure and altered glucose metabolism. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) occurs when at least two of the following criteria are present: Oligomenorrhea, amenorrhea or anovulation;/ Hyperandrogenia or hyperandrogynym;/ Polycystic ovaries identified by imaging tests;/",
        "Causes": "The pathophysiology or cause is not yet well understood, with genetic and hormonal factors involved that can be aggravated by lifestyle. It is known that there is a disorder in the ovaries, adrenal glands, skin and adipose tissue, and in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis.",
        "Diagnosis": "Most cases can be diagnosed with a thorough evaluation of medical history and symptoms, as well as a physical examination. It may still be necessary to use blood tests to measure the levels of various hormones. Pelvic ultrasound can confirm the diagnosis.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment options should be analyzed on a case-by-case basis, according to the patient's symptoms. Many of them are more aesthetic than therapeutic, since polycystic ovary syndrome has no cure. Although some manifestations can be treated as isolated diseases (acne, for example), it is not recommended to take this specific medication, as it does not act on the origin of PCOS, having only a superficial effect. The most common forms of treatment are: Regular physical exercise;/ Weight loss diet or specific diet for diabetics;/ Use of specific contraceptive pill for PCOS;/ Use of oral hypoglycemic agents or other drugs that are indicated for the metabolic clinical condition in question;/ Use of specific drugs to limit excess testosterone or the action of existing testosterone;/ Use of menstrual stimulants;/ Psychotherapy to manage stress and reduce anxiety caused by bodily changes;/",

Patients with metabolic syndrome have a 3.5 times greater risk of death from cardiovascular diseases, such as myocardial infarction and stroke.",
        "Symptoms": "Central, visceral, abdominal obesity greater than 94 centimeters for men, and greater than 80 centimeters for women;/ Fasting blood glucose levels of 100mg/dl or higher;/ Blood pressure of 130/85 mm/Hg or higher;/ Blood triglyceride levels of 150mg/dl or higher;/ High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels of 40 mg/dL or less for men and 50 mg/dL or less for women;/",
        "Causes": "In addition to a genetic predisposition, abdominal obesity and a sedentary lifestyle are the main causes of this syndrome. Research has identified excess abdominal fat as a common factor in most of these cases. This, in turn, causes a change in the hormonal state characterized by insulin resistance, which contributes to the onset of hypertension, cholesterol changes and diabetes.",
        "Diagnosis": "It is currently possible to recognize insulin resistance before its consequences occur and reverse it with appropriate measures and timely intervention. An early diagnosis with changes in lifestyle, control of metabolic changes and possible medication intervention makes it possible to avoid or delay the appearance of complications of this condition and increase the average life expectancy of these patients.",
        "Treatment": "Metabolic syndrome is characterized by the presence of a set of risk factors that include accumulation of abdominal fat, high blood pressure and high levels of glucose (sugar) and cholesterol in the blood. Together, these risk factors greatly increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The treatment aims precisely to control the different changes that are part of the condition, to prevent progression to more serious forms of the disease.",
        "Prevention": "Lifestyle changes are highly recommended in preventing metabolic syndrome: Exercise 30 to 60 minutes, five days a week;/ Eat a healthy diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products, and avoid saturated fats, cholesterol, and salt.;/ Lose weight if you are overweight;/ Quit smoking;/ Maintain regular medical check-ups.

It should also be noted that the higher the level of thrombosis, the more severe the symptoms.",
        "Diagnosis": "There is no standard biomarker, imaging or physiological test that establishes its diagnosis. The presence of symptoms and signs typical of a previous deep vein thrombosis is an important element in the clinical history. Post-thrombotic syndrome usually manifests within three to six months after DVT, but can occur up to two years or more.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment options vary depending on the severity of the condition. Treatment usually includes elevation of the affected limb, exercise, and compression therapy or compression stockings. Doctors may also prescribe blood thinners to prevent more clots from forming in the veins, and medications to control pain. Changing lifestyle by increasing physical exercise and reducing weight has proven beneficial in the recovery of these patients.

Its severity or extent is highly variable, from almost complete fusion, although a small hole always remains that allows urine to pass through, to milder cases in which only fusion occurs over 30-50% of the total length of the labia minora. .",
        "Symptoms": "This is a generally asymptomatic situation, which does not usually cause any urological or gynecological problem, and is almost always detected during routine observation by the attending physician or by the parents themselves (most frequently when changing the diaper). Very rarely urinary infections, local irritation or urine leakage (related to the retention of small amounts of urine that are trapped inside the labia minora and expelled after the child urinates normally) may occur. However, it has no implications on the future life of girls, as it does not affect sexual development or normal fertility.

    "Sinusitis": {
        "What is sinusitis?": "Sinusitis is a general term commonly used to describe inflammation or infection in one or more sinuses (four groups), which can be caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi or as a consequence of an allergic reaction. The paranasal sinuses are airy cavities, lined with a mucous membrane identical to that of the nasal cavities, which exist in the bones of the face. Called frontal, ethmoidal, sphenoidal and maxillary, depending on location, the paranasal sinuses surround the nose and communicate with the nasal cavities through small holes. These cavities produce mucus drained from the nose, which has a protective function of the airways. When inflammation occurs, as is the case with sinusitis, the sinuses become blocked due to the accumulation of mucus that causes infection and pain. Sinusitis is a very common disease that significantly affects the quality of life, as well as the professional and social performance of those affected. A study conducted in Coimbra and published in 2012 identified a prevalence of sinusitis of 27%. More recent data indicate a prevalence in Europe of between 10% and 30%, and 15% in the United States. On the other hand, the anatomical and functional proximity between the nasal cavities and the sinuses means that acute sinusitis is frequently associated with rhinitis, and is generally followed by this inflammation, as is the case with allergic rhinitis. Between 53% and 70% of patients with rhinitis develop sinusitis, and 56% of patients with sinusitis suffer from rhinitis symptoms. Rhinosinusitis can become chronic, being one of the most common chronic diseases in the world - it is estimated that 10.9% of Europeans suffer from this condition. Asthma is another inflammatory disease that is often associated with sinusitis and rhinitis, and episodes of one can trigger the others.",
        "Causes of sinusitis": "Sinusitis can be caused by factors that prevent the drainage of nasal secretions, allowing them to accumulate, resulting in inflammation. Respiratory allergies are a common cause of sinusitis, but there are other factors that can trigger this problem.  Allergens such as pollen, house dust, dust mites and animal dander often cause sinusitis attacks, which, although temporary, can occur throughout the year. It is a form of sinusitis most identified by symptoms of itching in the nose, eyes and throat.  A cold or flu, caused by a virus, when causing a respiratory tract infection, can cause sinusitis, contributing to the general symptoms of the disease. Sinusitis can also have a bacterial cause, either alone or in conjunction with a viral infection, especially when nasal symptoms associated with a cold do not improve after ten days.  It can be allergic, a consequence of an allergy to certain types of fungi - just reduced contact with the allergen - or invasive, the latter being the most serious. Invasive fungal sinusitis is characterized by an aggressive infection by the fungus and often occurs in situations where the immune system is compromised.",
        "Types of sinusitis according to duration": "Sinusitis can be defined and described depending on the causes, but also the duration and frequency with which it occurs.  These are isolated episodes of sinusitis, often with a viral cause, as in the case of a cold, or bacterial. It can also be allergic, after intense contact with an allergen or irritating substance, such as pollution or chemical substances. Dental infections and abscesses can also cause this type of sinusitis. Symptoms of acute sinusitis may persist for two to four weeks.  Subacute sinusitis occurs when symptoms last for up to 12 weeks, and specific treatment for the cause, using antibiotics, is required.  It is called chronic sinusitis when its duration exceeds 12 weeks, and can occur both in people with chronic allergies and in isolated situations, such as, for example, a bacterial infection, prolonged contact with irritating substances or due to air pollution.  When acute sinusitis occurs at least four times a year, disappearing quickly and returning after ten days or more, it is called recurrent sinusitis. It can originate from any of the previous causes, and is also potentiated by anatomical factors of the nose, allergic rhinitis, exposure to pollution and irritants, or even medical conditions that affect the immune system or respiratory tract.",
        "Risk factors for sinusitis": "In addition to the most common causes, such as allergies or respiratory infections, there are several situations that increase the risk of sinusitis: Cold and humid weather conditions;;/ Nose trauma;;/ Presence of nasal polyps;;/ Sudden pressure changes associated with flying or\u00a0diving;;/ Atmospheric pollution (car, industrial or secondhand tobacco smoke);;/ My hygiene is good;;/ Deviations of the nasal septum;;/ Diseases that cause immune system disorders;;/ Excessive use of nasal decongestants;;/ Tobacco use.;/  Swimming, despite being normally beneficial in the case of respiratory diseases, can, however, in susceptible people, increase the risk of developing sinusitis, mainly due to the presence of chlorine in the water.",
        "Sinusitis symptoms": "The list of symptoms is long, and their combination or severity often depends on the duration and cause of the sinusitis. In most situations, sinusitis disappears with treatment, but in subacute or chronic cases, symptoms can persist for a long time. Pain in the face is usually more intense in cases of acute sinusitis. Symptoms of sinusitis may include: Nasal congestion;;/ Rhinorrhea (discharge of secretions from the nose);;/ Cough;;/ Swelling and pain in the nose and nasal passages;;/ Itchy nose, eyes and throat;;/ Reduced sense of smell and taste;;/ Bad breath;;/ Fever;;/ Fatigue;;/ Weakness;;/ Headaches;;/ Pressure in the ears.;/ It is common to feel yellow or greenish mucus draining, which may also go down the throat. Many patients report pain or a feeling of pressure in the face, cheekbones, nose or between the eyes, and headaches are also common.",
        "Sinusitis in children": "With their respiratory system, facial and paranasal sinuses still developing, children often suffer from nasal infections and sinusitis, whether allergic or infectious. The greatest difficulty in releasing nasal secretions increases infections caused by viruses or bacteria, in addition to contact with all types of objects or with other children, dirt, as well as the act of frequently putting your hands in your mouth. Sinusitis in children can also be caused by the use of a pacifier or by using a bottle while lying down. Acute, unilateral sinusitis in young children should raise suspicion of a foreign object stuck in the nostril and is a reason for urgent medical observation. Sinusitis symptoms in children are similar to those in adults, although less intense in most cases. A more common symptom in children is irritability, mainly due to the fact that they do not know how to deal with the problem. As the symptoms are common to flu or colds, as well as other possible infections in children, diagnosing childhood sinusitis is often complex.",
        "Diagnosis of sinusitis": "The diagnosis of acute sinusitis in children or adults is essentially made through a clinical evaluation, when the presence of purulent nasal secretion, nasal obstruction and a sensation of pressure or pain in the face is verified. Medical confirmation, especially when symptoms persist for a few weeks, can be completed with nasal endoscopy, computed tomography or x-ray. In children, exams that use radiation are avoided, unless there are severe symptoms, signs of risk or severity or that may indicate another type of disease. If the symptoms are chronic, without signs of severity and persist after three months even with treatment, or the sinusitis is recurrent, it will be necessary to consult an otorhinolaryngologist, as it may be chronic sinusitis. The exams make it possible to accurately check the condition of the sinuses, revealing the presence of other possible causes, such as injuries, polyps or severe deviations of the nasal septum.",
        "Sinusitis treatment": "The treatment of sinusitis depends on its cause and usually requires a multifaceted approach, taking into account the patient's general condition, treatments already carried out, lifestyle and coexisting diseases. The objectives of therapy for sinusitis are to control and cure the infection, reverse the obstruction of the drainage holes of the paranasal cavities, reduce the risk of progression to a chronic situation and prevent more serious complications. Treatment generally includes decongestants and painkillers, and saline nasal sprays are also helpful. Antibiotics may be used, but are not the preferred treatment in most cases. A recent Portuguese study found that two-thirds of patients with acute rhinosinusitis can be cured in less than two weeks without the need for antibiotics. When sinus obstruction cannot be treated with drugs and nasal lavage, due to the presence of polyps, excess tissue, bone or a deviated nasal septum, surgery may be necessary. Patients undergoing surgery clearly improve the frequency and intensity of symptoms, making it easier for them to breathe. In general, surgical treatment is carried out under general anesthesia and endoscopic control, exclusively through the nasal cavities, without leaving any external scar, and with minimal discomfort for the patient.",
        "Sinusitis prevention": "To avoid sinusitis, especially due to allergies or a cold, it is important to use oral and/or nasal decongestants. If nasal sprays are used, it should be for short periods of time. The act of blowing your nose must be gentle, to avoid secretions rising instead of falling, as well as injuries to the sinuses. It is also advisable to drink fluids frequently in order to keep nasal secretions more fluid. In the presence of allergies, an immunoallergology consultation is important to detect which substances trigger them, and so that appropriate treatments can be instituted. On the other hand, with sinusitis often associated with the flu, seasonal flu vaccines can also increase immunity, indirectly helping to prevent the emergence or progression of sinus infections. Other ways to prevent sinusitis include avoiding prolonged presence in places with high air pollution; do not put your fingers or foreign objects in your nose (be careful in the case of children); avoid air that is too cold and humid, or too dry; blow your nose regularly; and try to do a nasal wash to clear the nose. Air travel can also cause or worsen sinusitis, so it's a good idea to ensure good nasal hygiene before traveling. For some patients with sinusitis, thermal treatments have good results, and it is important to consult your doctor beforehand.",
        "Difference between sinusitis and allergic rhinitis": "Sinusitis is sometimes confused with allergic rhinitis because they share some symptoms, such as nasal congestion. However, these are different problems. Allergic rhinitis is directly linked to the effect of allergens on the nose, being an inflammation of the mucosa due to exposure to substances such as dust, mold or pollen - in case of allergy. On the other hand, allergic arinitis may precede sinusitis when the severity of the symptoms caused by the allergic reaction causes a nasal obstruction, which progresses to an infection in the sinuses. As allergic rhinitis is a chronic disease, when it is diagnosed, it is common for the attending physician to make recommendations in order to prevent an allergic reaction from becoming sinusitis.

    "Sleep-walking": {
        "What is it?": "It belongs to the category of sleeping disorders. It is thought that walking while sleeping is synonymous with sleepwalking, which is a mistake, as this situation can have different causes, with equally different treatments. It is a well-defined disease, more common in boys, with a familial tendency and, although it can occur at any age, it generally begins around the age of five/six and disappears in adolescence. It is more common in children with sleep apnea and in those who wet the bed at night. Night terrors are also associated with sleepwalking. As a rule, it occurs one hour after the onset of sleep and does not repeat itself during the same night. The sleepwalker rarely remembers what happened: he walks around the house in an orderly but unconscious manner, which can cause accidents, such as falling down stairs or out of a window, breaking objects, among others. In general, there is no aggression, but it can occur if the sleepwalker is contradicted. It can be caused by some medications and can be aggravated by alcohol consumption, drugs, excessive exercise, fever or sleep deprivation. It is estimated that around 10% to 20% of children have at least one episode of sleepwalking, but the prevalence of the disorder is much lower, probably between 1% and 5%. In adults, its incidence is 1% to 7%. The onset or persistence of this condition in adulthood is common and, as a rule, is not associated with any psychiatric problem.",
        "Symptoms": "Often sleepwalkers sit and look as if they are awake but are, in fact, asleep. They can get up and walk or perform more complex activities, such as moving furniture, going to the bathroom, dressing or undressing. Episodes may last for a few seconds or minutes or be longer. In most cases they don't last more than ten minutes. If left undisturbed, the person will fall back asleep, which may happen in their own bed or somewhere else. Some of the signs that characterize this disease are confused or disoriented behavior upon waking, a blank stare, opening the eyes during sleep, no memory of what happened upon waking, aggressive behavior when the episode is interrupted by others, or talking during sleep with incoherent speech.",
        "Causes": "The normal sleep cycle has several phases and sleepwalking tends to occur in deep sleep, right at the beginning. Its causes are not known but fatigue, lack of sleep and anxiety can be triggering factors. Hormonal changes that occur during adolescence, menstruation and pregnancy can also be factors to take into account. Magnesium deficiency is another possible cause. In adults, sleepwalking can be caused by the consumption of alcohol, sedatives or other medications, such as antihistamines and antiarrhythmics, and occurs in patients with epilepsy or other mental disorders. In elderly people, sleepwalking can indicate the presence of an organic brain disease.",
        "Diagnosis": "In general, no special tests are necessary. If episodes are frequent, it may be important to carry out a more detailed evaluation to rule out other diseases, such as epilepsy. There are also tests that allow the analysis of sleep rhythms and patterns, which can help characterize this condition.",
        "Treatment": "It is common to think that it is dangerous to wake a sleepwalker, but this is not true, although there may be a period of confusion or disorientation after waking up. Another mistake is to assume that the sleepwalker cannot hurt himself during the episode, which in fact can happen. As a rule, no treatment is necessary for sleepwalking. Safety measures to prevent accidents are important, such as moving electrical objects and furniture away, blocking access to stairs, etc. In some cases, sedatives may be useful to reduce the number of episodes. In others, hypnosis appears to be beneficial.",
        "Prevention": "It is essential to avoid the consumption of alcohol or other substances that affect the central nervous system; and maintain good levels of rest in order to prevent insomnia and reduce stress and anxiety, factors that can worsen this disorder.

    "Excessive sleepiness": {
        "What is it?": "Excessive sleepiness or hypersomnia, corresponds to a greater tendency to sleep, involuntarily falling asleep even when it is inappropriate to do so (at work, during meals or during a conversation). These repetitive episodes of daytime drowsiness or prolonged nighttime sleep are different from those resulting from normal tiredness. It is estimated that this condition affects 2% to 5% of the population, negatively impacting school activities, work, family and social relationships, and increasing the risk of accidents. On the other hand, it is associated with neuropsychological and cognitive changes. It is generally first recognized in adolescence or young adulthood. Excessive drowsiness and sleep disorders are quite common situations, with an important impact on societies. For example, in the United States of America, it was determined that in the 1990s around 200,000 car accidents were caused by falling asleep at the wheel and of these, around a third were fatal. According to some studies, it is estimated that 40% of people may occasionally experience these symptoms.",
        "Symptoms": "Patients report difficulty waking up after a long sleep and may feel disoriented. There is a compulsive need to sleep, and patients fall asleep involuntarily at work, during a meal or during a conversation. Anxiety, irritability, lack of energy, difficulty concentrating and speaking, loss of appetite, hallucinations and memory problems may occur. They also tend to lose the ability to function in family, social settings and at work.",
        "Causes": "The most common causes are chronic sleep deprivation, obstructive sleep apnea and hypopnea syndrome, narcolepsy, restless legs syndrome, circadian rhythm disorders, use of some drugs and/or pharmaceuticals and alcohol abuse. Suddenly stopping a medication may be another possible cause.\u00a0 Some cases have no known origin and in others there appears to be a genetic predisposition. It can also result from a physical problem, such as a tumor, head trauma, or damage to the central nervous system. Multiple sclerosis, depression, encephalitis, epilepsy, and obesity can contribute to this disorder.",
        "Diagnosis": "There are some procedures that can be used to investigate excessive sleepiness, such as clinical evaluation or the creation of a sleep diary. Laboratory and imaging studies, such as computed tomography, polysomnography or electroencephalogram, may also be useful.",
        "Treatment": "Your treatment depends on the underlying cause. In many situations, good sleep hygiene, which allows you to recover your quantity and quality, is sufficient. In other cases, it may be important to control weight, avoid the consumption of alcohol or sedatives, and treat other diseases that may contribute to this condition. Treatment of sleep apnea, when present, is very effective. There are some medications that may be helpful, such as stimulants or antidepressants. The selection of the most appropriate therapy should always be made by a doctor.",
        "Prevention": "There is no known prevention for this condition. It is important to emphasize that, although excessive drowsiness in itself is not serious, it can be associated with serious consequences, such as accidents. As a rule, crises tend to recur throughout life, with the exception of cases in which there is a well-identified cause that can be removed.

    "heart murmur": {
        "What is it?": "A heart murmur is a sound resulting from the circulation of blood in the heart or blood vessels. Blood in motion, even without encountering any obstruction, generates sounds. However, when there is some change in the heart or vessels (namely in the valves that separate the upper cavities - atria - from the lower cavities - ventricles - or when there is communication between the right and left sides of the heart) murmurs may appear, with greater or lesser severity.",
        "Symptoms": "The vast majority of murmurs do not have any type of manifestation, that is, they are asymptomatic, and are only detected during child health monitoring consultations, through auscultation with a stethoscope. In rare cases, murmurs can be caused by more serious heart conditions. In some cases, the diagnosis may occur during pregnancy. In others, the baby may be pale, tired when breastfeeding, have blue nails and lips (cyanosis), or have poor weight and length gains. In extreme cases, a murmur may be heard even without the help of a stethoscope.",
        "Diagnosis": "The vast majority of murmurs are designated as \u201cinnocent\u201d murmurs: they exist but are not associated with the disease, they can be heard better when the child has a fever and they tend to disappear with age. As mentioned previously, the murmur is almost always diagnosed through auscultation. The pediatrician or attending physician will assess the need to refer the child to a heart specialist - a pediatric cardiologist, who, when he sees fit, performs cardiac ultrasound with color Doppler for diagnosis and assessment of heart complications.",
        "Treatment": "Fortunately, 99 out of every 100 children with a heart murmur have an innocent murmur and no treatment is necessary. A murmur in a healthy child is just that, another sign of health. The child exudes energy, jumps all day, runs around with joy, only stops to sleep, and has a heart murmur.

    "Deafness": {
        "What is it?": "Deafness means any limitation in hearing capacity. It is one of the symptoms that can affect all ages, sexes, races and has enormous repercussions from the point of view of language and communication. It is usually divided into two types: transmission hearing loss and sensorineural hearing loss. In terms of degree, it can vary between mild, moderate, severe and profound. In transmission hearing loss, there is no good propagation of sound from the outside to the inner ear, while in sensorineural hearing loss, the cause is at the level of the inner ear, the auditory nerve and the brain. In some cases, deafness involves both types.",
        "Symptoms": "Decreased or altered hearing produces a reduction in the perception of sounds and makes it difficult to understand words. This obstacle increases with the type and degree of hearing loss. At preschool age, it is known that the child should be able to say their first words between 15 and 18 months. If this does not happen, she should be observed by a specialist doctor to find out what is causing the speech delay. The most common cause of deafness in children aged between two and five years is serous otitis. This disease prevents the transmission of sound from the outside to the inner ear, predisposes to acute infections and can progress to more complicated chronic otitis.",
        "Causes": "There are several diseases during pregnancy that can affect the development of the baby's ears. Among these, the most common, both nationally and internationally, is cytomegalovirus infection. It goes unnoticed most of the time and the pregnant woman does not present any symptoms or only has complaints of the flu. In any case, deafness at birth must be detected as early as possible so that there is adequate monitoring during the child's development. There are other types of situations, although rare, that can cause it, ranging from genetic causes to ear malformations. In other cases there are blockages at the entrance to the ear: cerumen (wax), foreign bodies (common in children) or otitis externa (skin infection at the entrance to the ear \u2013 common especially at beaches and swimming pools). Easily diagnosed by otoscopy, the removal of cerumen and foreign bodies can be done in consultation and external otitis treated with drops and/or antibiotics. Chronic ear infections can appear at any age. The degree of deafness will depend on the severity of the disease. Pus can often come out of the ear and lead to serious complications such as paralysis of the facial nerve (responsible for facial movements), meningitis or other intracranial conditions. Chronic otitis should be monitored in an Otorhinolaryngology consultation as early as possible in order to avoid worsening. Osteospongiosis is a cause of deafness that mainly affects the third and fourth decades of life and predominantly affects females. In about half of the cases there is a genetic factor, so there are often other situations in the family, especially in women. It results from a change in bone metabolism located in the joint between the stapes (one of the ossicles that transmits sound) and the oval window (internal membrane that communicates into the ear) which causes transmission deafness. Osteospongiosis, in some cases, can improve with surgical intervention. When there is progressive deafness, especially unilateral, we may have an acoustic neuroma. It is a benign tumor but can grow locally and must be monitored and controlled. Several other situations can cause deafness, from a simple cold, ear trauma, stroke, changes in blood pressure (air travel, diving), use of certain medications, among others. Hearing loss can be sudden or progressive and have various causes. In short, deafness can be congenital or acquired. The term congenital deafness implies that hearing loss is present at birth. It may include hereditary forms or forms of deafness due to other factors present in utero or at the time of birth. Hereditary forms appear to be involved in more than 50% of cases of congenital deafness. There are some genetic syndromes in which deafness is a known feature, such as Down syndrome, Usher syndrome, Treacher Collins syndrome, Crouzon syndrome and Alport syndrome. Other causes of congenital deafness that are not hereditary in nature include prenatal infections, illnesses, toxins consumed by the mother during pregnancy, or other conditions that occur at the time of birth or in the immediate peri-partum period. For example: Intrauterine infections including rubella, cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex;/ Complications associated with the blood Rh factor;/ Prematurity;/ Maternal diabetes;/ Toxemia during pregnancy;/ Anoxia;/ Acquired deafness is deafness that appears after birth, at any time in life, resulting from various situations, including: Middle ear infections;/ Meningitis;/ Encephalitis;/ Measles;/ chicken pox;/ Mumps;/ Influenza/ gripe;/ Otosclerose;/ Meniere's disease;/ Drugs that damage the structures of the auditory system (ototoxic);/ Exposure to high noise levels;/ Acoustic neuroma;/ Head or ear injuries;/  Aging \u2013 presbycusis \u2013 particularly involves degeneration of the inner ear, although it can also involve other parts of the auditory system. Hearing loss is progressive, preferentially affecting the higher frequencies.",
        "Diagnosis": "Deafness must be confirmed and characterized by tests that are requested according to the patient's age and clinical situation: otoacoustic emissions, evoked potentials, audiometry, impedance testing, among others.",
        "Treatment": "As age advances, some quality of hearing is lost and depending on its severity, it may be necessary to use a hearing aid to be able to carry out daily activities. Depending on the pathology in question (otitis media with effusion, chronic otitis media, otosclerosis, exostoses), a type of surgical intervention is indicated: myringocentesis with placement of transtympanic tubes, tympanoplasty, open or closed technical tympanomastoidectomy, exostoses and otosclerosis surgery. In specific cases of deafness, it may be necessary to use specific equipment that allows for better hearing. This is the case with osteo-integrated implants and cochlear implants.",
        "Prevention": "Hearing problems that occur at birth or hearing impairments due to illness or accidents are subject to possible prevention in each situation, namely vaccination against maternal and child infections, improved peripartum care and treatment of otitis in children.

    "Childhood deafness": {
        "What is it?": "A significant number of children have hearing problems of varying degrees and types, and the situation is usually suspected within the family or at school. Hearing loss in children is often a temporary problem that can be easily resolved with medical treatment and/or minor surgery. However, it can always be a more serious situation, such as permanent sensorineural deafness, which requires a special teaching support program and early intervention in cognitive rehabilitation. Regarding childhood deafness, we can immediately distinguish two distinct groups: congenital forms and acquired forms. The term congenital deafness implies that hearing loss is present at birth. It may include hereditary forms or forms of deafness due to other factors present in utero (prenatally) or at the time of birth. Hereditary forms appear to be involved in more than 50% of cases of congenital deafness. Genetic transmission can be autosomal dominant (when one of the parents, usually with deafness, carries the dominant gene and passes it on to the child in 50% of cases), autosomal recessive (where both parents do not manifest any deafness, but transmit a recessive gene, with this probability of transmission being 25%) and X-linked (in which the mother carries a recessive gene on the X sex chromosome and passes it on to her descendants, manifesting itself only in male descendants). Acquired deafness is deafness that appears after birth, at any time in life, resulting from various clinical situations.",
        "Symptoms": "At preschool age, it is known that the child should be able to say their first words between 15 and 18 months. If this does not happen, she should be observed by a specialist doctor to find out whether it is deafness that is causing the speech delay.

        "Diagnosis": "Hearing problems can affect the language learning process in the first years of life and subsequently the acquisition of knowledge and academic performance, fundamental aspects of a child's development. The diagnosis of this type of pathology is made with the help of complementary screening and diagnostic tests, always depending on the clinical situation and the child's age, with emphasis on otoacoustic emissions, auditory evoked potentials (ERA), tympanograms, research on stapedic reflexes and audiograms. In the case of newborns, the most used test is the study of otoacoustic emissions, as it allows the baby's hearing to be assessed, from the first hours of life, in a painless, quick and comfortable way.",
        "Treatment": "Depending on the pathology in question and age, a type of intervention is indicated, which can even be surgical. In specific cases, there may be a need to use equipment that allows better hearing, such as osseointegrated implants and cochlear implants.",

    "Smoking": {
        "What is it?": "Smoking is the physical and psychological dependence on nicotine, a toxic substance present in tobacco that reduces blood flow to tissues and the central nervous system. However, this is just one of the 4,000 toxic and irritating substances present in cigarettes, 70 of which are carcinogenic, such as: Radioactive substances such as Polonium 210 and Carbon 14;/ Heavy metals, such as lead and cadmium, which are concentrated in the liver, kidneys and lungs;/ Carbon monoxide: takes the place of oxygen, causing intoxication of the body;/ Tar, highly carcinogenic;/  In Europe, smoking is responsible for one million and 200 thousand deaths every year and the trend is for it to reach two million, predicts the World Health Organization. In Portugal, between 20 and 26 percent of the population smokes, in a proportion of three and a half men for every woman, and around 11,800 Portuguese people die each year as a result of this habit. Smoking is harmful to health, reducing its quality and duration. It is also a risk factor for the onset of several diseases. This habit not only affects active smokers, but also those who are indirectly exposed to tobacco smoke (passive smokers).",
        "Consequences": "Although tobacco consumption is already a very old habit, it was only recently that the harms of smoking began to be known. On average, smokers live ten years less than non-smokers. This happens because the substances present in tobacco harm some important organs while weakening our body in the face of various diseases. Thus, smoking is responsible for: 25 to 30% of cancers, including those of the upper respiratory tract (lip, tongue, mouth, pharynx and larynx);/ 80% of cases of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;/ 90% of lung cancer cases;/ 20% of deaths from coronary heart disease;/ Furthermore, cardiovascular diseases are 2-4 times more common in smokers. Therefore, quitting smoking is the most effective way to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, peripheral arterial disease and stroke.",
        "Treatment": "Smoking, being an addiction, is treatable. There are a few steps that can help you do this: Set a date to stop smoking, within a maximum period of 15 days.;/ Before that date, prepare yourself. Make, for example, a list of the reasons that lead you to abandon this habit (and keep it with you at all times) and practice short periods of abstinence.;/ Identify why, when and how many cigarettes you smoke. Of these, how many do you smoke just out of boredom?;/ Tell your closest people about your decision; you will feel more supported.;/ It is normal for the first few days or even weeks to feel anxious, restless or irritable and have difficulty sleeping. But remember: these symptoms are temporary and many people have already overcome them.;/ Adopt a healthy diet to avoid weight gain.;/ Avoid places with smokers and objects that resemble tobacco, such as ashtrays and lighters.;/ Exercise: it helps control anxiety and keep you in shape.;/ If you relapse, don't give up: set a new date to quit smoking and start the process again.;/ Going to a smoking consultation can also help you take this step. It is carried out by a multidisciplinary team, which can be made up of professionals in the areas of pulmonology, nutrition and psychology, depending on the needs of each individual.",
        "What happens to your body if you quit smoking, after...": "20 minutes Blood pressure and pulse rate normalize.  8 hours Nicotine and carbon monoxide levels in the blood decrease by 50% and oxygen levels rise to normal values.  2 dias Blood pressure stabilizes and taste improves.  3 dias The bronchi relax, breathing becomes easier and the skin becomes more luminous.  2-12 weeks Circulation improves significantly and walking becomes less tiring.  6-9 months Gradual increase in general well-being, with more vitality.  5 years The risk of mouth and esophageal cancer is reduced by half.  10 years The risk of lung cancer is 50% lower than that of a smoker.  15 years The risk of cardiovascular disease is similar to that of a non-smoker (same sex and age).

    "CT scan": {
        "What is it?": "Computed Tomography, also called CT or CT scan, is an imaging technology that uses special X-ray equipment to obtain a volume of data from the body that is then processed by a computer to obtain images of the body's internal organs.  A CT scan is particularly useful for showing organs and tissues, such as the liver or kidneys, with greater clarity and detail than a conventional x-ray. It is often possible to make a definitive diagnosis using a tomography exam, and it is not necessary to carry out other diagnostic tests.  Computed tomography is a non-invasive diagnostic method and can be used to study the heart and arteries, lungs, abdominal organs such as the liver, spleen, pancreas, kidneys, bladder and intestine, skull and brain, the face, the sinuses, ears and neck, spine, pelvis, limbs and joints.  Through this examination, a radiologist or neuroradiologist can discover the causes of symptoms, allowing faster and more effective treatment and often eliminating the need for other, more aggressive and painful diagnostic methods.",
        "Methodology": "The exam is performed with the person lying on a table, which can be raised or lowered as necessary. The table slowly moves into the machine, where an X-ray generator rotates around the patient to produce the images.  During the exam, healthcare professionals will be in contact with you and can see you through a window. The exam lasts about 10 minutes and is painless.  The contrast product used in the computed tomography examination can be administered orally, intravenously or rectally, and helps to enhance the visibility of some tissues or blood vessels, thus obtaining a better diagnosis.  Some pelvic exams require the injection of liquid contrast into the rectum immediately before the exam begins. If intravenous contrast is required, you may experience some transient reactions that are usually mild, such as warmth in your arm or a metallic taste in your throat.",
        "Preparation": "Preparation depends on the type of exam to be performed. The type of preparation required will be indicated at the time of booking. For exams that require more complex preparation, you will receive a phone call the day before the exam so that you can receive better support during the preparation for it.  For most examinations of the spine, joints, sinuses, and jaw, no special preparation is necessary.  During chest, skull and neck exams, you should not eat at least 4 hours before the exam, but if you are administering any type of medication, you can normally do so with water.  For most abdominal and pelvic exams, you must not eat for at least 4 hours before the exam and drink a special liquid to opacify the intestine, about 30 minutes before the exam. In these cases, you will be asked to come to the office early.  On the day of the exam, you must arrive 15 minutes before the scheduled time to open your file. For exams with oral contrast, you must arrive approximately 45 minutes before.  After the exam, you can go about your normal life.  If you are diabetic and take oral medication, you may need to change it after the test.",
        "Precautions": "Tomography uses X-rays to obtain images. X-rays are radiation of the same type as sunlight, but with more energy. As a rule, the dose of radiation received by a person during a computed tomography exam is equivalent to the same dose he or she receives during 3 years from the natural environment.  In order to limit as much as possible the potential risks of radiation, which are in any case very small, specific precautions are taken in the case of children and young people.  People with asthma or allergies who need medical treatment must take premedication the day before the exam.  Diabetic patients and people with kidney disease may require special care, which will be explained before the examination.  If in the days prior to the CT scan you have had an examination using barium contrast (for example, in the stomach or intestine), it may be necessary to carry out additional preparation, which will be indicated to you on the day the examination is scheduled.  Children under 5 years of age may need to be sedated so that they cannot move during the exam.  Due to radiation, pregnant women should avoid having a CT scan. Women of childbearing age should always inform their healthcare providers if they are or suspect they are pregnant.",
        "Exam": "On the day of the exam you must bring with you: Examination request issued by your doctor;;/ Previous diagnostic tests;;/ Most recent blood tests;;/ Health system card (SNS, insurance or health subsystem).;/ Check out the full range of CT (Computed Tomography) scans offered by the CUF Network here Load more;/ Colonoscopy is a minimally invasive procedure that allows you to identify and treat intestinal lesions.

    "Tachycardia": {
        "What is it?": "Heart rhythm is controlled by electrical signals that are sent throughout the tissues of the heart. When these signals are produced abnormally, tachycardia can occur. This is a faster than normal heart rate. There are different types, with different severity and treatment. In some cases, it may not cause any symptoms. In others, it can significantly alter the functioning of the heart, increasing the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiac arrest or death.",
        "Symptoms": "When the heart contracts too quickly, it is unable to pump blood effectively around the body, depriving the tissues of oxygen. The symptoms of tachycardia result from this reduction in oxygen supply and may include dizziness, difficulty breathing, feeling of palpitations, chest pain or fainting (syncope). In some situations, there are no signs and the disease is detected in a routine consultation or on an electrocardiogram. In addition to these manifestations, it can also be associated with the formation of clots that can cause a stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure or even sudden death.",
        "Causes": "It results from an alteration in the electrical impulses that control the rhythm of contraction of the heart muscle. This can be caused by several factors, such as damage to the heart tissue resulting from heart disease, a congenital defect in the heart's electrical pathways or even anemia. Other factors that can also cause tachycardia are physical exercise, sudden stress, high blood pressure, smoking, fever, excessive alcohol or caffeinated drinks, the use of drugs such as cocaine, thyroid disease or even as a side effect of some medications. Sometimes, its cause remains unknown. Age is a risk factor, as is a family history of tachycardia or heart disease.",
        "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis requires a complete clinical examination and a set of tests that identify the type of tachycardia and its origin. They include: Electrocardiogram;/ Holter (24-hour electrocardiogram recording);/ Electrophysiological examinations;/ Tilt test, or others, depending on each case;/",
        "Treatment": "Treatment involves reducing heart rate, preventing future episodes and minimizing complications. During an episode, it can be corrected by performing the following procedures: Vagal maneuvers, such as coughing, leaning forward or putting ice on the face. If these are not effective, intravenous medication may be necessary, which should be administered in a hospital setting. There are also oral medications for the treatment of tachycardia;;/ Another alternative is electrical cardioversion, in which an electrical shock is applied to the chest with the aim of restoring heart rhythm;;/ Preventing new episodes can be done through the use of medication, the ablation of an anomalous electrical pathway in the heart using a catheter, or the placement of a pacemaker or defibrillator under the skin. This equipment detects the heart rhythm and can correct it;;/ Surgery may be necessary in some cases to remove abnormal electrical tissue;;/ Another important aspect is the prevention of blood clots, which can be achieved by using anticoagulants;;/ It is also worth highlighting the importance of controlling all underlying diseases, such as heart disease or hyperthyroidism, which may be the basis of tachycardia.;/",
        "Prevention": "The most effective way to prevent tachycardia is to reduce the risk of developing heart disease. If it already exists, it must be properly monitored and treated. For this prevention, it is essential to practice physical exercise regularly, adopt a healthy diet and maintain an adequate weight. It is also essential to have good control of blood pressure and cholesterol and sugar levels, not smoking, drinking alcohol in moderation, not consuming drugs or medicines without a prescription, limiting caffeine, controlling stress and having a medical consultation. routine regularly. Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, Maio de 2014 The American Heart Association, Outubro de 2014 Harvard Health Guide, 2014 1 in 6 Portuguese people may have heart failure without knowing it.

    "Tendinitis": {
        "What is it?": "Tendonitis is the inflammation of the tendons that move the wrist and fingers. A tendon is the dense but flexible structure through which the muscle attaches to the bone, allowing movement of the joints. When the muscle and tendon are subject to excessive stress, for example during repetitive tasks, an inflammatory process occurs in the tendon and its sheath, causing pain, which is initially associated with the execution of the task. As the activity continues, the condition worsens and the pain becomes present even at rest and can even disturb sleep. Tendinitis is one of the most common disorders among professional athletes, whatever the location, such as the thigh, knee, ankle, shoulder or wrist. In general, tendonitis results from an overload process, but the occurrence of repeated microtraumas or a single, more intense trauma can trigger the process.",
        "Symptoms": "In the initial phase, there is localized pain in the tendon involved, which is accentuated in movements against resistance, that is, in situations in which the muscle or muscles in question and their respective tendons are forced. When examined, the patient presents localized pain and limited movement. Tendonitis tends to develop in four phases, depending on the complaints presented: in the first phase, the pain appears after sporting activity; in the second, the pain appears at the beginning of the sporting activity, disappears after the warm-up period and may reappear with fatigue; in the third, the pain is constant, at rest and during exercise; in the fourth phase, the tendon ruptures. Palpation of the tendon causes pain, making it thicker and losing its clear outline. The lack of effective treatment determines the evolution of tendonitis and leads to chronicity and subsequent rupture of the tendon.",
        "Causes": "Hypermusculation is one of the most common risk factors. Tendons are solid, elastic and resistant structures. Their resistance is generally equal to the initial strength of the muscle multiplied by four; however, when weight training is performed, muscle strength can increase two or three times, thus reducing the tendon's safety margin, giving rise to inflammation as the first response and, if the situation persists, rupture. Chronic infectious foci, such as active cavities or tonsillitis that have not healed properly, are another risk factor. The bloodstream, when passing through a source of infection, collects and transports the toxins created and deposits them in an already inflamed area, facilitating the progression to chronic tendonitis. A diet rich in animal proteins causes an increase in uric acid and purines, which are not always completely eliminated in the urine. The excess can be deposited in overloaded areas, crystallizing and causing tendonitis. Most cases result from prolonged overuse with tendon deterioration but no associated inflammation, which is why some physicians prefer the term \u201ctendinopathy.\u201d This distinction is important because tendon inflammation (tendinitis) is treated differently than tendon deterioration (tendinopathy). Tendinitis generally responds quickly to treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs, whereas tendinopathies require longer-term treatment focused on improving tendon strength and rebuilding the surrounding tissue. The most common causes of tendinitis in an athlete are acute trauma in which a tendon is forced beyond its normal range of motion, causing pain, swelling and inflammation. For tendinopathies, the most common cause is chronic overuse with repeated strain and trauma to soft tissues without sufficient time for adequate healing. Tendon injuries are common in athletes who are just starting their activity and who overexert themselves without adequate rest. As such, it is important to start sports slowly and increase the intensity of your training gradually. Warming up is essential and should never be neglected. Another possible cause is the use of incorrect sports techniques or the use of inappropriate training material.",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of tendonitis is based on the athlete's complaints and changes found in the physical examination, complementary diagnostic methods, such as simple radiography and, mainly, Magnetic Resonance Imaging. This exam radically changed the evaluation of patients with sports injuries, with rare situations in which the doctor, after an initial assessment, can dispense, initially and during recovery, with the information that MRI offers. Ultrasonography allows you to study the path of the tendon and evaluate the accumulation of fluid, an indirect sign of tendon injury.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment for tendonitis is usually non-surgical, focusing on identifying the cause of the injury in order to prevent it, if possible, with rest, ice and anti-inflammatories. Physiotherapy plays a fundamental role. As a rule, the absence of physical activity is not prolonged. When a tendon injury occurs, it is important to stop activity and rest. Rest, associated with the use of ice, compression maneuvers and elevation of the affected limb allow for a reduction in inflammation and pain, allowing recovery from tendinitis in a few days or weeks. Tendinopathies take between two and six months to recover. If you don't stop the activity that caused the problem, tendinopathy will tend to become chronic. Whenever pain persists for more than a few days, despite the aforementioned treatment measures, it is important to consult a doctor so that the affected tendon can be rehabilitated. Physiotherapy uses techniques such as ultrasound, massage and strength and flexibility exercises to restore the tendon to its initial characteristics. The use of infiltrations with platelet concentrates (Growth Factors) around the tendon can accelerate its regeneration. Surgery should not be performed before three months of medical treatment and physiotherapy. When necessary, athenosynovitis is the surgical procedure in which inflammatory tissues of the hand and wrist that do not respond to medical treatment are removed.",

        "What is it?": "The rotator cuff corresponds to a set of four tendons, which covers the head of the humerus, and together with the deltoid muscle, controls the rotation and elevation movements of the shoulder. Rotator cuff tendinitis corresponds to inflammation of these tendons, and is the most common cause of shoulder pain. It can be seen in conjunction with bursitis (inflammation of the lubrication pocket between the rotator cuff tendons and the scapula) and/or calcification of the tendons (calcifying tendonitis). It is often associated with repeated overhead movements of a professional, sporting or recreational nature.",
        "Symptoms": "Shoulder cuff tendonitis is associated with pain, typically at night, in the upper and anterior part of the shoulder, which may radiate to the arm. Symptoms are often aggravated by the need to perform movements with the arms above the head or by placing the arms posteriorly in relation to the body (such as when putting on a seatbelt or fastening a bra).",
        "Diagnosis": "Clinical suspicion of the diagnosis is confirmed by physical examination, through provocative tests or resistance tests. X-rays allow the assessment of the condition of the joint and identification of calcium deposits. Ultrasound and/or Magnetic Resonance Imaging are necessary to characterize the inflammation and exclude tendon rupture.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment is carried out by modifying activities that are associated with increased pain in the patient, prescribing anti-inflammatories and complementing this with physiotherapy programs. In cases refractory to treatment, and in a selected manner, infiltrations with corticosteroids or growth factors may be used as a complement. The duration of treatment will be shorter and its effectiveness greater the sooner the patient begins medical treatment.

    "Achilles tendinopathy": {
        "What is it?": "The Achilles tendon is the strongest tendon in the human body, capable of supporting up to 12.5 times the body weight. It is located at the back of the ankle and connects the calf muscles to the heel bone. When the calf muscles contract, they cause the Achilles tendon to pull the foot downward. Therefore, the muscle and tendon \u201cwork\u201d every time you take a step to propel your body upward and forward. This tendon is mainly composed of collagen fibers, with a more vulnerable area located between 2 and 6 cm in the heel, concentrating stress in this area, and this being the most frequent site of rupture. In the region where it inserts into the heel, this tendon is protected by a bursa (cushion) between the bone and the calcaneus and is also covered by a structure that nourishes the tendon (paratenon). Achilles tendon injuries occur more frequently in men, mainly in the 30-50 age group, in those who practice regular physical exercise, mainly related to sudden changes in speed, but also in occasional athletes and in people without any sporting activity. In approximately 25% of cases, the initial diagnosis is not obtained and, when there is an injury on one side, the chance of injury on the other side is 20% to 30%. Achilles tendinopathy can occur outside the insertion zone, in the middle region of the tendon, or at the insertion zone of the tendon in the heel.",
        "Symptoms": "This injury is manifested by pain when palpating or touching the tendon. This pain appears gradually over days or months and worsens during physical activity, improving with rest. The pain is more intense in activities such as climbing stairs or inclined ramps or when increasing speed while running. There may be a crepitus in the tendon when the foot moves and a feeling of stiffness when taking the first steps in the morning (e.g. when getting out of bed) or after periods of rest. Sometimes swelling is visible in the tendon area. A thickening of the tendon or the presence of a bone spur may be noticeable. In general, ankle mobility is limited, especially in flexion movements. Prolonged tendinopathy can weaken the tendon, increasing the risk of rupture, which is associated with an audible clicking sound and often requires surgery.",
        "Causes": "This injury usually does not result from a specific trauma but rather from repeated stress placed on the tendon, which happens when the body's resistance limits are exceeded or when there is a sudden increase in training intensity. The most common causes for this injury are changes in the position of the foot, such as the lowering of the inner region of the foot during gait or walking, which increases the demand on the Achilles tendon; muscle shortening in the calves, which results in a decrease in the foot's ability to move; the use of inappropriate or uncomfortable footwear for sports; sudden changes in training routines or sporting activity, with exercises that place a lot of tension on the tendon, such as explosive running or repetitive jumping. The presence of bone spurs, which correspond to an excessive growth of bone at the site of the Achilles tendon insertion, can cause friction on the tendon and damage it. As we age, the structure of this tendon weakens, increasing the risk of injury. As already mentioned, middle-aged men are more susceptible to this injury. The presence of \u201cflat feet\u201d or obesity increases the tension on the Achilles tendon. Diabetes, high blood pressure and the use of antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones are also risk factors for this type of injury.",
        "Diagnosis": "In addition to the clinical examination, radiography allows the identification of tendon calcifications or changes in adjacent bones. MRI is not essential but is useful in planning surgery. Ultrasound can also be important in evaluating soft tissues.",
        "Treatment": "In the early stages, ice is helpful. Generally, ice should be applied for 20-minute periods. Anti-inflammatory medications can help control pain and swelling. Corticosteroid injections into the tendon are rarely indicated because they increase the risk of rupture. In some cases, it may be advisable to place a device inside the shoe to raise the heel, reducing tension on the tendon. This option may be suitable in the initial stages, but it is not a long-term solution. Rest is essential and all activities that put strain on the tendon should be avoided. Low-impact sports such as cycling or swimming are possible and allow you to maintain physical activity. There are specific exercises that help strengthen the calves and reduce tension on the Achilles tendon and will be prescribed whenever the doctor deems them appropriate. Even if treatment is started early, pain may last for 3 months or more. If treatment is started later, results may not appear until 6 months later. Physiotherapy is an integral part of treatment, as is the use of appropriate footwear that reduces the strain on the tendon. If these measures are not effective or if the pain does not improve after 6 months, surgery may be indicated. The type of surgery will depend on the location of the injury and its severity. Complications are rare. In general, recovery is good, with physiotherapy being important in the following months.",
        "Prevention": "It is possible to reduce the risk of this injury occurring by taking the following measures: Gradual start of any physical activity, with progressive increase in the duration and intensity of the training Activities that put a lot of strain on the tendons, such as running on an incline, should be avoided. Whenever pain occurs, immediately stop the activity that caused the pain. Wear appropriate footwear for each sport and foot shape. Perform daily Achilles tendon stretching exercises, in the morning and before and after physical activity. Maintaining adequate levels of calf muscle strength helps the Achilles tendon better withstand the stress associated with exercise. It is useful to carry out different activities, alternating high-impact sports such as running and jumping with reduced-impact activities such as cycling and swimming.

        "What is it?": "Quadriceps tendinopathy is characterized by injury and inflammation of the quadriceps tendon at its insertion into the knee, causing pain in the upper region of the knee. This muscle extends from the pelvic region and femur to the kneecap and is responsible for extending the leg and controlling flexion during weight-bearing activities such as lifting a weight. It is particularly active in sprinting or in activities involving jumping or kicking. During quadriceps contraction, tension is exerted on the tendon and if this tension is excessive, through repeated or excessive activities, tendon injury occurs and inflammation ensues. Although it can occur at any age, it is more common in older athletes.",
        "Symptoms": "This injury manifests itself as pain that gradually develops in the front of the knee, above the kneecap. In less severe cases, there may be only discomfort or stiffness in the knee that increases with rest after activities that require repeated contractions of the quadriceps muscle. Sometimes there is a burning or hot sensation. In some cases, this pain may improve with activity in the early stages of the injury. Swelling may be visible in the knee and there may be a feeling of weakness when trying to run or do leg curls. Knee stiffness is common when a patient first gets up in the morning or after a long period of inactivity, and also during and after exercise.",
        "Causes": "This injury most often occurs following prolonged or repetitive activities that place strain on the tendon and in sports that involve frequent acceleration and deceleration or repeated jumping, such as basketball. Other sports involved are football, volleyball and running sports. Quadriceps tendinopathy can occur at any age. A fall or a direct blow can generate a very intense force that the quadriceps tendon cannot withstand. There are other factors that increase the predisposition to this injury: joint stiffness, very contracted muscles, inadequate or excessive training, incomplete warm-up, muscular weakness of the quadriceps and glutes, instability of the pelvic region, inadequate posture and incorrect footwear.",
        "Diagnosis": "As usual, the diagnosis is based on a medical examination and tests such as ultrasound, radiography and magnetic resonance imaging.",
        "Treatment": "Most cases respond well to physical therapy. It is essential to stop activities that increase pain until it disappears. Activities such as running (especially on inclined or uneven surfaces), jumping or kicking should be minimized. This rest provides an opportunity for tissue healing and regeneration. After symptoms disappear, these activities can be gradually resumed. If symptoms are ignored, it may develop into a chronic injury, with slower healing, longer disability and a greater risk of relapse. This chronic process is called tendinosis, in which there is no inflammation but rather degeneration and/or formation of scar tissue. These chronic processes are more common in athletes aged between 30 and 50 years. The \u201crest, ice, compression and elevation\u201d regimen is beneficial in the first 72 hours, when there are still signs of inflammation. Anti-inflammatories are equally important at this stage. Ice should not be applied for consecutive periods longer than 20 minutes, so as not to induce reflex vasodilation. In chronic forms, with tendinosis, heat can be useful to stimulate blood circulation and accelerate healing. Physiotherapy, with massage or other techniques, speeds recovery and improves muscle flexibility and function in these cases. In the final stages of this process, a program will be implemented to return to previous activity levels. With proper treatment, mild cases can recover fully within a few weeks. In more severe cases, recovery can take months. Surgery is rarely necessary and is indicated when other treatments fail. Surgery allows damaged tissue to be removed and the tendon to be repaired. When performed using the arthroscopy technique, recovery is quick. After surgery, an appropriate rehabilitation program will be implemented.",
        "Prevention": "Preventing injuries to this tendon involves avoiding running on very hard surfaces, avoiding climbing or jumping, stretching your knees before and after exercise, as well as adequately warming up before exercising.

    "tendinous": {
        "What is it?": "Tendinosis is a degenerative process of the collagen in a tendon as a response to chronic overuse. When this overuse is sustained without giving the tendon time to rest and heal, tendinosis occurs. Even small movements, such as clicking a computer mouse, can cause tendinosis if performed repeatedly. In sports, tendons can suffer different types of injuries, such as traumatic ruptures, indirect trauma related to vascularization, associated inflammatory disease and age or microtraumatic overload injuries. In fact, tendinopathies are very common and are one of the most reported injuries both in the workplace and in sports.",
        "Symptoms": "In fact, tendinopathy translates into the presence of pain, sensitivity to touch, swelling and limited movement in the affected region. Often, a tendon injury initially presents an inflammation component that is followed by the degeneration process. As such, the two entities may, in some cases, be interconnected.",
        "Causes": "Tendinosis can result from long hours of activities, such as sports, using computers or musical instruments, or other manual activities. There are several risk factors for tendon injuries, such as alignment deficiencies, differences in limb lengths, muscle imbalances, hypermobility or muscle stiffness, training errors, both in intensity and technique, fatigue, the surface and the type of footwear and equipment.",
        "Treatment": "For tendinosis, treatment started at an early stage allows recovery in 6 to 10 weeks. In the chronic phase, treatment can last from 3 to 9 months. Some studies suggest that tendons take about 100 days to produce new collagen, so shorter treatments will not be effective. Treatment for tendinosis includes rest, adjustments to posture at work and during sports, use of appropriate support for the affected tendon, continued movement of the involved muscle, combined with stretching to prevent muscle retraction and stimulate healing, use of ice for 15-20 minutes several times a day with intervals of at least 45 minutes, stretching exercises performed slowly to stimulate collagen production, and massage sessions to stimulate circulation and cellular activity. Correct nutrition, including vitamin C, manganese and zinc, is important for collagen production. Vitamin B6 and vitamin E also contribute to tendon health. Anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroid injections can accelerate the degenerative process and make the tendon more susceptible to new injuries, with a higher risk of rupture and, as such, should not be used to treat tendinosis. Surgery should be used as a last resort, to remove affected tissue in the case of tendinosis. However, it does not stimulate collagen synthesis and its success rate varies between 75% and 85%.",
        "Prevention": "Since tendinosis causes changes in tissues that make them more susceptible to further injury, it is important to pay special attention to the affected\u00a0tendon even after treatment is complete. Massages, stretching and proper warming up before training are examples of useful strategies for preventing new injuries and maintaining healthy tissues.

    "De Quervain's tenosynovite": {
        "What is it?": "De Quervain's tenosynovitis is an inflammation of the tendons that pass from the wrist to the thumb, associated with inflammation of the protective sheath that covers this tendon. In this case, the inflamed tendons serve to extend the thumb and pass through a tunnel (1st extensor compartment) which, if occupied by inflammatory tissue, causes pain when the finger is moved. In most cases the cause is unknown and can affect people of all ages. It is common for women to experience it in the 4th to 6th week after giving birth, probably due to hormonal changes or fluid retention during pregnancy. This disease is the most common overuse disorder and involves the wrist joint. It is very common in people who use their hand with a firm grip associated with a deviation of the wrist to the side of the ulna bone, as in tennis.",
        "Symptoms": "Pain in the wrist when moving the hand and thumb, especially when squeezing or twisting the hand forcefully. A painful swelling may form on the radial edge of the wrist (thumb side). Thumb and wrist movements that involve holding something become difficult and painful. When you try to move your thumb, there is a sensation of intermittent, \u201cshooting\u201d movement. If the condition is not treated, the pain can progress to the rest of the thumb and forearm and there may be progressive limitation of movement due to the inability of the tendons to slide in the tunnel.",
        "Causes": "As mentioned, repeated use of the wrist is the most common cause of this clinical condition. Every time you hold something in your hand, two tendons in your wrist and thumb are used. These tendons usually slide through a small tunnel. If a movement is repeated several times a day, the sheath surrounding these tendons can become irritated, causing a thickening that restricts movement. Activities such as gardening and racquet sports may be behind them and tend to aggravate this condition. Canoeing, golf and bowling can also cause this injury. Other possible causes are a direct injury to the wrist or tendon with formation of scar tissue that prevents movement of the tendons or the presence of an inflammatory arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis. It is more common between 30 and 50 years of age, more common in females and can be associated with pregnancy. The very act of holding the baby several times a day can cause this condition.",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis is clinical, that is, based on the symptoms and clinical examination of the patient and can be confirmed with ultrasound. Diagnosis is based on a medical examination, and there are specific maneuvers that guide the diagnosis. As a rule, imaging studies are not necessary to diagnose this condition.",
        "Treatment": "Initial treatment consists of using a splint to prevent movement of the thumb and anti-inflammatories. Your doctor may suggest infiltrating the tunnel with corticosteroids, which may improve the condition. The surgery, which consists of opening the tunnel (1st extensor compartment) to release the tendons, has excellent results. Treatment is generally successful when started early, although the pain may return if the activity that caused the condition cannot be stopped. If treatment is started early, improvement can be expected within 4 to 6 weeks. If this disorder appears during pregnancy, it will tend to improve towards the end of pregnancy or breastfeeding. The use of anti-inflammatories and ice allows adequate control of pain and swelling. In some cases, corticosteroid injections into the tendon sheath may be necessary. When treatment is started within the first six months, most people improve with these injections, and often only one injection is needed. Immobilizing the thumb and wrist allows for better recovery. In more severe cases, surgery may be necessary. This allows the sheath to be opened, relieving pressure on the tendon. Physiotherapy will allow you to recover strength and mobility in your wrist joint.",
        "Prevention": "It is important to avoid repetitive movements and modify gestures to reduce pressure on the wrist. Breaks should be taken throughout a repetitive activity.

    "Stenosing tenosynovitis": {
        "What is it?": "Stenosing tenosynovitis involves the tendons and pulleys of the flexor tendons of the fingers. The tendons work like long ropes from the muscles in the forearm and passing through a tunnel, with a bone base and a roof of fibrous tissue, until they reach the fingers. Inside the tunnel, the tendons are wrapped in a film that allows them to slide easily inside the sheath and pulleys. More common in adults and diabetics, stenosing tenosynovitis - commonly known as spring finger or trigger finger - occurs when the tendon develops a nodule or edema of the surrounding layer. When the tendon swells, it increases in volume, and has to rub against the entrance of the tunnel (flexor tendon sheath), which causes pain, snapping and a feeling of being trapped in the finger. When the tendon rubs against the sheath, more inflammation and more edema occur. This causes a vicious cycle between the trigger, inflammation and edema, which in some cases leads to a blockage, making it impossible to bend or straighten the affected finger.",
        "Symptoms": "Trigger finger may begin as mild discomfort felt at the base of the finger. A thickening may be felt in this area. When the finger starts to become blocked and cause snapping or triggering, the problem may appear in the interphalangeal joint next to the finger. At the beginning of the disease, snapping is sporadic, becoming increasingly frequent as the inflammation of the tendon progresses, which can cause a blockage in the ability to stretch it.",
        "Causes": "The causes of trigger finger are not fully understood. Trauma to the palm of the hand can cause irritation of the flexor tendons. Some diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, gout and diabetes are associated with the appearance of trigger finger.",
        "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis is made by taking the patient's history and examining the hand. Normally this disease causes pain in the palm of the hand or at the base of the thumb as well as the finger sticking out or the finger being trapped in a bent position.",
        "Treatment": "The goal of trigger finger treatment is to eliminate the snapping or entrapment and allow full movement of the finger without pain or discomfort. Swelling around the flexor tendon and sheath should be reduced to allow the tendon to glide smoothly. Using a splint or taking oral or injected anti-inflammatory drugs around the tendon may be indicated to reduce swelling. Treatment may also involve changing activities to reduce direct trauma. Surgical treatment is recommended in more advanced disease or in the failure of previous treatments and consists of sectioning part of the affected tendon sheath and releasing the tendon adhesions. Active mobilization of the finger generally begins in the immediate postoperative period and normal use of the finger may resume as soon as the absence of complaints permits.",
        "Prevention": "Most of the measures to prevent stenosing tenosynovitis are common good practices: Avoid repetitive movements, particularly with your fingers, hands and arms. When these are unavoidable, you should take regular breaks.;/ Do exercises appropriate to strengthen the affected area;/ Before practicing sports, always warm up;/ Have a correct working position and an ergonomic chair;/ Tenosynovitis Load more;/ Rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, spondyloarthropathies...

    "Stye": {
        "What is it?": "The eyelids play a very important role in protecting the eye, acting as a mechanical barrier against external aggressions and being responsible for the secretion of tears, which have essential functions in lubricating, disinfecting and protecting the eyes. They are made up of several glands that produce the mucous and fatty components of tears. Sometimes, these glands can become inflamed. A stye corresponds to a palpable, painful, reddish abscess that occurs acutely on one of the eyelids as a result of infection of one or more glands that are located on its edge or in its thickness. The most frequently involved microorganism is a bacterium of the genus Staphylococcus. Depending on their location and the glands involved, styes can be classified as external, which is more common, or internal. Sties are quite common in the general population, especially in patients with chronic blepharitis. Relapses are equally frequent, especially if there is simultaneously untreated conjunctivitis or blepharitis.",
        "Symptoms": "The external stye initially appears with complaints of pain, redness and sensitivity on the eyelid margin, followed by the formation of a small rounded mass. The patient may report tearing, photophobia and foreign body sensation. The eyelid tends to be swollen, either localized or more diffuse. Over time, a yellow dot appears in the center of the small mass. In general, styes drain spontaneously after three to four days, with pus discharge and pain relief. The internal one also causes pain, redness and swelling that tend to be more localized. On the inside of the eyelid it is possible to see a small elevation or a yellowish area that can develop into an abscess. If it is large, it may interfere with vision.",
        "Causes": "It results from a bacterial infection. As such, poor eye hygiene coupled with poor hand washing allows the transfer of bacteria. Chronic inflammation of the eyelids (chronic blepharitis) is an important risk factor, as are seborrheic dermatitis and rosacea. Other causes are lack of care when wearing contact lenses, not removing makeup at bedtime and using old or expired cosmetics.",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of a stye is clinical and is carried out by an ophthalmologist during a consultation.",
        "Treatment": "It is important to emphasize that you should never squeeze a stye. This maneuver can worsen the situation by allowing the infected material to spread. It is recommended to apply warm compresses for 10 to 15 minutes, two to four times a day, in order to liquefy the secretions and facilitate drainage through the gland opening. In some cases, it may be necessary to use an antibiotic ointment. In more resistant cases, a small incision is made to drain the stye. In internal forms, the infection is deeper and, therefore, the local application of antibiotics must be complemented with the same medication orally.",
        "Prevention": "Preventing styes involves good hand hygiene, the appropriate use of contact lenses and cosmetics, and the treatment of chronic inflammation of the eyelids. Manual Merck Online, 2014 Drug Information Center, Technical Data Sheet, 64 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, June 2012 Myopia, astigmatism and hyperopia often lead to the use of glasses or contact lenses.

    "Percutaneous thermoablation of thyroid nodules": {
        "What is a Thyroid Nodule?": "Thyroid nodular pathology is extremely common in the world population, estimated to be present in approximately 75% of the adult population, and is more prevalent in women. Approximately 5% of nodules grow so significantly that they are detected by palpation.",
        "How is the diagnosis made?": "Ultrasound evaluation determines which nodules require biopsy based on risk stratification and size, with less than 5% being malignant. The vast majority of nodules are benign and do not cause symptoms. However, there is a significant number of nodules that, due to their location and/or growth, cause symptoms, whether compressive (especially difficulty swallowing, foreign body sensation and hoarseness) or aesthetic (\u201clump in the neck\u201d).",
        "What treatments are there?": "Conventional Treatment In the case of symptomatic benign nodules, the conventional treatment is surgery (total thyroidectomy or hemithyroidectomy). With the development of surgical techniques, these procedures have become less invasive, however they require hospitalization, general anesthesia, are not free of complications, leave scars and in most cases require the patient to take medication to replace thyroid function.  Percutaneous Thermoablation A minimally invasive technique, Percutaneous Thermoablation, was developed to treat these nodules. In this treatment, using ultrasound control, a thermoablation antenna (\u201cspecial needle\u201d) is placed through the skin, which will treat the lesion using thermal methods such as microwaves (\u201cburn\u201d the lesion), resulting in a significant reduction in its volume. . With the use of Thermoablation, a reduction in volume of more than 50% is expected up to 6 months and can even be close to 80% at 12-24 months.  This is an outpatient procedure that takes approximately 30 minutes. There is no need for general anesthesia, leaving the person awake, but medication is provided so that it is practically painless. Approximately 1 hour after the procedure, the patient can be discharged home, without significant restrictions, and can return to active life the following day.",
        "What are the main advantages of Percutaneous Thermoablation?": "The main advantages are: Improves, or completely resolves, aesthetic and compressive symptoms;/ Does not cause hypothyroidism (does not require subsequent medication);/ Does not leave a valuable scar;/ Technique performed on an outpatient basis (without hospitalization) with local anesthesia;/ Discharge home shortly after the procedure; you can resume your normal life after the intervention.;/ Complication rates much lower than those of surgery.;/",
        "Criteria for treatment with Percutaneous Thermoablation": "Single or dominant benign nodule causing aesthetic symptoms (externally visible or palpable nodule);/ Single or dominant benign nodule causing compressive symptoms (difficulty swallowing, change in voice, or foreign body sensation);/ Benign nodule proven to be progressively growing (avoiding future symptoms);/",

    "Thyroid and adrenal glands": {
        "What is the pituitary gland?": "The hypophysis (also known as the pituitary gland) can be considered the \u201cmother gland\u201d of the endocrine system as its function is to control the functioning of the other endocrine glands. It is located in a bony recess called the sella turcica, located behind and above the nasal pyramid, at the base of the brain. It produces several hormones, namely: growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), thyroid stimulator (TSH), corticotropin (ACTH), gonad stimulators (LH and FSH), melanocyte stimulator (MSH), antidiuretic (ADH) and oxytocin. There are several causes that can lead to pituitary gland malfunction, such as: traumas;/ infectious, infiltrative, tumoral diseases;/ birth defects;/ This malfunction can manifest itself in the form of both a deficiency and an excess of certain hormones, resulting in various pathologies.",
        "Thyroid": "The thyroid is a gland located at the base of the neck, just below the Adam's apple. It is shaped like a butterfly and consists of two lobes - right and left - joined by a central portion called the isthmus. Each lobe is about four centimeters long and one to two centimeters wide. Its function is to produce, store and release into the bloodstream thyroid hormones \u2013 triiodothyronine (T3) and tetraiodothyronine (thyroxine or T4) \u2013 which are essential for life: they contribute to the regulation of body temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, intestinal function, weight control, cholesterol levels, muscle strength, memory, mood states, among others. If the thyroid produces too little hormone, the body reduces its activity (hypothyroidism). If it produces too much, its activity increases (hyperthyroidism). Thyroid diseases include pathologies as common as nodules (3% to 7% of the adult population), hypo- and hyperthyroidism (2% to 4% of the adult population) and also subclinical dysfunctions, which have a prevalence greater than 10% in adults over 50 years. In Portugal, one in 10 individuals has thyroid disease. The current surgical indication for these benign disorders is reinforced by their aesthetic importance, as they mostly affect young women. Most malignant thyroid neoplasms, despite having a longer survival rate than most cancers (around 80% at 20 years), are emotionally burdensome and require a specific and rapid approach.",
        "Thyroid and pregnancy": "Thyroid diseases are more common in women of childbearing age, which is why thyroid dysfunction is common during pregnancy and, if not identified and treated, puts maternal and fetal health at risk. Pregnancy is associated with adaptive and reversible changes in thyroid function, which can generate doubts in the interpretation of laboratory tests. Universal screening for all pregnant women is still controversial, but there is consensus to do so when there is: History of thyroid dysfunction, prior cervical surgery or irradiation;/ Elevated anti-thyroid antibodies;/ Type 1 diabetes mellitus or other autoimmune diseases;/ History of miscarriage or premature birth;/ Treatment with amiodorone, lithium or recent iodinated contrast administration;/ Infertility;/ Staying in an area with iodine deficiency;/ There must be joint work between the Endocrinology and Obstetrics departments so that all pregnant women with this pathology receive differentiated and priority care.",
        "What is parathyroid?": "The parathyroid glands are four or more glands located on the posterior surface of the thyroid. They secrete parathyroid hormone (PTH), the main hormone in the regulation of calcium in the blood. Sometimes, ectopic and even intrathyroid parathyroid glands occur. The main function of the parathyroid glands is to maintain calcium levels at appropriate levels for the normal functioning of the nervous and muscular systems.",
        "Adrenal glands": "The adrenal glands are two endocrine glands surrounded by a fibrous capsule, located above the kidneys. They are responsible for: release of hormones in response to stress (cortisol, adrenaline and noradrenaline);/ metabolism of proteins, fats and glucose (cortisol);/ androgen production;/ kidney function and regulation of plasma electrolytes (through aldosterone secretion);/ The release of ACTH (corticotropin) by the adenohypophysis stimulates the secretion of cortisol. Aldosterone is stimulated by the levels of angiotensin II and potassium in the blood.

    "Dizziness": {
        "What are they?": "This is a term used to describe various symptoms, including weakness, imbalance, dizziness, dizziness or a feeling of fainting. In the case of vertigo, the patient may feel that they or the environment they are in is spinning or moving. Dizziness is one of the most common reasons for a doctor's visit, although it rarely reflects a serious illness.",
        "Symptoms": "Its most common manifestations are a false sensation of movement or rotation (vertigo), the perception of fainting, loss of balance or instability, a heavy head or a floating state. These symptoms can be caused by multiple medical conditions that interfere with signals coming from the brain. Dizziness increases the risk of falls and accidents that can be fatal. On the other hand, if the underlying disease is not properly treated and diagnosed, other complications may occur in the long term.",
        "Causes": "The sensations associated with dizziness, the identification of the factors that trigger it and its duration provide some clues about its possible causes. Vertigo results from a sudden or temporary change in the activity of structures located in the inner ear or brain. These mechanisms detect movements and changes in head position. If the patient is sitting or walking, the vertigo tends to worsen. When they are accentuated, they can be associated with nausea, vomiting and imbalance. The most common causes are inflammation of the inner ear, M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, migraine, acoustic nerve tumors or, more rarely, a stroke, cerebral hemorrhage or multiple sclerosis. The feeling of dizziness or weakness without loss of consciousness may be associated with nausea and paleness and may result from low blood pressure or heart disease (cardiopathy, arrhythmia, among others). Loss of balance corresponds to the instability felt during walking and can result from changes in the inner ear, vision disorders, damage to the nerves in the lower limbs, joint, muscular or neurological changes, or medications such as antiepileptics, sedatives and tranquilizers. There are other sensations that are more difficult to describe and that can fall under the definition of dizziness. Their origins are diverse and can include changes in the inner ear, medication, anxiety, anemia, hypoglycemia, ear infections, dehydration or excess heat. Being over 65 years old and having a history of dizziness are risk factors to be considered.",
        "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis begins with medical observation, and there are several auxiliary means that can be useful. Magnetic resonance imaging can be important, as well as a neurological, ophthalmological and otorhinolaryngological evaluation.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment depends on the cause and associated symptoms. It may involve performing maneuvers that affect the position of the head, controlling inner ear diseases, and addressing M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, migraines or anxiety. Given the various causes of the condition, treatment must be individualized and often multidisciplinary.",
        "Prevention": "It is not possible to prevent them. The important thing is to identify their cause early and treat them when they occur.

    "Whooping cough": {
        "What is it?": "Whooping cough (also known as pertussis or whooping cough) is a highly contagious respiratory disease (of the trachea and bronchi) caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. The disease is spread through respiratory droplets that the infected person expels when coughing or sneezing. It can also occur through contact with objects contaminated with a patient's secretions. In 2018, there were more than 151,000 cases of this acute infectious disease worldwide. Pertussis is most dangerous for babies and is a significant cause of illness and death in this age group.",
        "Symptoms": "The incubation period for whooping cough is 7-10 days, but can range from 5-21 days. The symptoms of whooping cough are usually mild and similar to those of a cold: Runny nose;/ Nasal congestion;/ Watery and red eyes;/ Fever;/ Cough;/  Whooping cough progresses in phases. The first is the catarrhal phase (lasting 1-2 weeks), in which the following occurs: Inflammation and runny nose;/ Non-productive cough;/ Low fever;/  In the second phase - the paroxysmal phase, which lasts for 2-6 weeks - the cough worsens, is more frequent at night and can worsen with crying (in the case of children) and eating. It can be accompanied by cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin and lips) and swelling of the tongue. In addition, the patient may produce a characteristic noise of the disease when breathing in and the cough can even cause vomiting. During the convalescence phase (2-6 weeks), the cough progressively decreases in intensity and frequency. The noise produced when inhaling and vomiting also disappear. However, whooping cough does not appear equally in all patients. There are people who do not develop noise when breathing. There are cases where a persistent cough is the only sign that a teenager or adult may be infected. Babies, on the other hand, may not have a cough, but may only have difficulty breathing or even suddenly stop breathing. Vaccinated children, adolescents and young adults may have only mild symptoms, such as a persistent cough. Patients with whooping cough are most contagious until about 3 weeks after the cough appears. It is a good idea to consult your doctor if you have prolonged coughing attacks and experience symptoms such as: Vomiting;/ Red or blue coloration of the face;/ Difficulty breathing;/ Breathing noise when inhaling;/",
        "Possible complications": "Complications associated with whooping cough are often side effects of persistent coughing, such as: Broken or sore ribs;/ Abdominal hernias;/ Rupture of blood vessels in the skin or eyes;/  Pneumonia is a relatively common complication, while seizures and neurological disease rarely occur.  In babies\u2014especially before 6 months of age\u2014complications of whooping cough can be more serious, including: Pneumonia;/ Slower breathing or respiratory arrest;/ Dehydration or weight loss due to difficulties in eating;/ Dizziness;/ Neurological damage;/",
        "Causes": "Whooping cough is caused by the bacteria Bordetella pertussis. Transmission occurs when an infected person sneezes or coughs, expelling microbes into the air. These droplets can then be inhaled by other people, infecting them.",
        "Diagnosis": "Diagnosing whooping cough in the early stages can be difficult because the signs and symptoms are very similar to those of other respiratory illnesses, such as colds, flu and bronchitis. In most cases, the diagnosis is made through clinical observation. However, tests may be done to help confirm the diagnosis, such as: Collection of nasopharyngeal exudate;/ Blood tests;/ Chest X-ray;/",
        "Treatment": "In older children and adults, pertussis treatment is usually done at home and includes taking antibiotics. Because babies are at higher risk of complications, they are more likely to need hospital treatment. If your child is unable to take in liquids or food, intravenous fluids may need to be administered. Your child may also be isolated from other people to prevent transmission of the disease. Family members who have been exposed to the infection may need to take prophylactic antibiotic treatment. Cough relief is difficult. Over-the-counter cough medicines have little effect on whooping cough and are not recommended. Always follow your doctor's instructions.",
        "What you can do at home": "In addition to the prescribed medical treatment for whooping cough, there are some measures you can take at home: Rest, preferably in a dark, cool and quiet room.;/ Increase fluid intake: water, juice and soup are good options to stay well hydrated. Be aware of possible signs of dehydration in children, such as dry lips, crying without tears and urinating infrequently.;/ Eat lighter meals. This is important to prevent vomiting associated with coughing.;/ Air out the house, keeping the interior free of irritants that could aggravate the cough, such as tobacco smoke or fireplace smoke.;/ Practice proper respiratory etiquette by covering your face whenever you cough. It is also important to wash your hands frequently and wear a mask around other people.;/",
        "Prevention": "The best way to prevent whooping cough is through vaccination. The pertussis vaccine is free and is included in the National Immunization Program (PNV), and must be administered in five doses at 2, 4, 6, 18 months and 5 years of age. Pregnant women should also be vaccinated between 20 and 36 weeks of gestation, ideally up to 32 weeks. The combined vaccine against pertussis, tetanus and diphtheria is also included in the PNV.  There are also preventive medications against whooping cough, which can be prescribed by your doctor for some specific groups that have been exposed to the disease: Health professionals;/ Pregnant women;/ Babies under 12 months;/ Patients with a health condition that increases the risk of serious illness or complications, such as immunosuppression or asthma;/ Living with someone who has whooping cough;/ Living with someone who is at increased risk of developing a serious illness or complications from pertussis;/ Mayo Clinic, janeiro 2021 World Health Organization, January 2021 SNS 24, janeiro 2021 Whooping cough has returned and again poses a threat, especially to babies. It is essential to vaccinate pregnant women between 20 and 36 weeks of gestation. It can be scary to see that you have spit or coughed up blood, but it may not be serious and there are several possible reasons. The answer is \"yes\".

    "Botulinum toxin botox": {
        "What is it?": "Botulinum toxin, or Botox, is a purified substance derived from bacteria that blocks muscle signals. By injecting small amounts into specific facial muscles, nerve impulses are blocked and skin wrinkling is temporarily reduced. Botulinum toxin, or Botox, has several uses in medicine. In dermocosmetics, it is used in injectable form for the temporary treatment of expression lines. This injection is used to reduce or eliminate forehead wrinkles, folds around the eyes and bags in the neck. The toxin blocks nerve impulses, temporarily paralyzing the muscles that cause wrinkles, giving the skin a smoother and more renewed appearance. Studies show its effectiveness in relieving migraines, excessive sweating and muscle spasms in the neck and eyes.",
        "What areas can be treated with botulinum toxin?": "These are usually the vertical wrinkles between the eyebrows and at the base of the nose, the \u201ccrow's feet\u201d around the eyes, the horizontal lines on the forehead and the muscular bands on the neck.",
        "Treatment": "The dermatologist first takes a patient's medical history, including any medications they are taking. The treatment then involves injecting small amounts of botulinum toxin, or Botox, directly into the facial muscles to relax them. A very fine needle, which is well tolerated by the skin, is used for just a few minutes, and there is no long recovery period.",
        "Results": "The effect is felt three to seven days after treatment. The improvement in wrinkles lasts between three and four months. The effect then gradually disappears and muscle action is restored. At this point, botulinum toxin, or Botox, can be injected again to maintain the results.",
        "Adverse effects": "They are minimal, temporary and typically related to the injection site. Bruising, headache and partial drooping of an eyelid may occur. All effects are mild, reversible and self-limiting.",
        "Other applications": "Hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating) of the armpits, hands or feet can be treated with injections of very diluted botulic toxin. This therapy leads to weakening of the sweat-producing glands for months. When excessive perspiration returns, administration of the toxin may be repeated.

    "Toxoplasmosis": {
        "What is it?": "Toxoplasmosis is an infection caused by a parasite, Toxoplasma gondii. Sexual reproduction of this parasite occurs only in the cells that line the intestine of cats. Thus, the parasite's eggs are found in the feces of these felines. Toxoplasmosis is one of the most common parasitic diseases in cats, with a worldwide prevalence of between 5.5% and 97.4%. This parasite infects almost a third of the world's population, although its prevalence in industrialized countries has been decreasing over the last 30 years, with an incidence in individuals aged between 15 and 45 years ranging from 10% to 50%. In the United States, it is estimated that there are around 60 million people infected by this parasite. In Portugal, some data point to an infection prevalence of around 60% in the population over 30 years of age.",
        "Symptoms": "Congenital toxoplasmosis can be asymptomatic or present severe and rapidly fatal symptoms. When signs do occur, the most common are inflammation of the eyes, severe jaundice, easy bruising, seizures, large or small head and mental retardation. Very mild signs may appear shortly after birth, but generally they only appear months or years later. Acquired toxoplasmosis rarely produces symptoms and is generally diagnosed when a blood test reveals the presence of antibodies against the parasite. In fact, in healthy people, this infection does not cause signs because the immune system prevents the parasite from causing the disease. In milder cases, it can simulate infectious mononucleosis, with swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck and armpits, which are generally not sensitive to touch, a feeling of malaise, muscle pain and a low, fluctuating fever that can last for weeks or months. Mild anemia, low blood pressure, low white blood cell count, increased lymphocyte count and abnormal liver function test results may also occur. In most cases, people infected with toxoplasmosis only have painless enlargement of the lymph nodes in the neck. In chronic forms, eye inflammation may occur, which can be serious if not treated properly. Acute disseminated toxoplasmosis can produce a rash, high fever, chills, and exhaustion. In some cases, the infection can cause inflammation of the brain and the membranes that cover it, the liver, lungs or heart. In a patient with immunodeficiency, as occurs in infection with the HIV/AIDS virus, toxoplasmosis tends to be generalized, with brain inflammation (encephalitis), seizures, tremors, headache, confusion or coma.",
        "Causes": "Transmission of toxoplasmosis can occur when eating raw or undercooked foods that contain the inactive form (cyst) of the parasite or after contact with land containing cat feces with eggs. If a pregnant woman becomes infected, the infection can be transmitted to the fetus through the placenta from there and can result in miscarriage or the occurrence of congenital toxoplasmosis.",
        "Diagnosis": "Its diagnosis is almost always laboratory-based, through blood tests that demonstrate the presence of antibodies against the parasite. In some cases, computerized axial tomography or brain magnetic resonance imaging may be necessary.",
        "Treatment": "In most healthy people, recovery from toxoplasmosis occurs without the need for treatment. When necessary, a set of medications such as spiramycin, sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine are administered, often in combination. In AIDS patients, toxoplasmosis is so common that therapy must be continued indefinitely. Treatment during pregnancy is debatable because medications can be toxic to the fetus. As such, it is important to evaluate each case individually.",
        "Prevention": "Preventing toxoplasmosis involves several steps: Cook food thoroughly;;/ Freeze food thoroughly before preparing it;;/ Peel and/or wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly;;/ Wash your hands and all kitchen utensils thoroughly when preparing food;;/ Do not drink untreated water;;/ Wear gloves in gardening activities or activities that involve contact with the soil and wash your hands at the end of these tasks (this precaution in regular hand washing should be passed on to children as a general principle).;/ In relation to cats, whenever possible, litter boxes should be kept outside the house and/or covered, they should be cleaned daily and the cats should be fed with specific foods already sold or with well-cooked food. In the case of pregnant women, it is even more important not to come into contact with the litter box and, if necessary, to do so by wearing gloves and washing your hands immediately afterwards. During this period, cats must be kept indoors to avoid contamination in the open air.

    "Meniscus transplant": {
        "What is it?": "In some cases, after surgery in which all or a significant part of the meniscus is removed, the pressure exerted on the knee cartilage increases and can cause pain and limited joint function. Post-meniscectomy syndrome, as it is called, represents a state of joint decompensation before osteoarthritis, due to a lack of meniscal tissue. Meniscus transplantation is a knee reconstructive surgery technique, indicated in cases of post-meniscectomy syndrome, in which a \u201cnew\u201d meniscus is placed, coming from a human tissue bank (similar to what occurs in transplants of other organs). . The main objective of this surgery is to treat pain and improve the function of the affected knee in activities of daily living. Practicing sports should be seen as a secondary objective in this context. The ideal candidate is someone who has had a meniscus removed, has pain and functional limitations related to the compartment without the meniscus, is under 50 years of age, has no or limited cartilage damage, no deviations from the mechanical axis and has a stable knee. However, knees with deviations from the axis and/or instability that can be corrected surgically can also undergo meniscus transplantation. Individuals with inflammatory joint disease, active infections, obesity, decreased immunity, children or those with established knee osteoarthritis are not candidates for this procedure.",
        "Surgical Technique": "The meniscus transplant technique is performed by arthroscopy, using an imaging camera and specific instruments. In addition to the 2 or 3 small incisions made during arthroscopy, other additional incisions may be necessary to correctly fix the meniscus. We use menisci from a human tissue bank, through the Southern Histocompatibility Center (national authority for transplantation), ensuring conservation conditions using cryopreservation techniques and carrying out screening tests for potentially contagious diseases.",
        "Complications": "The main cause of meniscus transplant failure is its rupture, just like an original meniscus. Possible complications include infection, neurovascular injury, joint stiffness and progression of osteoarthritis. The risk of transmission of infectious diseases is very low, given the process of preparing the meniscal tissue, and its occurrence is estimated at 0.000001% (1 case in 1 million patients operated on).

    "Delusional disorder": {
        "What is it?": "Delusional disorder (previously known as paranoid personality disorder) is a rare mental illness, part of the psychosis group, in which the person is unable to distinguish what is real from what is just a figment of their imagination. Delusions are the dominant symptom and can be of two types: Bizarre: beliefs in irrational and impossible things. For example, feeling controlled by an outside force.;/ Non-bizarre: delusions about things that could happen in real life. For example, thinking that you are being followed, that you have been poisoned, or that your neighbors are planning to murder you.;/  People with delusional disorder believe in their delusions even when presented with irrefutable evidence that they do not reflect reality. These delusions are confused with real life and may not be true at all, or they may be exaggerations that are not compatible with reality. Typically, delusional disorder appears for the first time in adulthood or old age.  There are several types of delusional disorder, which can be classified according to the theme on which the delusions are based: Erotomania: in this type of delusion, the patient believes that another person - often someone famous or well-known - is in love with them. This belief may lead you to try to contact that person (for example, through calls or messages) or even start stalking them.;/ Grandiosity: the person has an exaggerated sense of value, power, knowledge and even identity, which can lead them to think they have a great talent or have made a great discovery.;/ Jealousy: as the name suggests, in this type of delusion the person believes that their spouse is not faithful to them, based on erroneous interpretations they make about the available evidence.;/ Persecution: the person believes that there is some type of plan against them and that someone may be spying on them and harming them. In this type of delusion, the person often repeatedly reports to the authorities.;/ Somatization: the person believes they have some type of physical deformity or medical problem.;/ Mixed: occurs when the patient presents two or more types of delirium.;/",
        "Symptoms": "At first glance, the behavior of a person suffering from delusional disorder does not reveal the disease, as they do not act in an obviously strange way. The exception may occur when their delusions cause problems and affect certain areas of their life. This is the case, for example, when the patient believes that their partner is being unfaithful, even though this betrayal is not real. Some of the possible symptoms of delusional disorder are: Non-bizarre delusions, the most obvious symptom.;/ Hallucinations (which consist of seeing, hearing and feeling things that are not real) related to delirium.;/ Bad mood, irritability and anger.;/ Suspicion and lack of trust can lead to feelings of fear, anger, and betrayal. In addition, the person may become hypervigilant, have difficulty forgiving, or even adopt a defensive attitude.;/ To hold a grudge for a long time.;/ Taking/interpreting innocent comments or events as a threat.;/  For a person to be diagnosed with delusional disorder, their symptoms must persist for a month or more.",
        "Causes": "The exact cause of delusional disorder is not yet known, as is the case with many other types of psychotic disorders. Research is ongoing to try to discover what factors may be causing it, and so far it is known that the following may play a role: Genetics: Delusional disorder is more common in people who have a family history of this illness or schizophrenia, which suggests that there may be some genetic influence. In addition, it is believed that, as with other mental disorders, the tendency to develop delusional disorder can be passed from parents to children.;/ Biological: the way in which certain changes in certain areas of the brain may be involved in the development of delusional disorder is the subject of study by the scientific community. Research carried out to date has shown that an imbalance of neurotransmitters (substances that allow nerve cells to communicate with each other) can lead to the emergence of symptoms.;/ Environmental/psychological: Some evidence suggests that it may be triggered by stress, alcohol abuse, and drug abuse. People who tend to isolate themselves from others also appear to be more vulnerable to developing delusional disorder.;/",
        "Diagnosis": "In the presence of symptoms, the first steps in diagnosing delusional disorder are collecting a clinical history and performing a physical examination. There are no specific tests that can detect this disease, but some tests can be performed - such as X-rays and blood tests - to rule out other health problems. The patient should be monitored by a mental health specialist, such as a psychologist or psychiatrist. Based on the reported symptoms and behavioral observation, this health professional may be able to diagnose delusional disorder, and criteria must be met, such as having had non-bizarre delusions for at least one month and not having symptoms characteristic of other psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia. In addition, the impact on the patient's life is also taken into account - delusional disorder, except for the delusions and their respective effects, may be compatible with their usual activities. In these patients, manic or depressive episodes may occur, which are usually brief when compared to the delusions.",
        "Treatment of delusional disorder": "Treating delusional disorder can be challenging for healthcare professionals as patients often do not realize they have a problem and therefore do not seek help. This is a typically chronic disease, but with appropriate treatment it is possible to alleviate its symptoms. While some people make a full recovery, others experience periods of delirium interspersed with periods of remission (absence of symptoms). Treatment for delusional disorder usually involves two approaches\u2014psychotherapy and medication\u2014and a good doctor-patient relationship is essential to its success. One of the goals of a long-term treatment plan is to shift the patient's attention away from the delusion and toward more constructive and rewarding thinking. However, this goal can be difficult to achieve. Psychotherapy is essential in the treatment of delusional disorder, allowing the patient to find a safe environment to discuss their symptoms while encouraging them to adopt healthier and more functional behaviors. In addition, you can learn to manage your symptoms, as well as identify signs that you may be experiencing a relapse and develop a plan to prevent it. Pharmacological treatment may consist of different types of antipsychotics, tranquilizers and antidepressants. People with severe symptoms or who pose a risk to themselves or others may need to be hospitalized until their illness stabilizes.",
        "Prevention": "There are no known strategies for preventing delusional disorder. Early diagnosis and treatment can help reduce the impact this disease can have on the personal, family and social lives of sick people and their family and friends. Cleveland Clinic, May 2022 Harvard Health Publishing, Harvard Medical School, maio de 2022 MSD Manual, May 2022 Mental Health America, May 2022 WebMD, May 2022 When we are in danger or under pressure, there is a hormone that helps the body stay alert.

    "Psychotic Transtorno": {
        "What is it?": "Psychotic disorder refers to a set of serious mental health problems in which the patient has a distorted perception of reality or interprets it in a different way than those around them. These types of symptoms, when they are more severe and disabling, require therapy and strict clinical surveillance in order to allow the patient to live their daily lives with symptoms under control.  This group of mental illnesses can affect some abilities associated not only with reasoning but also with perceptions: Understanding reality;/ Proper/appropriate behavior;/ Good value judgments;/ Clear reasoning;/ Emotional response;/ Effective communication;/  Different people are affected in different ways: while some sufferers live with psychotic disorder most of the time, others only have a few episodes throughout their lives. It is also possible to have a single episode of psychotic disorder and not have it again.  There are several types of psychotic disorder, some examples being: Schizophrenia;/ Bipolar disorder;/ Paraphrenia;/ Schizoaffective disorder;/ Substance-induced psychotic disorder, such as drugs;/ Psychotic disorder caused by another health problem that affects brain function, such as brain injuries or brain tumors;/  Psychotic disorders - which, as a rule, appear in late adolescence or in the 20s/30s and tend to affect both sexes equally - can be treated, generally including severe cases.",
        "Symptoms of psychotic disorder": "Psychotic disorder can have several associated symptoms, but there are two that are most important: hallucinations and delusions.  As the name suggests, hallucinations are false perceptions, that is, things that the person is experiencing, but which are not real. Hallucinations can involve the various senses, and may include situations such as: seeing things that do not exist or that are not in front of you, such as religious figures, animals or objects that move differently than normal; hear voices; smell smells; feel flavors; or feel something touching your skin. Although hallucinations are a figment of the patient's imagination, they can seem very real to him.  While hallucinations are false perceptions of reality, delusions are false beliefs. That is, believing in things that are not real, such as thinking that there is someone or something conspiring against you or even that you are receiving secret messages from television. In addition, the person may also have delusions about themselves, thinking that they are someone very important (for example, rich and powerful) or that they can resurrect other people or control time. The sufferer may continue to believe these delusions even when confronted with evidence that they do not reflect reality. For these people, the delusions \u201care\u201d real and are frightening, making them feel threatened or insecure.   Especially in combination, delusions and hallucinations can cause great distress in the patient, as well as behavioral changes. In addition to delusions and hallucinations, there are other possible symptoms of psychotic disorder, such as: Acting cold and distant, unable to express emotions;/ Disorganized or incoherent speech;/ Abnormal behavior;/ Confused reasoning;/ Loss of interest in personal hygiene;/ Loss of interest in usual leisure or family activities;/ Problems at school, at work or in relationships;/ Changes in mood level or other mood-related symptoms, such as depression or mania;/ Slower or abnormal movements;/  People suffering from a psychotic disorder do not all present the same set of symptoms and, even within a given patient, symptoms can vary over time. These illnesses can have a major impact on the life of the sufferer, who may feel tired, overwhelmed, anxious, scared, threatened or even confused. In addition, they may see their experience being devalued by others - because they are not real beliefs or perceptions - which can cause feelings of incomprehension and frustration.",
        "Causes": "Some problems/situations identified as potentially causing psychosis are: Physical health problems, such as stroke, brain tumor, and brain infection;/ Traumatic experience;/ Drastic change in family or work life;/ Stress;/ Alcohol and drug use;/ Adverse effects of medications;/  Additionally, people who suffer from certain types of psychotic disorders (such as schizophrenia) may have problems in the areas of the brain responsible for functions such as reasoning, motivation, and perception. In some situations, it is possible to associate psychosis with a specific mental pathology, such as severe depression, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Since several cases of psychotic disorder are recorded in some families, it is possible that this disorder is, in part, hereditary. The exact cause of the psychotic episode can influence how often it occurs and how long it lasts.",
        "Diagnosis": "Taking a medical and psychiatric history and a physical examination are the basis for diagnosing psychotic disorder. In addition, the attending physician may prescribe some tests to rule out other diseases or causes of the problem, such as blood tests and imaging tests such as magnetic resonance imaging, to obtain images of the brain. When no physical cause is identified that could explain the psychotic episodes, the attending physician may refer the patient to a psychiatrist, who will use other specific diagnostic methods, thus determining whether the person has some type of psychotic disorder.",
        "Treatment of psychotic disorder": "It is possible to treat psychotic disorder and most patients recover well with treatment and follow-up. The therapeutic plan always depends on the cause of the psychotic disorder and may include: Medication: consists mainly of antipsychotic drugs, effective in controlling symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions and even reasoning problems. While some patients take antipsychotics throughout their lives, in others it may be possible to reduce the dosage and even stop taking them when symptoms improve. As a general rule, the medication is given in the lowest possible dose for each case, with the aim of minimizing its adverse effects.;/ Psychotherapy;/  In more severe cases of the illness, where the patient may pose a danger to themselves or others or where they are unable to care for themselves due to the illness, hospitalization may be necessary.",
        "Prevention": "There are no strategies that can help prevent psychotic disorders. However, it is important to take into account that the sooner treatment is started, the better. This is the best way to minimize the impact that the disease can have on the patient's life. People who are at high risk of developing psychotic disorders - for example, those with a family history of these problems - should avoid using drugs (such as marijuana) and alcohol.

    "Thyroid treatment with radiofrequency": {
        "What is it?": "Radiofrequency treatment is a less invasive procedure that reduces the size of benign thyroid nodules without the need for surgery. The percentage of people with palpable thyroid nodules represents approximately 5% of the population. Ultrasound can detect thyroid nodules in approximately 40% of adults. The vast majority (approximately 90%) of these nodules are benign. However, some nodules can cause neck discomfort or aesthetic deformity in the neck. Until a few years ago, the only effective therapy for these situations would be surgery (which involves removing at least the affected side of the thyroid). However, the surgery requires general anesthesia, requires hospitalization and leaves a visible scar on the neck, in addition to the possibility of some complications, such as hoarseness.\u00a0Removing half of the thyroid may also require thyroid hormone replacement, with this replacement being mandatory whenever the entire thyroid is removed. Interest in less invasive techniques that can significantly reduce the size of benign nodules without the need for surgery has increased in recent years. Radiofrequency is currently the most studied and practiced of these minimally invasive techniques.",
        "Advantages and Benefits": "As it is a non-invasive and relatively simple procedure, it is performed using only local anesthesia, under ultrasound control and without the need for hospitalization. Radiofrequency is the least invasive technique with the most published results and which consistently achieves the greatest reduction in nodular volume.",
        "Indications": "This procedure is indicated for benign thyroid nodules, so it requires that a cytology test be performed beforehand, with a benign result for the nodule to be treated.",
        "Methodology": "The technique consists of inserting a special needle (connected to a radiofrequency generator) into the nodule, and destroying it through the thermal action of the radiofrequency. The treated nodules will then undergo a progressive reduction in volume over the following months and years. These reductions generally reach 70% of nodular volume and sometimes more. This volume reduction makes it possible, in most cases, to effectively eliminate compressive symptoms and/or aesthetic deformity caused by natural nodules.",
        "Complications": "Although simple and minimally invasive, this procedure can cause some local complications, generally temporary, namely local pain. Deandrea M. et al.

    "Dental treatments": {
        "Microscopic Endodontics": "Endodontics corresponds to the area of \u200b\u200bDentistry that encompasses the treatment of dental pulp. The dental pulp is an organ made up of nerves and blood vessels, which are found inside the tooth, and is commonly called the \"nerve\". When this tissue is affected, for example by a fracture or tooth decay, an inflammatory state occurs which can involve pain when cold. If this aggression continues, without the tooth being treated, the inflammatory state becomes so advanced that the dental pulp loses its ability to defend and recover. Faced with this irreversible state, normally accompanied by intense and prolonged pain when cold, hot, or even spontaneous, it becomes necessary to completely remove the dental pulp, that is, to carry out endodontic treatment.",
        "Aesthetics": "Aesthetic treatments promote a clear improvement in your smile, image and self-confidence. From changing the color of your teeth (tooth whitening) to changing their shape (crowns and veneers), there are countless alternatives. 1. Teeth Whitening 2. Facets 3. Crowns 4. Tooth fractures  1. Teeth Whitening It consists of changing the color of the teeth, making them whiter. This dental treatment does not wear down or weaken the teeth. A gel is applied to the surface of the teeth that will whiten them. It can be done in two ways: in the office or at home (but always with proper guidance). The final results are equivalent, the only difference being the speed at which the desired color is obtained.  2. Facets Veneers consist of changing the shape and/or color by applying a thin ceramic or composite sheet to the tooth. This treatment involves minimal wear on the visible surface of the tooth (0.3 to 0.7 mm) which allows the transition between the tooth and the veneer to be hidden. They also allow for the closure of unsightly spaces between teeth (diastema). 3. Crowns Crowns on natural teeth Crowns are recommended in cases where it is necessary to provide greater resistance and durability to damaged teeth, improve the aesthetics, shape or alignment of the teeth in the dental arch. They involve greater wear of around 1 mm around the entire tooth. They are made of pure ceramic in order to obtain an optimal final aesthetic result. Crowns on implants A crown can also be placed over a dental implant, restoring the shape and structure of the missing natural tooth.",
        "Oral Hygiene": "Nowadays, with the new preventive paradigm in Oral Health and the generalization of dental implants, the specialty of Oral Hygiene has come to occupy a prominent place in Oral Health, far beyond simple scaling, commonly known as \"teeth cleaning\". Oral hygienists therefore have a preventive, educational and habit-modulating role suited to each patient's condition, supporting the dentist in the treatment of diseases such as gingivitis and periodontitis (the most prevalent diseases in the Western world) or even halitosis (bad breath). Its function becomes decisive in rehabilitations with dental implants, since the bacterial plaque that is deposited deep in the gingival tissues is one of the main reasons for the failure of implants. Brushing and flossing instructions are two very important components of an oral hygiene consultation. What is done at an oral hygiene consultation? This consultation involves screening for tooth decay, gum disease and diagnosing other problems that may arise. Tartar and plaque are removed through scaling and root planing, as well as polishing and sandblasting with sodium bicarbonate particles to eliminate surface stains. In the case of children, fissure sealants are also applied. Other products and techniques used include the application of high-concentration fluoride, products that reduce tooth sensitivity, whitening and maintenance of implant-supported restorations. Regular visits to the Oral Hygiene consultation are a determining factor in maintaining your teeth and smile.",
        "Pediatric dentistry": "A pediatric dentistry consultation is a consultation aimed at children, with the aim of screening for any problems related to the child's oral health. From the time the first tooth erupts, it is advisable to have the first consultation so that parents are informed of all alternatives for maintaining the child's oral health, oral hygiene and habits that may in some way cause changes to the child's dental arch. Care at an early age positively prepares the child for future treatments that may be necessary. It is also intended for patients who due to age, intellectual immaturity or any type of disability that decreases the ability to cooperate. These patients can be treated using alternative resources, such as conscious sedation or general anesthesia. Conscious sedation is an anesthesia technique that allows the child to cooperate with the dentist as fear and anxiety are greatly reduced without ever losing consciousness. General anesthesia is an anesthetic technique that eliminates pain, muscle paralysis, reflexes, amnesia and, most importantly, unconsciousness. General anesthesia makes the patient unable to feel and/or react to any stimulus in the environment, allowing any type of treatment to be performed without the need for the child's cooperation. We brush our teeth every day, but that doesn't mean we've mastered the technique. Learn about some oral hygiene mistakes and how to correct them.

    "Trochanteritis": {
        "What is trochanteritis?": "Trochanteritis is a painful condition located on the outer side of the hip, radiating down the lower limb, which is why it can be confused with sciatica. This condition is also known as trochanteric bursitis or greater trochanter pain syndrome. This condition results from inflammation of a bursa, which corresponds to a gelatinous sac-shaped structure that contains fluid. There are bursae in several joints, the most important being those located in the shoulder, elbow, hip, knee and heel. Bursae act as cushions between bones and surrounding tissues, reducing the friction that occurs between muscles and bones when muscles contract. The greater trochanter is a protrusion located in the upper portion of the femur where muscles essential for the functioning of the hip joint are inserted. This greater trochanter has a bursa that can become inflamed, causing this condition. Trochanteritis can result from causes other than inflammation of the trochanteric bursa. It can originate in the tendons or neighboring muscles (gluteus medius and gluteus minor, among others) and can have many different causes, the most common being mechanical overload. It is a disease that affects women about four times more often than men. There are approximately 1.8 cases/1,000 per year and it is a condition that affects between 17.6% and 35% of adults, depending on the population studied.",
        "Symptoms of trochanteritis": "The most common symptoms of trochanteritis are pain on the outer side of the hip, running down the thigh. In the early stages, the pain is more acute, localized and intense, and later becomes more diffuse. The pain of trochanteritis is aggravated by movement and when pressure is exerted on the hip. This pain tends to be worse at night, when the patient lies on the affected hip, and when the patient tries to get up from a chair after sitting for a while. It may also be worse after long walks or climbing stairs.",
        "Causes of trochanteritis": "Trochanteritis can affect anyone, but it is more common in women and in middle-aged or older people. It is less common in young people and men. The most common risk factors are overuse injuries from repetitive motions, such as running, climbing stairs, cycling, or standing for long periods of time. With regard to sporting activities, running is what is most associated with this condition, especially when new exercise regimens are introduced. A fall onto the hip, hitting the hip against a raised surface, or lying on one side of the body for a long time can also cause trochanteritis. Spinal injuries (scoliosis, lumbar spine arthritis), an asymmetry in the length between the two legs, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, previous surgeries (hip replacement), bone spurs or calcium deposits that form within the tendons that insert into the greater trochanter are other possible causes of trochanteritis.",
        "Diagnosis of trochanteritis": "A medical examination can identify the painful area in the hip region. Difficulty sleeping on the affected side is an important diagnostic element. Radiographic studies and Magnetic Resonance Imaging allow for a more accurate diagnosis.",
        "Treatment of trochanteritis": "Treatment for trochanteritis generally involves changing physical activity (in cases where the injury is associated with repetitive and excessive activity), using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, local ice and exercises to improve the condition of the muscles and tendons. Physiotherapy, with local treatments, is very effective, although there is not much scientific evidence regarding its usefulness in these cases. It is really important to avoid activities that aggravate symptoms. Using a cane for a week or more can be very helpful. Anti-inflammatories can cause several side effects, which is why they should be used after medical prescription and under proper monitoring. It may be necessary to complement this treatment with an injection into the bursa of local anesthetic and corticosteroid (infiltration). If the first injection does not work, it can be repeated once or twice, every few weeks. In cases that do not improve with conservative treatment, after about 2 to 4 months, surgical treatment may be indicated. However, surgical treatment is rarely used. The surgery involves removing the bursa. This removal affects the hip and it can function normally without the bursa. This type of surgery can be performed through arthroscopy, which consists of creating two small incisions and is, therefore, less invasive, less painful and allows for faster recovery. After surgery, a rehabilitation period is important, generally short, using a cane or crutches.",
        "Trochanteritis prevention": "This prevention of trochanteritis involves identifying the behaviors and activities that increase inflammation, so that they can be avoided. Adequate warm-up with thigh muscle extension is essential before beginning physical activity that affects the hip. When cycling, it is important not to adjust the seat to a position that is too high. Repetitive movements that put strain on the hips are particularly important. You should not remain seated for long periods of time or always lie on the same side. When you need to bend over, you should bend your knees instead of your back or hips. Losing excess weight is important. If there is asymmetry between the two legs, appropriate footwear should be used to correct this difference. It is also helpful to maintain the strength and flexibility of all the muscles in the hip region.

    "Venous thrombosis": {
        "What is it?": "Venous thrombosis, or phlebitis, is characterized by the presence of a large clot attached to the inner wall of a vein (thrombus). In addition to blocking venous circulation in the affected vein, the clot can break free and cause an embolism in a major organ such as the lungs or brain, hence the importance of diagnosis and treatment as soon as possible. Most cases occur in the lower leg, thigh or pelvis, although they can also occur in other areas of the body, including the arm, brain, intestine, liver or kidney. In the acute phase, the main complications are pulmonary embolism and venous gangrene, which can lead to limb amputation and high mortality. In the late phase, the most frequent complication is post-thrombotic syndrome, which can be characterized by pigmented dermatitis mainly on the leg, lipodermosclerosis, edema predominantly in the evening, varicose veins of the lower limbs and active or healed ulcers. This condition, which affects millions of people, is responsible for significant mortality (over 10% in hospital settings).",
        "Symptoms": "Most patients do not have symptoms that indicate it. However, if these develop, they set in suddenly, the most common being pain, edema, sensation of heaviness, change in the color and temperature of the limb and partial functional incapacity.",
        "Causes": "Some risk factors that can lead to the development of thrombosis are: advanced age, pregnancy, use of oral contraceptives, obesity, varicose veins in the lower limbs, neoplasia, trauma and hypercoagulable states. In the presence of these signs, it may be necessary to carry out a genetic study.",
        "Diagnosis": "The most commonly used diagnostic test for confirmation and location of thrombosis is Doppler echocardiography or venous angiodynogram (as it has high sensitivity, specificity and is non-invasive). Sometimes, it may be necessary to perform phlebography which, despite being more specific, is an invasive exam with administration of contrast.",
        "Treatment": "In the initial phase, treatment of thrombosis may require rest with postural drainage of the affected limb or walking with appropriate elastic stockings, anticoagulation with low molecular weight or unfractionated heparin, or possibly fibrinolysis, with surgery rarely being necessary. Currently, it is possible to treat the vast majority of patients on an outpatient basis, with hospitalization only being necessary in very specific situations. Maintenance of oral hypocoagulation (often warfarin and for at least six months) under INR laboratory control is currently the current practice that may be changed with the progressive introduction of new oral antithrombotic medications. Thrombosis requires specialized, regular medical surveillance and periodic ultrasound control.",

    "Tuberculosis": {
        "What is it?": "It is caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis, also known as Koch's Bacillus. This infection is transmitted from person to person by air and, therefore, only people with pulmonary or laryngeal tuberculosis are contagious. Every time one of these patients coughs, sneezes or talks they release small droplets that carry Koch's bacillus. It remains one of the world's biggest public health problems. Even today, more people die from tuberculosis than from any other curable infectious disease. For these reasons, the World Health Organization declared this disease a medical emergency. It is estimated that nine million new cases arise per year and, of these, 1.8 million end up dying. These numbers are particularly shocking if we consider that we are facing a curable disease, whose treatment is accessible and cheap. In Europe there are around 500,000 people with tuberculosis, around a thousand people fall ill every day and around 40,000 die each year. In Portugal, 2,480 cases of tuberculosis were declared in 2012, which represents a reduction of 6.1% compared to 2011. The success of treatment in pulmonary tuberculosis has been falling, reaching values \u200b\u200bbelow 85% since 2010. Although it can affect anyone, it mainly affects the most vulnerable, the elderly and children, the marginalized and prisoners. Despite the existence of treatment, resistance often arises and is increasing in the European region. As such, there has been a gradual reduction in therapeutic success. It is now possible to diagnose tuberculosis and test resistance to some drugs in just over an hour and a half, but these tests are not yet available in all countries.",
        "Symptoms": "In the vast majority of cases, it manifests itself in the lungs, since the initial contact of the bacillus with the body is made through inhalation. However, other organs can be affected, such as the ganglia, meninges, pericardium, bones, kidneys, skin or intestines. These forms of tuberculosis are, as a rule, not contagious. This disease usually has a discreet clinical presentation, progressing without the patient noticing over days, weeks or even months. The most common complaints are tiredness, lack of appetite, weight loss, night sweats and low fever (37.5\u00baC) at the end of the day. There may be other symptoms depending on the organs involved. In the case of pulmonary tuberculosis, the most common is a cough, either dry or with phlegm, which may contain blood. Symptoms are more severe, more difficult to diagnose and treat in patients with lower immune defenses.",
        "Causes": "Inhaling air with bacilli that will reach and deposit in the lungs. From that moment on, either the body's defenses manage to eliminate them and no disease occurs or the bacteria overcome these barriers and the infection sets in.\u00a0 There are also situations in which the bacillus is not eliminated, but is kept inactive for years or even for life. These individuals are healthy and not contagious, but they have a 10% chance of becoming ill at some point in their lives, with this risk being greatest in the two years following the infection (latent tuberculosis). The droplets containing the bacillus are invisible to the naked eye and can remain suspended in the air for several hours, particularly if the individual is in an unventilated place. The likelihood of becoming infected depends on the number of infectious droplets in the air, the time and location of exposure, and the susceptibility of the person exposed to that environment. As tuberculosis is a disease transmitted by inhalation, it is necessary to avoid unprotected close respiratory contact with people who have tuberculosis in the contagious phase, especially if they are not taking medication. If this is not possible, you should try to ensure that the contact sites are ventilated and exposed to sunlight, as the bacillus is very sensitive to ultraviolet rays. In non-ventilated places, the use of a mask is mandatory. Normally, if the patient takes the medication as prescribed by the doctor, after the first 15 days the risk of contagion begins to reduce.",
        "Diagnosis": "There are two types of screening tests for tuberculosis: the Mantoux tuberculin skin test and the blood test. In the first case, a small amount of a substance called tuberculin is injected under the skin of the forearm. After two to three days, an assessment is made and, if there is a skin reaction with redness and a papule that is measured, it is considered that the person has had contact with the tuberculosis bacillus. Additional blood tests are needed to determine whether the individual has latent tuberculosis or ongoing disease. To determine whether an infection is active or whether the lungs are infected, sputum and lung fluid tests, X-rays and chest computed tomography are performed.",
        "Treatment": "With medication administered orally (tablets, capsules or syrup). The minimum duration of therapy is six months, varying depending on the organ involved, progression or severity of the disease, and may be longer than one year. Correct treatment allows a cure in more than 95% of cases. It is essential to strictly adhere to the medication in order to avoid the development of resistance. Most cases are treated on an outpatient basis, without the need for hospitalization. This is justified in cases of more serious illness or for patients without the social/psychological conditions to avoid contagion or maintain compliance with the prescribed medication.",
        "Prevention": "It is important to track close contacts of patients with tuberculosis (mainly pulmonary or upper airways). In addition to enabling the detection of new cases, it also allows diagnosing latent cases and treating them. The BCG (bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin) vaccine is useful in preventing severe and disseminated forms of the disease in children, although it does not prevent infection or even the development of the disease. All newborns should be vaccinated. Revaccination throughout life does not increase the level of protection and is therefore not recommended. Northern Regional Health Administration, I.P.

        "What is it?": "Pituitary adenomas are benign tumors that originate in the cells of the anterior portion of this gland. They can be functional (produce one or more hormones) or non-functional. These constitute 30% of cases. Most pituitary tumors are benign and are abnormal cell proliferations that produce hormones (functional tumors) and, as they grow, can compress neighboring structures. They are usually treated with surgery or radiation and drugs to control the effects of excessive hormone production.",
        "Symptoms": "Although these are benign conditions and often do not produce hormones, pituitary tumors can cause symptoms due to compression (headaches, changes in vision) or due to loss of production of normal pituitary hormones (which can cause anything from infertility to fatigue). Functioning adenomas cause specific clinical symptoms, depending on their size, location and the hormone they produce. They may or may not be associated with symptoms of compression.",
        "Causes": "The exact cause of the development of this type of tumor is still under debate. Some conditions can increase the likelihood of its occurrence: Carney complex (a rare genetic disorder that causes benign tumors);/ Familial isolated pituitary adenomas (FIPA), an uncommon condition that causes the body to grow larger than normal;/ Isolated familial acromegaly;/ McCune-Albright syndrome (defined by the clinical triad of fibrous dysplasia of bone, caf\u00e9-au-lait spots on the skin, and precocious puberty);/ Multiple endocrine neoplasia, type I and type IV (MEN1, MEN4) which can cause tumors in the glands;/",

    "Orbital tumors": {
        "What is it?": "Orbital tumors correspond to anomalous lesions, which can be benign or malignant, located in the space around the eyeball, which also houses the optic nerve, muscles, lacrimal gland and fat. Early identification is essential for timely diagnosis and treatment. Types An orbital tumor is not necessarily a malignant lesion. Most cases are benign, grow slowly and may go unnoticed for several years. In children, dermoid cysts and infantile hemangiomas are more common, benign lesions that result from early developmental changes. Although malignant tumors are rare in this age group, the observation of a more prominent eye and/or swelling of the eyelids should prompt immediate investigation. In adults, some signs may indicate the growth of an anomalous mass at the orbital level, and should be promptly investigated: the observation of a more prominent eye, strabismus of recent onset, sudden drooping of the upper eyelid, which may or may not be accompanied by loss of vision. Not being specific to a particular diagnosis, these manifestations can occur in the context of other diseases such as thyroid orbitopathy, non-specific primary inflammations or secondary inflammations to systemic diseases, among others. A thorough ophthalmological examination, complemented when necessary with other complementary exams, will allow the differential diagnosis between non-neoplastic or neoplastic lesions, and within these between benign and malignant lesions.",
        "Symptoms": "They depend on the characteristics and location of the tumor. Progressive prominence of the eyeball, double vision, drooping of the upper eyelid or reduced visual acuity may be noted.",
        "Treatment": "It depends on the type of injury. Definitive diagnosis will usually require biopsy of part or all of the lesion, which in the latter case may be curative.

    "Tumors of the eyelids": {
        "What is it?": "An eyelid tumor is the growth of an abnormal lesion that may be benign or malignant. It is essential that this distinction is made early, through a detailed examination by a specialist with experience in the area, who will be able to indicate the most appropriate type and treatment. Genetic factors, sun exposure and smoking are known risk factors for the development of eyelid tumors. Not all tumors are malignant. \u00a0They are often benign lesions, with slow growth, the most common being papillomas, cysts, seborrheic keratosis, xanthelasmas, molluscum contagiosum, etc. There are, however, more serious tumors that, if not treated in a timely manner, can compromise other adjacent structures and even metastasize to more distant locations. Basal cell carcinoma is the most common malignant tumor of the eyelid, accounting for approximately 90% of all malignant lesions. It is more common on the lower eyelid and in light-skinned individuals with a history of sun exposure. Although it grows gradually over months or years, and its metastasis is very rare, it is a locally invasive tumor, and early diagnosis and treatment are important. Other malignant lesions that can develop in this region are squamous cell carcinomas, sebaceous carcinomas or melanomas. These are more aggressive tumors that can generate distant metastases, which can be life-threatening.",
        "Symptoms": "Eyelid tumors (benign or malignant) manifest themselves in a variable way, and may be elevated or flat lesions, pigmented or not. Some characteristics that may raise the suspicion that the lesion is malignant are rapid growth, distortion of the eyelid margin, change in the texture and appearance of the skin, loss of eyelashes, the appearance of a central ulcer that can bleed and does not heal, a lump persistent or a chalasium (also known as a stye) that does not improve. The presence of any of these changes should prompt observation by a specialist for adequate diagnosis and treatment.",
        "Treatment": "It depends on the type of tumor. A benign lesion can be monitored or removed, a tumor with suspicious characteristics must be analyzed through biopsy with removal of all or part of the tumor and subsequent reconstruction. A precise technique and detailed knowledge of the local anatomy will allow the defect resulting from the removal of a tumor to be resolved, with a good functional and aesthetic result.

    "Gastric ulcer": {
        "What is it?": "A gastric ulcer, or stomach ulcer, is a lesion that occurs in the lining (mucosa) of the stomach. It can also appear in the duodenum or esophagus. It is a very common problem, with one of the most common causes being the consumption of anti-inflammatories. In fact, acetylsalicylic acid and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are among the most prescribed medications worldwide. In Portugal, around 800 thousand people take these medications daily. It is estimated that the risk of gastrointestinal complications associated with their consumption is four to five times greater than that of the population that does not consume them, and is even higher in the elderly and/or individuals with a history of ulcers. There are few studies in Portugal on gastrointestinal complications associated with the consumption of anti-inflammatories, but in the United States, it is estimated that around 20 million Americans suffer from ulcers at least once throughout their lives.",
        "Symptoms": "The most common complaints of gastric ulcers are abdominal pain described as a burning sensation that occurs two to three hours after eating. The pain tends to be worse when the stomach is empty and can occur at night. It improves with the use of antacids and with food intake. Patients with this pathology also report difficulty in digestion, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite and weight. In more serious cases, in which the ulcer progresses and perforates the stomach wall, the pain is much more intense, accompanied by abdominal rigidity and blood loss in vomit or feces. These situations constitute medical emergencies and require immediate hospital care.",
        "Causes": "The stomach walls are normally protected from the effects of the acid normally present in this organ and which is essential for the digestive process. If this protection is affected, a stomach ulcer can form. One of the most common causes is Helicobacter pylori infection, which weakens the stomach's protective barrier. It is estimated that this bacteria causes around 20% of gastric ulcer cases. Prolonged use of anti-inflammatory drugs also affects the defenses of the stomach wall and is a very common cause of ulcers. Some people are more susceptible to the effects of these medications on the stomach. Antiplatelet agents can also cause this condition. Alcohol abuse and radiotherapy can also be associated with gastric ulcers. There are risk factors for its development, such as family history, advanced age, chronic pain due to prolonged use of anti-inflammatories, diabetes, tobacco, coffee and chronic stress. However, there is some controversy regarding the role of stress in ulcers, and there is no consensus on its responsibility in this disease.",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of gastric ulcer is based on medical examination and complementary tests such as endoscopy. During the procedure, it is customary to collect small fragments of tissue for other examinations. This collection is called a biopsy. There are specific tests to detect Helicobacter pylori infection. One of them is the breath test, which is very simple and reliable.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment involves eliminating the cause, controlling the injury and its potential complications, and preventing new episodes. There are medications indicated for relieving complaints associated with ulcers and medications capable of eliminating Helicobacter pylori infection. Surgery may be necessary in more complicated cases and changes in lifestyle and diet are important to relieve symptoms and prevent future ulcers. The most commonly used medications are antacids, which relieve the pain associated with this disease but do not treat it, proton pump inhibitors and H2 receptor inhibitors, which reduce acid production, some antibiotics are also effective in eliminating the Helicobacter pylori. It is often necessary to combine several of these medications to achieve good results. Diet is important in the recovery and prevention of gastric ulcers. It should include foods rich in fiber, such as fruits and vegetables. Apples, onions, garlic and tea can help inhibit the growth of Helicobacter pylori. Spicy foods tend to aggravate ulcer symptoms and should be avoided. Tobacco, alcohol, coffee (even decaffeinated) and carbonated drinks should be reduced because they increase the production of acid in the stomach. Physical exercise is also a good component of the treatment and prevention of gastric ulcers and many other diseases. Finally, it is important to learn how to manage stress.",
        "What is the prognosis for gastric ulcer?": "In general, with proper treatment, most ulcers heal within six to eight months. However, relapses can occur, especially if Helicobacter pylori is not eliminated. Complications, such as bleeding, perforation or intestinal obstruction, are rare but potentially very dangerous. Bleeding occurs in approximately 15% of patients with ulcers. Intestinal obstruction results from scars that form in inflamed areas and can cause tightness that prevents the passage of food.\u00a0This complication is more common in duodenal ulcers. On the other hand, the presence of ulcers associated with Helicobacter pylori increases the risk of stomach cancer, which reinforces the importance of early and adequate diagnosis and treatment.",
        "Prevention": "Prevention involves controlling all risk factors. In the case of anti-inflammatories, if they are essential, stomach-protective medications should also be used.

    "Uveites": {
        "What is it?": "Uveitis is a generic term that encompasses a set of rare ophthalmological pathologies, with an approximate prevalence of 100 cases per 100,000 people, but potentially serious, being responsible for 10 to 15% of cases of blindness.  By definition, uveitis is an inflammation of the uvea, the vascular layer of the eyeball. The uvea, in turn, can be divided into the anterior uvea (consisting of the iris and ciliary body), which is in contact with the lens and anterior structures of the eyeball, and the posterior uvea (choroidea), which is in direct contact with the retina. . The uvea is the most vascularized tissue in the human body.  This wealth of blood vessels is related to their function of nourishing the retina's photoreceptors, the main cells responsible for vision. However, this characteristic of the uvea also makes it highly susceptible to infectious or inflammatory processes, local or originating elsewhere in the body.",
        "Causes": "There are dozens of diseases that can cause uveitis. However, in more than 50% of cases a specific cause cannot be identified. Possible causes can be grouped into: Infectious, such as toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis, viruses or bacterial or fungal endophthalmitis;;/ Systemic autoimmune diseases, namely Beh\u00e7et's disease, sarcoidosis, ankylosing spondylitis, inflammatory bowel disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus;;/ Specific autoimmune diseases of the eye, such as birdshot retinochoroidopathy or Fuchs' heterochromic uveitis;;/ Traumatic.;/",
        "Symptoms": "The signs and symptoms associated with uveitis are varied and depend on the ocular structure involved: If the front of the eye is affected, symptoms include sensitivity to light (photophobia), red eye, blurred vision, and eye pain.;/ If the back of the eye is affected, eye symptoms include visual loss, flashes of light (photopsias), and floaters (myodesopsias).;/ Uveitis can affect one or both eyes and come on suddenly or occur over several days. If left untreated or diagnosed late, uveitis can result in glaucoma, cataracts, retinal detachment or permanent visual loss.",
        "Treatment": "The treatment of this pathology depends on its cause. In cases of infectious etiology, anti-infectives (antibiotics or antivirals, for example) are used to eliminate the microorganism responsible. In most cases, it is necessary to combat the inflammation using immunosuppression, which reduces the activity of the immune system. Corticosteroids are generally used as the first line of treatment and can be prescribed locally (using eye drops or injections) or systemically (tablets). In the case of severe uveitis, other immunosuppressive medications may be necessary to effectively control the inflammation.

    "Vaginitis": {
        "What is it?": "The vagina is a dynamic ecosystem that evolves over the course of a woman's life and is influenced by hormones, sexual and reproductive activity. The pH of the vagina from premenarche to puberty is almost neutral (pH 7.0). In adolescence, due to the influence of estrogens, there is an increase in the thickness of the vaginal squamous epithelium, with a concomitant increase in glycogen levels. This increase causes the predominant flora to be lactobacillus and the pH drops to below 4.5. In healthy women, this low pH remains until menopause, when the epithelium becomes thinner and the pH of the vagina rises to values \u200b\u200bgreater than 6.0. Lactobacillus exist in high numbers in the normal vagina,\u00a0 more than 10 million organisms per gram of vaginal fluid. Anaerobes, streptococci or staphylococci exist in smaller numbers. Women with high lactobacillus are less colonized by other infections such as Gardnella vaginallis, mycoplasmas, and anaerobes, as well as having less bacterial vaginosis or other sexually transmitted diseases, in addition to having healthier pregnancies. In women with HIV, but with a high number of lactobacillus, there is less spread of the virus in secretions. Vaginal symptoms are the main reason for gynecology consultations and emergency care. There has been little progress in the ability to diagnose and effectively treat vaginitis.",
        "Symptoms": "Your symptoms may vary depending on what causes the infection or inflammation. Some of the most common manifestations are: Abnormal vaginal discharge with an unpleasant odor;/ Burning sensation outside the vagina during urination;/ Itching around the vagina;/ Discomfort during sexual intercourse;/",
        "Causes": "Bacterial vaginosis is the main cause of abnormal discharge (leucorrhoea), followed by vulvovaginal candidiasis and trichomoniasis (although less common). Inflammatory desquamative vaginitis of unknown aetiology is the cause of purulent vaginitis. Non-infectious causes include a lack of estrogen (postpartum or post-menopause) or allergic vaginitis.",
        "Bacterial vaginosis": "It is probably the result of complex interactions between many species of bacteria, modified by host responses. Gardnella vaginallis has been identified in women with bacterial vaginosis. Approximately 50% of asymptomatic patients with normal pH are colonized with this bacterium. Prevalence: 29.5% have bacterial vaginosis. Symptoms: Symptomatic vaginosis covers 60% of all cases of increased, foul-smelling vaginal secretion. Risk factors: The event that leads to the shift to anaerobic dominance that characterizes vaginosis is unknown, but sexual activity may be a factor, at least in some women. It happens among those who have new or several sexual partners and also among homosexuals. Condoms protect against the disease. Treatment: As the causal factor is unknown, treatment attempts to reduce the number of these anaerobes and improve the symptoms of increased vaginal discharge with an odor. The usual treatment is oral or vaginal metronidazole or clindamycin. Both are recommended for bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy, taken orally. It is important to inform the attending physician of the presence of this abnormal secretion during pregnancy so that appropriate treatment can be prescribed to prevent obstetric complications. The treatments are effective although there is a high rate of recurrence: from 11% to 29% at three months. The biweekly use of vaginal metronidazole is effective in preventing vaginosis.",
        "Diagnosis": "A detailed medical history, particularly regarding previous sexually transmitted infections and sexual habits, is essential to guide the diagnosis. A pelvic examination assesses inflammation and any vaginal discharge. Sometimes a sample is taken to determine the cause of the inflammation. The cause of vaginitis can be diagnosed by checking the appearance of the vaginal fluid, its pH levels, and microscopic detection of specific cells.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment depends on the cause. It may include topical steroids applied to the skin, topical or oral antibiotics, antifungals, or antibacterial creams. Bacterial vaginitis is usually treated with antibiotics, such as metronidazole or clindamycin. Medications used to treat a yeast infection include butoconazole and clotrimazole. Other options include cortisone cream to treat severe irritation and antihistamines if the inflammation appears to be due to an allergic reaction; topical estrogen cream is also recommended if the vaginitis is due to low levels of this hormone. If a woman is pregnant she should tell her doctor why she has vaginitis and some treatment options may not be suitable.",

    "Valvulopatia": {
        "What is it?": "Valvular heart disease corresponds to diseases that affect the heart valves, preventing them from opening and/or closing properly. There are four (aortic, mitral, tricuspid and pulmonary) and all of them can present anomalies that manifest themselves differently. Valvular diseases that affect the aortic and mitral valves are the most important, due to their impact on the body. The function of heart valves is to regulate blood flow between the various chambers of the heart and the main vessels. As such, they are essential for the correct functioning of the entire cardiovascular system.",
        "Symptoms": "Valvular heart disease can be asymptomatic for long periods of time. The main symptoms are shortness of breath, chest pain and syncope (fainting). These symptoms tend to be more evident after exertion that increases blood flow. They can also cause arrhythmias, with a feeling of palpitations, and when the cause is endocarditis, fever occurs. If the disease is left untreated, a heart attack, stroke, blood clots or sudden death from cardiac arrest can occur.",
        "Causes": "The most common causes of valvulopathy are rheumatic fever, following a streptococcal infection, and degenerative forms. These have been increasing in frequency, following the increase in population life expectancy. Since they open and close around 60 times per minute, after 70 years they will have performed this movement more than two billion times, which explains their aging, hardening and calcification. Congenital malformations are also common. Asendocarditis, which corresponds to infectious processes of the valves, is also common and can occur, for example, after dental treatment during which microorganisms enter circulation and deposit in the valves, especially if they present structural changes. Trauma can also cause valvulopathy. Coronary heart disease, high blood pressure, aneurysms, some tumors are other possible origins, as well as drug use and exposure to radiation.",
        "Diagnosis": "Medical examination is very important here and cardiac auscultation makes it possible to detect many cases of valvular heart disease. The echocardiogram allows a better definition of the disease and its severity, being important for the therapeutic strategy. It may also be useful to perform a simple or exercise electrocardiogram and, in some cases, a cardiac catheterization.",
        "Treatment": "There is no medication that can treat valvular heart disease. However, adopting a healthy lifestyle and taking some medications can alleviate symptoms and prevent complications. Depending on the clinical case, the use of antibiotics, anticoagulants, and medications to control blood pressure may be recommended. Surgical treatment for valvulopathy consists of repairing the valve or replacing it with a prosthetic valve (synthetic or biological). In some cases, it is possible to dilate it by inserting a catheter, without the need for surgery.",
        "Prevention": "It is important to treat any tonsillitis that lasts more than 48 hours, especially if accompanied by a fever. In these cases, the use of an antibiotic can prevent the development of rheumatic fever and consequent damage to the heart valves. Controlling blood pressure, diabetes and atherosclerosis is equally essential. You should avoid smoking, consume alcoholic beverages in moderation, maintain a balanced diet, low in salt and fat, perform physical exercise regularly and maintain a healthy weight.

    "chicken pox": {
        "What is it?": "Chickenpox is a viral infection caused by the Herpes varicella zoster virus, also responsible for other diseases, such as herpes or mononucleosis. Chickenpox is one of the most common childhood illnesses. It is so contagious that more than 90% of people who have not had contact with the virus end up becoming infected. The infection is most common in late winter and early spring and is contracted through direct contact with infected skin or with particles of saliva released when a patient coughs or sneezes. The ease of contagion is accentuated by the fact that one person can infect another before symptoms even appear.",
        "Symptoms": "The virus can be transmitted through respiratory secretions, by dissemination through the air\u00a0when the infected person coughs, sneezes or talks or by contact with the liquid from skin lesions, when they rupture. Another mode of transmission of the virus is transplacentally, which can lead to infection of the fetus. The most typical symptoms are the presence of small blisters filled with liquid on the skin, mainly on the trunk, but which can also appear on the face, scalp and genitals or even spread throughout the body. Before its appearance, chickenpox makes itself known by the presence of pink, flat, superficial spots that, in a second phase, transform until very thin-walled blisters are formed that contain a transparent liquid. They end up breaking, leaving small lesions on the skin that dry out, until a crust forms that also disappears, generally speaking, without leaving any marks. These different phases can be present simultaneously in the patient. In some cases, it manifests itself mildly, forming few blisters. In others, they erupt in hundreds, sometimes even on the roof of the mouth or inside the rectum and vagina, causing great discomfort. The itching caused is very severe and can cause skin damage and/or bacterial infection. As such, it is very important to keep children's nails short and clean in order to minimize these risks. Although the blisters are the most visible sign of chickenpox, there are other symptoms such as fever, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, headaches and general malaise. These symptoms are usually mild. Although it is a benign disease, complications such as pneumonia, encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), cellulitis or toxic shock can occur. It is important to know that, although each person has only one episode of chickenpox, the virus remains latent in the nerve cells. When it is reactivated, due to illness, stress, sun exposure or medication use, it emerges in the form of a new disease called shingles (also caused by the herpes zoster virus). This occurs in about 10% of adults who had chickenpox in childhood. Chickenpox tends to be more serious when acquired in adulthood, especially in patients whose defenses are reduced due to other pathologies or the use of some medications such as corticosteroids. In fact, adolescents and adults are more susceptible to serious complications, with a 20-fold increase in mortality between the ages of 15 and 44. Pregnant women are also a particular risk group. If a woman did not have chickenpox in childhood and contracts it during pregnancy, especially in the first few weeks, the fetus may be born with congenital anomalies. If the disease is contracted in the week before birth, there is a risk that the baby will be born with an infection that can be fatal. On the contrary, if the mother has chickenpox before becoming pregnant, the fetus receives antibodies through the placenta or during breastfeeding, which reduces the likelihood of contracting it or, if it does appear, it will be in a very mild form.",
        "Causes": "It is caused by the virusHerpes varicella zoster, also responsible for herpes or mononucleosis.",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of chickenpox is mainly clinical. In general, laboratory evaluation is not necessary.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment essentially involves controlling and relieving symptoms. Itching can be reduced by using warm water baths and/or by using calamine-based lotions on the affected areas. On the face, extreme care must be taken to avoid contact with the eyes. Fever and pain can be controlled with painkillers, but it is important not to use aspirin in children, given the risk of Reye's syndrome. If necessary, antihistamines can be used to control itching and, in more severe cases, antivirals. Rest is also helpful.",
        "Prevention": "Considering that this is a contagious disease, it is essential to\u00a0isolate the infected child until the blisters dry completely. The vaccine, although it does not guarantee 100% protection, ensures that even if chickenpox does occur, it will be much milder. It is not part of the National Vaccination Plan, but is available in pharmacies. It can be administered from 12 months of age, in which case only one dose is necessary. From 13 years of age, two doses are injected, with an interval of six to ten weeks between them. The vaccine cannot be administered to immunocompromised individuals, pregnant women, children under one year of age or individuals undergoing salicylate therapy (they should not be prescribed until six weeks after vaccination). Like any other vaccine, it can cause some side effects at the site of administration, such as redness and fever.  Manual Merck online, 2013 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Julho de 2014 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, Maio de 2014 Society of Pediatric Infectiology/ Portuguese Society of Pediatrics, Recommendations for vaccination against chickenpox, Acta Pediatr Port2009:40(4):185-8 It is one of the benign childhood diseases, it affects younger children more and is very contagious.

    "Varicose veins": {
        "What are they?": "Varicose veins are dilated and tortuous veins located under the skin, which makes them easily identifiable. They must be distinguished from effusions, which are small-caliber vessels. Although they have different natures and importance, both are covered by the term Chronic Venous Disease and can and should be treated, to improve symptoms, to prevent progression to more serious cases or even just for aesthetic reasons. The prevalence of varicose veins in Portugal is between 20 and 25% of the population, with females being the most affected in a ratio of two to one, due to hormonal influence and pregnancy. Only 10% of diagnosed cases are indicated for surgery or alternative techniques, and the remainder must be treated with medication, compression stockings and simple sclerotherapy or external laser therapy.",
        "Symptoms": "The main symptoms of varicose veins are pain (of various characteristics), tiredness, heaviness, cramps, \u201ctingling\u201d and \u201citching\u201d in the lower limbs, accompanied or not by \u201cswelling\u201d, especially in the ankles and feet, worsening at the end of the day and with prolonged exposure to heat. Signs of seriousness include changes in the color and consistency of the skin on the lower third of the legs, which becomes brownish, scaly and hardened, and its appearance is a sign of the possible onset of a varicose ulcer. This clinical condition is very disabling, significantly interfering with the lives of those affected in the social, professional and psychological domains, due to a loss of body image and a consequent decrease in self-esteem.",
        "Causes": "The causes of varicose veins are varied but begin with congenital or inherited weakness of the walls of the veins, which thus become easily dilated by blood pressure. Additional factors include body weight, exposure to heat, prolonged periods spent standing and a sedentary lifestyle. Aging is in itself a sign of worsening, so general prophylaxis rules should be advised early on and appropriate treatments instituted.",
        "Diagnosis": "For the correct diagnosis of varicose veins, it is often necessary to perform a Doppler and/or Doppler ultrasound, carried out by the specialist at the first consultation.",
        "Treatment": "Varicose vein therapy is divided into conservative and non-conservative. The first includes skin care, especially hydration, use of phlebotonic medications and compression with elastic stockings or bandages. The second includes sclerotherapy (\u201cdrying\u201d), which can be simple or foam therapy with or without ultrasound control, transcutaneous or endovascular laser therapy, radiofrequency also performed endovascularly with ultrasound support and also the classic surgery known as saphenectomy. This variety of procedures can most often be performed on an outpatient basis and under local, regional or general anesthesia, and the choice depends on the specialist's assessment of the severity of the case. In many cases, it may even be necessary to use several methods simultaneously or in addition to obtaining the best result. The current trend in non-conservative treatment is the use of less invasive techniques for radiofrequency sclerosis, given the tolerance and absence of complications.",
        "Prevention": "Avoid long periods of standing or standing still. To do this, you must take short walking breaks or stand on your toes several times;;/ Avoid sitting for a long time, especially on hard-edged chairs, or crossing your legs. In this case, it is advisable to move your legs frequently;;/ Avoid very hot baths, as heat dilates varicose veins even further;;/ Avoid long exposure to the sun. You must swim or walk along the seashore, in the burst\u00a0area;;/ In hot weather, you should massage your legs with a cold shower (two minutes), from bottom to top;;/ Do not block venous circulation with tight trousers or boots, girdles, garters or stockings with strong elastic edges.;/ Sonovein ecotherapy is a non-invasive treatment for varicose veins. Orlanda Castelbranco, angiologist and vascular surgeon, explains what it consists of. Smoking, poor sleep, and excessive sun exposure are all enemies of healthy, youthful skin. But there are other mistakes you can avoid to prevent premature aging. A long, hot shower can be relaxing, but it can also dry out and irritate your skin.

    "Warts": {
        "What is it?": "They are a skin infection caused by the Human Papillomavirus. The virus penetrates the skin through previous lesions and develops to form a characteristic benign lesion in the form of a rough bump on its surface. They are a common viral infection that can affect anyone at any age.",
        "Symptoms": "Small calluses form on the skin that grow slowly, with small black dots visible in their center. Sometimes they become bulging and the surface looks like cauliflower. Warts can appear anywhere, but they are most common on the hands and feet.",
        "Causes": "It usually happens in humid environments such as swimming pools or changing rooms, where the humidity softens the skin and facilitates the penetration of the virus. They are not serious, but when located on the soles of the feet they can cause pain and consequent changes in gait and posture, which is why should not be neglected.",
        "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis is based on examination of the skin and the wart, taking into account other symptoms the patient may have.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment involves keratolytics, corrosive substances that destroy the keratin that makes up warts. The product is applied daily. As dead skin forms on the surface, it must be scraped off until the wart heals, which can take weeks. If you cannot eliminate them in this way, it is necessary to use surgical methods to remove them, under local anesthesia.",
        "Prevention": "There is no foolproof way to avoid warts, however you should avoid the risk of contamination from other infected sources: Wearing flip-flops or sandals in locker rooms, swimming pools or public showers;/ Don't touch someone else's wart;/ Don't scratch a wart;/ Don't shave over a wart;/ Keep clothes and towels away from other people in the house, preventing them from coming into contact with the wart.;/ Cleveland Clinic Warts and blackheads are often considered synonymous, but they are actually two distinct conditions.

    "Vertigo vertigo syndrome": {
        "What are they?": "Vertigo is not a disease but rather a symptom that can occur in various pathologies. The word vertigo comes from the Latin vertere, which means spinning or rotating movement. Vertigo, or vertigo syndrome, is defined as a distortion of the body's movement in space. To understand what causes vertigo, we must understand the entire mechanism involved in maintaining balance. There are several systems involved in the orientation of our body: the visual, the vestibular (inner ear) and the proprioceptive (these receptors are located in the muscles, tendons, joints and skin). Vertigo occurs when there is an anomaly in one of these systems and can also result from a problem in the brain, which is responsible for analysing and integrating information about the movement and position of the head and body. This condition can affect people of any age and is usually accompanied by other symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, headaches, paleness, increased heart rate and loss of consciousness. They correspond to an illusion of movement, with a sensation of movement of surrounding objects in relation to the individual or vice versa. They are most often rotatory (the environment seems to move around the patient), but they can also manifest as a sensation of sliding to one side or up and down. It is necessary to distinguish vertigo from dizziness: dizziness is a generic designation that encompasses all situations where there is a disturbance in the individual's relationships with space, and vertigo must be considered a particular form of dizziness. This distinction is not always easy, especially in cases of great anxiety or when dizziness occurs in the context of a psychiatric illness. In general, vertigo results from an injury to the inner ear, its peripheral receptors, the pathways that carry the information collected or the centers of the central nervous system that process this information. Vision disorders and a special type of sensitivity (proprioceptive) in the skin, bones, muscles and joints throughout the body can also cause dizziness, which can be very difficult to distinguish from vertigo. Vertigo is part of a broader set of disorders, known as vestibular disorders, which are very common. For example, in the United States, it is estimated that approximately 35% of the population over the age of 40 has had at least one episode of vestibular disease.",
        "Symptoms": "Vertigo, or vertigo syndrome, can be accompanied by dizziness, a feeling of lightheadedness or fainting, loss of balance or instability. The duration of episodes can vary from a few minutes to hours and are often accompanied by intense nausea and vomiting. In general, headaches, slurred speech, double vision, weakness of one of the upper or lower limbs, and uncoordinated movements are signs that the vertigo is caused by a neurological disorder in the brain and not a problem limited to the ear. Elderly people or those taking medications for heart disease or high blood pressure may experience dizziness or fainting when they stand up abruptly. This happens due to a momentary drop in blood pressure (orthostatic hypotension) that lasts just a few seconds. It can often be prevented by standing more slowly or wearing compression stockings.",
        "Causes": "There are many causes of vertigo. The body detects posture and controls balance through balance organs located in the inner ear. These have nerve connections with specific areas of the brain that allow balance to be maintained. Therefore, vertigo can be caused by disorders of the ear, the nerves that connect the ear to the brain or the brain itself - in more aggressive acute or chronic otitis, toxic substances can spread to the inner ear and interfere with its proper functioning for balance. It can also be related to visual problems or sudden changes in blood pressure, but also to labyrinthitis, neuritis, traumatic brain injury, auditory nerve or brain tumors, strokes, meningitis, ototoxicity from certain medications, barotrauma due to pressure changes, among others. Cardiac arrhythmia, hypoglycemia, a sudden drop in blood pressure, or anxiety that causes the patient to constantly take deep breaths can cause syncope that can be confused with vertigo. Changing the prescription of glasses lenses can also cause this condition. The most common cause is motion sickness, which can occur in anyone whose inner ear is sensitive to certain movements, such as rocking or sudden braking and acceleration. These people may feel particularly dizzy during car or boat journeys. This type tends to be more common in women and is more common in older people, and its exact cause is not always known. In some cases, the condition occurs after a head injury, reduced blood flow to certain areas of the brain, a viral infection, after ear surgery or prolonged breastfeeding. M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease causes episodic and abrupt attacks of vertigo, along with ringing in the ears and progressive deafness. They can also be caused by bacterial or viral infections, tumors, abnormal pressure, nerve inflammation or toxic substances that affect the aforementioned structures. At a cerebral level, they occur in the context of migraines, after a stroke, following transient episodes of ischemia or in multiple sclerosis.",
        "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis is based on clinical history and medical examination of the auditory system or nervous system. Some tests can provoke an episode of vertigo and thus help to understand its cause. Tests such as audiometry, impedance analysis, evoked potentials, electro or videonystagmography, posturography and imaging tests (computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) are frequently used.",
        "Treatment": "Some cases do not require treatment and disappear spontaneously. In others, certain maneuvers can be performed to control the condition. Depending on the cause, there are other treatment options, such as anti-inflammatory or antiemetic drugs (if there is significant vomiting), among others.",
        "Prevention": "Anyone can experience vertigo and there is no way to prevent a first episode. Since it causes a strong feeling of imbalance, it is important to avoid situations in which you could fall. American Academy of Family Physicians, 2014 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, 2013 MedicineNet, 2014 Vestibular Disorders Association, 2014 Load more;/ Vestibular neuritis is an inflammation of the vestibular nerve after an episode of acute vertigo, which can maintain the sensation of imbalance for weeks.

    "Marburg virus": {
        "What is it?": "Marburg virus was first detected in 1967, after several simultaneous outbreaks occurred in laboratories located in Marburg and Frankfurt, Germany, and in Belgrade, Serbia. Like the Ebola virus, this virus belongs to the Filoviridae family. Although the diseases caused by the Marburg virus and Ebola are different, they have similar clinical profiles, capable of causing outbreaks with high mortality rates. The disease caused by the Marburg virus is a rare, serious type of hemorrhagic fever with a high mortality rate - on average, 50%, but it can vary between 24% and 88%, depending on several factors, such as the strain of the virus and the health care provided to the patient. The bat Rousettus aegyptiacus, which is distributed throughout Africa, is considered a natural host of the Marburg virus, but it has also been detected in monkeys and chimpanzees. This is a zoonotic disease, meaning it can be transmitted from animals to humans. The virus can also infect other non-human primates, and more studies are needed to determine whether other species can also be hosts for the virus. Outbreaks have been reported in Africa, including cases in: Gana;/ Uganda;/ Zimbabwe;/ Democratic Republic of the Congo;/ Kenya;/ Angola;/ South Africa;/  Although cases of Marburg virus disease have occurred outside of Africa (as in 1967), these are rare.",
        "Symptoms of Marburg Virus": "The incubation period (interval between the moment of infection and the appearance of symptoms) of the disease caused by the Marburg virus can vary between two and 21 days (or up to 26 days). Symptoms appear suddenly and include: High fever;/ Goosebumps;/ Severe headache;/ Severe malaise;/ Muscle pain (myalgia);/ Severe diarrhea (appears around the 3rd day of symptoms and can last up to a week);/ Nausea and vomiting (usually appear on the 3rd day);/ Abdominal pain and cramps (usually appear on the 3rd day);/ Fatigue, sunken eyes and severe lack of strength;/ Chest pain;/ Sore throat;/  Around the 5th day of symptoms, a maculopapular rash (reddish spots and papules) may occur, mainly on the chest, abdomen and back. Five to seven days after the onset of symptoms, severe bleeding may appear, which is associated with the majority of fatal cases (often bleeding in multiple areas of the body). Blood in stool and vomit is often accompanied by bleeding from the nose, gums and vagina (in women). Bleeding may also occur in areas where the skin is punctured to obtain intravenous lines (to administer fluids, medications or obtain blood tests). In the most severe phase of the disease, patients maintain a high fever and the following may also occur: Confusion;/ Aggressiveness;/ Irritability;/  As the disease progresses, symptoms can become more severe and include: Jaundice;/ Shock;/ Liver failure;/ Inflammation of the pancreas;/ Multiple organ dysfunction and failure;/ Severe weight loss;/ Delusions;/ Severe bleeding;/ Orchitis (inflammation of one or both testicles - in the case of men);/  In very severe cases resulting in death, this most often occurs between the 8th and 9th day after the onset of symptoms and is usually preceded by severe blood loss, shock and multiple organ failure.",
        "Causes": "The Marburg virus is transmitted from the bat Rousettus aegyptiacus to humans (when there is prolonged exposure to the habitat of these animals), and contagion between humans can then occur. From person to person, transmission can occur through: Direct contact (through breaks in the skin or mucous membranes) with the blood, secretions (e.g. respiratory), organs and other fluids (feces, urine, vomit, saliva) of the infected person.;/ Contact with surfaces and materials, such as clothing and bedding, contaminated with the previously mentioned fluids.;/ Through infected semen - this type of contagion can occur up to seven weeks after the person is considered clinically recovered.;/ Use of infected injection equipment and needlestick injuries.;/  Transmission of the Marburg virus does not occur during the incubation period and, usually, infected people are contagious only after symptoms appear. So, people are considered infectious as long as the virus is detected in their blood. Contamination of other people can occur even after the patient's death, for example, through contact with the body during funeral ceremonies. It is known that Marburg virus can persist in some recovered people. Recurrence without reinfection in someone who has recovered from the disease is a rare event, but it has been documented.",
        "Diagnosis of Marburg virus": "It may be difficult to distinguish clinically between Marburg virus disease and other infectious diseases (such as malaria, meningitis, typhoid fever, shigellosis, and other viral hemorrhagic fevers). Therefore, blood tests are necessary, which detect the presence of an immune response to this virus in order to confirm whether the disease is effectively caused by the Marburg virus - ELISA method (immunoenzymatic serological test), RT-PCR tests, among others . These diagnostic methods are often not available in countries that have fewer health care resources and a higher risk of outbreak.",
        "Marburg virus treatment": "Despite the high mortality rate (which can reach 88%), this can be much lower when adequate health care is provided. To increase the likelihood of survival, early oral or intravenous hydration and symptomatic treatment are very important. To date, there is no approved specific antiviral treatment or vaccine for Marburg virus disease, but there are several therapies in development (such as immunotherapy or drugs). Although the disease caused by the Marburg virus is similar to Ebola, the Ebola vaccine is not effective in preventing this infection.",
        "Prevention": "Some strategies that can help prevent community transmission of Marburg virus include: Avoid traveling to areas where there are active outbreaks of the disease.;/ Reduce the risk of transmission from the bat Rousettus aegyptiacus to humans, such as using protective equipment (such as gloves, masks and appropriate clothing) when visiting the habitat of these animals (caves or mines).;/ Avoid eating bushmeat. When there are active outbreaks, all animal products (blood and meat) should be consumed thoroughly cooked/cooked.;/ Avoid close and direct contact with infected people.;/ Avoid contact with clothing, bedding or other objects that have been in contact with infected patients.;/ Use gloves and other protective equipment if it is necessary to care for the patient at home and at funeral ceremonies for people who were sick.;/ Wash your hands frequently (or, when this is not possible, use alcohol gel), especially after visiting the patient in the hospital and in care.;/ Men who have recovered from the infection, in order to reduce sexual transmission of the virus, must reinforce the adoption of safe sexual practices and hygiene in the 12 months following the onset of symptoms or until the semen has tested negative for the presence of the virus twice in a laboratory analysis.;/  Healthcare professionals must wear facial protection (visor, mask and glasses), long-sleeved lab coat and gloves whenever providing close care to patients with Marburg virus.

    "Virus epstein barr": {
        "What is it?": "Epstein-Barr (VEB) is a virus that belongs to the group of human herpesviruses. It is one of the most common, being present all over the world. Around 50% of children up to 5 years of age are infected and more than 90% of adults carry the virus. This means that most people, at some point in their lives, become infected with Epstein-Barr.  EBV is mainly known for causing infectious mononucleosis (popularly known as the kissing disease). It can also be associated with other diseases and complications, such as: Ear infections;/ Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome;/ Nose, throat and gastric cancer;/ Burkitt's lymphoma;/ Hodgkin's lymphoma;/ Interstitial pneumonia;/ Pancytopenia (decrease in the number of blood cells);/ Uveitis (inflammation of the uvea, the vascular layer of the eyeball);/  Recent studies also show that the Epstein-Barr Virus could be associated with multiple sclerosis. The virus is found mainly in saliva and nasal secretions and infects B lymphocytes. After the first infection, EBV remains permanently in the host and spreads asymptomatically and intermittently from the oropharynx. Spread is greater in immunocompromised patients (e.g. HIV patients or organ recipients).",
        "Symptoms": "Infection with the Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is generally asymptomatic and the incubation period for the virus is approximately 30 to 50 days. In children, symptoms, if they exist, may not be distinguishable from other common illnesses such as a cold or flu. Young people and adults generally have more characteristic symptoms of the disease, which may include: Fatigue;/ Fever;/ Sore throat;/ Appearance of lymph nodes in the neck;/ Lack of appetite;/ Skin irritation - rash;/ Headache;/ Tonsillitis;/  In more serious cases, the infection can also cause an increase in the size of the liver and spleen and generate neurological, hematological, respiratory and hepatic complications. Symptoms usually disappear after two to four weeks, but tiredness can last for months.",
        "Causes": "The Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is transmitted, above all, through saliva between an infected person and an uninfected person - hence mononucleosis, the most common disease caused by this virus, is also known as \u201ckissing disease\u201d -, but also through use of contaminated objects, such as toothbrushes or glasses. EBV is also found in blood and sperm, so it is possible to spread it through transfusions of untreated blood, organ transplants or sexual intercourse. When a patient becomes infected for the first time - the so-called primary infection - they can spread the virus for weeks while being asymptomatic. After this first infection, the virus remains in the patient's body and can become active again, making the person contagious again.",
        "Diagnosis": "Diagnosing Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection can be time-consuming, as the symptoms are easily confused with other illnesses such as flu or tonsillitis. Examination of the patient at the doctor's appointment may reveal more details, such as swelling of the liver or spleen and white spots on the tonsils. The blood count can also detect the infection, by finding antibodies to the virus or leukocytes (white blood cells), produced by the immune system to fight the infection.",
        "Treatment": "There is no specific medication to treat Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection, and it must follow its natural course until cured, generally after two to four weeks. However, the patient can take some measures to alleviate symptoms: Increase your fluid intake to stay hydrated;/ Rest during the acute phase of the disease;/ Avoid doing sports and demanding physical activities;/ Taking medicines such as ibuprofen or paracetamol to relieve pain and fever;/  Antibiotics should not be administered, as this is an infection caused by viruses and not bacteria. In more serious cases, corticosteroids may be used.",
        "Prevention": "There is no vaccine against Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection. Therefore, the best form of prevention is to avoid contact with infected people or objects. You should not kiss or share drinks, food and personal objects with anyone who is infected. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, February 2022 MSD Manual, February 2022 National Health Service, February 2022 WebMD, February 2022 When mononucleosis affects you or a family member, it is important to consider the types of foods and drinks that can help fight this viral infection.

The likelihood of serious infection caused by RSV is greater in children: Premature;;/ Up to 2 years old who were born with heart or lung disease;;/ Whose immune system is weakened due to illness or medical treatment;;/ Less than 8 to 10 weeks old;;/  The World Health Organization estimates that 33 million lower respiratory tract infections caused by Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) occur annually in children under 5 years of age worldwide, of which 3.3 million require hospitalization. Around 60,000 of these children end up losing their lives due to complications.",
        "Symptoms of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)": "RSV infection typically manifests itself four to six days after infection and the main symptoms include: Runny nose;;/ Loss of appetite;;/ Cough;;/ Sneezing;;/ Fever;;/ Wheezing/wheezing.;/  As a general rule, these symptoms do not appear all at the same time and some may not appear at all. In very young babies, the only symptoms of RSV may be irritability, decreased activity, refusal to feed, or difficulty breathing. In children younger than 6 months, apnea (obstruction of airflow to the lungs) may be the initial symptom of RSV infection. In healthy adults and older children, the illness is usually mild and may be virtually asymptomatic or manifest as just a common cold.",
        "Causes": "Like other viruses that cause respiratory infections, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is also transmitted through secretions from the nose or mouth. Contagion is easy and can occur through direct contact (for example, when kissing the face of an infected child) or through droplets expelled when talking, coughing or sneezing. The virus can still remain on surfaces for hours, and this aspect is of great importance, considering that sharing toys is one of the most common ways of transmitting RSV among children, in daycare centers and nurseries. Epidemics tend to be seasonal, with the peak generally recorded between December and January, although the virus can circulate at other times of the year. Having been infected once does not protect against reinfection, but the antibodies that are developing against RSV contribute to a decrease in the severity of the disease. The contagious period begins two days before symptoms appear and only ends when the infection is completely controlled. However, some children and adults with weakened immune systems can continue to spread the virus even after no symptoms, for up to four weeks.",
        "RSV Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is usually made based on the patient's clinical history and observation, including auscultation of the lungs. The doctor also takes into account the time of year and the circulation of the virus at the time. Although it is not the most common, it is possible that the clinician will resort to some tests, especially if the disease is serious, requires hospitalization or rules out other diagnoses. Among the tests that the attending physician may use include: Blood and urine tests, with the aim of identifying associated complications or other causes that explain the symptoms;;/ Chest X-ray, to look for signs of pneumonia or identify lung complications associated with RSV;;/ Rapid antigen tests, PCR tests or virus culture.;/",
        "Treatment of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)": "Most RSV infections eventually go away after a week or two, and nothing more than relieving symptoms is needed, similar to what is done for most colds. There is no specific treatment for RSV, so as a rule it is advised to manage fever and pain with antipyretics/pain relievers and drink plenty of fluids, preferably water, to prevent dehydration and help thin secretions. Although treatment can be carried out at home, it is important that the evolution of the situation is monitored and that a doctor is consulted in case of difficulty breathing, dehydration or worsening of symptoms. Before administering any medication to a child, it is advisable to ask the attending physician for help, bearing in mind that not all medications are suitable. People with breathing difficulties may be hospitalized (especially children and the elderly) and, depending on the clinical picture, doctors may treat them with oxygen, intravenous hydration and medications or procedures (intubation) to open the airways.",
        "RSV prevention": "The main measures to prevent infection with Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) are similar to those for other respiratory viral infections, namely: Hygiene: frequent hand washing with running water and soap. If washing is not possible, it is advisable to use alcohol gel, particularly in public places. Frequently clean high-touch surfaces, such as door handles, handrails, switches and screens of electronic devices;;/ Respiratory etiquette: anyone showing symptoms of a respiratory infection should wear a mask, especially if they come into contact with children or the elderly. In situations where you do not wear a mask, you must protect your nose and mouth with a disposable tissue or your forearm when sneezing or coughing, throw away used tissues and wash your hands immediately;;/ Avoid close contact: anyone with symptoms compatible with RSV should avoid close contact with other people, that is, kissing, touching hands and sharing glasses, cups or cutlery. Care must be taken in the case of children and the elderly who are at high risk of serious RSV infections;;/ Immunization: although not yet considered a vaccine, the long-acting monoclonal antibody nirsevimab was recently approved for immunization against RSV. Immunization will be seasonal, taking place every year between October 1 and March 31. It should be administered at birth, for those born during that period in public, private or social sector maternity hospitals. Immunity lasts only six months, so taking it does not provide lifelong immunity but only for the autumn/winter of the year in which it is administered*. The introduction of this new immunization represents a major achievement in the fight against RSV, particularly among the most vulnerable. This measure is expected to significantly reduce hospitalizations and significantly increase the number of lives saved, as well as preventing seasonal outbreaks of this common and challenging agent.;/  *Exceptionally, in 2024 the following will be covered: I. Babies born in August and September; II. Preterm children up to 34 weeks (exclusive) born between January 1st and July 31st; III. Children with other risk factors for serious RSV infection such as heart disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and other chronic lung diseases who have not yet turned 2 years old by September 30, 2024.

    "Vitiligo": {
        "What is it?": "It is a localized or diffuse depigmentation of the skin, characterized by well-defined white skin patches with a tendency towards symmetry. It appears at any age, although more frequently in young adults. Its evolution is extremely variable, in terms of age, number of injuries and progression.",
        "Symptoms": "In some people, only one or two well-defined spots appear; in others, the spots are more extensive. The skin that is affected by the disease also produces white hair, because the hair follicles lose their melanocytes. The changes are more visible in patients with dark pigmentation, with non-pigmented skin being extremely sensitive to sunburn.\u00a0 This pathology can have an important psychological impact, due to its effect on image and self-esteem.",
        "Causes": "Its lesions result from the partial or total absence of melanocytes, cells responsible for the production of melanin. Its cause is still unknown, with the autoimmune hypothesis being the most widely accepted one. In about a third of cases, a familial incidence is also observed.",
        "Diagnosis": "White spots are usually easily visible, but your doctor may use a Wood's lamp, which projects ultraviolet (UV) light onto your skin, to help differentiate them from other conditions.",
        "Treatment": "Until the middle of the 20th century, vitiligo was a dermatosis with few therapeutic possibilities. In 1947, Mofty first used 8-methoxypsoralen, a purified molecule from the Ammi majus plant, associated with sun exposure. Later, 8-MOP was used in association with artificial UVA radiation. This treatment, called PUVA, is still widely used in the treatment of vitiligo. Simultaneously, in the 1950s, therapy with topical corticosteroids was initiated. With the intention of improving the results obtained and minimizing side effects, other molecules such as 5-methoxypsoralen, phenylalanine, kellin, levadamisole, pseudocatalase, placental extracts, among others, have been tested.\u00a0 However, low efficacy rates, combined with the incidence of side effects, have led to the non-approval of these therapies. Recently, tacrolimus and vitamin D derivatives have demonstrated their effectiveness, eventually becoming therapeutic options. Autologous melanocyte grafts are another possibility. As well as the transplantation of melanocytes from in vitro cultures.",
        "How effective are the treatments?": "There is a wide variability in results with the various treatments available. However, their effectiveness does not usually exceed 75% of repigmentation. Clarification of its pathophysiological mechanisms will enable the development of new drugs that reduce the depigmentation process and the combination of medical and surgical methods may make vitiligo a potentially reversible disease.",
        "Prevention": "Since its exact cause is unknown, it cannot be prevented. Cleveland Clinic Medical News Today It is natural for parents to try to prevent their child from missing school. However, there are reasons that justify a child staying at home, such as when they are sick. Cancer treatment can cause changes in the image that affect the self-esteem of the cancer patient.

        "What are they?": "Vomiting is a common situation in pediatrics and is associated with many childhood illnesses. They often appear in any febrile situation, with a sore throat or in gastroenteritis. It is important to know that in themselves they are not synonymous with severity. After an episode of vomiting, any patient, child or adult, becomes prostrate and pale. However, after a short time the child returns to his or her normal state.",
        "Practical advice": "Taking a break from eating for more than half an hour;/ If your child has vomited more than once, giving your child a sugary drink, a cookie with jam, or some sugar can help stop the vomiting and keep your child hydrated and free from hypoglycemia.;/ After half an hour, give him small sips of sweetened weak tea or oral moisturizer at regular intervals.;/ If an antipyretic is needed, opt for a suppository;/ Go on a fat-free diet;/ Do not force the child to eat;/ Do not transmit anxiety to the child;/ Load more;/ About us;/ Events;/ Clients and Companions;/ News;/ CUF Academic Center;/ Partnerships;/ Contacts;/ Frequently Asked Questions;/ Join us;/ Virtual Visit;/ English version;/ My CUF;/ Access Solutions and Health Plans;/ Facebook;/ Facebook Instagram;/ Instagram LinkedInCreated with Sketch.;/ LinkedIn Youtube;/ Youtube award4;/ award4 certification1;/ certification1 certification2;/ certification2 certification3;/ certification3 Complaints and compliments;/ Complaints and compliments Privacy and Cookies Policy;/ Terms and Conditions;/ Whistleblower Channel;/ \u00a9 CUF 2024 All rights reserved Start;/ Health A-Z: Diseases, Symptoms and Treatments;/"

    "Vulvitis": {
        "What is it?": "Vulvitis is not a disease in itself but an inflammation of the skin folds of the vulva, which corresponds to the outermost region of the female genitals. This inflammation can result from an infection, allergy, or injury. The vulva is especially susceptible to inflammatory processes, given its external location, humidity and temperature. This type of disorder, like countless other dermatological conditions, has an important functional, aesthetic and psychological impact. In many cases, the cause is unknown. Although itching, pain and discomfort during sexual intercourse are the most common symptoms, in the case of a more severe or prolonged illness, complications such as sexual dysfunction, urination disorders or even malignancy may arise. Women of any age can be affected by vulvitis. Younger girls, before puberty, or in the post-menopausal phase are at greater risk, given the lower levels of estrogen that make the tissues in the vulvar region thinner and drier. However, these conditions are generally easy to approach and treat.",
        "Symptoms": "Its main symptoms are intense itching, with a burning sensation in the vulvar region, secretion, skin lesions with redness, swelling, blistering or flaking. These complaints may correspond to other diseases of the genital organs, so a complete medical evaluation is essential.",
        "Causes": "It can be caused by several factors, such as the use of scented wipes, bath foam or soap, use of vaginal sprays, irritation caused by pool or jacuzzi water, allergy to spermicides or toilet paper, use of synthetic underwear, prolonged use of a swimsuit, cycling or horse riding, fungal or bacterial infections, herpes, eczema or dermatitis.",
        "Diagnosis": "The clinical history and examination are very important. Laboratory tests may also be relevant to rule out other types of diseases.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment involves identifying any substances that may be causing irritation/aggression so that they can be avoided. The use of creams with corticosteroids, antihistamines or estrogens can alleviate complaints but must always be prescribed by a doctor. In fact, the thinning of the internal vaginal lining after menopause (atrophic vaginitis) can be treated with estrogen replacement therapy that can be administered orally, using a skin patch or applied directly to the vulva and vagina. If the discharge is normal, frequent washing with water can reduce its quantity. However, discharge caused by vaginitis requires specific treatment, depending on its cause. If it is an infection, treatment consists of administering an antibiotic, an antifungal or an antiviral, depending on the type of agent. In addition to an antibiotic, treatment for a bacterial infection may include propionic acid jelly in order to increase the acidity of vaginal secretions, which inhibits the growth of bacteria. In cases of sexual transmission, both members of the couple must be treated simultaneously to avoid a new outbreak. Other complementary measures include wearing loose, absorbent clothing that allows air to circulate, such as cotton underwear, as well as keeping the genitals properly clean. Sometimes placing ice on the vulva, taking a cold shower, or applying cold compresses reduces pain and itching.",
        "Prevention": "Prevention is possible through the use of mild cleaning products, adequate drying after bathing, not using perfumed solutions, preferring cotton underwear, not too tight, and not keeping wet clothes in contact with the vulvar region for a long time (after swimming or physical exercise).

    "Arthritis arthrosis of the hand and wrist": {
        "What is it?": "It is an inflammation that affects the different elements that make up a joint (the area where two or more bones meet and which allows movements to be carried out).  It manifests with pain localized to the affected joint, accompanied by decreased movement of the same joint and typically worsens with age.  The most common arthritis are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. In osteoarthritis, the cartilage, which is the covering of the bones in the joint areas and which allows them to slide to carry out movement, suffers wear and tear and even disappears. Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease in which the body attacks the inner lining of the joints.",
        "Symptoms": "Affected joints present: Dor;/ Rigidity with decreased total movement of the same;/ Edema (swelling);/ Redness;/ Heat;/ Joint deformity (in advanced cases);/",
        "Causes": "The two most common causes of arthritis damage the joint differently.  Osteoarthritis: in this situation, there is wear and tear of the cartilage, the covering present at the ends of the bones in the joint areas. This covering allows the bones not only to slide harmoniously, producing movement, but also the distribution and dissipation of energy generated in movements of greater intensity, such as jumping, thus preventing injuries. If this covering deteriorates, which occurs over the years or following fractures involving the bones in the joint areas, severe sprains or joint infections, the bone begins to rub against the bone, causing pain and reduced movement of the joint involved.  Rheumatoid arthritis: In this disease, the organism attacks the tissue that lines the inside of the joints (it is called the synovial membrane and is equivalent to paint on the wall of a room).\u00a0 This membrane then becomes inflamed, red and swollen. As membrane inflammation increases, which happens as the disease progresses, cartilage and bone are gradually destroyed.  Risk factors for arthritis are:  Family history: Some types of arthritis have a familial component, which means that if parents or siblings suffer from the disease there is a greater risk than the general population of developing it.  Age: The risk of developing most arthritis types increases with age.  Sex: Rheumatoid arthritis affects women more frequently, gout in turn affects men more.  Previous joint injuries: Any joint that has suffered a fracture or a severe sprain suffers early wear and tear, sooner or later developing into osteoarthritis.  Obesity: Increased weight on a joint causes premature wear, especially on the joints that support it such as knees, hips, ankles and spine, which is why obesity is directly related to arthritis.",
        "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis is made by observing the joints, looking for swelling, redness, heat and evaluating movement.  The medical evaluation can be completed with tests (of the blood or even the fluid present in the joint) and X-ray (where it is possible to identify the loss of cartilage, bone destruction and the formation of osteophytes, commonly called \u201cparrot beaks\u201d).  It may be necessary, not for diagnosis but for defining the treatment plan, to perform computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasound.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment depends on the type of arthritis and the goal is to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life.  Medication: There are several medications available for controlling pain and inflammation. They can be used as definitive treatment if they meet the treatment objectives by allowing the patient to carry out day-to-day activities without complaints or with only residual complaints.  Physiotherapy: This can provide relief in some types of arthritis, especially by reducing the inflammatory process and promoting muscle strengthening. During the course of treatment, splints may be used to rest the joint.  Surgery: If conservative treatment (medication and physiotherapy) does not work, surgery is recommended. Surgical options are adapted to the pathology present and the patient and are: Joint lavage: Usually performed with 2 to 4 small incisions that allow the placement of instruments inside the joint through which it is possible to proceed to wash the joint, remove loose bodies (fragments of cartilage that have come loose) and inflammatory tissue. Valid option in the initial stages of arthritis or as a way of postponing a more aggressive surgical procedure.;/ Joint replacement (arthroplasty): In this method, damaged surfaces are removed and replaced with a prosthesis or spacer (artificial or constructed from the patient's own tendon) in order to eliminate pain and preserve the movement.;/ Joint fusion (arthrodesis): This technique eliminates the joint by removing the ends of the two bones and establishing the union of the two bones by placing plates and/or screws. By eliminating the movement of the joint, the pain caused by the movement disappears.

    "Inflammatory arthritis": {
        "What is it?": "Inflammatory arthritis is part of a group of diseases that affect the immune system and, therefore, the body's defense systems attack the body's own tissues instead of attacking microorganisms or external substances. These pathologies are known as autoimmune diseases. It corresponds to an inflammatory joint process characterized by the presence of joint effusion and/or pain on movement, heat, redness and functional limitation. In general, its signs and symptoms last up to six weeks. It can affect only one joint (monoarthritis), less than five (oligoarthritis) or more than five (polyarthritis). The most common inflammatory arthritis are rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and arthritis associated with psoriasis. These diseases can affect men, women and children at any age and affect other parts of the body. However, in the case of rheumatoid arthritis, 75% of patients are female and it occurs most frequently between the ages of 25 and 50. Systemic lupus erythematosus is also more common in women. On the other hand, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis are more common in younger populations. Inflammatory arthritis is not curable but its prognosis has improved in the last 20/30 years. There are new treatments that are started earlier, thus reducing joint damage, the need for surgery and the number of complications. It is important not to confuse inflammatory arthritis with osteoarthritis, which is a degenerative process that occurs when cartilage and/or ligaments wear out. When these structures are damaged, the muscles surrounding them contract to protect the joint. When this mechanism is not effective, the bone around the joint grows, forming spurs that attempt to stabilize the joint. In the case of inflammatory arthritis, the challenges faced by patients are physical (pain, disability, fatigue, damage to joints and organs) and emotional (depression, frustration, anxiety).",
        "Symptoms": "Many people with inflammatory arthritis do not have any signs of disease. Increased blood flow and the release of chemicals attract white blood cells to the site of inflammation. These events cause irritation, joint wear and swelling. The most common symptoms are redness, swelling of the joints that become painful and tender to the touch, joint pain and stiffness, and loss of function of the joints involved. As a general illness, fever, chills, fatigue and loss of energy, headaches and loss of appetite may occur. If the inflammation affects other organs, the symptoms may vary. If it occurs in the myocardium, there will be chest pain or fluid retention; if it involves the bronchial tree, there will be difficulty breathing; if it affects the kidneys, there may be hypertension or renal failure; in the case of the visual system, the patient may feel pain and decreased vision; if it affects the muscles, it will cause pain and muscle weakness; if it involves the blood vessels, there may be vasculitis, with manifestations in the skin or damage to other deeper organs. Pain is not always present because many organs do not have pain-sensitive nerves.",
        "Causes": "In general, the cause is unknown, and it is thought that its origins are inflammatory or autoimmune factors. The role of genetics is still unclear. When the inflammatory process occurs, chemicals are released that reach various tissues. This release tends to increase blood flow to the affected area, which can cause heat and redness. The associated swelling can stimulate some nerves, causing pain.",
        "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis involves a medical examination, with emphasis on the location of the affected joints, the presence of morning stiffness and complaints in other organs, and these elements should be complemented by radiological and laboratory tests.",
        "Treatment": "There are several options, including rest and surgery. The type of treatment will depend on several factors, such as the type of disease, the patient's age, current medications, general health and the severity of symptoms. The main objectives are to avoid or modify activities that aggravate the suffering, to use anti-inflammatory or analgesic medications to control pain and inflammation and to reduce the pressure exerted on the affected joints by using immobilization or support systems, whenever necessary. The most common therapy is that which reduces inflammation and swelling and which prevents or minimizes the progression of the disease itself. The most commonly used are aspirin, ibuprofen, corticosteroids and medications such as those used in chemotherapy, biological therapies or narcotic drugs for pain relief. The role of early rehabilitation is essential and may include physical therapy, joint protection, and exercises to restore strength and flexibility.",
        "Prevention": "If there is no specific cause, prevention is more difficult. However, regular physical exercise adapted to the age and conditions of each person, a balanced diet, adequate weight control, are good examples of measures that can help prevent the various forms of arthritis.

    "Rheumatoid arthritis": {
        "What is it?": "Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory rheumatic disease that manifests itself in the form of polyarthritis (defined by the involvement of three or more joints), bilateral (affecting joints on both sides of the body), symmetrical (affecting the same joints on both sides of the body ), progressive, destructive and deforming. This evolution culminates, after 10 to 20 years of evolution of the pathology, particularly in patients with a partial response to treatments, in some degree of motor disability. In Portugal, rheumatoid arthritis is the most prevalent inflammatory rheumatic disease, affecting around 0.3% to 0.4% of the Portuguese population.",
        "Symptoms": "The clinical presentation of rheumatoid arthritis is variable, with the disease beginning acutely or slowly, or between these two extremes, subacutely. A slow or gradual onset is more common (about 2/3 of cases), while an acute onset is less common. It begins predominantly as a joint disease, with one or more joints affected, most frequently the small joints of the hands and feet, bilaterally and symmetrically, although it may initially manifest as an extra-articular disease or with a non-articular presentation, or even predominantly general, with diffuse inflammatory joint or muscular pain. In the articular picture, there is often, from the beginning of the disease, fatigue, anorexia, weight loss and low fever. In other cases, months before the onset of polyarthritis, isolated fatigue or non-specific diffuse pain may occur, accompanied by lung disease.",
        "Causes": "The cause of rheumatoid arthritis is unknown, however several risk factors have been identified, such as infections, genetics and hormonal changes. It is an autoimmune disease, which means that the body's defenses attack its own tissues. Rheumatoid arthritis can occur at any time of life but is more common in middle age. The individual's gender affects susceptibility to the disease, so it is approximately two to three times more common in women.",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis is made by the rheumatologist and other clinicians with experience in observing these patients, immediately and \u201cat the entrance to the office\u201d, based on a quick observation of the hands, which present typical joint deformities. In fact, the hands of a rheumatic patient offer so much information regarding their illness that they can be considered their calling card. However, diagnosing its early and initial symptoms, as well as its atypical forms, are a challenge. As there is no single clinical, radiological or serological test that allows a conclusive diagnosis, it is carried out based on the clinical combination (characteristic signs and symptoms), as well as laboratory and radiological data. Although in some patients all tests may be normal.",
        "Treatment": "It is a pathology that requires lifelong treatment, including the use of medication, physiotherapy, exercise and surgery. It is equally important to assess the presence of food allergies and aim for a balanced diet, rich in omega-3 acids. Within drugs, there are several classes that can be used depending on the clinical condition of each patient. The earlier the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, the more it will be possible to delay joint destruction.",
        "Prevention": "There is no information on how to prevent rheumatoid arthritis, as this disease results from a combination of genetic, immunological and environmental factors. However, early diagnosis and treatment, as well as the adoption of non-pharmacological measures, are essential in preventing RA complications.

    "Total knee arthroplasty": {
        "What is it?": "Total knee replacement/arthroplasty is a surgical procedure in which the worn joint surfaces of the femur, tibia and often the kneecap are replaced because they are a source of debilitating pain. Metal and high-density polyethylene components are placed in place of the damaged and painful joint surfaces. The main objective of placing a total knee prosthesis is to treat the pain caused by osteoarthritis and, at the same time, improve joint mobility, increase functional capacity and restore quality of life. In some cases, osteoarthritis results from varus or valgus misalignment of the knee (bow knees or knees together, respectively), and there is then a second objective for surgery, which is to correct this anatomical deformity.;/ The joint mobility that is intended to be achieved after surgery will be between 100 and 130 degrees of flexion and full extension. However, the main factor that determines the postoperative range of motion is the range before surgery, so a knee with reduced mobility will have greater difficulty in achieving the desired range of motion.;/ All patients indicated for total arthroplasty are frankly limited in their activities of daily living, suffering from intense and disabling pain, resistant to medical and physiatric therapy and without any other surgical option. The age factor must be evaluated based on currently existing statistical data, which reveal that the survival rate of total knee arthroplasties is 90% at 10 and 80% at 20 years (defined by the prostheses still functioning) respectively. However, the placement of knee prostheses can be proposed at younger ages, in particular clinical situations that have no other medical or surgical alternative that would restore the patient's quality of life. The majority of patients are in the age group over 60 years old, with the upper limit, nowadays, depending on the general clinical condition, with many cases operated after the age of 80 years. Surgical risk will always be assessed in a pre-operative Anesthesiology Consultation. Another important factor, regardless of age, is the motivation of the patient and his family, given the disability and suffering caused by osteoarthritis, after an open discussion of the risks and benefits, especially if there are no serious pathologies that could affect the longevity of the patient. patient.;/ The patient indicated for this surgery most often has advanced arthrosis of idiopathic etiology (no cause is identified), mechanical due to axis deviation or post-traumatic, as a result of joint fractures.;/ Rheumatic diseases, especially rheumatoid arthritis, represent the second most important group of pathologies, due to their joint involvement.;/ Excess body weight does not represent a contraindication, as long as the patient's general condition is compatible with surgery. The long-term results are slightly lower when compared to surgery, however, it must be considered that obesity associated with limited mobility is in itself a vicious cycle, both due to the medical pathologies it causes and the greater gain in body weight.;/ The longevity of the prosthesis that we mentioned above motivates us to try whenever possible a more conservative surgical approach in younger patients, defined by age groups below 60 years of age. This approach consists of arthroscopic gestures, osteotomies to correct the axis (\u201cstraightening crooked legs\u201d) or even physiotherapy associated with medications and infiltrations in the context of regenerative medicine.;/ Carrying out an arthroplasty involves risks that the patient must be aware of. Possible postoperative complications include thromboembolism, which requires mandatory pharmacological prevention, cutaneous complications and neurovascular injuries. Infection, often referred to as rejection, has an incidence of less than 1%, but may require further lavage surgery and replacement of the prosthesis.;/ Arthroplasty failure may be due to aseptic detachment (loose components in the absence of infection, due to sensitivity to polyethylene wear) and premature wear of the material. In these cases, it also requires further surgery to review/replace the material.;/ The surgical technique we currently use is called minimally invasive. It involves the use of smaller skin incisions, but above all, less aggression to the surrounding soft tissues (muscles, synovial membrane, ligaments, vessels and nerves).;/ This approach allows for a less painful post-operative period, less blood loss, lower risk of infection and a faster and less painful recovery. Most patients are able, after an initial period of support and weight-bearing of the operated lower limb, with two crutches, to resume walking without aids within 1 to 2 months, depending on the condition of the contralateral knee.;/ When performing this surgery, general or locoregional anesthesia can be used, depending on the decision of the patient and the anesthetist, during the Anesthesiology Consultation.;/ The rehabilitation program begins during hospitalization, approximately 48 hours after surgery, when the patient leaves the hospital walking with the help of two crutches and able to go up and down stairs.;/ Having a knee replacement surgery involves limitations on sports, and high-impact activities should be avoided. However, walking, golf, gym, swimming, dancing and cycling are permitted. Patients should ensure the longevity of their prosthesis by avoiding excess weight, intense physical exertion with impact (running), carrying heavy loads and hyperflexed postures.;/ Any infection that occurs, anywhere on the body, must be treated early and effectively, due to the risk of bacteremia (bacteria circulating in the bloodstream) that can contaminate the knee prosthesis from a distance. For the same reason, you should also systematically carry out antibiotic prevention in all dental or endoscopic manipulations, contacting your attending physician whenever necessary.;/ The confinement and changes in sports practice had consequences.

    "Knee and ankle arthroscopy": {
        "What is it?": "Minimally invasive surgical technique, which allows exploration and treatment of lesions found and previously diagnosed inside the joints, through 2 or 3 small incisions of 1 to 1.5 cm, using an imaging camera and specific instruments. This treatment method, due to its lower aggressiveness, allows for a post-operative period with less pain, fewer risks and complications, therefore with easier and shorter rehabilitation and a reduced hospital stay. This surgery is usually performed with locoregional anesthesia, depending on the patient's wishes and the evaluation in an Anesthesiology consultation.",
        "Indications": "Diagnosis: Currently rarely performed solely for this purpose, except in cases of inconclusive diagnosis by the clinic and complementary exams due to persistent complaints. In this context, surgical treatment will be performed at the same time as the operation, depending on the pathology detected intraoperatively.",
        "Knee Surgery": "The menisci are structures that are interposed between the femur and the tibia and function as \u201cshock absorbers and load distributors\u201d. In their absence, wear and tear of the articular cartilage occurs, which in the long term can lead to osteoarthritis. These are structures with vascular and nerve endings on their periphery, which cause pain when they tear and are \u201cstuck\u201d inside the joint, during rotation and squatting movements. The greater the mobility or instability of the torn fragments, the more frequent and intense the pain. The most common knee injuries are meniscal tears, and meniscectomies/partial resections or meniscal sutures/repairs may be performed. Meniscal transplantation is the placement of a cadaver meniscus to reconstruct an absent or insufficient meniscus after a total meniscectomy. It is indicated only in age groups under 50 years and in the presence of painful complaints and evaluation by magnetic resonance imaging (pre-arthrosis degenerative process). Cartilage is a tissue that allows joint movement without friction. Its wear, fracture or structural change (chondromalacia) causes pain and joint effusion. Arthroscopy allows these injuries to be treated, but this tissue does not heal like existing cartilage. Instead, the body produces fibrocartilage, which fills the area of \u200b\u200binjury. In cartilage injuries, techniques are used to regularize unstable fragments, techniques to stimulate regeneration from mesenchymal cells (microfractures) and mosaicplasty (cartilage transplant). The latter technique often requires open surgery (with a wide incision) to obtain a good clinical result. Through arthroscopy, synovectomies can also be performed (excision of the lining membrane from the inside of the knee, in cases of chronic inflammation), external alectomy (section of the external wing of the patella in cases of cartilage wear, due to poor alignment of the patella), removal of free bodies and arthrolysis of the knee (release of intra-articular adhesions to gain joint mobility, in cases of stiffness).",
        "Ankle Surgery": "In this joint, this technique also allows for the performance of synovectomies, treatment of cartilage lesions, removal of intra-articular free bodies, arthrodesis (fixation of the joint supplemented with screws), arthrolysis (release of adhesions and intra-articular fibrosis to gain reduced joint range of motion) and excision of osteophytes/\"parrot's beaks\" (in cases of bone conflict).

    "Shoulder and elbow arthroscopy": {
        "What is it?": "Arthroscopy is a minimally invasive technique developed since the beginning of the 20th century with a progressive increase in the diagnostic and therapeutic capacity of a large number of pathologies in the field of Orthopedics. It consists of introducing an optical amplifier inside a joint, connected to a light source, and transmitting the signal to an external monitor, allowing us to see what is happening inside the cavity where it is located.  As this diagnostic part was the one that initially encouraged its development, it was soon realized that with its help it could also be used to treat many pathologies using direct visualization of anatomical structures.  As added value it brought us the use of small incisions and less tissue destruction necessary to reach the joint to be studied/treated, as each entry point (portal) for each joint is no more than 0.5 to 1 cm, and can create several portals as needed. Indirectly, this added value allows for less post-operative pain; minor damage to the structures that surround the joint and which only occurs so that we can access the joint; greater speed in the rehabilitation process.  It was also thanks to the introduction of arthroscopy in the shoulder joint that many pathologies/diseases were discovered/better understood, as direct observation of the joint is always more complete than indirect observation provided by other complementary diagnostic methods (x-ray, ultrasound, CT, MRI, arthrography, etc.).  Patients who were condemned to live their lives with a diagnosis of \u201ctendinitis\u201d now have their injuries diagnosed and treated.  Arthroscopy therefore had the merit of allowing us to understand that many pathologies do not have a structural basis but rather a functional basis. The disease is not a consequence of damage that occurs in a specific structure but results from changes in the way that structure functions or in its interaction with adjacent structures.  To keep up with all this development, both the surgical instruments and the materials used needed to adapt to the area of \u200b\u200barthroscopy as they presented specificities that had not been introduced until then.  Arthroscopy allowed hospitalization times to decrease and increased the possibility of outpatient surgeries, with less consumption of direct and indirect economic resources  Arthroscopy, as a technique increasingly used in a greater number of pathologies and by a greater number of surgeons, should not be seen as a minor surgery, because as with any surgery, it has risks common to all of them and specific to arthroscopy. And, it is not a panacea, because it leaves many areas where \u201cclassical\u201d surgery has an advantage. Learn what it is, the causes and how to prevent it.

    "Osteoarthritis of the thumb": {
        "What is it?": "Osteoarthritis is a disease that causes inflammation, stiffness and destruction of joints. In a normal joint, cartilage covers the bone ends, allowing them to move smoothly and without pain. The joint at the base of the thumb is formed by one of the carpal bones (trapezium) and the first of the three thumb bones (metacarpal). This joint (trapezium-metacarpal) allows the thumb to move and grip with the other fingers. In osteoarthritis, the cartilage layer deteriorates and the bones rub against each other. It often affects the joint at the base of the thumb, also called the trapezium-metacarpal joint. Trapeziometacarpal osteoarthritis (rhizarthrosis) slowly destroys the joint. Rhizarthrosis is more common in women over 40, but anyone can have it. It usually affects both thumbs.",
        "Symptoms": "The most common symptom is pain at the base of the thumb. It can be felt when you pick up an object between your thumb and fingers, when you try to open a door, turn a lock or when you drop something. The pain can also worsen over time. The joint can become inflamed and become increasingly stiff or deformed.",
        "Causes": "The tops of the bones are covered with cartilage. This covering acts as a cushion, allowing the bones to move smoothly. Osteoarthritis destroys the cartilage and the bones start to move against each other when the thumb is moved, making the joint inflamed and painful. Over time, the bones can collapse or dislocate, causing deformation and stiffness that prevents the finger from being straightened. Trapeziometacarpal osteoarthritis results from wear and tear of the joint. It is more common in younger people if there has been trauma with ligament damage or a fracture of the thumb. Repetitive pinching, twisting or rolling movements between the thumb and fingers can aggravate osteoarthritis.",
        "Diagnosis": "The doctor can diagnose it by the deformation and mobility of the thumb. He or she may also order an X-ray to see the degree of destruction of the joint. Treatment will depend on the pain and the degree of joint involvement.",
        "Treatment": "Non-surgical treatment If arthritis is diagnosed at an early stage of the disease, it may respond favorably to non-surgical treatment. Your doctor may place a splint to immobilize your thumb for a period of three to six weeks. This limits movement and reduces inflammation. It may be associated with the oral intake of an anti-inflammatory drug, such as Aspirin or Voltaren. If symptoms do not improve, your healthcare professional will consider a joint injection of an anti-inflammatory drug, such as cortisone. If non-surgical treatment does not relieve pain and stiffness, or if the arthritis is already at a more advanced stage with joint destruction, the doctor may recommend consultation with a hand surgery specialist to assess the situation and which technique is best. correct for each case.  Surgical treatment If the hand surgeon recommends surgery, the diseased joint will be removed, usually by removing the base of the first metacarpal and trapezium. Reconstruction is performed using a prosthesis or a tendon graft taken from the forearm and wrist. This type of surgery can be performed under general anesthesia (which requires a 24-hour hospital stay) or under local regional anesthesia of the branchial plexus, in which only the arm is anesthetized (which does not require hospitalization).  The recovery Initially the hand has a relatively bulky bandage and a splint. After removing the stitches, you will only have a splint to immobilize your thumb for a total of six weeks, from the date of surgery. This will keep the thumb stable while healing occurs. Once it is removed, the surgeon guides the movements to be made and will send the patient to a physiotherapist to help with mobility, making the new joint more flexible and the muscles stronger and more elastic. It will take some time before you regain full use of your thumb. Once regenerated, the patient will have little or no pain \u2013 as long as they do not exaggerate activities with the thumb. You have to ensure that you continue doing the exercises prescribed by your surgeon or hand therapist to improve the new joint. The thumb may never fully recover like a new finger, but you will be able to resume most of your daily tasks with virtually no complaints.",
        "Prevention": "In order to delay the progression of osteoarthritis, all measures that avoid overloading or misuse of the joint are essential.

        "Treatment": "The treatment aims to control the inflammation that exists in the bronchi. Therefore, the medications used have anti-inflammatory action and the most frequently prescribed are inhaled corticosteroids. Leukotriene antagonists can also be used, which have the same effect. To either of these two types of drugs it is useful to add a bronchodilator. Considering that asthma is a chronic disease, therapy must be carried out daily. It is also important to monitor other pathologies that may eventually coexist, such as allergic rhinitis. In a situation of respiratory distress crisis, the child must immediately begin the emergency treatment regimen prescribed by the doctor. If therapy is completed and asthma is controlled, children with this pathology can and should exercise - even so, it may be necessary to take a bronchodilator before physical education class.

    "Astigmatism": {
        "What is it?": "Astigmatism is a refractive error, that is, a change in the configuration of the eyes that affects the way images are formed and transmitted to the brain. It is a common refractive error, accounting for around 13% of all refractive errors. The other most obvious refractive errors are myopia and hyperopia. It results from an irregularity in the curvature of the cornea, the most anterior layer of the eyes, which, instead of being perfectly convex, has an abnormal surface with higher areas and flatter areas. This anomaly determines that, when images are projected onto the retina, they undergo distortion as they pass through the cornea and, as such, appear blurred. Its incidence varies with age, being very common in the first months of life (around 20%), reducing at school age to a frequency close to 5% and in young adults reaching around 60% of people, being, In general, very mild astigmatism, less than 0.5 diopters. In practice, almost everyone has a small degree of astigmatism, but this does not affect the quality of their vision. In Portugal it is estimated that around 20% of children and half of the adult population suffer from significant refractive errors, including astigmatism.",
        "Symptoms": "The presence of astigmatism translates into reduced quality of vision. In a child, this decrease may go unnoticed, especially if it affects only one eye. Younger children may complain of headaches, tiredness, their school performance may be lower, they tend to get too close to the television or objects but, in many cases, none of this happens. For this reason, it is important to carry out an ophthalmological screening at around three years of age. This consultation will allow you to detect the presence of astigmatism, myopia or hyperopia and, if necessary, correct it. In adults, complaints are more obvious because it is easier to perceive and verbalize visual difficulties. In this pathology, both near and far vision are compromised.",
        "Causes": "Its exact cause is not known. As a rule, it is present from birth and is almost always associated with myopia or hyperopia. Its basis is essentially genetic but can appear after trauma or eye surgery. Some eye diseases, such as keratoconus, in which the cornea becomes progressively thinner, are associated with high degrees of astigmatism.",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis is made during the Ophthalmology consultation, and there is a range of equipment that allows for rapid detection and quantification of this anomaly, both in adults and children. Even in children who are not yet able to participate in normal vision tests, there are alternatives that allow for an accurate diagnosis. During this consultation, the entire eyeball is assessed in order to study its characteristics and rule out possible causes of astigmatism as well as other eye diseases.",
        "Treatment": "Mild forms of astigmatism, which do not significantly interfere with vision, do not require treatment. When astigmatism is high and/or when it affects the quality of vision, it is important to correct it using glasses, contact lenses or refractive surgery. Glasses: these are the ideal solution for children up to 15 years of age. In the case of people over 40 years of age, a type of lens may be necessary in the glasses that corrects both astigmatism and so-called \u201cclose-up tired eyes\u201d. These lenses are progressive, as they contain different graduations across their surface.;/ Contact lenses: can be used from 15 years onwards as long as there are no contraindications, such as the presence of allergies, lack of tears, intense exposure to smoke or very dry environments. The use of contact lenses requires rigor, hygiene and discipline, and regular medical monitoring is important to ensure the prompt detection and correction of any anomalies resulting from their use. There are several types of contact lenses and selecting the most appropriate one will always depend on a prior medical evaluation. Both glasses and contact lenses compensate for the refractive error caused by astigmatism but do not cure it.;/ Refractive surgery: is indicated for people with astigmatism, over 18 years of age and with a stabilized degree for at least 12 months. This intervention, when performed by laser, allows the surface of the cornea to be shaped and surface errors corresponding to astigmatism to be corrected. It is a very simple procedure, carried out under local anesthesia, lasting 15 to 20 minutes and allowing normal vision in less than 24 hours.

        "What is the prognosis for astigmatism?": "Although it can change over time, making it necessary to update your glasses or contact lens prescription, it is a benign process with no permanent implications for vision. The exception to this statement corresponds to children under the age of 5/6. If there is significant astigmatism present from the first years of life and not corrected by that age, a condition called amblyopia, the common \u201clazy eye\u201d, may occur, which implies interruption of the normal development of vision. This, after 5/6 years, tends to become permanent and irreversible. Hence the interest in carrying out a first ophthalmological consultation for all children around the age of three, in order to ensure that any type of refractive error is promptly diagnosed and corrected before the onset of amblyopia.",
        "Prevention": "It is not possible to prevent astigmatism. Astigmatism is present from birth and has a familial incidence.

    "Panic attack": {
        "What is it?": "It is a sudden and intense episode of fear that triggers a set of physical reactions that can simulate a heart attack or generate a feeling of imminent death. Although they can be very frightening, they occur in the absence of real danger and without any apparent cause. In most cases, they manifest themselves in just one or two episodes throughout life, particularly during periods of greater stress. If they are repeated, causing a constant fear of a new attack, we are facing a pathological panic. Panic attacks are common, affecting more than a third of adults each year. However, women experience these episodes two to three times more frequently than men. Pathological panic attacks are rarer and are diagnosed in less than 1% of the population, usually in late adolescence or early adulthood. Although they significantly affect quality of life, they can be effectively treated.",
        "Symptoms": "Panic attacks start suddenly, without warning, and can occur at any time, such as while walking, driving, sleeping, or during a meeting. Although they vary greatly in their presentation, symptoms usually peak after 10 minutes and are eventually accompanied by a feeling of extreme fatigue. The most common signs are: Sense of imminent danger;/ Fear of losing control or dying;/ Increased heart rate;/ Perspiration;/ Tremors;/ Rapid and difficult breathing;/ Chills;/ Confrontations;/ Nausea;/ Abdominal or chest pain;/ Headaches;/ Dizziness;/ Feeling faint;/ Difficulty swallowing;/ One of the most difficult aspects of panic attacks is the intense fear that they will happen again, leading the patient to avoid situations in which they may occur or even avoid leaving the house (agoraphobia) because, for the patient, no place seems safe. Without treatment, panic attacks end up affecting all aspects of life, whether personal or professional, and can lead to the development of various forms of phobia, withdrawal from social life, problems at work or school, depression, suicidal tendencies, alcohol or drug abuse and financial problems.",
        "Causes": "Its causes are not well known but it is thought that genetics, the presence of intense stress, individual temperament and changes in the functioning of some areas of the brain may be relevant. There are increased risk factors for panic attacks, such as the death or serious illness of someone close to you, major life changes, a history of physical or sexual abuse in childhood, or a history of a traumatic event, such as an accident or assault.",
        "Diagnosis": "To diagnose them, it is important to rule out organic diseases that can cause similar symptoms, such as cardiovascular or thyroid diseases. It is always important to carry out a complete medical examination, in which psychological evaluation is an essential element, as there are well-defined diagnostic criteria for pathological panic.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment essentially involves psychotherapy and medication to reduce the symptoms and depression generally associated with this clinical condition. The aim is to eliminate the symptoms, allowing the patient to resume all their daily activities.",
        "Prevention": "There is no surefire way to prevent panic attacks. Therefore, the best recommendations are to seek treatment as soon as possible, maintain the treatment plan to prevent relapses, and maintain regular physical activity, which can have a protective effect against anxiety.

    "Atherosclerosis": {
        "What is it?": "Atherosclerosis is a particular type of arteriosclerosis, very common, which mainly affects the large vessels and which is the basis of the most common arterial diseases, such as arterial hypertension, coronary disease, aortic aneurysm or arterial disease of the lower limbs. This aspect is very important because it is known that pathologies of the circulatory system are responsible for the main causes of death in Portugal. Atherosclerosis is a disease of the large and medium-sized elastic arteries and muscular arteries, and is characterized by the presence of lesions that resemble plaques (atheromas). This pathology mainly affects the outer margins of arterial bifurcations and branches, where blood flow is most turbulent. It is a general disease that can affect different organs. When the artery wall is subjected to different forms of aggression, local accumulation of lipoproteins and migration of inflammatory cells occurs, with abnormal proliferation of some cellular elements in the inner layers of the arteries. This process leads to a progressive narrowing of the arterial caliber and tends to affect the elastic characteristics of the vessels. It begins at a young age and has a long silent gestation period, which is why it is necessary to adopt preventive measures to control risk elements during childhood and adolescence.",
        "Symptoms": "Atherosclerosis usually does not cause any symptoms until the blood supply to an organ is reduced. When this happens, the manifestations vary, depending on the specific organ involved. In fact, the signs of atherosclerosis are very variable. Some patients with a mild type may present with a serious illness, such as an acute myocardial infarction or sudden death. In contrast, other patients with more advanced disease may show few signs. Its different manifestations result from a generalized clinical process that can involve different vascular territories: cerebral, coronary and peripheral arteries. For this reason, the symptoms vary according to the arterial vascular territory involved. Cerebrovascular disease may appear as a transient ischemic attack, if there is complete regression of neurological symptoms and signs in less than 24 hours, or a stroke. Coronary vascular disease can become known in several ways, such as an acute coronary syndrome, stable or unstable angina pectoris, and acute myocardial infarction. Peripheral arterial disease produces several signs that range from intermittent claudication to pain at rest. Narrowing of the leg arteries causes cramp-like pain in the leg muscles, especially during exercise. If the narrowing is severe, there may be pain at rest, fingers and feet may become cold, pale or bluish, and hair loss may occur on the lower limbs. As noted, the progressive narrowing of the artery lumen caused by the expansion of the atheromatous plaque leads to a gradual obstruction of blood flow. When it reaches 50% to 70% of the vessel diameter and/or when there are increased metabolic or oxygen needs, symptoms of low output, angina pectoris or intermittent claudication appear. Rupture of an unstable atherosclerotic plaque, exposing its contents, can lead to thrombosis with total obstruction of the artery involved. This can result in unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack or stroke. Other clinical manifestations include erectile dysfunction, development of aneurysms and chronic renal failure. When atherosclerosis affects circulation in the abdominal region, a dull or cramp-like pain may occur in the middle of the abdomen, usually starting 15 to 30 minutes after a meal. Complete blockage of an intestinal artery causes severe abdominal pain, sometimes accompanied by vomiting, diarrhea or an increase in abdominal volume.",
        "Causes": "Factors that increase the risk of atherosclerosis include: High levels of cholesterol in the blood;/ Low levels of HDL cholesterol (the \u201cgood cholesterol\u201d);/ Elevated levels of C-reactive protein (a marker of inflammation);/ High blood pressure;/ Diabetes;/ Family history of coronary heart disease at an early age;/ Smoking;/ Obesity;/ Physical inactivity;/ Advanced age;/",
        "Diagnosis": "Medical examination may be useful in detecting its signs, such as the presence of lipid deposits in the eyelids or tendons, carotid bruits, decreased peripheral arterial pulses, palpable and pulsatile abdominal masses, neurological signs, peripheral cyanosis, gangrene, hypotension, tachycardia. Diagnosis is based on clinical history, including current symptoms and current medications, and medical examination. Laboratory tests are important, as is an electrocardiogram or echocardiogram. Other studies may be necessary to assess blood circulation in the heart, brain, and legs. Ultrasound measurement of the thickness of the intima and media layers of the carotid arteries has been considered a test with great potential for noninvasive assessment of the disease.",
        "Treatment": "There is no cure, but treatment can slow the progression or even stop it from getting worse. The main goal of treatment is to prevent significant narrowing of the arteries so that symptoms never develop and vital organs are never damaged. To achieve this, you must start by having a healthy lifestyle. It is also important to diagnose and treat all risk factors for its development, such as cholesterol and high blood pressure. Once organ damage related to atherosclerosis has developed, treatment depends on the organ involved. There are currently effective medications available to control coronary heart disease, transient ischemic attacks and peripheral arterial disease. These treatments may be purely drug-based or involve surgery.",
        "Prevention": "It is possible to help prevent atherosclerosis by changing the risk factors for the disease. You should practice a lifestyle that promotes good circulation, avoiding smoking, maintaining a healthy weight and diet rich in vegetables and fruit, practicing regular exercise, controlling high blood pressure, diabetes and cholesterol. Regular physical exercise can bring many benefits to the health of cardiovascular patients. But you should consult your doctor. Hypertension, stroke, dementia, osteoporosis, excess weight. Excess salt can increase the risk of several diseases. The key is moderation. It is important in diagnosing heart problems and should be done regularly from a certain age.

    "Global developmental delay": {
        "What is it?": "Global developmental delay (AGD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that occurs at an early age in a child's development and can become chronic throughout life. From birth, children develop according to stages of psychomotor development that are characteristic of all children. Therefore, there are developmental milestones that must be achieved at specific target ages. When these stages are not achieved, we are possibly facing a developmental delay. Developmental delay is different from maturational delay, in that the deviation in the acquisition of the developmental milestone is more significant in temporal terms.",
        "Symptoms": "Global developmental delay refers to a delay in at least two of the areas of child development: verbal cognition, non-verbal cognition, language, gross motor skills, fine motor skills or autonomy. This delay can be noticed early, for example when the child fails to start walking within the ideal time for acquiring walking skills (after 18 months) or when he/she does not acquire his/her first words until 18 months. The baby/child's behaviour is also often different when compared to babies/children of the same age, and may be excessively active, sullen, inattentive, or on the contrary, very passive, uncommunicative and with little reaction to stimuli from the environment and interaction with people.",
        "Causes": "The global delay in psychomotor development results from atypical intellectual and adaptive development with an early origin, and can be a consequence of multiple causes (prenatal, perinatal or postnatal). The etiological diagnosis remains unknown in 50-80% of all situations. As a disorder with a genetic cause, it is heterogeneous. \u00a0In addition to its clinical variability, it can occur sporadically or be hereditary. Numerous factors are involved in the genesis of AGD: genetic, educational, cultural, traumatic, emotional and socioeconomic. Genetic research may help identify the cause, especially in cases of moderate to severe AGD.",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of AGD is based on the existing delay in psychomotor development in more than one domain (cognition, motor, autonomy, language, fine motor skills, verbal cognition, attention, behavior). This delay should ideally be quantified in Psychology consultations through the application of psychometric tests, information from the child's and family's and school history data. In addition to AGD, it will be important to check whether there are other comorbid neurodevelopmental disorders, such as a language disorder or attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. This diagnosis can be made during the first two years of life and up to 5 years of age. From this age onwards, the most appropriate nomenclature for a situation of this type may be intellectual development disorder. For this diagnosis, a Neurodevelopmental Pediatrics consultation should also be carried out so that other clinical causes can be excluded, comorbidity identified and to guide the etiological investigation of the situation. Genetic consultation is normally recommended, especially in more severe cases, or in the presence of phenotypic changes, to attempt to identify the etiological cause.",
        "Treatment": "AGD has a major impact on the life of the affected person as well as their family and society, which is why its timely diagnosis is essential so that timely intervention/treatment can be initiated. Intervention in AGD must be multidisciplinary, since this delay affects more than one area of \u200b\u200bdevelopment. Therefore, an intervention program must be created that includes specialties such as Psychology, Psychomotricity, Speech Therapy, Occupational Therapy or Music Therapy. The number of hours allocated to the program depends on the child's age, the severity of the delay and the individual profile, but in general, the ideal would be a more intensive intervention in the first phase (1h/day) so that deficits can be overcome as soon as possible. as quickly as possible. In addition to specialized technicians, educators must also be included, so that school integration must be early, as well as parents. Parents must be an active element, and must be guided with parental strategies on the best way to encourage their child towards the objectives defined in the intervention programs. This work must be coordinated between everyone involved.",
        "Prevention": "Many causes of intellectual disability are not preventable. However, numerous strategies must be implemented to detect and diagnose treatable causes early (such as hypothyroidism and phenylketonuria), reduce the risks of intellectual development disorder, minimize sequelae, and improve children's function and prognosis.Primary prevention aims to prevent conditions that could cause intellectual disability. Examples of interventions are: Avoid prenatal exposure to alcohol, drugs and other teratogenic agents;/ Use of prenatal vitamin and mineral supplements, including folic acid;/ Adequate prenatal surveillance;/ Differentiated perinatal care;/ Extended prenatal screening test (heel prick test);/ National vaccination program;/ Use of restraint system and appropriate automobile transport;/ Prevention of road, domestic and leisure accidents and other traumas;/ Prevention of traumatic brain injuries.;/ Early, adequate and timely genetic study and counseling must be carried out in all suspected cases. There are also two other levels of prevention: secondary and tertiary. Secondary prevention, encompasses the specific treatment of conditions with the aim of reducing the risk of AGD and improving the prognosis, and tertiary prevention, brings together interventions that aim to optimize children's function and quality of life.

    "Stroke stroke": {
        "What is it?": "Cerebrovascular accident (CVA) is the main cause of death in Portugal. Worldwide, it is estimated that: one in six people will have a stroke; every second someone suffers this illness; and every six seconds this disease is responsible for someone's death. Each year, 15 million suffer a stroke and, of these, six million do not survive. According to the Portuguese Stroke Society, Portugal is, in Western Europe, the country with the highest mortality rate, especially in the population under 65 years of age. Stroke results from damage to brain cells, which die or stop functioning normally, due to the lack of oxygen and nutrients following a blockage of blood flow (ischemic stroke) or because they are flooded with blood from an artery that connects. ruptures (hemorrhagic stroke). Ischemic patients account for around 4/5 of the total. Brain cells die soon after this injury occurs. However, it can last a few hours if the blood flow is not completely stopped. For this reason, it is essential to act quickly to minimize brain damage. There is also another form of shorter duration, less than 24 hours, which is called a transient ischemic attack (TIA). In these cases, the blockage of the cerebral artery is momentary and symptoms can last for a few minutes or hours. It is important to emphasize that, even in temporary cases, it is essential to go to the hospital, as a TIA can be the first sign of a stroke with devastating consequences. In fact, one in five people who experience a TIA will suffer an extensive stroke within the next three months. You should never ignore an AIT. It is still common to designate stroke as \u201cthrombosis\u201d.",
        "Symptoms": "Since the brain controls bodily functions, its signals will vary depending on the area affected. For example, if a stroke affects the area that controls body movement on the right side, that side will have reduced mobility. Since the brain also controls more complex mental processes, such as communication, emotions, reasoning and thinking, all of these functions are likely to be affected after a stroke. As it occurs suddenly, due to the occlusion or rupture of an artery, its effects on the body are immediate.",
        "Causes": "There are numerous risk factors, and the greater the number, the greater the risk of a stroke. Some of these factors cannot be controlled, such as age, gender (more common in men) and genetics. Regarding age, it is important to note that around 25% of strokes occur in young people. Diabetes, high blood pressure, cholesterol, obesity, a sedentary lifestyle, arrhythmias, fibromuscular dysplasia, tobacco and alcohol consumption also increase the risk.",
        "Diagnosis": "It's simple to recognize a stroke using the five F's rule. These symptoms can appear alone or in combination: Face: may suddenly become asymmetrical with one of the eyelids drooping. These signs can be better noticed if the affected person tries to smile.;/ Strength: It is common for an arm or leg to suddenly lose strength or for a sudden loss of balance to occur.;/ Speech: may sound strange or incomprehensible and speech may not make sense. Often, the patient does not seem to understand what is being said to him or her.;/ Sudden lack of vision: in one or both eyes, is a common symptom, as is double vision.;/ Severe headache: it is also important to assess a sudden and very intense headache, different from the usual pattern and with no apparent cause.;/",
        "Treatment": "The most useful medications for the treatment and prevention of stroke are antihypertensives, antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants. Altogether, these three classes of medications improve circulation and ensure better flow of blood, oxygen and nutrients to brain cells. The choice of drug combination should always be made by the doctor. In some cases, surgery may be essential to unblock a clogged artery.",
        "What is the recovery after a stroke?": "About a third of patients recover significantly within the first month, but many patients will experience lifelong after-effects. Recovery will depend on the location and extent of the stroke, but also on the time that has passed, which is why it is crucial to go to hospital immediately if there is a suspicion that it has developed. Physiotherapy and lifestyle changes are important aspects of rehabilitation. Maintaining a positive attitude and professional and family support are also essential to ensuring that everything goes as smoothly as possible.",
        "What are the consequences of a stroke?": "They will depend on the type of stroke, the location of the artery affected, the area of \u200b\u200bthe brain affected, and the state of health and activity prior to the episode. All strokes are different and each person affected will have different problems and needs.",
        "Prevention": "It is important to monitor all aspects of your health, by regularly checking your blood pressure and cholesterol, not smoking or consuming excessive amounts of alcohol or salt, maintaining a healthy diet and exercising.",
        "What to do if you suspect a stroke?": "In these cases, it is essential to call 911 immediately, explaining everything that is happening.

        "What is it?": "Heartburn is a symptom of a digestive disorder and not a disease in itself. It occurs, for example, in gastroesophageal reflux, a condition in which the acidic contents of the stomach flow back into the esophagus, damaging its walls. Heartburn is part of a broader picture of symptoms that are called dyspepsia, a term that means poor digestion. This is characterized by a set of signs that are related to the digestion of food, such as abdominal pain or discomfort, a feeling of fullness, belching, vomiting, heartburn or loss of appetite. This is a common problem and it is estimated that around 30% of the adult population suffers or has suffered from this pathology. In Portugal, around 3% to 4% of general practitioner consultations are due to this symptomatology.",
        "Symptoms": "Its sensation usually starts in the sternum and can travel up to the throat. It is more common after meals or when the patient is lying down, and can last minutes or hours.\u00a0In general, it manifests itself in the form of a stinging or burning sensation that can worsen when swallowed. This burning sensation results from the irritation caused by the reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus. In other cases, it appears as a bitter taste in the mouth. This symptom should not be confused with difficulty swallowing, which is called dysphagia, and which can occur in various diseases such as esophagitis or esophageal cancer. In some cases, it is associated with a chronic cough, also resulting from irritation of the esophagus by stomach contents. If this condition is not treated and if it occurs frequently, repeated damage to the walls of the esophagus can cause blood loss and a progressive narrowing of the channel, making swallowing difficult. Ulcers can also occur in the esophagus and, if the aggression is prolonged, there is a risk of developing esophageal cancer. The pain of heartburn can simulate that which occurs during a heart attack and it is important, in case of doubt, to consult a doctor urgently.",
        "Causes": "During a meal, food passes from the mouth to the stomach through a tube called the esophagus. Under normal conditions, the connection between the esophagus and the stomach does not allow food or stomach secretions to flow back up. If this mechanism does not work properly, stomach acid can reach the walls of the esophagus, irritating them and causing heartburn. One of the causes of this reflux is a hiatal hernia, a condition in which part of the stomach passes above the diaphragm, entering the chest cavity. A very large meal, leaning forward and a horizontal position are factors that can contribute to reflux and, therefore, to the occurrence of heartburn. Pregnancy, stress, tobacco, coffee (even decaffeinated), alcohol, carbonated drinks, citrus fruits, tomatoes, chocolate, mint, onions and very fatty or spicy foods are other causes associated with this symptomatology. Among medications, aspirin, ibuprofen, some sedatives and antihypertensives can also cause this condition.",
        "Diagnosis": "When faced with a patient complaining of heartburn, the doctor should try to obtain, through clinical history and objective examination, a diagnostic hypothesis that is as precise as possible.\u00a0 These elements are often enough to start treatment, with a reassessment being important a few weeks later. In fact, in many cases a significant improvement is achieved in this way without the need to carry out further examinations. In other cases, this investigation may be relevant and, within it, upper digestive endoscopy and respiratory testing to search for helicobacter pylori stand out.",
        "Treatment": "There are several medications that can be used to treat reflux. The most commonly used classes of drugs are antacids, H2 receptor blockers and proton pump inhibitors. These drugs aim to reduce or neutralize stomach acid secretion, so that damage to the esophagus is less significant in the presence of reflux. All of these substances must be prescribed by a doctor, who will be able to select the most appropriate one for each case. In more severe cases, surgery may be necessary to correct the cause of the reflux.",
        "Prevention": "There are several non-medical measures that can help combat heartburn, such as eating at least two to three hours before going to sleep, lying down with the head elevated, stopping smoking, losing weight, not overeating, avoiding too much clothing. tight spaces and foods that tend to cause the problem.

    "Overactive bladder": {
        "What is it?": "Overactive bladder is a neuromuscular disorder in which the muscle in the bladder wall contracts inappropriately during filling, compromising the storage phase. When the bladder is not full, its muscles are relaxed. When it is fuller, signals are sent to the nervous system with this information, triggering the urge to urinate. Overactive bladder occurs when this signal is sent even when the bladder is not full, or when the bladder muscles are too active, forcing the bladder to contract even when it is not full, thus causing an urgent need to urinate. Overactive bladder does not correspond to a disease but to a set of symptoms, such as the urgent need to urinate (urination urgency), with or without incontinence, usually accompanied by frequency and an increase in the number of nocturnal urinations (nocturia), in the absence of infection or other illness that may explain these symptoms. This condition significantly affects quality of life, increases the risk of depression and reduces sleep quality. Psychological effects are common, with feelings of fear, shame and guilt. Concern regarding odor, the feeling of dirt, incontinence\u00a0during sexual activity can compromise the emotional life of affected patients and urinary frequency and the need to interrupt tasks interfere with the ability to work and travel. In the United States of America, it is estimated that around 30% of men and 40% of women experience symptoms of overactive bladder. In Portugal, it is estimated that the prevalence of symptoms indicative of overactive bladder is slightly higher in men than in women. These numbers may be higher because many people with symptoms do not go to the doctor out of shame or because they are unaware that treatment exists. The prevalence of overactive bladder increases with age (20% at age 70 and 30% at age 75); however, it should not be seen as part of aging, but rather as a disorder that can be treated.",
        "Symptoms": "The main symptom is the feeling of urgency to urinate. This feeling is almost uncontrollable and is accompanied by the fear of not being able to reach a bathroom in time. There may or may not be loss of some urine. There is also an increase in the number of daily urinations and it is common to wake up during the night more than once with the urge to urinate. It is important to highlight that the symptoms of overactive bladder can result from a urinary tract infection, nerve damage or be a side effect of some medications. As such, it is essential to always consult a doctor when symptoms of overactive bladder appear.",
        "Causes": "The causes of overactive bladder are diverse: trauma with spinal cord injury, stroke, multiple sclerosis, dementia, Parkinson's disease, diabetes, heart failure, peripheral venous insufficiency, medications (diuretics, bethanechol), postural changes, coughing and walking. People with depression or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus have a higher risk of developing an overactive bladder. Age (over 75 years), arthritis, oral hormone replacement therapy, women with increased body mass index, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, constipation, immobility, bladder or vaginal surgery, hysterectomy, and some medications (beta blockers, antidepressants, antipsychotics, some antihypertensives, diuretics, sedatives) are also risk factors for this condition. Physiological changes associated with aging, such as decreased bladder capacity and changes in muscle tone, also favor the development of overactive bladder. Some foods are irritating to the bladder, such as caffeine, alcohol and spicy foods, and therefore accentuate the symptoms of overactive bladder.",
        "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis is based on clinical history, medical examination and some additional tests, such as urine analysis and assessment of post-void residue. A neurological examination is important in some cases. In other cases, an ultrasound of the bladder may be useful.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment depends on the severity of the symptoms and their impact on the patient's lifestyle. Treatment may be pharmacological, behavioral or surgical. A combination of the first two is effective in most patients. There are medications that relax the bladder muscle and prevent it from contracting at the wrong times. Behavioral interventions consist of limiting the consumption of bladder irritants (caffeine, alcohol), bladder training, urgency suppression techniques, and pelvic floor exercises. Other options are neuromodulatory treatments, in which electrical stimuli are used on the nerves to modify their functioning and botulinum toxin, administered to the bladder in order to reduce its contraction frequency. Surgery is indicated in cases where other modalities are not effective. If other conditions are identified as the cause of overactive bladder symptoms, they should be treated accordingly.",
        "Prevention": "There are some activities that can reduce the risk of developing overactive bladder: regular physical exercise, reducing caffeine and alcohol consumption, not smoking, treating and controlling chronic diseases, such as diabetes, which can contribute to overactive bladder, carrying out exercises to strengthen the pelvic muscles.

    "Neurogenic bladder": {
        "What is it?": "Neurogenic bladder consists of the loss of normal bladder function caused by damage to part of the nervous system. Neurogenic bladder may originate from a disease, trauma, or birth defect that affects the brain, spinal cord, or nerves that go to the bladder, its sphincter, or both. There are different types of neurogenic bladder: low activity, when it is unable to contract and empty well, or hyperactive, when it empties due to uncontrolled reflexes. The normal function of the bladder is to store urine and eliminate it in a coordinated manner through the urethra. This coordination is regulated through a complex interaction between the central and peripheral nervous system and, if it is disturbed, a neurogenic bladder can develop.",
        "Symptoms": "The inability to control urine output (urinary incontinence) is associated with neurogenic bladder. The patient may experience intermittent urinary flow, discomfort during urination or even inability to urinate. This urinary retention may result from the inability to contract the bladder muscle or the loss of coordination between this muscle and the bladder sphincter. Symptoms of urinary infection or kidney dilation may occur as a result of neurogenic bladder. Symptoms associated with the formation of bladder stones may also occur. If urine refluxes from the bladder to the ureters and from there to the kidney, kidney damage or infection can occur, with even more serious consequences. Symptoms vary according to the stage in which the bladder is, low activity or overactive. As a bladder with low activity, in general, it cannot empty, it dilates until it becomes very large. This dilation is usually not painful because the bladder expands slowly and has very little or no local nerve activity. In some cases, the bladder remains enlarged but loses small amounts of urine constantly (overflow incontinence). Bladder infections are common in people who have an underactive bladder, as the stasis of residual urine provides the conditions to stimulate the growth of bacteria. Bladder stones may form. Symptoms of a bladder infection vary depending on the amount of nerve activity remaining in the bladder. An overactive bladder can fill and empty without control and with varying degrees of discomfort, as it contracts and empties reflexively, that is, involuntarily. When there is an underactive or overactive bladder, the pressure and backflow of urine from the bladder and through the ureters can damage the kidneys. In people who have a spinal cord injury, bladder contraction and sphincter relaxation may not be coordinated, so the pressure in the bladder remains high and does not allow urine to leave the kidneys. This can result in kidney damage.",
        "Causes": "A low-activity neurogenic bladder is usually the result of interruption of the local nerves that stimulate it. The most common cause in children is a birth defect of the spinal cord, such as spina bifida or myelomeningocele. An overactive bladder generally results from a disruption of normal control of the bladder by the spinal cord and brain. A common cause is trauma or a disease, such as multiple sclerosis, which affects the spinal cord and which can be associated with paralysis of the legs (paraplegia) or arms and legs (tetraplegia). Diabetes Mellitus and AIDS are diseases that also affect peripheral nerves and can cause urinary retention. In these diseases, the nerves that control the bladder are destroyed, causing progressive and painless distension. In fact, in Diabetes patients lose the sensation of filling their bladder. Around 25% of patients who suffer a stroke develop urinary retention. Other diseases that can cause neurogenic bladder are polio, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, genitoanal area herpes, anemia, neurosyphilis, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. Some types of tumors can also cause neurogenic bladder.",
        "Diagnosis": "When neurogenic bladder is suspected, it is important to evaluate both the nervous system and the urinary system. A medical examination may allow you to detect an enlarged bladder by examining the lower part of the abdomen. Radiological studies in which a radiopaque substance is injected through a vein (intravenous urography), or through a probe that is inserted into the bladder (cystography) or urethra (urethrography), provide more information. X-rays can show the caliber of the ureters and the size of the bladder and, possibly, the presence of stones and kidney damage, which provides the doctor with valuable information about the functioning of the kidneys. Ultrasound provides similar information. Cystoscopy is a procedure that allows observation of the inside of the bladder through a flexible endoscope that is inserted into the urethra, generally without causing pain. The amount of urine left in the bladder after urinating can be measured by inserting a probe through the urethra to empty the bladder. Internal bladder and urethral pressure can be measured by connecting the probe to a meter (cystometrography). The study of the brain and spinal cord using imaging methods such as magnetic resonance imaging complements this information.",
        "Treatment": "The main goal of treating neurogenic bladder is to prevent kidney damage. On the other hand, it is important to minimize the limitations and social impact of this dysfunction. The earlier the treatment, the lower the risk of deterioration in kidney function and the less need for future surgery. When the cause of a\u00a0low-activity (hypotonic) bladder\u00a0is a neurological injury, a probe (or catheter) can be inserted through the urethra to empty the bladder constantly or intermittently. The probe is inserted as soon as possible after the injury, to prevent the bladder muscle from being damaged by excessive stretching and to prevent infections. Permanently placing a catheter causes fewer physical problems in women than in men. In a man, the probe can cause inflammation of the urethra and the tissues surrounding it. People who develop an overactive bladder may also need a tube to facilitate emptying if bladder outlet spasms prevent it from emptying completely. In quadriplegic men, who cannot use the tube themselves for this purpose, it is possible that the bladder outlet sphincter will have to be sectioned to allow it to empty and an external collection device must be used. Treatment with medications can improve urine storage in the bladder, can relieve symptoms associated with bladder irritation or incontinence, and can improve bladder control. In general, control of an overactive bladder can be modified with medications that relax the bladder, such as anticholinergics. However, they often cause side effects, such as dry mouth and constipation; Furthermore, it is difficult to improve bladder emptying with medication in patients with a neurogenic bladder. Sometimes surgery is recommended to make urine drain through an external opening made in the abdominal wall or to increase the size of the bladder. Urine leaving the kidneys can be diverted to the surface of the body by excising a short segment of the small intestine and connecting the ureters to it; in this case, the urine is collected in a bag. The bladder can be enlarged with a segment of intestine in a procedure called augmentation cystoplasty, and the individual can thus perform self-algalization. In infants, the connection is made between the bladder and an opening in the skin as a temporary measure, until the child is old enough for permanent surgery. In all cases, it is important to reduce the risk of stones forming in the urine as much as possible. . Kidney function must be strictly monitored. Any kidney infection must be treated immediately. It is recommended to drink at least eight glasses of liquid per day. Although complete recovery from any type of neurogenic bladder is not common, some people recover quite well with treatment.",
        "Prevention": "Although most forms of neurogenic bladder cannot be prevented, it is possible to delay its development in patients with Diabetes by strictly controlling blood glucose levels. From another perspective, using a seat belt when driving a car and not carrying out activities that increase the risk of spinal cord injuries is an important way to prevent this type of neurogenic bladder.

    "Biopsies": {
        "Advantages and benefits": "Obtaining these samples allows, for example, studying their microscopic structure, identifying abnormal growth patterns, changes in the normal architecture of the cells that make up this tissue, the presence of inflammatory reactions or microorganisms. In conjunction with other techniques, a biopsy allows us to obtain very rich information and, therefore, makes the diagnosis more accurate and the treatment more appropriate. In the case of surgery, the biopsy allows, during the intervention itself, to understand what type of lesion is present and, in the case of tumors, it allows to assess whether the entire tumor was removed with an adequate safety margin. Thus, the biopsy works as a complement to surgery, enhancing the benefits it aims to offer the patient.",
        "Methodology": "The methodology depends on the type of biopsy. Most involve the use of a sharp instrument to remove a small amount of tissue. If the biopsy is performed on the skin, a local anesthetic is used beforehand. Biopsies can be performed using a needle, or guided by computed tomography or ultrasound, so that the tissue collection instrument is directed to the desired location. In the case of bone cancer, a bone biopsy is performed, which may involve minor surgery. In cases of leukemia or lymphoma, a bone marrow biopsy is done, usually on the iliac crest bone. Biopsies of organs such as the liver, kidney or prostate allow the diagnosis of diseases in these locations. In general, it is possible to perform a biopsy in any location and in any organ. In the specific case of the skin, a circular blade is used to obtain a cylindrical sample of skin. In the presence of cystic lesions, an aspiration biopsy is performed, which allows the contents to be aspirated and sent for analysis. This type of biopsy is also useful in Ophthalmology where it allows the collection of samples of the contents of the eyeball (aqueous or vitreous humor) which are important for the diagnosis of eye diseases. Depending on the site to be studied, biopsies can be more or less complex, more or less invasive. More superficial biopsies, such as skin biopsies, can be done in an office at the same time the lesion is identified. As mentioned, in these cases a local anesthetic is used to reduce discomfort during the procedure. More invasive biopsies must be performed in a hospital setting and may require sedation and pain medications. It is normal to experience some discomfort at the biopsy site for a few days. In many cases, the biopsy area is simply protected by a dressing; in other cases, a few stitches may be needed to close the site where the biopsy was performed and thus speed up healing. Once the sample has been collected, it is properly preserved and sent to a laboratory where it will be studied according to the objective to be clarified. In some cases, the result is very quick; in others, techniques are required whose results can take a week or more. For biopsies performed under local anesthesia, the patient does not need to remain in the Clinic or Hospital; if general anesthesia is necessary, an overnight stay in the Hospital may be recommended.",
        "Complications": "Complications from a biopsy are rare. Bleeding or infection may occur at the site of collection. Pain is generally well tolerated and resolves with the use of painkillers. More rarely, fever, swelling at the biopsy site, pain that worsens despite medication, persistent bleeding or suppuration at the biopsy site may occur. In most cases, no preparation is necessary, but sometimes it may be recommended to stop taking medications that interfere with clotting to reduce the risk of bleeding. In each specific case, you will always be given full information about the preparation required before a biopsy.",
        "Indications": "Biopsies are useful for identifying masses, tumors or cysts and for studying skin diseases. During surgery to remove a tumor, performing a biopsy during surgery allows you to assess whether the entire tumor has been removed and whether the safety margin has been respected. Thus, tissue removal may or may not be increased depending on the results obtained in real time. Other interesting applications are the characterization of lesions that arise after trauma and that may correspond to a reaction to a foreign body or nonspecific inflammatory processes that may result from a bacterial, viral or other type of microorganism infection.",
        "Care to be taken": "Depending on the type and location of the biopsy, care may vary and will be duly explained before the procedure. Biopsies are an extremely useful diagnostic tool. Through them, many diseases can be properly identified and treated, with a very low degree of invasion, very high safety and increasing effectiveness.

    "Blepharitis": {
        "What is it?": "Blepharitis is an inflammation of the eyelid margin that can affect up to 30% of the population. It is divided into: Anterior (more superficial, where the eyelashes grow) Posterior (deeper, associated with dysfunction of the Meibomian glands located inside the eyelids). Many cases are mixed, involving the eyelid globally. Blepharitis can be associated with skin problems such as rosacea, psoriasis or seborrheic dermatitis, but also with hormonal changes, chemotherapy, or develop gradually with aging. In many cases it is not possible to identify a direct cause.",
        "Symptoms": "Symptoms are variable and can be mild and occasional or severe and persistent. The sensation of eye irritation, stinging, burning and red eyes are common. Since the Meibomius glands are essential for the production of tears (lipid component), their dysfunction leads to greater instability of the tear film and consequently complaints of dry eye and possible injuries to the ocular surface. Sometimes small \u201cdandruffs\u201d are visible at the base of the eyelashes.",
        "Treatment": "Variable. The application of local moist heat, topical anti-inflammatories or topical or systemic antibiotics may be indicated.

    "Blepharospasm": {
        "What is it?": "Essential or primary blepharospasm corresponds to an involuntary repetitive contraction of the eyelid muscles (orbicularis muscle), of unknown cause. It is bilateral and develops gradually, initially as discrete contractions, which worsen over time. There are situations where contractions may be secondary to ocular changes (such as dry eye), which should always be excluded through a thorough ophthalmological examination. Another common condition is hemifacial spasm, where the muscles on one side of the face contract irregularly and uncontrollably. This condition may be secondary to compression of the facial nerve, which should be ruled out.",
        "Symptoms": "Involuntary contraction of the eyelid muscles, which in more advanced cases can lead to significant vision disturbance. Essential blepharospasm disappears during sleep.",
        "Treatment": "The first line of treatment is the periodic application of botulinum toxin to control muscle contractions. Only in specific cases may surgery to excise the affected muscles (myectomy) be indicated. Myopia, astigmatism and hyperopia often lead to the use of glasses or contact lenses.

    "Botulism": {
        "What is it?": "Botulism is a rare but serious and potentially fatal disease caused by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. This microbe produces spores that release toxic substances - botulinum toxin - into our nervous system, causing muscle paralysis, respiratory failure and eventual death. This toxin is considered the most lethal produced by bacteria and perhaps the most deadly of all poisons. It is classified as a biological agent, with potential bioterrorism.",
        "Transmission": "The bacteria exists in soil and aquatic environments,\u00a0resisting high temperatures (above 100\u00baC). The most common type of botulism is foodborne, caused by ingestion of food contaminated with the toxin, especially home-made preserves and smoked products (such as, for example, sausages, ham, sausages). Infant\u00a0botulism, an even rarer type of botulism, occurs in the\u00a0first two years of life\u00a0in babies who eat contaminated food, germinating the spores in the intestine and releasing the toxin. The food most associated with this intoxication is\u00a0honey.",
        "Symptoms": "Symptoms begin 18 to 36 hours after ingesting contaminated food and gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or abdominal pain are the first to appear. Subsequently, patients present neurological symptoms such as difficulty swallowing, speaking, double vision, hoarseness, with progression of paralysis to the respiratory muscles, arms and legs, leading to respiratory failure and eventual death. In\u00a0infantile botulism,\u00a0babies\u00a0appear\u00a0soft, with weak sucking and swallowing reflexes, weak crying and poor head control.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment with anti-botulinum toxin serum is the only effective treatment capable of reversing the condition. Given the severity of the disease, patients must be admitted to intensive care units, almost always requiring ventilatory support to breathe and other supportive treatments.",
        "Prevention": "Botulism prevention involves proper food preparation and storage. To prevent infant botulism, honey should not be offered to children before the age of 2, a practice that is wrong but widespread due to the supposed calming properties of honey.

    "Prostate Braquitherapy": {
        "What is it?": "Prostate cancer is a major male scourge, causing enormous suffering for both the patient and his family. This tumor is the most prevalent in men and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in men. The heavy social, medical and personal burden that prostate cancer entails has driven all efforts towards early detection. Therefore, urologists have done their best to diagnose this tumor at an early stage of the disease, increasing the chances of success of the chosen treatment. Among the various existing alternatives for the treatment of localized malignant prostatic neoplasia, interstitial prostatic brachytherapy stands out due to some characteristics of this technique. The term Brachytherapy, also known as interstitial or internal radiotherapy, derived from the Greek word \u201cbrachios\u201d, means short, and refers to the therapeutic effect of radioisotopes placed in contact with the lesion to be treated. Therefore, prostatic brachytherapy consists of placing radioisotope seeds in the prostate, perineally, with prostate cancer curative purposes. In reality, prostate brachytherapy is a less invasive surgical technique, without the need for a classic surgical incision, simple and performed in a single session, allowing the patient to be discharged early after approximately 24 hours of the intervention. Taking into account the focus on the patient's quality of life and expectations, we can say that this is an excellent option, as it guarantees the early resumption of normal life, almost immediately (unlike what happens with radical surgery). or external radiotherapy). It is a form of treatment for prostate adenocarcinoma that is very popular in the USA, where it was developed in its modern form in the mid-1980s. In Portugal, it is relatively recent but has a representation comparable to other more established therapies (surgery and external radiotherapy). The development of ultrasound, computers and sophisticated three-dimensional prostate dosimetry programs, as well as perineal grid guidance systems, allowed the development of modern prostate brachytherapy, which finally managed to establish itself as an alternative to classic treatments, radical prostatectomy and external radiotherapy.",
        "Target audience": "The selection of patients for this treatment is based on a number of factors. Briefly, the main indication is considered to be localized disease and some locally advanced disease.  There are patients who are universally accepted as \u201cideal\u201d. However, as the advantages of this technique are considerable, it is possible (and common) to treat patients who do not have all the characteristics. There are therefore more comprehensive, less restrictive criteria, which can be considered as a relative indication, but whose results are equally very good. Different authors recommend different criteria.  In patients at high risk of disease progression, combined treatment with external radiotherapy and androgen hormone blockade may be indicated. As one of the possible \u2013 and currently most widely used \u2013 therapies for the treatment of localized prostate cancer, it has the same indications as other therapies for the same stage of the disease.",
        "Technique": "Prostate brachytherapy involves the insertion of radioactive \u201cimplants\u201d (\u201cseeds\u201d) into the prostate, under ultrasound control and real-time monitoring. It is performed in an operating room, under local or general anesthesia. It can be performed on an outpatient basis. The patient is in the lithotomy (\u201cgynecological\u201d) position.  It is a minimally invasive procedure, which lasts between 60 and 120 minutes and does not require surgical incision or blood transfusion.  As these seeds are placed within the prostate, this allows a high dose of radiation to be released while remaining essentially confined to the prostate. This fact allows the surrounding tissues (healthy tissues) to be practically intact, such as the rectum, bladder and urethra. The application of seeds that can be separated or linked requires an appropriate device.  The control of the number and position of the seeds to be used is done through an extremely sophisticated computer system, with specific software. The implementation of this technique therefore requires a multidisciplinary team that includes, in addition to the Urologist, a Radiotherapist and a Physicist, whose joint, complementary and extremely differentiated action allows the good results described for this technique to be obtained.  The entire operation is meticulously planned in advance. Thirty days after the procedure, a pelvic CT scan is performed to map the prostate three-dimensionally and calculate dosimetry.  In the post-operative period, patients are reassured about the risk of radioactivity emission and instructed to follow certain recommendations in their sexual life and in their relationships with children in particular.",
        "Advantages": "Prostate Cancer treatment with Brachytherapy has a curative purpose. According to the results of the world literature, 95% of patients treated with I-125 are free of the disease after 12 years of treatment.  It is associated with very encouraging complication rates. Only about 5% of patients who have not had previous prostate surgery may experience some degree of urinary incontinence. About 10% of men may experience sexual impotence of varying degrees.  In some cases, there may be slight discomfort in the perineal area for 2 to 3 days, which can be effectively treated with mild painkillers. Some blood may be seen in the urine or semen for a few days after the procedure. This is normal and will stop spontaneously after 2 to 3 days.  It is a curative treatment performed in a single session. Patients can return to normal activity (including work) within a few days.  It has numerous advantages, such as high efficacy (greater than External Radiotherapy, as demonstrated by a recent study), lower rate of side effects (such as risk of urinary incontinence and erection problems, which are common after radical prostatectomy and rectal injuries after radiotherapy) shorter anesthesia and hospitalization time (the patient is generally discharged the day after the intervention). The catheterization time is only a few hours (generally less than 24 hours), unlike surgery, where it is necessary to maintain the catheterization for a few days and the return to normal day-to-day activity is also very difficult. faster.  However, it has limitations in relation to patients with large prostates, or those who have undergone previous prostate surgery or with significant symptoms of the lower urinary tract, especially emptying symptoms (\u201cobstructive\u201d). In these situations, special attention must be paid to the risk of post-treatment urinary retention or complaints of bladder instability.

    "Bronchiolitis": {
        "What is it?": "Bronchiolitis is an acute inflammation of the lower airways, very common in the first two years of life and predominantly in late autumn and winter. Bronchioles are the smallest and narrowest airways that communicate between the larger bronchi and the alveoli. The alveoli are the portion of the lungs where oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange occurs. Respiratory syncytial virus is the agent responsible for more than 70% of cases. Sometimes, in the same episode of acute bronchiolitis, one or more infectious agents may be involved. It is extremely contagious and transmission occurs through contact with contaminated respiratory secretions. Although coughing produces aerosols (small infected droplets) that children inhale, the most common mode of transmission is through hands that have infected secretions. Typically, children acquire the condition after being exposed to family members with the infection or sick children in kindergarten. As such, washing your hands before handling babies is one of the most important measures to reduce contagion. Acute bronchiolitis is characterized by an obstruction of small airways (bronchioles), making it difficult for air to enter the lungs. It mainly affects children under two years of age (maximum incidence between the first and sixth months of life). Most are infected by this virus and develop mild bronchiolitis without requiring hospital care. The most serious cases (1% to 2% of cases) will have to be admitted to pediatric services.",
        "Symptoms": "Bronchiolitis usually begins with a runny nose and blocked nose, cough, with or without fever. After a period of two to three days, breathing difficulties appear, which worsen and are accompanied by wheezing (wheezing), irritability and refusal to eat. In younger children, acute bronchiolitis may manifest itself, at an early stage, through periods of apnea (breathing pauses). Rapid breathing or difficulty breathing in and out may also occur.",
        "Causes": "It is a viral infection. Most cases are benign and only 1% to 3.5% of all children with acute bronchiolitis require hospital admission. This percentage is higher in risk groups such as ex-premature babies, minors with chronic respiratory diseases, congenital heart disease, immunodeficiencies and those under the age of three and six months. There are also other factors that increase the risk of disease: masculine gender;/ exposure to tobacco smoke;/ feeding with breast milk for less than one or two months;/ low socioeconomic status;/",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of bronchiolitis is mainly clinical. An important data to be valued in the physical examination is the measurement of oxygen saturation to assess the need for oxygen administration. Hypoxemia (low oxygen) is an important complication that requires hospital admission. If the progression of acute bronchiolitis is different from usual, it may be necessary to perform blood tests, chest X-rays or collect secretions to search for viruses.",
        "Treatment": "Most acute bronchiolitis is mild and does not require specific treatment. Some helpful measures at home include: create a calm environment;/ avoid irritating factors, such as tobacco;/ raise the head of the bed to 30\u00ba;/ use of antipyretics if there is a fever (paracetamol or ibuprofen in babies over six months);/ clear the airways through frequent nasal washing with saline solution and/or suctioning of secretions;/ eat smaller meals at shorter intervals;/ maintain good hydration, giving water between meals;/ The administration of any cough syrup is contraindicated. Respiratory kinesiotherapy is not indicated in acute bronchiolitis because it does not alter the course of the disease and may even worsen it. Bronchodilators, if prescribed, must be administered with a pressurized inhaler associated with an expansion chamber and not with the \u201caerosol device\u201d which is only recommended for use in specific cases and in the hospital. If breathing difficulties worsen, food refusal or other worrying signs appear, it is essential to consult a doctor.",
        "Prevention": "For some children included in the risk group, there are clinical guidelines that recommend prophylaxis with palivizumab, a vaccine to prevent infection by the respiratory syncytial virus. In all cases, to avoid contagion, measures such as the following are recommended: hand washing;/ limit contact with people with respiratory infections, particularly with siblings who attend kindergarten;/ avoid places with large concentrations of people, polluted areas and/or areas with tobacco smoke;/ Portuguese Lung Foundation, 2013 Manual Merck, 2014 Spanish Society of Pediatric Pulmonology, 2006 U.S. National Library of Medicine, agosto de 2013 Patr\u00edcia Ma\u00e7\u00e3o et al., Acute Bronchiolitis, Prospective Study, Acta Med Port 2011; 24(S2): 407-412 Load more;/ RSV infection can progress to bronchiolitis or pneumonia.

    "Bronchitis": {
        "What is it?": "Bronchitis is a process of inflammation of the main airways of the lungs (the bronchi), causing them to narrow, making breathing difficult and causing symptoms such as coughing. This process can be acute or chronic: acute bronchitis occurs for a short period of time; In chronic cases, symptoms occur during most days of the month, over at least three months and in two consecutive years. In bronchitis, there is hypertrophy of the glands that produce mucus along the airways, which explains the productive cough typical of this disease. As the pathology progresses, airflow limitation increases and complications such as pulmonary emphysema may arise. In Portugal, this is a very common condition. According to a study carried out in the country, bronchitis increases in prevalence with age, being around 12.5% \u200b\u200bin men and 10.2% in women aged between 75 and 84 years. In global terms, bronchitis affects around 3.7% of the Portuguese population.",
        "Symptoms": "The main manifestation of bronchitis is cough, which evolves from seasonal to constant, becoming mucopurulent with increasing frequency. Shortness of breath is another important symptom. Chest pain can result from coughing. In acute bronchitis, other symptoms may appear, such as sore throat, runny nose, headache, muscle pain and fatigue. Fever is not common and should make you think of pneumonia or another infection.",
        "Causes": "Bronchitis can be caused by infectious agents, such as viruses or bacteria, by tobacco consumption or by inhalation of dust or polluting agents. Some diseases, such as asthma, can be confused with bronchitis. Sinusitis, pharyngitis, tonsillitis or apneumonia can also cause similar conditions. Respiratory viruses are the most common cause, with tobacco consumption being the main cause of chronic bronchitis. In fact, smoking is responsible for about 85% to 90% of cases of chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Smoking inhibits the movement of respiratory cilia, essential for the elimination of debris and microorganisms, interferes with the function of immune system cells, causes hypertrophy of the glands that produce mucus and contributes to the narrowing of the airways.",
        "Diagnosis": "The description of symptoms and medical examination, including pulmonary auscultation, are the starting point for diagnosis. The most commonly used tests are chest X-rays. In some situations, it may be important to perform laboratory tests on sputum or perform respiratory function tests.",
        "Treatment": "It is important to know that most cases do not require the use of antibiotics to treat acute bronchitis. They will only be important if a bacterial infection is confirmed. The most important measures for your treatment are: drinking plenty of fluids;/ use of inhalers (in the case of asthma);/ rest;/ use aspirin or acetaminophen if there is a fever;/ creation of a humid atmosphere;/ It may be useful to use medications that help dissolve the mucus in sputum, but it is important to only use them under medical advice. It is essential not to smoke, avoid secondhand smoke and pollution and wash your hands frequently to avoid transmitting viruses or other infectious agents.",
        "Prevention": "In addition to the measures already mentioned, it is important to remember the role of influenza and pneumococcal vaccines in preventing bronchitis.\u00a0 The first must be administered between October and December for all people who belong to risk groups; the second must be carried out on chronically ill people and on all people aged 65 or over every five years.

    "Bruxism": {
        "What is it?": "Bruxism is a disorder characterized by involuntary clenching and grinding of the teeth, applying excessive force to the chewing muscles, causing wear to the teeth that can affect their integrity and compromise oral health. Two distinct forms of bruxism can be considered: daytime and nighttime. The first is characterized by a semi-voluntary activity of the jaw, with the clenching of the teeth while the individual is awake and where grinding generally does not occur, being related to a tic, habit or a reaction to stress. The second is an unconscious activity of grinding or clenching teeth, producing sounds, while sleeping. Sleep bruxism creates tension in the temporomaxillary joints, which can wear them out and cause headaches. It also causes wear on teeth that can affect their integrity and compromise oral health. Sleep bruxism is a problem that mainly affects children but can also affect adults. It is estimated that the prevalence of bruxism is 20% in adults, and nocturnal bruxism, according to reports from family members, occurs in around 8% of the population. It is also believed that around 100,000 people in Portugal are affected by this condition.",
        "Symptoms": "The main symptoms are headaches, discomfort in the temporomandibular joint, pain in the muscles of the face and earlobes, stiff shoulders, limited mouth opening movements and sleep disturbances. There is also wear and tear of tooth enamel or even fracture of teeth, inflammation of the gums, excessive tooth mobility and premature tooth loss. Headaches are the most common symptom, occurring three times more in people with bruxism than in others. In children, it is common to be associated with nasal obstruction and respiratory complaints resulting from hypertrophy of the tonsils and adenoids. It is also normal for changes in behavior and attention to occur in this scenario.",
        "Causes": "As for daytime sleepiness, its causes are not known, although stress and anxiety are considered to be risk factors. Some studies show that during nocturnal crises, there is an increase in cardiac, respiratory and muscular activity, which suggests that there is a relationship between sleep mechanisms and bruxism. People with this condition often have other sleep disorders, such as snoring, episodes of apnea (pauses in breathing), talking or hallucinations in the phase between sleeping and waking. Other associated factors are young age, high level of education, tobacco use, and caffeine or alcohol intake. The use of substances to help with sleep, depression and anxiety can alter sleep patterns and increase the risk of bruxism occurring. Stress and anxiety appear to be related to around 70% of cases of bruxism.",
        "Diagnosis": "During a dental appointment, several signs of bruxism may be visible, such as uneven tooth wear, cracks or fractures, and tooth or facial muscle sensitivity. A sleep study could help confirm the diagnosis.",
        "Treatment": "The consequences of nocturnal bruxism can be controlled by using a relaxation splint placed in the mouth that protects the teeth and reduces muscle activity. Correct articulation of the upper and lower teeth reduces friction between them and improves the quality of chewing. Therefore, monitoring by the dentist is always important. Sometimes there are behavioral therapeutic proposals, such as psychoanalysis, hypnosis and relaxation techniques. However, these still lack sufficient scientific validation.",
        "Prevention": "Preventing most episodes of bruxism involves reducing the child's anxiety levels, which can be achieved by trying to relax before bed, for example, by taking a warm bath, listening to calm music, or reading a book. In cases where anxiety cannot be reduced, it may be necessary to consult a dentist or pediatrician in order to carry out a more detailed assessment. Bruxism in childhood is usually outgrown by adolescence. Most children stop grinding and clenching their teeth when their baby teeth are replaced by permanent teeth. However, some continue to do so during adolescence, and if the cause is stress, the grinding will continue until the tension is relieved. In this condition, bruxism can be prevented by trying to talk to children or adolescents to understand their fears and anxieties, and helping them to deal with their problems.

    "Bulimia": {
        "What is it?": "Bulimia nervosa is a potentially serious eating disorder characterized by the secretive ingestion of large quantities of food, followed by induction of vomiting. In other cases, an attempt is made to compensate for excessive calorie intake with excessively intensive levels of exercise or by using diuretics and laxatives. The urge to expel food can become so intense that it is induced even after a light meal. After episodes of binge eating, patients tend to feel guilty and anxious for not having been able to control their impulsiveness. The sensation of hunger, as it is felt in an aversive way, leads to these compulsive behaviors being experienced with extreme shame, which may lead to their concealment. Bulimia nervosa can be of the purging type, when the patient regularly induces vomiting or uses laxatives, diuretics or enemas, or of the non-purging type, when the patient uses other compensatory behaviors such as fasting or excessive physical exercise. These patients are extremely rigid about their body image and weight management. It is quite common for these patients to have recurring thoughts about food and to have an extremely rigid ideal of thinness. It is estimated that bulimia nervosa affects around 13 out of every 100,000 people annually.\u00a0Its incidence in women aged 15 to 24 \u2013 the highest risk group \u2013 has\u00a0increased over the last 50 years. Some studies suggest that in endangered populations (generally female students) the frequency is around 10%. If we consider teenagers or young women in general, this value is lower and is around 1% to 3%. Bulimia, similar to anorexia nervosa, is related to the perception of body image.",
        "Symptoms": "Bulimia manifests itself through excessive concern about the body and weight, a constant fear of gaining weight, feeling unable to control eating behavior, eating until discomfort or pain occurs, inducing vomiting after eating or exercising excessively, inappropriate use of laxatives, diuretics and enemas or use of dietary supplements to lose weight. When bulimia is not properly controlled, complications can arise, such as dehydration, kidney failure, heart problems, menstrual irregularities, tooth and gum deterioration, digestive problems, anxiety, depression and alcohol and/or drug abuse.",
        "Causes": "Its exact cause is unknown. Multiple biological, emotional and social factors probably contribute to this condition. The main signs of risk are: Gender: female;/ Age: adolescence and young adults;/ Heredity: greater risk when there are first-degree relatives with eating disorders;/ Psychological and emotional aspects: reduced self-esteem, perfectionism, impulsive behavior, depression, anxiety or presence of an obsessive-compulsive disorder;/ Social Pressure: exerted by close people and the media, especially on young women. People with professions in contact with the public are at greater risk of developing disorders such as bulimia;/ Pressure resulting from sports practice: coaches and family members can, unintentionally, contribute to this situation by encouraging the athlete to lose weight and restrict their diet in favor of better sports performance;/",
        "Diagnosis": "Early diagnosis is important but not always possible. Many patients are of normal weight, which makes it difficult to identify the problem. Generally, to identify bulimia, a medical examination, blood and urine tests, a psychological evaluation and other tests are necessary to rule out similar pathologies. It is considered to be bulimia when the following elements are present at least twice a week for at least three months: repeated episodes of eating large amounts of food with a feeling of inability to control this urge;/ elimination of excess calories through vomiting;/ too much physical exercise;/ fasting or use of diuretics or laxatives;/ excessive influence of weight and body shape on self-esteem;/ exclusion of the diagnosis of anorexia;/",
        "Treatment": "Generally speaking, treatment requires a combination of medication and psychotherapy. In addition to these clinical elements, family support is a fundamental aspect in overcoming this disorder. At the pharmacological level, the most used medications are antidepressants, especially fluoxetine. Proper nutritional monitoring is important to ensure good eating habits, to achieve a healthy weight and to correct imbalances resulting from bulimia. Hospitalization may rarely be necessary. Although symptoms often improve, recovery is sometimes not complete and periods of excessive food intake and subsequent elimination may occur, triggered by everyday events or stress. In these patients, periodic medical or psychological monitoring may be recommended. Through psychological intervention in bulimia nervosa, the patient will be able to develop a regular and flexible eating plan that includes previously avoided foods. Over the course of the intervention, the aim is for the patient to be able to deal with risk situations for compulsive food intake and vomiting. In order for the patient to learn to reduce concerns about their body and weight, attempts will be made to modify maladaptive thoughts, attitudes and emotions related to eating behavior. After the patient improves, the intervention will have as its central objective the prevention of possible factors that could generate a relapse.",
        "Prevention": "Prevention involves maintaining healthy lifestyle habits and identifying any signs of this condition early. In younger people, regular pediatric evaluation allows for early identification of eating disorders. Creating an adequate perception of body image by children, through parents, also plays a very important role in preventing bulimia.

    "Macular hole": {
        "What is it?": "The retina is a tissue located inside and the macula is located in the center of the retina and is responsible for vision in greater detail and allows us to see with great definition. A macular hole (MB) is a small hole in the retina and causes blurred or distorted vision. MBs usually occur as an age-related process and begin after the age of 60.  Is the other eye at risk? If you have a BM in one eye, there is a 10 to 15% risk of developing a BM in the other eye.",
        "Symptoms": "In the initial phase, symptoms include slightly distorted or blurred vision.",
        "Causes": "Most of the inside of the eye is filled with a gel called vitreous, which maintains the structure of the eyeball. With age, the gel goes through a degenerative process with changes in its structure and consistency and ends up detaching from the surface of the retina. When the vitreous is firmly attached to the retina, and this detachment occurs, it can cause tears and lead to the development of BM. Other causes of BM are: retinal detachments, epiretinal membranes, diabetic retinopathy or eye trauma.",
        "Treatment": "In most cases, surgery is necessary and the procedure is called vitrectomy. The surgeon will remove the vitreous from the eye and replace it with gas to allow the retina to heal. This gas will disappear within a few weeks. Until then, you will need to remain in a specific position (prone position). This positioning is extremely important for the success of the surgery. Anesthesia may be local plus sedation or general. Surgery is usually performed on an outpatient basis.  What are the benefits of surgery? The most common benefit is improved vision, although this varies from person to person and with the duration of BM. Recovery can take up to several months. Myopia, astigmatism and hyperopia often lead to the use of glasses or contact lenses. LASIK surgery can restore good vision. It's important to have sunglasses on hand all year round.

    "Bursitis": {
        "What is it?": "Bursitis is an inflammation of a bursa (or sac), a type of cushion that sits between the bone and the skin, cushioning impacts on the elbow. This sac contains a fluid that reduces friction and facilitates the movement of the skin over the underlying bone. The olecranon bursa is located between the skin and a bony projection of the ulna bone, at the back of the elbow, called the olecranon. Normally, this bursa is flat. If it is irritated or inflamed, more fluid accumulates inside it and bursitis occurs.",
        "Symptoms": "As the olecranon bursa is the largest in the elbow, its injury is associated with a significant impairment of the function of this joint. When bursitis is caused by trauma, the elbow swells quickly. When this process is slower, it corresponds to a repeated injury, in which pressure is created by using the elbow to support the body's weight. The elbow may be painful, tender to the touch, or unable to move normally. If the skin is red and warm, it may be a sign of an infection. If the infection is left untreated, it can spread through the bloodstream to other parts of the body. Pus may also drain spontaneously from an infected pocket. Prolonged pain and swelling limit movement, causing motor weakness and muscle atrophy. Attacks of chronic bursitis can last from a few days to several weeks, and relapses often occur. Often the first symptom is swelling, but because the skin in this area of \u200b\u200bthe elbow is very loose, a small build-up of fluid and swelling may not be noticed immediately.",
        "Causes": "In the presence of trauma or prolonged support on the bursa, it can become inflamed, a fact that is quite common in professions that involve repeated support of the body on the elbow, such as painters or truck drivers resting the elbow against the window. Although there are other small bursae in the elbow area, the olecranon bursa is the most prominent and is therefore the most affected in sports. Its location, right at the tip of the elbow, also makes it more vulnerable. In the context of sport, this bursitis is most often caused by acute trauma, such as a fall. Although bursitis can result from chronic overuse of a joint or trauma, there are other causes, such as a wound, gout, pseudogout, rheumatoid arthritis or infections. In fact, an infection at the end of the elbow, such as an insect bite or a wound, allows bacteria to enter and reach the bursa, infecting it. Often the cause is not identified.",
        "Diagnosis": "A medical examination is important. The presence of an area at the tip of the elbow that is painful to the touch and the occurrence of pain with some specific movements of the joint are highly suggestive signs of the presence of elbow bursitis. If the bursa is very swollen, the doctor may use a needle and syringe to extract a sample of fluid from the bursa to perform tests to help determine the cause of the inflammation (such as an infection or gout). X-rays are not usually helpful unless calcium deposits are present. Therefore, this type of examination will be important to rule out other associated problems.",
        "Treatment": "When the swelling develops gradually, is not very large and no trauma has occurred, some measures can be used, such as stopping activities that put pressure on the elbow, using ice for 15 to 20 minutes, three or four times a day and elevating the elbow above the level of the heart. If symptoms persist, the elbow is red, the pain increases or trauma has occurred, it is important to see a doctor to rule out an associated fracture. Anti-inflammatories are equally useful and, in some cases, corticosteroid infiltration or aspiration of their contents may be used. The surgery involves removing the bursa and involves a short period of immobilization to protect the skin. Some time in physiotherapy may be recommended to improve elbow mobility. As a rule, the skin heals in 10 to 14 days and, after 3 to 4 weeks, it can be used without restrictions although it must be protected for a few months to prevent relapses or new lesions. In cases of acute bursitis, taking an oral corticosteroid, such as prednisone, for a few days helps to relieve the pain. When the pain subsides, specific exercises are useful to increase the degree of joint movement. Treatment for chronic bursitis is similar, although rest or immobilization is less likely to be effective. Bursitis that limits joint function can be relieved by several corticosteroid injections along with intensive physical therapy to restore joint function. Exercises help strengthen weakened muscles and restore full range of joint movement. Bursitis often recurs if the underlying cause, such as gout, rheumatoid arthritis, or chronic overuse of the joint, is not corrected. In the presence of infection, antibiotics are essential, either orally or injected directly into the bursa.",

    "Kidney stones": {
        "What is it?": "Kidney stones, usually called urinary lithiasis or urolithiasis, correspond to a disease in which stones are formed in the urinary tract. They are solid structures that result from the agglomeration of crystals that form due to a metabolic change in the organism. This change determines an increase in the urinary excretion of substances that favor the formation of stones, such as calcium, uric acid, oxalate and phosphate and/or a decrease in the elimination of substances that inhibit this formation (citrate and magnesium, among others). The chemical composition of the crystals determines the type of stone: calcium oxalate (60%), calcium oxalate associated with calcium phosphate (20%), uric acid (8%), struvite (8%), calcium phosphate (2%) and cystine and other components (2%). Approximately one person in every 100 develops urinary stones in their lifetime. Around 80% of these expel the stone spontaneously, along with urine. Its elimination can be very painful but, in general, it does not cause permanent damage. The remaining 20% \u200b\u200bwill need some type of treatment.",
        "Symptoms": "The presence of stones in the urinary tract may have no signs or trigger very intense symptoms, namely renal colic and serious clinical complications, which can end in chronic renal failure. When a kidney stone moves from the kidney and passes into the ureter, intense pain occurs in the lower back on the same side, below the insertion of the ribs. This pain tends to spread to the lower abdomen and groin and comes in waves that vary in intensity. There is also pain when urinating, and the urine may turn pink, red or brown, as a result of the trauma caused by the stone on the ureter wall. It is often associated with nausea and vomiting and a persistent urge to urinate. Fever and chills may also occur. As a rule, as the stone moves, the pain varies in location and intensity.",
        "Causes": "The most frequent metabolic changes that can create conditions for stone formation are increased urinary excretion of calcium, uric acid and oxalate, as well as decreased elimination of citrate and, less frequently, magnesium. Recurrent urinary infections cause a specific type of stones. In this case, treatment and prevention may include prolonged use of antibiotics to keep the urine bacteria-free. The risk is greater when there is a family history of this condition, at ages over 40, in males, in people who drink little liquid and/or who live in hot climates and with diets very rich in proteins, sodium and sugar. Obesity is another factor to be considered, as well as some digestive diseases or surgeries. Renal tubular acidosis, cystinuria, hyperparathyroidism and the use of certain medications are elements that can promote the formation of kidney stones.",
        "Diagnosis": "After the first diagnosis of urolithiasis, it is important to consult a urologist who will carry out the entire diagnostic process and try to determine the type of stone and the associated metabolic change. The examination involves clinical observation, supplemented by blood and urine tests. The chemical composition of the stone can only be determined by biochemical observation of the stone. Therefore, if it is removed, it should be sent for analysis. If it is not, the patient should be instructed on techniques for its recovery, such as urinating into a paper filter. Once recovered, the stone should be stored in a dry jar. Imaging studies are important. Depending on the case, X-rays, ultrasound or computed tomography may be used to determine their location.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment for urinary lithiasis involves several phases. In the initial stage, during renal colic, pain relief is essential. Here, analgesics and anti-inflammatories are very important. In a second stage, if necessary, the stones must be removed or fragmented. Fragmentation can be performed using ultrasound. Removal is performed through the urethra or by making a small incision in the dorsal region. The final phase involves preventing the formation of new stones. This involves diet and, whenever necessary, the use of appropriate medication. As the formation of urinary stones results from a chronic metabolic change, when there is the presence of a first stone, the patient will always be susceptible to the formation of more. It is estimated that about 50% of untreated patients will develop a new stone within five to 10 years. It is also important to consider in the treatment of urinary lithiasis, addressing the metabolic changes responsible for its formation.",
        "Prevention": "Prevention involves general measures, such as increasing fluid intake and changes in diet. It is important that patients drink around two liters of fluids per day (three liters on hotter days) in order to make the urine less concentrated and prevent the formation of new stones. This preventive measure is very important as, in the absence of any other treatment, it can reduce the formation of lithiasis in around 60% of cases. It is recommended to drink water, orange, lemon or apple juice. Black tea, coffee and cola drinks should be avoided. Dietary changes can be made by a urologist and can be, if necessary, complemented by a nutritionist. In general, the intake of milk and dairy products is permitted, generally twice a day. Preference should be given to lean meats in moderate amounts to reduce protein intake. It is also important to reduce the amount of salt and avoid salty foods. Likewise, fat and sugar intake should be limited. For each patient, other specific dietary measures can be adopted. In fact, depending on the composition of the stones, it is important to select the most appropriate diet. These preventive measures make it possible to reduce, in more than 80% of cases, the growth of existing stones and the formation of new ones. J.

    "Bladder cancer": {
        "What is it?": "Bladder cancer usually originates in the cells lining the bladder, that is, the urothelium. Approximately 75% of patients with bladder cancer present at diagnosis with disease confined to the mucosa and submucosa (non-musculoinvasive tumors). This type of cancer has a high prevalence due to the long-term survival rate compared to muscle-invasive tumors.",
        "Prevention": "There are no prevention strategies for bladder cancer.",
        "Risk Factors": "Smoking habits;/ Smoking is the most common risk factor for bladder cancer, causing 50-65% of male cases and 20-30% of female cases. The incidence of bladder cancer is directly related to the duration of smoking and the number of cigarettes smoked per day. An immediate reduction in the risk of bladder cancer was observed in those who stopped smoking. The reduction was approximately 40% within 1-4 years and 60% after 25 years of stopping smoking.  Occupational exposure to chemicals;/ Occupational exposure is the second most important risk factor for bladder cancer. It has been reported to account for 20\u201325% of all bladder cancer cases in several work-related studies. Chemical exposures include benzene derivatives and amines, and are most likely to occur in workers in the dye, rubber, textile, leather, paint, and other chemical industries. The risk of bladder cancer due to occupational exposure to carcinogenic aromatic amines is significantly increased after 10 or more years of exposure. The average latency period usually exceeds 30 years.  Radiotherapy;/ Increased rates of secondary malignancy in the bladder have been reported after external beam radiotherapy for gynecologic cancers. In a population-based cohort study, the standardized incidence ratios for bladder cancer after various prostate cancer treatments such as radical prostatectomy, radiotherapy, brachytherapy, and radiotherapy-brachytherapy were 0.99, 1.42, 1.10, and 1.39, respectively, compared with the general population in the United States. Therefore, all patients who have received any radiotherapy treatment require long-term follow-up, given the high risk of developing bladder cancer.  Diet;/ Several dietary factors have been studied to see if they are related to bladder cancer. A large prospective multicentre European Study on Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) found no association between diet, lifestyle, or environmental factors and cancer. That is, no association was found between bladder cancer and fluid intake, red meat, or fruit and vegetable consumption.  Bladder schistosomiasis or bilharziasis and chronic urinary tract infection;/ Bladder schistosomiasis (bilharziasis) is the second most common parasitic infection after malaria, with approximately 600 million people exposed in Africa, Asia, South America and the Caribbean. There is a well-established link between bladder carcinoma and infection by this parasite, which can develop into squamous cell carcinoma. Improved control of the disease is reducing the incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder in endemic areas such as Egypt. Likewise, invasive squamous cell carcinoma has been associated with the presence of a chronic urinary tract infection distinct from schistosomiasis. A direct association between bladder cancer and urinary tract infections has been observed in several case-control studies.  Sex;/ Although men are more likely to develop bladder cancer than women, women present with more advanced disease and have worse survival rates. A meta-analysis of a total population of almost 28,000 patients showed that female gender was associated with a worse survival outcome than male gender after surgical treatment. A population-based study indicated that women experienced more delays in diagnosis than men, as there were more differential diagnoses that included diseases that are more prevalent than bladder cancer. Differences in the prevalence of bladder cancer between men and women may be due to factors other than tobacco and chemical exposure. In a prospective cohort study, postmenopausal status was associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer, even after adjustment for smoking status. This result suggests that differences in estrogen and androgen levels between men and women may be responsible for some difference in bladder cancer prevalence.  Genetic factors;/ There is growing evidence that genetic susceptibility factors and familial associations may influence the incidence of bladder cancer. In one study, a family history of cancer in first-degree relatives was found to be associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer, and the association was stronger in younger patients. Recent studies have found genetic susceptibility at a number of independent loci that have been associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer.",
        "Symptoms": "Bladder cancer symptoms are not exclusive, they can appear in other diseases, namely infections. Just because you have one or more of the symptoms described here does not mean you have bladder cancer. Bladder cancer symptoms are not exclusive and can appear in other diseases, including infections. The existence of one or more of the symptoms described here does not mean that there is bladder cancer. Symptoms to look out for are: -Blood in the urine (hematuria) \u2013 urinating blood is the most frequent sign in the presentation of bladder cancer. Hematuria is usually asymptomatic. -Frequent urge to urinate, often with urinary urgency.",
        "Who should I contact?": "If you suspect cancer, due to symptoms or a complementary diagnostic test that presents an alteration, you should consult a Urologist, or alternatively, less commonly, an Oncologist. Meet our team of experts The different subtypes have different prognoses and treatments. \u2022Urothelial carcinoma \u2013 is the most common subtype, accounting for more than 90% of all cases. \u2022Urothelial carcinoma with partial squamous and/or glandular differentiation \u2013 partial squamous or glandular differentiation worsens the prognosis. \u2022Micropapillary or microcystic urothelial carcinoma \u2013 aggressive variant with a worse prognosis. \u2022\u201cnested variant\u201d (including large nested variety); lymphoepithelioma, plasmacytoma, giant cell, undifferentiated. \u2022Transitional cell carcinoma with trophoblastic differentiation. \u2022Small cell carcinoma (very rare) \u2013 very aggressive tumor. \u2022Sarcomatoid carcinoma \u2013 very aggressive variant with a serious prognosis.",
        "Diagnosis and Staging": "In a patient with a clinical history and physical examination suspicious of bladder cancer, general tests, as well as a urinary cytology, should be requested. Acytologyhas a high specificity. Urinary markers for diagnosis are not recommended. Performing a bladder ultrasound is often enough to diagnose bladder cancer. However, the best, most sensitive and specific means of diagnosing bladder cancer is cystoscopy. If imaging studies clearly demonstrate a bladder tumor, diagnostic cystoscopy may be omitted. Cystoscopy is a procedure performed on an outpatient basis by a urologist, in that a cystoscope (an endoscope) is passed through the urethra into the bladder. This device allows you to observe the mucosa and, in most cases, diagnose bladder cancer. Any suspicious image of bladder cancer, taken through vesicaloucystoscopy ultrasound, subsequently involves resection through the urethra, in the surgical center under anesthesia, of the suspicious lesions and sending them for anatomopathological study. This study allows confirmation of the diagnosis of bladder cancer, checking the histological subtype, checking its aggressiveness (papillomas, low and high grade tumors \u2013 WHO 2004) and checking if it is superficial, that is, it does not invade the muscular layer of the bladder, or if it is muscle-invasive. Staging is the process by which we make sure whether bladder cancer is superficial, that is, it does not invade the muscular layer of the bladder, whether it is muscle invasive or whether it locally invades neighboring organs or even has distant metastases. For correct staging, information on the anatomopathological results of transurethral resection of the bladder tumor is required, complemented by pelvic and abdominal imaging exams. The information obtained through the staging process determines the stage of the disease and the prognosis. In addition, staging determines the treatment. Thus, bladder cancers are divided into non-muscle-invasive, that is, they do not invade the bladder muscle itself and therefore do not require bladder removal in most cases, and muscle-invasive, which in most cases requires surgical removal of the bladder (radical cystectomy) supplemented with chemotherapy.  Tests required in most situations for staging bladder cancer: Pelvic, abdominal and thoracic CT scan \u2013 allows you to visualize the presence of cancer in the bladder, lymph nodes or other locations in the pelvis, abdomen or chest. Pelvic and abdominal magnetic resonance imaging \u2013 magnetic resonance imaging can be an alternative to CT in staging.  Based on the urethral resection of the bladder tumor and pathological analysis and staging diagnostic examinations performed, the staging of bladder cancer can be classified as follows: Primary tumor;/ TX Primary tumor not evaluable T0 No evidence of primary tumor Ta Non-invasive papillary carcinoma Tis Carcinoma (\u201ctumor plano\u201d) T1 Tumor that invades the subepithelial connective tissue T2 Tumor invading muscle T2a Tumor invading the superficial muscle layer (inner half) T2b Tumor invading the deep muscle layer (outer half) T3 Tumor invading perivesical tissue T3a Microscopicamente T3b Macroscopically (extravesical mass) T4 Tumor that invades any of the following structures: prostate, uterus, vagina, pelvic wall, abdominal wall T4a Tumor invading the prostate, uterus, or vagina T4b Tumor invading the pelvic wall or abdominal wall Lymph nodes;/ NX Regional lymph nodes not assessable N0 No metastases in regional lymph nodes N1 Metastases in a single lymph node less than or equal to 2 cm in maximum diameter N2 Metastases in a single lymph node greater than 2 cm but less than 5 cm in maximum diameter or in multiple lymph nodes, none larger than 5 cm in dimension N3 Lymph node metastases greater than 5 cm in maximum diameter Metastases;/ MX Distant metastases not assessable M0 No distant metastases M1 Distant metastases",
        "Treatment": "Optimal treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer requires the involvement of a highly specialized multidisciplinary team and an integrated model to avoid fragmentation of patient care. Bladder cancer treatment can be divided into two main groups depending on whether or not it invades the bladder muscle (detrusor). In non-muscle invasive bladder cancers, i.e. superficial (stage Ta, T1), complete transurethral resection of the tumor may be sufficient treatment, sometimes complemented with intravesical application of chemotherapy or immunotherapy.;/  In the case of muscle-invasive bladder tumors, i.e. those invading the muscular layer of the bladder (stage T2 or higher), high-grade superficial T1 tumors associated with carcinoma in situ, multiple and/or recurrent and/or large high-grade T1 tumors, aggressive histological subtypes and tumors with lymphatic and vascular invasion, radical cystectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy (surgical removal of the bladder and pelvic lymph nodes) is indicated. Nowadays, in most situations where cystectomy is indicated, patients may benefit from chemotherapy before surgery, i.e. neoadjuvant chemotherapy.;/  Radiotherapy in general is not a first-line treatment for bladder cancer. However, it may be indicated in palliative situations or in attempts to preserve the bladder in selected cases. All treatments for muscle-invasive bladder cancer such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy should be carried out by doctors with specialized training in this area. Robot-assisted radical cystoprostatectomy;/ Video-assisted radical cystoprostatectomy;/ Robot-assisted radical cystectomy;/ Video-assisted radical cystectomy;/ Chemotherapy;/ Immunotherapy, namely with immunological checkpoint inhibitors;/ Robotic radiosurgery - Cyberknife;/ External radiotherapy;/ Surgery for bladder cancer can be of several types: Transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TUR-V) - In this type of surgery, under general or epidural anesthesia, a resectoscope is inserted into the bladder through the urethra and through it endoscopic resection of the bladder tumor is performed.;/  Radical cystectomy - This surgery consists of removing the bladder, pelvic lymph nodes, part of the urethra and neighboring organs that contain cancer, namely the prostate in the case of men and the uterus in the case of women. This surgery involves the creation of a new bladder made from the small intestine (ileum) that allows urination through the urethra or the creation of a cutaneous urinary diversion (urostomy) requiring the placement of a urine collection bag on the abdominal wall. In this case, it will be necessary to be accompanied by a nurse specialized in ostomy, who will teach you how to apply the collection bags and care for the urostomy. This surgery is a major surgery. If you have been offered a radical cystectomy you should discuss with your urologist the implications of having it performed.;/ Medical treatment used for bladder cancer: Intravesical chemotherapy - This modality consists of administering chemotherapy directly into the bladder, acting on lesions in the mucous layer that lines the inside of the bladder. Intravesical immunotherapy \u2013 if the bladder cancer is superficial, the doctor may opt for immunotherapy immediately after performing TUR-V, in order to prevent cancer recurrence; In this type of treatment, BCG (tuberculosis vaccine) is introduced with live, weakened bacteria into the bladder through a catheter, which stimulates the immune system to eradicate residual cancer cells. The patient keeps the BCG in the bladder for two hours, then eliminates it. This treatment is generally performed once a week for a minimum of 6 weeks; Systemic chemotherapy - This is the most common way of administering chemotherapy, through a peripheral vein, in a day hospital run by a medical oncologist. Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors \u2013 it has recently been demonstrated that this type of immunotherapy may be more effective than systemic chemotherapy in the case of advanced bladder cancer. Clinical trials \u2013 Participation in clinical trials is often an opportunity and a hope for treatment at certain stages of bladder cancer.  Patients who have had bladder cancer must be monitored by a urologist. They must be observed regularly in consultation to perform cystoscopies and/or other complementary tests such as Tomography or Magnetic Resonance Imaging.

    "Laryngeal cancer": {
        "What is it?": "The cells of the laryngeal epithelium are responsible for the formation of the tissue that lines the larynx. In their normal state, these cells grow and divide into new cells, formed as they are needed, and this process is called cell regeneration.  When cells lose their control mechanism and undergo changes in their genome (DNA), they become cancer cells, which do not die when they age or are damaged, and produce new cells that are not needed in an uncontrolled manner, resulting in the formation of cancer.  Laryngeal cancers form in response to continuous aggression to the epithelium. Laryngeal cancer is part of a group of cancers that we group under the general name of head and neck cancer.",
        "Prevention": "Preventing laryngeal cancer fundamentally involves adopting healthy habits, namely not smoking and avoiding alcohol consumption.  It also involves being alert to the symptoms of the disease and should consult your doctor if they appear.  If you are a habitual smoker or drink alcohol excessively, you should consult your doctor regularly to make an early diagnosis of laryngeal cancer or another type of head and neck cancer.",
        "Risk factors": "Any behavior or condition that increases your risk of developing a disease is a risk factor. Just because one or more risk factors apply to you, it does not necessarily mean that you will develop laryngeal cancer. Likewise, laryngeal cancer can occur in individuals who have no known risk factors. The causes of laryngeal cancer have not yet been determined, but some risk factors are known. The main risk factors are:  Tobacco \u2013 smoking is the cause of most laryngeal cancers; heavy smokers who have smoked for several years are at higher risk;  Alcohol \u2013 excessive alcohol consumption increases the risk of laryngeal cancer; this factor combined with tobacco increases the risk of developing laryngeal cancer.",
        "Symptoms": "The symptoms of laryngeal cancer are not exclusive and can occur in other diseases. The fact that you have one or more of the symptoms described here does not mean that you have laryngeal cancer.  You should be alert and consult your doctor if you have the following symptoms: Inflammation in the throat that does not go away despite treatment;;/ Mass in the neck or throat;;/ Hoarseness or voice change that does not go away;;/ Difficulty or pain when swallowing;;/ Difficulty breathing;;/ Persistent cough that does not go away despite treatment;;/ Ear pain that won't go away.;/",

As long as we have strength we must move forward.\"",
        "Diagnosis and Staging": "In a patient suspected of having laryngeal cancer, tests may be requested to diagnose the disease.  The first step will be to have an otorhinolaryngology consultation, during which a laryngoscopy will be performed \u2013 an examination that involves inserting an endoscope into the throat to view the larynx. The doctor may perform a biopsy on suspicious areas of the larynx, collecting samples of the suspicious tissue. Imaging tests should also be requested, the most common being CT scan and general blood tests. Only observation under a microscope by Pathological Anatomy of the material collected in a biopsy of the suspicious laryngeal mass can confirm the diagnosis of laryngeal cancer. Staging is the process by which we determine whether cancer cells have spread from the larynx to other nearby or more distant structures. The information obtained through the staging process determines the stage of the disease, which is essential for planning treatment.  When the diagnosis of laryngeal cancer is confirmed, the next step is to stage the disease through the following diagnostic tests: Cervical and thoracic CT scan;;/ Chest X-ray;;/ Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.;/  Based on the diagnostic tests performed, the staging of laryngeal cancer can be classified as follows: Stage 0 \u2013 also called carcinoma in situ, at this stage the cancer is only found in the innermost layer of the laryngeal epithelium;  Stage I \u2013 at this stage the cancer presents as follows: Supraglottic \u2013 Cancer located on one of the walls of the supraglottis;;/ Glottic \u2013 presence of cancer in one of the vocal cords. The other vocal cord moves normally;;/ Subglottic- Cancer located in the subglottis.;/  Stage II - at this stage the cancer presents as follows: Supraglottic- Cancer located in the various walls of the supraglottis and surrounding tissues;;/ Glottic\u2013 the cancer has spread to the supraglottic or subglottic floor. The vocal cords do not move normally;;/ Subglottic \u2013 the cancer has spread to one of the vocal cords.;/  Stage III \u2013 the cancer invades lymph nodes on the side of the tumor but the nodes are smaller than 3 cm;  Stage IV- In this stage the cancer has spread to distant organs.",
        "Treatment": "Taking into account the staging of laryngeal cancer, the multidisciplinary clinical team will assess the best treatment to follow.  Options may include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, either alone or in combination.  Stage 0 \u2013 the treatment option involves surgery to remove the lesion, preserving the larynx;  Stage I \u2013 at this stage and depending on the type of cancer, treatment options may be: -Non-glottic cancer: surgery to partially remove the larynx - supraglottic, partial or hemilaryngectomy - or total laryngectomy and radiotherapy; -Glottic cancer: the same options presented for non-glottic cancer, and/or even performing a cordectomy, that is, removing the vocal cords;  Stage II \u2013 in this stage the treatment option is surgery, with or without radiotherapy or exclusively radiotherapy;  Stage III \u2013 options include surgery with or without radiotherapy, or radiotherapy alone, or chemotherapy concurrent with radiotherapy (with or without surgery);  Stage IV - Surgery may be performed to control the local disease, but the most common is the use of non-surgical modalities such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, in combination or in sequence.  Carrying out a total laryngectomy causes consequences for the patient, such as stopping speaking and having a permanent tracheostomy, that is, breathing must be done through an artificial hole in the throat, made by the surgeon.  Fortunately, over the years, safe forms of conservative treatment have been developed, that is, those that do not require a laryngectomy to treat laryngeal cancer.  Patients who have had laryngeal cancer may be monitored by an oncologist or otorhinolaryngologist if they have undergone surgery. Patients must be observed in the Otorhinolaryngology consultation where observation of the larynx must be carried out and the tests to be requested are imaging tests and blood tests, depending on the clinician's decision.

    "Cancer yes mom": {
        "What is it?": "Breast cancer originates in the mammary gland. When normal breast cells age or become damaged, they die naturally. When cells lose this control mechanism and undergo changes in their genome (DNA), they become cancer cells, which do not die when they age or are damaged, and produce new cells that are not needed in an uncontrolled manner, resulting in the formation of cancer. Unlike normal cells, breast cancer cells do not respect the boundaries of the organ, invading surrounding tissues and potentially spreading to other parts of the body. For example, cancer cells can invade nearby lymph nodes, such as those located under the armpit, the nodes at the base of the neck, and the nodes in the chest wall. They can later reach distant organs such as bones, liver, lungs and brain. This process is called metastasis.",
        "Prevention": "Early diagnosis of breast cancer, before any signs or symptoms appear, is essential as it increases the likelihood of treatment being more effective and, consequently, enabling a better prognosis of the disease. In addition to reducing mortality, early diagnosis can, in some cases, avoid mutilating surgeries such as radical mastectomy and the use of chemotherapy. You should talk to your doctor about your personal risk of having breast cancer, determining the age at which you should start screening tests for the disease and how often they should be done.  For early detection of breast cancer, it is generally recommended that: After a certain age, which should be between 40 and 50 years old, women should have a mammogram annually or every two years. There is no consensus regarding the recommended age for onset or frequency, this milestone must be decided on a case-by-case basis with your doctor.  Mammography allows you to visualize nodules in the breast, before they can be felt or palpated by the woman, as well as possible microcalcifications. Based on the results of the mammogram, the doctor may ask for it to be repeated and, if necessary, request a breast biopsy.  In addition to mammography, early detection measures for the disease also include breast self-examination and clinical breast examination performed by your doctor.  Breast self-examination should be done once a month, with the best time being the week following your menstrual period. Women should bear in mind that breasts are not the same and that changes may occur due to various factors, such as age, taking contraceptive pills, menstrual cycles, pregnancy or menopause.  If a woman detects anything unusual during her self-examination, she should always contact her doctor as soon as possible.  Learn how to do a breast self-exam.  Regarding the clinical breast examination, the doctor palpates the breasts to look for changes and/or nodules or other signs of the disease, in different positions: standing, sitting and lying down. The doctor may ask the woman to raise her arms above her head, leave them hanging or press her hands against her thighs.  It should be noted that breast ultrasound is not a recommended method for early diagnosis of the breast.",
        "Symptoms": "The symptoms of breast cancer are not exclusive to this disease, they can appear in other diseases, such as benign cysts. Just because you have one or more of the symptoms described here does not mean you have breast cancer.  You should be alert and consult your doctor if you have the following symptoms: lump or thickening of the breast or armpit area, detectable by touch;/ changes in breast size or shape;/ I miss my mother;/ changes in the breast or nipple, visible or to the touch;/ nipple sensitivity;/ discharge or loss of fluid from the nipple;/ nipple retraction;/ cracked or flaky skin of the breast, nipple or areola, redness or swelling;/",
        "Risk factors": "Any behavior or condition that increases your risk of having a disease is a risk factor. If one or more risk factors apply to you, it does not mean you will necessarily develop breast cancer. Likewise, breast cancer can appear in individuals who have no known risk factors. The causes of breast cancer have not yet been found, but some risk factors are known. The main risk factors are as follows:  Age It continues to be the greatest risk factor for breast cancer: a 60-year-old woman has an eight times greater risk of developing it in the following 5 years than a 30-year-old woman; 25% of neoplasms occur in women under 50.  Family background There is evidence of familial aggregation of breast cancer in approximately 10% of cases. In half of these, that is, 5%, there are changes in inherited genes that can be characterized in a DNA analysis, if this is decided after a medical genetics consultation. In most cases, they are mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. However, in other cases, familial aggregation is observed but no inherited mutations in susceptibility genes are found. Genetic transmission is suspected in families with more than three young women with breast cancer\u00a0or in situations where there is a family history of ovarian cancer. The family risk is greater as the number of family members affected. These genetic mutations are generally absent in sporadic breast cancer.  Hormonal factors Some hormonal factors are described as risk factors for breast cancer, such as: early menarche - first menstruation at an early age;/ late age at first full-term pregnancy;/ late menopause;/ not having had children;/ use of contraceptives - slightly increases the risk, but not all studies are consensual;/ use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) - widespread and prolonged use (more than 2 years) of HRT in postmenopausal women increases the risk of breast cancer;/  Proliferative breast diseases Diseases that affect the epithelium of the mammary gland, suspected on imaging but only proven in the case of biopsy.  Food and weight High fat consumption, especially in childhood and adolescence, and excess weight also contributes to an increased risk.  Exposure to ionizing radiation For example resulting from radiotherapy, particularly if it occurs at a young age.",
        "Who should I contact?": "If you suspect breast cancer, due to symptoms or a complementary diagnostic test that shows a change, you should go to a Gynecologist, a General Surgeon specialized in Senology or, alternatively, less commonly, an Oncologist. Thinking about your comfort and convenience, the CUF network has formed teams specialized in treating breast pathologies, especially breast cancer. Get to know the CUF Breast Units. Make your contact request so we can follow up from the first moment. If you prefer, you can schedule an appointment through our free line.",
        "Breast cancer subtypes": "The breast is a gland that produces milk. To do this, the glandular part of the breast is made up of lobules and ducts. The most common type of breast cancer is carcinoma that originates in epithelial cells. Breast carcinoma can be classified as: -ductal carcinoma- the most common, originating in duct cells -lobular carcinoma- carcinoma originating in the cells of the lobules is called lobular The cells of the ducts and lobules are separated from the other cells of the breast by a membrane, called the basement membrane because it is at the base of these cells. When malignant cells, in addition to proliferating in a disorganized way and not dying, acquire the capacity to invade, surpassing this basement membrane. When this happens, carcinomas begin to include the designation of invasive \u2013 invasive ductal carcinoma or invasive lobular carcinoma. If the cancer has not yet surpassed the basement membrane, it is called carcinoma in situ -ductal carcinoma in situ or lobular carcinoma in situ- because it is \u201cin its anatomical place\u201d. There are three proteins whose presence is systematically evaluated in all cases of breast cancer: the estrogen receptor (ER);/ o receptor deprogesterona(RP);/ epidermal growth factor type 2(HER2);/  The evaluation of these proteins allows breast cancer to be subdivided into three main groups: cancer that has the presence of the estrogen receptor;/ cancer that has the presence of HER2;/ cancer that does not have any of the previous proteins, which is called triple negative;/",
        "Diagnosis and Staging": "In the presence of one or more symptoms, the doctor will evaluate your case and may recommend imaging such as mammography, breast ultrasound, and, possibly, a breast MRI. With the results of these tests, and maintaining the degree of suspicion, you may request a breast biopsy. Breast biopsy consists of collecting suspicious breast tissue. Only observation of the breast cells obtained by biopsy and analyzed under a microscope by Pathological Anatomy will determine whether or not you have breast cancer.  Breast Imaging is one of its basic areas in the diagnosis of breast diseases, both benign and malignant, facilitating better diagnosis and subsequent treatment of women with this pathology. Of note is the most recent examination, Tomosynthesis or 3D direct digital mammography, which is a rapidly developing technology that is expected to be crucial in the early diagnosis of breast cancer. Approved in 2011 by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration), studies carried out in 2017 reveal that when performed in conjunction with 2D mammography, it provides: - an increase in diagnostic information of 27 to 30% -a 15 to 20% reduction in false diagnoses compared to 2D mammography alone; -an increase in the diagnosis rate of new breast cancers, 25 to 27% of which 40% were invasive at the time of diagnosis. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, it is essential to know the extent of the tumor in the breast, regional lymph nodes and other organs. This is called staging. The information obtained determines the stage of the disease, which is essential for planning treatment. The number and type of staging exams may vary from case to case. In general, bone metastases should be excluded through bone scintigraphy, liver metastases through liver ultrasound and possible lung metastases through radiography. More sensitive tests can be performed, such as computed tomography (computed tomography) and positron emission tomography (PET). Based on the tests performed, breast cancer staging can be classified as follows: Stage 0 - the cancer is non-invasive, called in situ, as it is in its own location, that is, limited to a very early location. Stage I - the cancer is less than 2 cm in size and there is sometimes microscopic evidence of tumor cells in the lymph nodes in the armpit on the same side. Stage II - breast cancer is larger than 2 cm but there is only microscopic evidence of tumor cells in the lymph nodes in the armpit on the same side. Stage III - breast cancer is greater than 5cm in size and there is evidence of disease in the axillary lymph nodes on the same larger side. Stage IV- breast cancer cells have spread to other organs, calling this phenomenon metastases. Bearing in mind the importance of a quick and accurate diagnosis for the timely start of treatments, CUF Oncologia has organized a rapid response in the event of a strong suspicion of breast cancer.",
        "Breast Cancer Treatment": "Breast cancer treatment involves joint work by several specialists who determine the best strategy for each patient. In general terms, it can be said that the majority of breast cancer patients are treated with surgery, radiotherapy and medical treatment (chemotherapy and other modalities). Determining factors for treatment selection are age and pre- or post-menopausal status, disease stage and disease subtypes (as mentioned in point 3, according to the presence of estrogen receptor, HER2 or the absence of any from them). Based on the staging of breast cancer, it is possible to determine the most appropriate treatment: Stage 0 \u2013 therapeutic options include surgery and radiotherapy. It may also include the administration of anti-estrogen hormonal therapy, if the cancer shows the presence of the estrogen receptor (ER+); Stage I \u2013 therapeutic options include surgery and radiotherapy. It may also include the administration of anti-estrogen hormone therapy, if the cancer shows the presence of the estrogen receptor (ER+). If the presence of epidermal growth factor type 2 (HER2+) is also evident, treatment generally also involves the administration of antiHER2-directed therapy. Chemotherapy treatment may be considered; Stage II - therapeutic options include surgery, radiotherapy and generally also chemotherapy. It may also include the administration of anti-estrogen hormonal therapy, if the cancer shows the presence of the estrogen receptor (ER+). If the presence of epidermal growth factor type 2 (HER2+) is also detected, treatment also involves antiHER2-directed therapeutic administration; Stage III \u2013 therapeutic options include surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. It may also include the administration of anti-estrogen hormonal therapy, if the cancer shows the presence of the estrogen receptor (ER+). If the presence of epidermal growth factor type 2 (HER2+) is also detected, treatment also involves antiHER2-directed therapeutic administration; Stage IV \u2013 in this stage, treatment is individualized, but necessarily includes systemic therapy, whether with antiestrogen hormonal therapy, antiHER2 targeted therapy or chemotherapy. Breast cancer treatment usually begins with surgery. The surgical procedure used to treat breast cancer must include the approach to the breast and armpit. For the breast it can be of two natures: Conservative surgery \u2013 the cancer and part of the breast are removed, leaving the remaining breast unaffected; the surgeon usually also removes the lymph nodes in the armpit. In the case of conservative surgery (also called lumpectomy or quadrantectomy), the woman will then undergo radiation therapy. Mastectomy \u2013 the entire breast is removed; usually the surgeon also removes the lymph nodes in the armpit; If the woman wishes, and her clinical case allows it, in the same surgical procedure as the mastectomy, breast reconstruction can be performed immediately by a plastic surgeon. The most suitable type of reconstruction varies depending on the age, the woman's physiognomy and the type of surgical treatment that was used for breast cancer, and breast implants or tissue from another part of the woman's body may be used. The approach to the armpit can be done by dissection - removal of all nodes in the armpit or by the sentinel node technique. Sentinel lymph node test - If breast cancer is confirmed, it will be necessary to perform a sentinel lymph node test, which consists of identifying the lymph node in the lymph node area closest to the lesion to which the cancer may have invaded. To find this lymph node and determine whether it has been involved by breast cancer, a dye is injected into the lesion site, and the lymph node to be removed is the one to which the contrast goes. This test is performed if there is no evidence of lymph node involvement by the cancer to begin with. The removed lymph node will be analyzed by Pathological Anatomy, and if the presence of cancer is confirmed, it will be necessary to remove all the lymph nodes in this lymph node area, a procedure called lymphedenectomy.  Side Effects Surgical treatment for breast cancer may have some side effects, including: increased sensitivity and numbness in the operated area;/ imbalance due to the absence of weight from the removed breast;/ lymphatic edema of the arm on the affected side, which should be prevented by avoiding carrying large loads, wounds or burns; physiotherapy is very useful for preventing and treating lymphatic edema in women who have undergone a mastectomy.;/ Systemic treatment\u00a0is currently indicated for the majority of patients and may include anti-estrogen hormonal treatment, cytostatic chemotherapy and treatment targeting the HER2 protein. A more detailed description goes beyond the scope of this text due to its length and diversity. Typically, women seek to know the consequences of breast cancer treatment, particularly in terms of physical sequelae and impact on their daily life. You should check with your doctor and nursing team and discuss the various treatment options, adapted as far as possible to your needs.  Side Effects Chemotherapy Chemotherapy, on the other hand, can cause the following side effects: fatigue;/ appearance of bruises;/ temporary hair loss;/ lack of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, sores in the mouth and/or lips;/ Some drugs can affect the ovaries, interfering with hormone production, which can cause symptoms similar to menopause, make the menstrual period more irregular or even suppress it. In some cases, chemotherapy can cause infertility.;/  Antiestrogenic Hormone Therapy Depending on the hormone therapy administered, it may cause the following side effects: confrontations;/ vaginal discharge;/ fatigue;/ vaginal itching;/ headaches;/ nausea, vomiting;/ If the hormonal treatment option is surgery, namely surgical removal of the ovaries, menopause is immediate as are the symptoms associated with it.  AntiHER2 Targeted Therapy AntiHER2 targeted therapy may cause the following allergic reactions during treatment: pains;/ fatigue;/ nausea, vomiting;/ fever;/ chills;/ difficulty breathing;/ skin rashes;/ The use of this type of therapy can cause heart problems that should be evaluated by your doctor using cardiac exams. Radiotherapy treatment requires careful and precise planning, which is why the CUF Oncologia Radiotherapy team has radio oncologists dedicated to the treatment of breast cancer. Radiotherapy for breast cancer is mainly prescribed as an adjuvant treatment (after surgery) with the aim of reducing the risk of recurrence of these tumors. The effectiveness of this treatment has been documented in numerous trials and randomized studies. In order to reduce the toxicities of treatments, the Radiotherapy Unit has a non-invasive guided image system, allowing treatment to be carried out in forced inspiration (DIBH - Deep Inspiration Breath Hold). In selected cases, this technique allows the exposure dose to the lungs and heart to be reduced.",
        "Follow up": "International standards recommend the following monitoring: During the first 3 years after treatment: collection of clinical history and clinical physical examination, every 3 to 6 months;/ From the 4th year onwards: collection of clinical history and clinical physical examination, every 6 to 12 months;/ From the 6th year onwards: collection of clinical history and clinical physical examination, annually;/ Monthly breast self-examination and alertness to symptoms of possible recurrence;/ Annual mammogram. If the woman has undergone conservative treatment, the first mammogram should be performed after 6 months.;/ Annual gynecological examination;/ Follow-up by a medical oncologist for the first 5 years after treatment;/ In case of symptoms and not routinely, use chest radiography, bone scintigraphy, liver ultrasound, pelvic ultrasound, blood count, liver biochemistry, and CA 15.3 or CEA tumor markers for diagnosis.;/ \"From my experience, what I take away is that we should not ignore the signs that our body gives us.\" \"I only have one goal in sight: to cure myself and be able to help many people with my experience\" \"I have always been very positive and therefore I saw this situation as something I would definitely overcome\" Count on a specialized medical evaluation service, carried out by experts in oncological diseases, with administrative support from a dedicated manager throughout the entire process.

    "Non-melanoma skin cancer": {
        "What is it?": "In recent decades, there has been a significant increase in the various types of skin cancer. More than 95% of these skin cancers are not melanoma. The most common are basal cell carcinoma, or basalioma, and squamous cell carcinoma. Skin cells are responsible for the formation of skin tissue. In their normal state, these cells grow and divide into new cells, which are formed as they are needed. This process is called cell regeneration. When normal skin cells age or are damaged, they die naturally. When cells lose this control mechanism and undergo changes in their genome (DNA), they become cancer cells, which do not die when they age or are damaged, and instead produce new cells that are not needed in an uncontrolled manner, resulting in the formation of cancer.",
        "Prevention": "You've probably heard that the most effective method of preventing melanoma is avoiding the sun. In fact, excessive exposure to the sun not only causes skin aging, but can contribute to the development of skin cancer, particularly melanoma. Reinforcing this association is the increased incidence of malignant melanoma in people with a history of sunburn in childhood. However, exposure to sunlight in moderation is beneficial. In addition to the psychological effect, sun exposure is essential for the synthesis of vitamin D in the skin. Vitamin D promotes joint and bone health, but it has also been linked to the prevention of certain types of cancer and autoimmune diseases. A healthy person needs 5 to 15 minutes of sun exposure most days, on their hands, arms and face, to produce enough vitamin D. During the winter, you need 2 to 3 hours a week. The required exposure times increase for darker skin types. Neither the use of sunscreen nor the use of protective clothing in the summer (hat, sunglasses or long-sleeved shirt) cause vitamin D deficiency. In cases of vitamin D deficiency, supplements can help. You should never use tanning beds to synthesize vitamin D. Tanning beds are artificial sources of ultraviolet radiation. Their use is associated with an increased risk of melanoma, particularly in people who started using them under the age of 35.  -Stay in the shade: the best way to avoid UV rays when outdoors; -Wear clothes that protect your skin: long-sleeved clothes, pants and hats with brims make all the difference. You can find clothing and sporting goods made with materials designed to limit exposure to UV radiation; -Use sunscreen: with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 or higher. Follow the instructions on the sunscreen label. Reapply sunscreen if you sweat or after each swim. Use sunscreen on sunny, cloudy or grey days, as UV rays are always present. Remember that sunlight reflects off the water, so take extra care when you are at the beach. Do not use sunscreen to increase the time you spend in the sun. UV rays can reach the skin even when we use sunscreen; -Use a lip balm or a broad-spectrum sunscreen cream to protect your lips. However, using higher SPF sunscreens can be misleading. Higher SPF sunscreens may prevent the skin from becoming red, but they do not prevent some of the ultraviolet rays from reaching the skin and causing cumulative damage. There is no such thing as a \u201cfull-screen\u201d sunscreen. You should avoid creating a false sense of security when using sunscreen. Using high SPF sunscreens does not justify reducing the amount applied or the frequency of applications, nor should it exclude the application of the other sun protection methods previously described. -Wear sunglasses: with 99% or 100% UV protection. This type of glasses offers greater protection for the eyes; -Do not use tanning beds or UV lamps: these types of equipment expose the skin to UV radiation and are no safer than sun exposure. Additionally, \u201cgetting a base tan\u201d in a tanning bed does not prevent sunburn or reduce UV exposure. If you want to look tanned, use products such as self-tanners or tanning sprays.  Self-examination and examination of your family members The importance of self-examination is scientifically demonstrated. It is recommended to do a complete self-examination monthly.",
        "Symptoms": "The main warning signs of skin cancer are: A change in the size or appearance of a mole or wart;/ Appearance of persistent scale or crust over months or years, especially in a place exposed to the sun;/ Wound that does not heal in the usual time despite the care applied;/ Injury that bleeds spontaneously or after mild trauma (e.g. when shaving, combing, blowing the nose or contact with glasses) over the course of weeks or months.;/ Brown or pink pigmentation that extends beyond the boundaries of the skin lesion;/ Itching or pain in a mole or wart;/",
        "Risk factors": "Basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma are associated with excessive exposure to the sun and its ultraviolet (UV) rays. Excessive exposure to UV rays is associated with some risk behaviors: Severe burns, whether or not accompanied by the formation of blisters, especially during childhood (commonly called scalds);/ Spending a lot of time in the sun over many years, whether at the beach, at work or while playing sports;/ Use of tanning beds, which are artificial sources of UV rays;/  There are other risk factors such as: Light skin;/ Skin infection by some types of human papillomavirus (HPV);/ Occupational or medical exposure to X-radiation or arsenic;/ Family history of skin cancer;/ Multiple nevi (moles) or atypical nevi;/  Risk factors combine with excessive sun exposure to significantly increase the risk of skin cancer.",
        "Who should I contact?": "In addition to your family doctor, you should also consult a Dermatologist, a General Surgeon or, alternatively, a less common Oncologist. Meet our team of experts Make your contact request so we can follow up from the first moment. If you prefer, you can schedule an appointment via our toll-free line.  Basal cell carcinoma is the most common of all types of skin cancer, with squamous cell carcinoma being the second most common. Most of these carcinomas are treatable with current therapies available to the population.  Actinic keratosis is a skin lesion induced by ultraviolet radiation that can progress to invasive squamous cell carcinoma. It is the most common skin lesion with malignant potential. Its diagnosis and treatment can prevent the occurrence of squamous cell carcinoma. The development of squamous cell carcinoma in skin damaged by sun exposure is a gradual process that manifests itself through a spectrum of lesions of increasing malignancy, ranging from the pre-neoplastic precursor lesion, called actinic keratosis, through squamous cell carcinoma in situ (limited to the epidermis), invasive squamous cell carcinoma (when it reaches the dermis) and, at the opposite extreme, metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. Actinic keratosis is more common in individuals over the age of 55, with light skin and eyes, especially in areas subjected to long periods of sun exposure. Given the risk of progression to squamous cell carcinoma, it is mandatory to carry out early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Treatment of actinic keratosis includes topical application formulations (cream or gel) or destruction of the lesion by applying a chemical that produces a localized peeling effect, by the cold of liquid nitrogen, by laser or even topical photodynamic therapy. In more advanced lesions, surgical excision may be performed. These methods do not exclude compliance with sun protection recommendations such as paying attention to the time of day when you are exposed to sunlight, wearing protective clothing and regularly applying sunscreen.",
        "Diagnosis and Staging": "Your treating physician may refer you for a dermatology consultation if you suspect cancer. Many skin changes are not cancer, but only a dermatologist can confirm this.  Dermatoscopia Dermatoscopy (also called epiluminescence microscopy) is a skin assessment technique using a dermatoscope, an optical magnifying device (usually 10x) with its own light source. It is a technique widely used by dermatologists in the evaluation of skin diseases and in particular in the diagnosis of melanocytic nevi (\u201cmoles\u201d) and malignant melanoma. It is particularly useful in the evaluation and monitoring of patients with multiple melanocytic nevi that pose diagnostic difficulties (clinically atypical nevi) and especially when there are other family members with multiple atypical nevi and malignant melanoma (dysplastic nevi syndrome).  Microscopia confocal In vivo confocal microscopy is an advanced imaging technique that allows non-invasive study of the skin in real time. This technology allows images to be obtained with a cellular and subcellular resolution identical to conventional histology obtained through a biopsy, but without the need to extract a skin sample. It is a painless technique, with no need for anesthetic procedures and no risks related to radiation. Confocal microscopy is a means of choice for the diagnosis and monitoring of skin cancer treatment.  Digital photographic record of the entire body Full body digital photographic registration is a medical procedure in which the majority of the skin is recorded using digital photographs. These records allow the identification of new signals or even the appearance of changes in existing signals.  Biopsy Based on the results of the physical examination, the dermatologist may decide to perform a biopsy. A biopsy consists of removing part of the skin to be observed under a microscope by a specialist in Pathological Anatomy. It is the only way to confirm the diagnosis of melanoma. Staging is the process by which we determine whether cancer cells have spread from the skin to other nearby or more distant structures. The information obtained through the staging process determines the stage of the disease, which is essential for planning treatment. In addition to the information obtained by diagnostic biopsy, the following tests are used to stage the melanoma: blood tests;;/ imaging tests such as X-rays, CT scans, MRI scans or PET scans.;/",
        "Treatment": "A large proportion of squamous cell carcinomas arise from precancerous lesions, Actinic Keratoses, so timely treatment of these lesions is essential to prevent the development of cancer cells. In these cases, possible treatments are cryotherapy or photodynamic therapy, which consists of applying a chemical to the skin lesion and then exposing it to a special light source (such as laser light) to kill the cancer cells. Another option for low-risk lesions may be topical chemotherapy, through the application of a cream or lotion containing chemotherapeutic agents. Surgery;/ Treatment is surgical and it is very important to be early, including safety margins for a more complete cleaning of the lesions. Mohs Surgery;/ Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) is a surgical technique used in the treatment of malignant tumors of the skin and, more rarely, of the mucous membranes. The malignant tumors most frequently treated by MMS are squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma, but also include dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans and Merkel cell carcinoma. This technique consists of sequential excision of the tumor in thin layers and microscopic observation of the respective margins in fresh frozen sections. This procedure saves healthy tissue, while ensuring total excision of the tumor in a single surgical procedure. It is associated with a high cure rate and is a preferred therapeutic option in the treatment of recurrent tumors, with a high risk of recurrence or located in areas where a minimal surgical defect is desired. Electrocoagulation and Curettage;/ The cancer is removed with a sharp, spoon-shaped device called a curette. This treated area is then subjected to an electric current that controls bleeding and destroys any cancer cells. These procedures are quick and easy to perform. Cryosurgery;/ The treatment involves the application of liquid nitrogen to the area to be treated, which leads to the rapid freezing of tumor cells and their destruction. Laser surgery;/ With this technique, the tumor is vaporized through the application of a\u00a0thin, concave beam of light. As it is mainly used in neoplasms located only in the outer layer of the skin, this treatment requires stricter monitoring. Radiotherapy;/ It is mainly recommended for treating tumors in hard-to-reach areas or in people at higher risk of complications and therefore not suitable for surgery. In some cases, it is also recommended after surgery, especially in tumors with a higher probability of recurrence. The treatment to be carried out depends on several factors: tumor location;/ tumor size;/ tumor depth;/ your general state of health;/ your medical history;/ if the tumor had already been treated;/ In most cases, treatment is surgical. In some more superficial cases, treatment with photodynamic therapy, CO2 laser, cryosurgery and imiquimod may be possible. In more extensive or difficult to locate lesions, plastic surgery, Mohs surgery or radiotherapy may be necessary. Load more;/ In summer, achieving healthy, tanned skin is a difficult task. Is it possible with self-tanners? The sun is part of our life. It is a source of heat, a generator of well-being and a regulator of biological rhythms.

    "Prostate cancer": {
        "What is it?": "Prostate cancer is currently one of the main cancers faced by the male population, being the most common and the second most common type of mortality. As average life expectancy increases, there is an increase in the incidence and mortality of prostate cancer. When prostate cells undergo changes in their genome (DNA), which do not die when they age or become damaged and produce new cells that are not needed in an uncontrolled manner, they become cancer cells.",
        "Prevention": "Mass population screening is defined as the systematic screening of asymptomatic (at-risk) men and is usually initiated by health authorities. In contrast, early detection or timely screening is a process that begins on the initiative of a man who is being assessed by a doctor. The primary goal of screening is to reduce mortality from prostate cancer while maintaining quality of life. Mortality from prostate cancer varies widely from country to country in the industrialized world. However, mortality from prostate cancer has been decreasing in most Western countries.",
        "Risk Factors": "Epidemiological studies have shown strong evidence for a genetic predisposition to prostate cancer, based on two of the most important factors, ethnic background and family history. Genetic studies have identified 100 common susceptibility loci that contribute to prostate cancer risk. A small subpopulation of men with prostate cancer (about 9%) has true hereditary prostate cancer. This is defined as the existence of three or more affected relatives, or at least two relatives who developed early-onset disease, that is, before the age of 55. Patients with hereditary prostate cancer generally have disease onset six to seven years earlier than in sporadic cases. Factors such as diet, alcohol consumption, sexual behavior, ultraviolet radiation exposure, chronic inflammation, and occupational exposure have been discussed as being important in the causation of non-hereditary prostate cancer. However, there is not yet sufficient evidence to recommend lifestyle changes (such as reducing animal fat intake and increasing fruit, grain, and vegetable intake) to reduce the risk. However, such lifestyle changes may be associated with other benefits and should therefore be encouraged.",
        "Symptoms": "The symptoms of prostate cancer are not exclusive, they can appear in other diseases, such as benign prostate hypertrophy. Just because you experience one or more of the symptoms described here does not mean you have prostate cancer. You should be alert and consult your doctor if you have the following symptoms: - Presence of blood in urine or semen; - Frequent need to urinate, especially at night; - Inability to urinate, or difficulty starting or stopping the flow of urine; - Weak or intermittent urine flow; - Pain or burning during urination; - Difficulty getting an erection; - Persistent pain in the lower back, hips or upper thighs.",
        "Who should I contact?": "If you suspect cancer, due to symptoms or a complementary diagnostic test that presents an alteration, you should consult a Urologist, or alternatively, less commonly, an Oncologist. Meet our team of experts Make your contact request so we can follow up from the first moment. If you prefer, you can schedule an appointment via our toll-free line. The prostate is a gland that is part of the male reproductive system and produces part of the seminal fluid. During ejaculation, the seminal fluid helps to transport sperm (part of the semen or sperm) until it is released outside. The prostate is located below the bladder, near the base of the penis. The urethra connects the bladder and passes through the prostate to the penis. Above the prostate and behind the bladder are the seminal vesicles. Testosterone produced by the testicles causes the prostate to grow. At the end of puberty, the prostate is the size of a walnut. After the age of 40, the prostate may still grow a little, although some men may have a high growth rate of this gland. An enlarged prostate may mean the presence of benign prostatic hypertrophy - an abnormal growth of benign prostate cells - a very common problem in men, or other types of medical problems. If the prostate grows too much, it can reduce or stop the flow of urine by putting pressure on the urethra. Most prostate cancers occur in the epithelial cells of its glandular tissue. This type of cancer is called adenocarcinoma. It usually appears initially in the peripheral area of \u200b\u200bthe prostate. The second most frequent location is in the transition zone. There are also rare prostate tumors that occur in neuroendocrine cells. One of the neuroendocrine prostate tumors is the small cell tumor, and it is treated differently than adenocarcinoma. Over time, cancer cells grow and divide enough to form a tumor. Prostate tumors can grow large and affect the entire prostate. They can also grow through the prostate capsule and invade surrounding tissues. This growth is called\u00a0extracapsular extension. Some prostate tumors can cause the appearance of new blood and lymphatic vessels in addition to existing ones, in order to receive nutrients to grow. If the prostate tumor invades the blood and lymphatic vessels, it can metastasize, and the most common way is to first affect the bones and lymph nodes. Although treatments can control prostate cancer after it metastasizes, it is not considered curable.",
        "Diagnosis and Staging": "Prostate cancer is usually suspected by a prostate digital rectal exam and/or an altered PSA level. Definitive examination depends on histological verification by performing a prostate biopsy or incidental verification of prostate cancer in tissue from transurethral resection or prostate adenomectomy.  Your doctor will usually examine you to check for signs of the disease. The most common exam is called a digital rectal exam and is used to assess whether your prostate is a normal size, whether it is soft or lumpy, or whether it causes pain when touched. The peripheral area of \u200b\u200bthe prostate, where most cancers begin, faces the wall of the rectum. If your doctor feels that your prostate is enlarged, lumpy or hard, he or she will recommend tests that will include a PSA test and will probably refer you for a prostate biopsy.  Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a protein produced by the cells where most cancers begin. PSA is what turns the semen that clots after ejaculation back into liquid, and can be measured by a blood test once part of it enters the blood vessels of the prostate.  A biopsy is the means of confirming the existence of prostate cancer. This consists of removing small fragments of prostate tissue for pathological anatomy analysis. Typically, 12 samples of prostate tissue are collected in order to check the presence of cancer and its location in the prostate. Prostate biopsy is not an infallible method, and therefore there may be false negatives. If cancer is not detected, the patient may need to undergo a new biopsy if prostate cancer remains suspected. Normally biopsies are performed without any complications.  Prostate fusion biopsy improves the prostate cancer detection rate from the current 65% to more than 85%. This method, which uses the images previously provided by 3 Tesla Magnetic Resonance Imaging and merges them with the image provided by prostate ultrasound, makes the prostate biopsy more precise and accurate. Not only does this new technique increase the likelihood of detecting malignant disease, it also minimizes the number of punctures needed in each procedure and reduces the likelihood of having to repeat biopsies. The aim is to offer patients a more effective and efficient alternative, reducing the suffering and potential complications inherent to performing multiple punctures. Staging is the process by which we determine whether cancer cells have spread from the prostate to other nearby or more distant structures. The information obtained through the staging process determines the stage of the disease, which is essential for treatment to be planned. Prostate cancer staging includes Pathological Anatomy analysis of collected tissues, imaging or Nuclear Medicine exams. Bearing in mind the importance of a quick and accurate diagnosis for the timely start of treatments, CUF Oncologia has organized a rapid response in case of strong suspicion of prostate cancer.",
        "Treatment": "The extent of prostate cancer is assessed by digital rectal examination and PSA and can be complemented with Bone Scintigraphy, Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (mpMRI) and/or Computed Axial Tomography (CT).  Surgical procedures for treating prostate cancer can be: Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy;/ Video-assisted radical prostatectomy;/   Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) is the most commonly performed robot-assisted procedure in the world. PRAR is indicated in all patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer and with a life expectancy of more than 10 years. Prostatectomy is indicated in patients with localized or locally advanced prostate cancer. The objective of PRAR is to excise the prostate in order to remove the entire tumor while preserving urinary continence. Patients with localized prostate cancer and an intact capsule can preserve erectile function. Preoperative multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging is very important to check the integrity of the prostate capsule and decide whether to perform RARP with preservation of the vascular-nervous bundles in order to preserve erectile function.  CUF Technique An extraperitoneal approach, i.e. before starting the surgery, a space is created below the navel, between the abdominal wall and the bladder, and it is in this space that the surgeon inserts the surgical instruments, allowing the surgery to be performed without contact with the large intestine. With this technique, the post-operative period is even shorter and with less associated pain, which leads to a hospital stay of less than 24 hours. This may be a treatment option if your case does not require surgery. Radiation therapy can shrink or even kill tumor cells. External beam radiation therapy (IMRT);/ Robotic radiosurgery - Cyberknife;/ Brachytherapy;/ Hormonoterapia;/ Chemotherapy;/ Immunotherapy;/ Hormonoterapia;/ Possible side effects of Prostatectomy and Radiotherapy: Erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, colitis Today, robotic radical prostatectomy clearly reduces the likelihood of urinary incontinence and allows full recovery of continence within one month of surgery. Possible side effects of lymphadenectomy Lymphatic edema, venous thromboembolism Possible side effects of hormone therapy and chemotherapy Erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, obesity, hot flashes, increased emotional sensitivity, breast enlargement, infections, vomiting, loss of appetite, fatigue, mouth ulcers, hair loss.  Follow-up of patients after curative treatment In asymptomatic patients, a specific history of the disease and serum PSA determination, complemented by digital rectal examination, are the recommended assessments in routine follow-up. They should be performed at 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment, then every 6 months until 3 years, and annually thereafter. After radical prostatectomy, total PSA should be undetectable (<0.1 ng/mL). A total PSA >0.1 ng/mL after radical prostatectomy is a sign of recurrence or residual prostate tissue. After undetectable total PSA after radical prostatectomy, a total PSA >0.2 ng/mL and rising is associated with disease recurrence. After radiotherapy, a rise in PSA >2 ng/mL above nadir is the most obvious sign of disease recurrence. Palpable nodules and a rise in serum PSA are signs of local recurrence.

    "Thyroid cancer": {
        "What is it?": "The cells that make up normal tissue grow and divide as necessary, in a controlled manner, with the aim of replacing aged cells and thus preserving the function of the organ to which they belong. During this process, which is continuous, one of the cells may suffer one or more genetic mutations, causing its division to stop being regulated and become excessive, giving rise to a tumor. In malignant tumors, cells may no longer respect the limits of the organ, infiltrating neighboring tissues or giving rise to cell colonies in other organs or structures, a process called metastasis. The thyroid gland has two types of endocrine cells in its composition, which synthesize and secrete hormones, and which can give rise to different malignant tumors: the follicular cell, which secretes the thyroid hormones T4 and, to a lesser extent, T3, and the parafollicular Cou cell, which produces calcitonin.",
        "Prevention and screening": "In terms of prevention, from what was said above, it follows the need to avoid exposing the thyroid to radiation, including that used in a medical context, especially in children. This exposure should be reserved for cases in which it is strictly necessary.  For most people, no form of thyroid carcinoma screening is recommended, given the fact that its benefit is doubtful. Carrying out screening tests is only indicated in very specific cases, such as belonging to a family with medullary thyroid carcinoma.",
        "Risk Factors": "The best-known risk factor for the development of thyroid carcinoma, especially the papillary type, is exposure of the gland to radiation, especially when this occurs in childhood. There are several syndromes that are associated with\u00a0 an increased risk of thyroid carcinoma. Also, the fact that there are several close relatives with well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma increases the probability of having a malignant nodule. As mentioned previously, some medullary carcinomas have a familial incidence.",
        "Symptoms": "The diagnosis of thyroid carcinoma arises, in the vast majority of cases, following a clinical study of a nodule located in this gland. With the widespread use of ultrasound, nodules are often diagnosed that, due to their small size, are not identified either by the person or during medical examination, that is, they are asymptomatic. However, it is important to highlight that these small lesions, even when they are malignant, have a small impact on survival. A thyroid nodule that increases in size or is associated with symptoms such as difficulty breathing or swallowing or hoarseness is more suspicious and should immediately lead to seeking medical evaluation.",
        "Who should I contact?": "The identification of a thyroid nodule should prompt a medical consultation. The specialists best qualified to carry out this evaluation are the Endocrinologist and the General Surgeon, who specializes in thyroid surgery. There are several types of thyroid carcinoma, which are differentiated microscopically (histology or anatomopathological examination), by associated genetic alterations and by clinical behavior. The most common forms of malignant thyroid tumor belong to the group of well-differentiated carcinomas. They originate from follicular cells and present, in most cases, an excellent prognosis, with a survival rate of over 95% at 10 years. They are divided into two main groups: Papillary carcinoma \u2013 This is the most common form of thyroid carcinoma, accounting for approximately 85% of cases. Under the microscope, the nuclei of its cells show changes that, although not exclusive to this entity, are typical. From a clinical point of view, metastases are frequently identified in the lymph nodes of the neck.;/ Follicular carcinoma \u2013 Represents around 10% of all thyroid carcinomas and, unlike papillary carcinoma, is not associated with the emergence of lymph node metastases.;/  There are other, less common forms of thyroid carcinoma that, as a group,\u00a0 are associated with more aggressive biological behavior. These tumors include: Medullary carcinoma - It originates from the C or parafollicular cells of the thyroid and, in most cases, has the ability to secrete a hormone called calcitotin which, being able to be measured in the blood, constitutes a very useful marker for the diagnosis, staging and monitoring of this condition. type of tumor. Around 25% of cases are familial, resulting from the occurrence of a mutation in the RET gene.;/ Anaplastic or undifferentiated carcinoma \u2013 This is very rare, mainly affecting people over 60 years of age. It is the most aggressive malignant thyroid tumor.;/ Poorly differentiated carcinoma \u2013 It presents a clinical behavior that is between that of well-differentiated and undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma.;/ Meet our team of experts Make your contact request so we can follow up from the first moment. If you prefer, you can schedule an appointment via our toll-free line.",
        "Diagnosis and Staging": "One of the questions that arises when a thyroid nodule is diagnosed is whether it is malignant, requiring treatment, or benign and therefore eligible, in most cases, for monitoring. The majority of thyroid nodules are benign. It is estimated that only about 5% of people with one or more thyroid nodules have a malignant tumor. In order to identify which nodules are malignant, in addition to a thorough clinical history and medical observation, some diagnostic tests must be requested, the most important of which are: Blood tests to assess thyroid hormone levels \u2013 Some thyroid nodules produce hormones in an uncontrolled and often excessive manner. They are called toxic nodules and are only very rarely malignant. The suspicion that we are facing one of these nodules arises from the observation of thyroid function analyses, but confirmation of the diagnosis requires carrying out other tests.;/ Blood tests to assess thyroid hormone levels \u2013 Some thyroid nodules produce hormones in an uncontrolled and often excessive manner. They are called toxic nodules and are only very rarely malignant. The suspicion that we are facing one of these nodules arises from the observation of thyroid function analyses, but confirmation of the diagnosis requires carrying out other tests.  Neck ultrasound with assessment of the thyroid and neck lymph nodes \u2013 Ultrasound to assess thyroid nodules is a very important examination today. A correct ultrasound assessment allows the nodules to be stratified according to their risk of malignancy and thus, in conjunction with the clinical assessment, identify those that are indicated for aspiration cytology. In order to maximize its diagnostic accuracy, this examination should be performed by doctors with special expertise in this area.;/  Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) \u2013 This is a very simple, very safe and practically painless test. It allows, through a simple prick in the neck, almost always performed with ultrasound imaging control, the collection of some cells from the nodule for analysis. In most cases, FNAC allows a diagnosis of benignity or malignancy, with a very low margin of error. It is, however, possible that, even having obtained cellular material for study, this does not allow a certainty to be stated whether the nodule is benign or malignant. In these cases, we say that the cytology is indeterminate and, when the risk assessment is considered unacceptably high, surgery may be indicated.;/ A malignant tumor is characterized by the potential of its cells to go beyond the limits of the organ of origin, invading other structures, locally or remotely. After diagnosis, in order to correctly plan the initial treatment, which is almost always surgical, it is essential to assess the extent of the disease. The diagnostic process that allows us to carry out this assessment is called staging. The most important examination for the initial staging of thyroid carcinoma is an ultrasound of the neck. The aim, especially in papillary carcinoma, is to evaluate the lymph nodes in the neck, which should undergo FNAC if they meet suspicion criteria. Occasionally, other examinations, such as a CT scan of the neck or chest, may prove useful. There are data obtained following surgery, anatomopathological examination, possible treatment with I-131 and laboratory evaluation, which allow the staging to be completed and thus optimize the assessment of the tumor's prognosis.",
        "Treatment": "The definition of the most appropriate treatment for each person with thyroid carcinoma must be subject to evaluation and discussion within the scope of a Multidisciplinary Consultation, in which the specialties most directly linked to the approach to this pathology participate, taking into account the type of tumor and its staging. For well-differentiated carcinomas, originating in follicular cells, which constitute more than 90% of malignant thyroid tumors, treatment is based on three fundamental pillars: Surgery, Therapy with radioactive iodine (I-131) and Suppressive therapy with levothyroxine. The need for external radiotherapy or chemotherapy does not arise for the majority of malignant thyroid tumors, although there are situations in which, due to their aggressiveness or poor response to usual therapy, their use is justified. Surgery is, as a rule, the first therapeutic procedure for these tumors. Its extent depends on the stage of the disease. The most conservative (least extensive) surgery, accepted for some tumors considered to be at very low or low risk of recurrence, is thyroid lobectomy with isthmectomy, also known as hemithyroidectomy, which involves removing half of the thyroid that contains the carcinoma. However, for the vast majority of cases, the surgery of choice is total thyroidectomy (removal of the entire thyroid) with removal of the lymph node chains in the neck (cellulectomy) affected by the disease. As thyroid follicular cells have the ability, which is rare in the human body, to concentrate iodine within themselves, treatment with I-131 constitutes a form of radiotherapy directed at thyroid cells which, for this reason, has a low probability of complications. In most cases, the sole purpose of hospitalization is to reduce community exposure to radiation. This treatment should only be carried out after a total thyroidectomy and consists of the oral administration of I-131. The purpose of this treatment is to destroy normal and malignant thyroid cells that were not removed during surgery and to perform a staging examination called body scintigraphy. The aim, therefore, is to improve disease surveillance conditions and reduce the likelihood of recurrence and death from the tumor. This treatment is only indicated for thyroid carcinomas originating in follicular cells, in which the risk of negative events is considered significant. Treatment with radioactive iodine is not useful in tumors in which the follicular cell has lost its differentiation and, therefore, its capabilities (for example, in anaplastic carcinoma) or in medullary carcinoma originating in parafollicular cells. Thyroid replacement, with a dose of thyroid hormone (levothyroxine or LT4) slightly above the physiological level, allows the suppression of TSH production by the pituitary gland, which has a stimulating action on the proliferation of thyroid follicular cells. The use of this strategy may be useful in thyroid carcinomas originating in follicular cells. However, over time, when there is no persistent disease, it is necessary to consider reducing the dosage of thyroid hormone, ensuring the replacement of the gland removed during surgery. Patients undergoing treatment for thyroid carcinoma should be monitored regularly in an Endocrinology Consultation with differentiation in oncological diseases of this gland. Normally patients with thyroid carcinoma are not monitored by an oncologist. Monitoring of differentiated thyroid carcinoma is based on clinical observation, blood tests, which should include the measurement of thyroglobulin, a tumor marker for this type of tumor, and periodic ultrasound of the neck, performed by a doctor with special expertise in this area.

The thyroid is an endocrine gland located at the base of the neck in front of the trachea. It is shaped like a butterfly with a right and left lobe that surround the trachea, joined by a thin piece of tissue called the isthmus. A healthy thyroid is about 2.5 cm long and cannot be felt through the skin. On the back of the thyroid gland are four pea-shaped organs called parathyroid glands. The thyroid and parathyroid glands produce, store and release hormones into the bloodstream. The hormones produced by the thyroid gland contain iodine, a mineral that we get in our diet. There are foods that contain iodine, such as fish and vegetables, and there are foods to which iodine is added, such as salt. The hormones produced by the thyroid regulate the body's metabolism and organ function, having the following functions: Control heart rate, body temperature and metabolism, generally the speed at which food is transformed into energy, memory, among other bodily functions;;/ Control the amount of calcium in the blood.;/ Portugal's largest private cancer care network.

    "Biliary tract cancer": {
        "What is it?": "Bile duct cancer is one of the types of cancer of the digestive system, and is also one of the types of hepatobiliary pancreatic tumors (liver, pancreas and bile ducts). Epithelial cells are responsible for the formation of the bile duct tissue. In their normal state, these cells grow and divide into new cells, which are formed as they are needed. This process is called cell regeneration. When cells lose their control mechanism and undergo changes in their genome (DNA), they become cancer cells, which do not die when they age or are damaged, and produce new cells that are not needed in an uncontrolled manner, giving rise to tumors called cholangiocarcinoma. Unlike normal cells, bile duct cancer cells do not respect the borders of the organ, invading the surrounding tissues and can spread to other parts of the body. This process is called metastasis. Bile duct cancers are rare diseases, usually diagnosed at an advanced stage and therefore with a poor prognosis.",
        "Prevention": "Patients with sclerosing cholangitis or ulcerative colitis should have regular liver and bile duct imaging tests.",
        "Risk Factors": "Bile duct cancer can occur in individuals who have no known risk factors. The causes of bile duct cancer have not yet been determined, but some risk factors are known. The main risk factors are: Primary sclerosing cholangitis (an autoimmune disease);/ Ulcerative colitis;/ Bile duct cysts;/ Infection with a bile duct parasite;/",
        "Symptoms": "The symptoms of bile duct cancer are not exclusive, they can appear in other diseases such as lithiasis (gallstones). Just because you have one or more of the symptoms described here does not mean you have bile duct cancer. You should be alert and consult your doctor if you have the following symptoms: Abdominal pain;/ Jaundice;/ Fever;/ Itching;/ Weight loss for no apparent reason;/ Weakness;/",
        "Who should I contact?": "If you suspect cancer, due to symptoms or a complementary diagnostic test that presents a change, you should always go to your family doctor, your CUF Assistant Physician, a Gastroenterologist, a General Surgeon or alternatively, less commonly to an Oncologist. Meet our team of experts Make your contact request so we can follow up from the first moment. If you prefer, you can schedule an appointment via our toll-free line. Although there are no subtypes regarding the cell type of bile duct cancers, there are subtypes regarding their location. Lower bile duct cancers and those in the area where the right and left bile duct bifurcate are called Klatskin tumors.",
        "Diagnosis and Staging": "In patients with a clinical history and clinical examination suspected of bile duct cancer, the following should be requested: - General blood tests that include assessment of liver function and the following tumor markers: carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carcinoma antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), which may be elevated in patients with bile duct cancer - Imaging tests that may include ultrasound, computed tomography and MRI; - Endoscopic examinations of the bile duct - the doctor can perform a biopsy of a suspicious lesion, that is, collect cells to be analyzed under a microscope. There are several ways to obtain biopsy material:  Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) - examination that consists of the oral introduction of an endoscope - a flexible tube that allows the doctor to visualize the orifice where the bile duct connects to the duodenum. A contrast substance may be injected into the main bile duct and visualized using radioscopy. The doctor can collect samples of cells from the wall of the bile ducts to be observed under a microscope later by pathological anatomy;;/  Percutaneous cholangiography (bile duct x-ray) \u2013 test that involves injecting a contrast substance into the liver, which allows the flow of bile to be assessed as it drains from the liver. The doctor can collect cell samples to be observed under a microscope later by pathological anatomy;;/  Liver biopsy \u2013 examination that consists of introducing a needle through the skin to the site of the lesion, through which tissue samples can be collected, usually guided by computed tomography.;/ Only when the material collected in a biopsy from a suspicious mass is observed under a microscope is it possible to confirm the diagnosis of bile duct cancer.  Staging is the process by which we determine whether cancer cells have spread from the bile duct to other nearby or more distant structures. The information obtained through the staging process determines the stage of the disease, which is essential for planning treatment. When the diagnosis of bile duct cancer is confirmed, the next step is to stage it, and the following tests may be requested if they have not been performed to obtain the diagnosis: Abdominal, thoracic and pelvic CT scan;/ Liver magnetic resonance imaging;/ Bone scintigraphy;/ Positron emission tomography (PET scan);/ Often the staging of the disease is only complete after the treatment surgery, through microscopic analysis by Pathological Anatomy of the tissues collected during surgery.  Based on the diagnostic tests performed, the staging of bile duct cancer can be classified as follows: Stage 0- At this stage, the cancer cells are only in the innermost layer of the epithelium that comes into contact with the bile, also called carcinoma in situ because it is in its location; Stage I- In this stage the cancer has spread to the muscle and fibrous tissue that forms the wall of the bile duct; Stage II- In this stage the cancer has spread to the fat outside the bile duct wall or to the liver; Stage III - At this stage, the cancer has spread to the arteries and veins of the liver or regional lymph nodes; Stage IV- In this stage the tumor has spread (spread) to distant organs.   Stage 0- At this stage, the cancer cells are only in the innermost layer of the epithelium that comes into contact with the bile, also called carcinoma in situ because it is in its location; Stage I - At this stage, the cancer has grown throughout the thickness of the bile duct wall; Stage II- At this stage, the cancer has spread to regional lymph nodes or regional organs such as the gallbladder, pancreas, small intestine or other organs; Stage III - At this stage, the cancer has spread to the large arteries and veins of the abdomen; Stage IV- In this stage the tumor has spread (spread) to distant organs.  Bile duct cancer can also be separated in a more practical way according to how it is treated: Localized and operable- This cancer can be completely removed by the surgeon;/ Inoperable or metastatic- This cancer can no longer be treated by surgery and must be followed up by medical oncology.;/",
        "Treatment": "The multidisciplinary clinical team will assess the best treatment to follow, taking into account the stage of the disease, the location of the tumor and your general health status: Localized and operable cancer \u2013 the treatment option is radical surgery and possibly radiotherapy; Inoperable or metastatic \u2013 the treatment option is palliative surgery and usually chemotherapy. Radiotherapy is used in specific situations.  Radiotherapy for biliary tract carcinomas can be applied in cases after surgery, with the aim of reducing its recurrence.   - Radical surgery for bile duct cancer may consist of the following surgical procedures: Removal of the bile duct - In this surgery, the diseased part of the bile duct is removed. It is a surgical procedure used in cases of early cancer.;/ Partial hepatectomy- This surgery removes the part of the liver that has cancer.;/ Cephalic duodenopancreatectomy (CPD) or Whipple surgery - In this surgery, the head of the pancreas, the gallbladder, part of the stomach, part of the intestine and the bile duct are removed;/ - Palliative surgery or local endoscopic techniques for bile duct cancer may consist of the following surgical procedures: Biliary bypass- Surgery in which the cancer is not removed but in which a diversion or bypass is made to the tumor;;/ Placement of a biliary prosthesis - Placement of a tube in the bile duct that prevents it from collapsing and the patient from becoming jaundice.;/ Patients who have had bile duct cancer may be monitored by the oncologist or surgeon if they have undergone surgery.\u00a0Follow-up generally consists of observation in consultation, with imaging tests and blood tests usually being requested, depending on the clinician's decision.

    "Head and neck cancer": {
        "What is it?": "Head and Neck Cancer is a designation used by doctors to group a group of other cancers that are present in the head and neck area, such as: Laryngeal Cancer, 25% of head and neck cancers;/ Oral Cavity Cancer, 42%;/ Oropharyngeal Cancer, 15%;/ Hypopharyngeal Cancer, 6%;/ Nasopharyngeal Cancer, 12%;/ Cervical metastases from occult primary;/ Salivary Gland Cancer;/ Nasal and Paranasal Sinus Cancer;/ Skin Cancer of the Face, Neck and Scalp;/   More than 90% of these tumors occur in people over 40 years of age, although their incidence is increasing in younger people. Unfortunately, many are diagnosed late, which greatly compromises their prognosis. That is why early diagnosis is so important and otorhinolaryngologists play a fundamental role in diagnosing these early-stage tumors as well as pre-malignant lesions in order to allow effective treatment.",
        "Prevention": "There are several ways to prevent head and neck cancer or reduce the risk of developing it, such as reducing tobacco and alcohol consumption and avoiding being affected by the Human Papillomavirus (HPV), among others. However, not everyone diagnosed with head and neck cancer has a specific cause or associated risk factor. Sometimes, the reason why the tumor appears is still unknown.",
        "Symptoms": "The main warning signs and symptoms are: Swelling (\u201clump\u201d) in the neck;/ Voice changes (hoarseness);/ Persistent difficulty or pain when swallowing;/ Appearance of blood in saliva or in the mouth;/ Persistent pain in one ear without ear disease;/ Changes in the skin of the face or neck;/ Other warning signs may be the appearance of white or red spots in the mouth, wounds in the mouth that do not heal, swelling or wound in the jaw that causes poor adaptation or discomfort of the dental prosthesis, chronic infection of the sinuses that does not respond to antibiotic therapy. recurrent nosebleeds, recently established permanent nasal obstruction, persistent headaches, increased volume of the salivary glands or paralysis of facial muscles.;/  In the vast majority of cases, these symptoms do not mean the existence of a tumor, but a careful examination by your doctor is essential to rule out this hypothesis.",
        "Risk Factors": "It is common knowledge that there are risk factors for tumors that make some people more at risk than others. The main risk factors for head and neck tumors are: Tobacco \u2013 tobacco is associated with the appearance of tumors in the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, nose and paranasal sinuses;;/ Alcohol \u2013 people who consume alcohol excessively are more likely to develop a tumor of the oral cavity or pharynx and the risk increases further if these people, in addition to drinking alcohol, also smoke;;/ Papilloma virus (HPV) infection \u2013 some strains of HPV can infect the mouth and throat and their presence may be associated with the appearance of tumors in this area;;/ Sun exposure \u2013 excess exposure to sunlight is responsible for the appearance of tumors in this area of \u200b\u200bthe body that is normally very exposed (skin and lips);;/ Exposure to industrial products such as wood, nickel and other heavy metals, asbete or previous radiotherapy are associated with a higher incidence of tumors in these territories;;/ A diet low in vegetables and fruits is often associated with an increased risk of developing tumors of the oral cavity and pharynx;;/ Poor oral hygiene \u2013 is normally associated with the appearance of these tumors.;/",
        "Who should I contact?": "If you are concerned because you suspect that you have any of these signs or symptoms or because you consider yourself to be at increased risk, then you should seek out a specialist in Otorhinolaryngology or Maxillofacial Surgery as soon as possible.

Laryngeal Cancer;/ Located in the area of \u200b\u200bthe vocal tract, its appearance is associated with tobacco use and excessive alcohol consumption. Other risk factors are consecutive exposure to environments with metal dust, asbestos, paint chemicals, etc.  Oral Cavity Cancer;/ It usually starts on the lips or inside the mouth and is often detected at the dentist. It is mainly associated with tobacco use and excessive alcohol consumption.  Oropharyngeal Cancer;/ The oropharynx is the middle part of the throat (the pharynx) and begins at the back of the mouth. The main risk factors are tobacco and alcohol. Another risk factor for the development of this cancer is the Human Papilloma Virus, the incidence of which has been increasing.  Hypopharyngeal Cancer;/ It corresponds to the lower part of the throat, next to the trachea and esophagus. As with most head and neck cancers, the main risk factors are tobacco and excessive alcohol consumption.  Nasopharyngeal Cancer;/ This is the uppermost part of the throat, connecting the mouth to the nose. It also includes the Eustachian tubes, which connect the throat to the ears. Most of these cancers start in the squamous cells that line the nasopharynx. Some lymphomas can also appear in this area, but this is rare. Some types of salivary gland cancer can also start in the nasopharynx due to the presence of minor salivary glands in the throat, but this is also rare.  Salivary Gland Cancer;/ It corresponds to cancer that arises in the parotid, submaxillary or minor salivary glands. They are characterized by the appearance of swellings in these glands, which increase in size. The main etiological factors are tobacco, alcohol, radiation, and a diet low in polyunsaturated fatty acids.  Nasal and Paranasal Sinus Cancer;/ It corresponds to cancer that appears inside the nose, and in the cavities associated with it. The most frequent causes are tobacco, contact with wood dust and nickel. Other causes are chromium, hydrocarbons, viral and genetic causes. There may also be malignant transformation of benign inverted papilloma-type tumors. There is no evidence that chronic sinusitis predisposes to cancer.  Cervical metastases from occult tumor;/ The nodules (swellings) that appear on the neck, which do not disappear after 2 weeks, may correspond to nodes affected by tumor cells originating in the mouth, pharynx or larynx. In adults, 80% of these nodules are lymph node metastases from malignant tumors, if we exclude thyroid pathology. Hence the need to consult your ENT doctor, who will carry out an observation and a fibroscopy, and request an aspiration cytology (\u201cprick\u201d), to define the cause of the nodule.",
        "Diagnosis and Staging": "The diagnosis of head and neck tumors must be made through a careful clinical history, direct observation of the entire suspected territory or using endoscopy of the various regions during the consultation and, when necessary, carrying out laboratory and imaging tests (simple X-ray, CT or MRI) to allow clarification of the situation. When suspicion persists, a biopsy is necessary to fully clarify the situation. Only after the pathologist observes the tissue sample under a microscope can he confirm the presence of cancer cells.  Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing is a routine test for people with throat cancer. HPV-positive patients have a better prognosis for the disease, as the tumor is more sensitive to treatments and is more easily destroyed. This way, it is also possible to carry out less intense treatments with fewer side effects. Staging is the process by which we determine whether head and neck cancer cells have spread to other nearby or more distant structures. The information obtained through the staging process determines the stage of the disease, which is essential for planning treatment.  The recommended tests for staging are: Rx Torax PA;/ Clinical Pathology;/ Electrocardiogram;/ CT Head and Neck;/ CT Chest (stages III-IV);/ Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Neck (possible);/ PET (eventual);/ Endoscopy Alta (if any);/",
        "Treatment": "The treatment or combination of treatments to be carried out depends on the stage of the disease, its location and your general state of health. The main treatment for mouth or salivary gland cancer is usually surgery. Sometimes, radiotherapy or chemotherapy is also used to prevent the cancer from returning.;/  Surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy are possible approaches for people with throat cancer or nasal cavity tumors. There are also specialized treatments for oropharyngeal cancer related to the HPV virus.;/  For people with advanced disease, our experts are prepared to recommend innovative treatments such as immunotherapy and targeted therapies for head and neck tumors.

    "Brain cancer": {
        "What is it?": "The abnormal proliferation of cells that invade or compress normal tissues constitutes a tumor, thus resulting in bone, meningeal or nervous tissue tumors. Primary tumors of the Nervous System originate in cells of the nervous tissue or meninges. Secondary tumors are tumors that originate from tumors in other organs of the body that spread to the Nervous System, or to the surrounding membranes or bone. Metastases constitute the majority of tumor lesions found in the Central Nervous System.",
        "Prevention": "There are no prevention strategies for brain cancer. You should adopt healthy habits and pay attention to any symptoms.",
        "Risk Factors": "It is not yet possible to find the causes of brain cancer. However, there are genetic syndromes that can increase the risk of developing a brain tumor. Genetic syndromes associated with risk factors for the development of brain cancer are: - Neurofibromatosis type I or type II - von Hippel-Lindau disease - Tuberous sclerosis - Li-Fraumeni syndrome - Turcot syndrome type I or II - Gorlin syndrome",
        "Symptoms": "The clinical complaints and changes in the neurological examination of a patient with a tumor depend on the tumor location.  The tumor can cause cognitive complaints (disorientation and changes in reasoning or language, for example), or motor complaints (difficulties with walking and mobility or coordination of the limbs) and sensory complaints (persistent changes in sensitivity in the body), epileptic seizures, more rarely visual difficulties, headaches and repeated vomiting. It can arise in the cervical (neck), dorsal (thorax) or lumbar spinal cord. And it can be intramedullary or external to the spinal cord, compressing it. The tumor may cause persistent local pain. However, warning signs for the patient and the doctor are the development of a lack of strength and/or sensitivity in the limbs (arms and/or legs).",
        "Who should I contact?": "The hospitals in the CUF network have specialists in Neurology and Neurosurgery on their teams. The Brain Tumor Units in the North and South of the country were also established, within the scope of CUF Oncology's activities, namely in the CUF Infante Santo, CUF Descobertas and CUF Porto hospitals, to respond to more complex cases. These are multidisciplinary teams that include specialist doctors in Neurosurgery, Neuropathology, Neuroradiology, Radiotherapy, Oncology, Neuro-oncology, Onco-Psychology and Palliative Care. Count on a specialized medical evaluation service, carried out by experts in oncological diseases, with administrative support from a dedicated manager throughout the entire process.  The Central Nervous System is made up of the brain (which includes the cerebrum, cerebellum and brain stem) and spinal cord. The brain and spinal cord are bathed in a fluid, the cerebrospinal fluid, and are surrounded by membranes - the meninges. This membrane is externally protected by a covering of bone. The bones of the skull protect the brain and the spinal column protects the spinal cord. Nervous tissue is made up of two fundamental types of nerve cells: neurons, linked in a network to transmit information permanently, among themselves and to the rest of the body, and glial cells that provide them with support. The brain centralizes and controls all the capabilities of thought, language and emotions, but also the bodily functions of motor, sensory or sense organs (such as vision or hearing). The communication pathways between the brain and the body are established and ensured by the spinal cord and the nerve bundles that emerge from it and are distributed throughout the organism, which are the nerves. Meet our team of experts Make your contact request so we can follow up from the first moment. If you prefer, you can schedule an appointment via our toll-free line.",
        "Brain cancer subtypes": "Tumors that develop in the Nervous System include primary tumors and secondary malignant tumors originating from other organs. In addition to the morphological microscopic classification without further specification, complementary molecular studies are also carried out, in a selected manner, for each type of tumor, in which some important characteristics are analyzed, not only for the more specific diagnosis of that tumor, but also for establishing the prognosis of tumor evolution, allowing a more informed decision regarding the best treatment to apply. The behavior and potential aggressiveness of primary tumors of the nervous system are due, on the one hand, to the location and consequent initial damage to the nervous tissue at the site where it develops, and, on the other hand, to the risk associated with both increased damage to the nervous system and recurrence (new growth of the tumor after its complete or incomplete removal). The evolution of tumors and the reported risk depend on several factors: Anatomopathological and molecular classification of tumor type;/ Location of the tumor and possibility of surgical removal;/ Responsiveness and tumor control capacity by other complementary treatments (radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy);/",
        "Classification of Primary Tumors": "The international classification of primary tumors of the Nervous System adopted for diagnosis is that of the World Health Organization (WHO, 2016). It includes tumors originating in the meninges (meningiomas), neurons (neuronal tumors) or glial cells supporting nervous tissue (gliomas). This classification is based on the study of surgically removed tumor material and its microscopic (anatomical-pathological) analysis. Meningiomas and gliomas are the most common primary intracranial tumors. Within each of these groups there may be subgroups that are associated with different degrees of aggressiveness or malignancy, classified by microscopic analysis. There are also several intracranial tumors, which do not originate in the nervous tissue, and are specific to the affected structure, for example tumors of the cranial nerves (neurinomas) or pituitary tumors (adenomas) or tumors of the pineal gland or tumors of the bones of the skull or spine. There are around 25% of brain tumors and in 85% of cases they are benign. They are more common in people aged 60 to 80 and in\u00a0females. They originate in the meninges that surround the CNS, with symptoms associated with the place where they grow and the function of the area they compress. Some are atypical or malignant, developing more quickly Primary brain tumors originate in the CNS itself. Almost always, the primary tumors are gliomas, which grow from the cells that surround and support neurons. There are several types of Gliomas: Glioblastoma Multiforme is the most common and most aggressive type; other types may be Astrocytoma and Oligodendroglioma. -Glioblastomas: These are the most common primary brain tumors in adults (50-60%). They are more common between 60 and 70 years of age, presenting rapid and infiltrative growth of the CNS. -Astrocytomas: These are tumors that can appear in the brain, cerebellum, brain stem or spinal cord. They are of low grade malignancy (slower growing) or intermediate grade, but may over time change to a higher grade. They usually occur in young adults. -Oligodendrogliomas: These are less common gliomas, often slow growing and low malignancy, but their behavior may change over time (or be a more aggressive oligodendroglioma from the beginning). They are more frequent in the third and fourth decades of life. -Ependymomas: They are rare, originating from the cells that line the various interior brain cavities that contain Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF). They are more common in children and young people. They typically arise in the CSF cavities near the cerebellum and brainstem, or centrally in the medulla. They are the most common tumors in children and characteristically develop in the cerebellum. These are malignant tumors that can extend throughout the CNS, but with a good chance of effective treatment. Primary or secondary, lymphomas are generally malignant tumors of the body's lymph nodes and other organs that can reach the CNS, compressing it (especially the spinal cord) or infiltrating it (secondary lymphomas). There are primary lymphomas exclusive to the CNS, usually in the brain. They account for only 2% of brain tumors. They are benign but can be multiple, and in some cases they are familial tumors, associated with other cysts and tumors in the body. They are rare bone tumors that typically originate in the bones at the base of the skull or the lower end of the spine, so their growth interferes with normal CNS functioning. These are tumors that grow beneath the frontal area of \u200b\u200bthe brain, close to the pituitary gland, and can interfere with both brain and hormonal functions. They are frequently diagnosed in children, adolescents and young adults. They are also associated with problems, mainly visual and hormonal, such as weight problems, growth problems or severe diabetes. They are tumors of the pituitary gland, which produces hormones that in turn control several other body hormones such as the thyroid or adrenal gland. They can also compress and compromise vision pathways. They originate in the cranial nerves (e.g. auditory nerve) or peripheral nerves of the body. The complaints arise from its location, in the case of acoustic cranial nerve neuroma, which is the most common, hearing and balance are lost. Acoustic neurinomas at a very young age or bilaterally suggest a hereditary disease \u2013 neurofibromatosis Type II. They are more frequent than primary tumors of the nervous system. They constitute metastases (cells that spread and grow at a distance, forming new tumors) of malignant tumors in other organs of the body, and can be located in the bones of the skull or spinal column, as well as in nervous tissue, especially the brain or cerebellum. The clinical complaints they cause depend, as in the case of primary tumors of the nervous system, on the location of the metastasis. Not infrequently, and unlike what happens with primary tumors, metastases occur in more than one location simultaneously, both in the brain and outside it, in other organs and systems. They generally appear at a stage of the cancerous disease in which the initial tumor / originating in another part of the body (breast, lung, prostate, digestive tract, kidney, skin, etc.) is already known and/or is even undergoing cancer treatment.",
        "Classification of Secondary Tumors": "These are tumors of the brain, cerebellum or brain stem. The patient may present cognitive complaints (disorientation and changes in reasoning or language, for example), or motor complaints (difficulties in walking and mobility or coordination of limbs) and sensory complaints (persistent changes in sensitivity in the body), epilepsy crisis, visual difficulties, headaches and repeated vomiting. Secondary medullary tumors are more often located in the bones of the spine than in the spinal cord itself. They can appear in the cervical (neck), dorsal (chest) or lumbar region. The growth from the bone usually causes intense persistent pain in the spine followed by signs of compression and malfunction of the spinal cord. The warning signs for the patient and doctor are pain and the development of a lack of strength and/or sensitivity in the limbs (arms and/or legs). - Metastases: are secondary to malignant tumors in different parts of the body and constitute the most common tumors in the CNS. They can affect the bones of the skull or spine and trigger neurological complaints in the brain or spinal cord.\u00a0These may be due to direct growth of the metastasis within the nervous tissue, especially in the brain, or to compression, for example, of the spinal cord from bone metastases in the spine. They can be single or multiple and the treatment involves combining treatment of the body tumor and treatments aimed at the CNS.",
        "Diagnosis and Staging": "In a patient suspected of having brain cancer, tests may be ordered to diagnose the disease. To make the diagnosis, tests that examine the central nervous system are used, such as: Clinical examination and neurological examination- The neurological examination evaluates the function of the nervous system, more specifically: Cognitive functions, coordination, gait, muscle function, senses and reflexes.;/ Visual field examination to see if vision is unchanged;;/ General analysis;;/ Radiological examinations such as tomography, MRI and angiography. Spectroscopy can be performed to evaluate how certain substances that are injected are used by the tumor;;/ Nuclear Medicine exams such as SPECT and PET;;/ Biopsy - it is essential to obtain a small fragment of the lesion to be able to observe it under a microscope and make a diagnosis in relation to the type of cells and the grade of the tumor. This fragment can be obtained through biopsy or surgery.;/ There may be occasions when a biopsy is difficult due to the region where the tumor grows. In these cases, the diagnosis is made taking into account the imaging tests; however, it is desirable to always obtain a fragment for biopsy. Only observation of suspicious cells under a microscope by Pathological Anatomy can confirm the diagnosis of brain cancer. Staging is the process by which we determine whether cancer cells have spread to other structures. The information obtained through the staging process determines the stage of the disease, which is essential for planning treatment. This process is used for most cancers but not for tumors of the nervous system, as they rarely spread beyond the brain. Treatment of brain tumors is based on the following parameters: Cell type of origin;/ Anatomical location of the tumor;/ Tumor remaining after surgery;/ Grau do tumor;/",
        "Treatment": "Tumor images obtained by CT and MRI serve as a basis for making some diagnostic hypotheses according to the location of the tumor and the characteristics of the image in these exams. They are also used to plan the best surgical intervention. Surgery is almost always an important treatment tool. In addition to allowing tumor tissue to be obtained to confirm the diagnosis of the type of tumor, removing the maximum amount of tumor possible is a factor that positively influences the disease and its progression. The decision on the possibility of surgical intervention and complete or less complete removal of a tumor or biopsy depends on the location of each tumor and the corresponding risk of damage, loss of nervous tissue function and neurological deficit. In cases where the tumor is located in areas of great eloquence such as motor or language areas, preoperative MRI techniques such as functional MRI can help to better define the relationship between the location and the brain function at risk.  Functional MRI During surgery, the use of sophisticated techniques for intraoperative marking of tumor tissue with fluorescence products, or electrical stimulation of the areas to be manipulated and preserved, constitute an important resource. In selected cases of patients with tumors in areas that control language functions, surgery techniques can be used with the patient awake. The latter case involves testing the patient's capabilities during surgery while the tumor is removed. Radiotherapy after surgery is indicated in most gliomas, and in some meningiomas, again depending on the grade of the tumor and the extent of surgical excision. The radiotherapy indicated for most cases, whether cerebral, cerebellar, brain stem or spinal cord, is generally focal or stereotactic focal (for tumors too close to very vulnerable structures), divided into several sessions, directed at the tumor area and with a safety margin. Holocranial radiotherapy to the whole brain, even if in a lower dose and sparing more vulnerable structures, is used less frequently, aimed at more extensive tumors, with a high risk of dissemination through the nervous system or with multiple tumor foci. Radiosurgery (with Gamma-Knife, Cyberknife or with linear accelerator) is a form of radiotherapy with a very concentrated dose applied to a tumor focus, with very limited indications in primary CNS tumors. It is mainly recommended for selected cases of meningiomas or neurinomas, or even in some brain metastases. Chemotherapy is indicated in many gliomas, usually concomitantly or after radiotherapy, and consists of taking medications orally (taken by mouth) or by injection, administered periodically and with drugs selected according to the specific type of tumor. The type and number of chemotherapy treatments is initially planned by the neuro-oncologist according to internationally defined standards and the patient's physical condition. During chemotherapy treatments, it may be necessary to adjust the dose or intervals according to tolerance and possible undesirable effects on the patient's body.  nausea or vomiting are generally prevented or well controlled by specific medications.;/  toxic effects on the blood (e.g. anemia, reduction in white blood cells - defenses against infections - and reduction in platelets - increased risk of bleeding) are partly dependent on the doses and the accumulation of treatments, but also on the organism of each patient, and are always monitored by regular laboratory tests.;/ In rare cases of more severe (e.g. more serious infections) or unpredictable (e.g. allergies) drug complications, special treatment measures such as blood product transfusions or inpatient treatment may be necessary. Other effects such as hair loss or infertility, which may or may not be reversible (depending on the treatment), are discussed initially with the patient. During radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatments, patients of childbearing age must use contraceptive measures to avoid pregnancy, as this may be associated with a greater risk of embryo-fetal malformations in the child. Contact one of our Oncology Managers to guide you\u00a0and monitor you from the start. If you prefer, you can schedule an appointment via our toll-free line.",
        "General Care": "Patients with central nervous system tumors often need to take medications that reduce excessive inflammatory reactions and local edema (\u201cswelling\u201d in the CNS), usually corticosteroids. These are useful for improving neurological symptoms and pain. Corticosteroids can, however, have adverse effects that are tried to be minimized whenever possible. There are earlier effects, such as insomnia and agitation (which may benefit from taking the medicine earlier during the day), gastric discomfort (prevented by taking a stomach protector), possible decompensation of diabetes, body swelling and other more serious effects. which include greater vulnerability to infections, skin lesions and osteoporosis over time.  If the tumor is in the brain, it often requires taking anticonvulsant/antiepileptic medications to prevent and treat epilepsy. Of these drugs, those that have less interference with other medications, such as chemotherapy, are preferably prescribed, and it is recommended that the patient and his/her family members monitor for epileptic seizures and undesirable effects. The main adverse effects of most of these medications are drowsiness and dizziness, especially at high doses, but more rarely they can have toxic effects, for example hepatic or allergic. Pain, if any, may involve taking specific pain medications or just taking the corticosteroids mentioned above.",
        "Follow-up": "Patients who have had brain cancer may be regularly monitored in consultation by a neuro-oncologist or by a surgeon if they have had surgery, and will be asked for\u00a0exams, usually MRI.

    "Cervical cancer": {
        "What is it?": "Cervical cancer is the third most common malignancy in women worldwide and remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related death in women in developing countries.  With rare exceptions, cervical cancer results from genital infection with the Human Papillomavirus (HPV). Although HPV infections can be transmitted non-sexually, most result from sexual contact. Consequently, the main risk factors identified in epidemiological studies are the following: Onset of sexual activity at a very early age;/ Multiple sexual partners;/ Promiscuous male partners;/ History of sexually transmitted diseases;/  HIV infection, for example, is associated with a 5-fold increase in the risk of cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is generally a slow-growing tumor and is preceded by cellular changes called dysplasias, in which altered cells begin to appear in the cervix.",
        "Prevention": "Primary Prevention: Introduction of prophylactic vaccination against HPV, within the scope of the National Vaccination Plan (PNV) in 2007. Our country has one of the best vaccination coverage rates in Europe and even in the world, around 87%. Secondary prevention: Carrying out a cervical screening test. Conventional cytology, liquid cytology and the HPV test or a combination of the latter two can be used as screening methods. Recognition of the etiological role of HPV infection in cervical cancer has led to the recommendation to add HPV testing to the screening regimen in women 30 to 65 years of age. However, women who have symptoms, abnormal screening test results, or a macroscopic lesion of the cervix are best evaluated with colposcopy and biopsy. There are two types of screening: -Organized Screening \u2013 It is a population-based screening -Opportunistic Tracking \u2013 So called because it is the performance of the screening within the scope of a consultation and without a defined frequency  Screening Recommendations: Based on guidelines from the American Cancer Society (ACS), the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP), the American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP), the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the recommendations are as follows: < 21 years: Screening is not recommended;/ 21-29 years: Cytology (Pap smear) every 3 years;/ 30-65 years: Human Papillomavirus (HPV) testing and cytology every 5 years (preferred) or cytology only every 3 years (acceptable);/ 65 years: Screening is not recommended if a previous adequate screening has been negative, and no risk factors are present.;/",
        "Risk Factors": "Any behavior or condition that increases your risk of having a disease is a risk factor. If one or more risk factors apply to you, it does not mean that you will necessarily develop cervical cancer. Likewise, cervical cancer can appear in women who have no known risk factors.  It has not yet been possible to find the causes of cervical cancer, but some risk factors are known. The main risk factors are the following: Human papilloma virus (HPV) infection is the biggest risk factor for cervical cancer. The presence of this infection is highly correlated with changes in the cells of the cervix, which could lead to cancer or other complications. HPV is transmitted through sexual contact with an infected partner. HPV infections are very common, and the vast majority of the adult population will have been infected throughout their lives.;/ Not all HPV subtypes cause cancer, the most dangerous are 16 and 18. The Pap test is essential to detect this infection and the presence of abnormal cells in the cervix. There is a vaccine that protects women from HPV subtypes 16 and 18 and is being administered to young people before they begin sexual activity. It can also be administered to women who have already started, but this should be discussed with your gynecologist.  Have many children;/  Having many sexual partners \u2013 the risk increases if sexual partners have had equally many sexual partners;/  Having started sexual activity early;/  Smoking \u2013 women who smoke with HPV have a higher risk of developing the disease;/  Age \u2013 with advancing age, the risk of developing cervical cancer increases, particularly from the age of 40;/  Taking the Pill for long periods of time: In women with HPV, taking the Pill for 5 years or more may increase the risk of developing cervical cancer;/",
        "Symptoms": "The symptoms of cervical cancer are not exclusive, they can appear in other diseases. Just because you have one or more of the symptoms described here does not mean you have cervical cancer. In general, this type of cancer does not cause symptoms when diagnosed at an early stage, which is why screening for the disease is carried out. However, you should be alert and consult your doctor if you experience the following symptoms: Vaginal bleeding;/ Abnormal vaginal discharge;/ Pelvic pain;/ Pain during sexual intercourse;/",
        "Who should I contact?": "If you suspect cancer, due to symptoms or a complementary diagnostic test that presents an alteration, you should always seek an Oncological Gynecologist. He will carry out a first clinical and imaging assessment, and will forward your case for discussion in a multidisciplinary team, which carries out a personalized assessment, and which will propose the best therapeutic option for each case. Meet our team of experts Make your contact request so we can follow up from the first moment. If you prefer, you can schedule an appointment via our toll-free line. The most common form of cervical cancer is squamous cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, epidermoid carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma. Other rarer types of the disease are adenocarcinoma or small cell carcinoma of the cervix.  Cancer cells may appear only within the epithelium, without invasion beyond the superficial lining, which is called cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) with different degrees of severity according to the shape and size of the cells under the microscope.  In most cases, atypical cells detected on a Pap smear are not cancerous. However, over time and without treatment, atypical cells can develop into cancerous cells: -Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL): these are changes seen in the cells on the surface of the cervix, normally caused by HPV infections (human papilloma virus). In most cases, these lesions disappear on their own over time, even without treatment. However, they can sometimes develop into a high-grade lesion (HSIL), increasing the risk of degenerating into cervical cancer. Its incidence is higher in young women;  -High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL): although not considered cancer, these lesions can develop into cervical cancer if left untreated. Pre-cancerous cells are only on the surface of the cervix, so treatment at this stage is essential.",
        "Diagnosis and Treatment": "If a woman has symptoms or has a Pap test result that identifies the presence of pre-malignant cells or cancer, the doctor will use the following tests to obtain a diagnosis: Colposcopy: the doctor uses equipment \u2013 \u200b\u200ba colposcope \u2013 that allows you to view the cervix, obtaining enlarged images of it.;/ Biopsy: the doctor performs local anesthesia and collects tissue samples.;/ There are several types of biopsy: -Endocervical curettage: the doctor uses an instrument - the curette - to scrape a sample of tissue from the cervical canal. Alternatively, a soft brush can be used instead of the curette; -Punch biopsy: the doctor uses a hollow, sharp device to collect small samples of cervical tissue; -LEEP: the doctor uses an electrode that, through low voltage and high frequency electrical energy, allows a small fraction of tissue to be cut; - Cone biopsy or conization: the doctor collects a cone-shaped tissue sample, allowing the Pathological Anatomy to analyze the existence of atypical cells in the tissue below the surface of the cervix. Cone biopsy can also be used to remove a pre-cancerous lesion. Only observation under a microscope by Pathological Anatomy of the cells collected through biopsy can confirm the diagnosis of cervical cancer. Staging is the process by which we make sure whether cancer cells have spread from the cervix to other nearby or more distant structures. The information obtained through the staging process determines the stage of the disease, which is essential for treatment planning. If the biopsy diagnoses cervical cancer, staging must be done through clinical observation and imaging tests such as pelvic MRI, computed tomography and ultrasound. Based on the tests performed, the staging of cervical cancer can be classified as follows: Stage I - Carcinoma limited to the cervix;/ IA- Preclinical carcinoma (histological diagnosis only) IA1- Stromal invasion \u2264 3 mm in depth and \u2264 7 mm in extensionIA2- Stromal invasion > 3 mm and \u2264 5 mm in depth and \u2264 7 mm in extension. IB- Clinical lesions limited to the neck or preclinical with dimensions greater than stage IA.IB1- Clinically visible carcinoma measuring \u2264 4cm IB2- Clinically visible carcinoma > 4cm Stage II-Carcinoma extends beyond the colon,;/ but does not reach the pelvic wall, nor the lower 1/3 of the vagina IIA- Tumor involves up to the upper 2/3 of the vagina, without obvious infiltration of the parametrium IIA1- Clinically visible carcinoma \u2264 4cm, without parametrium involvement IIA2- Clinically visible carcinoma > 4cm, without parametrium involvement IIB- Carcinoma infiltrates the parametrium, without reaching the pelvic wall Stage III-Carcinoma extends to the pelvic wall and/or invades the lower 1/3 of the vagina, and/or hydronephrosis or non-functioning kidney (unless another cause is known);/ IIIA- Invasion of the lower 1/3 of the vagina, without reaching the pelvic wall IIIB- Extension to the pelvic wall, and/or hydronephrosis, and/or non-functioning kidney Stage IV \u2013 Carcinoma extends beyond the pelvis, and/or invades the mucosa of the bladder and/or rectum;/ IVA- The tumor invades the mucosa of the bladder and/or rectum IVB- Distant metastases",
        "Treatment": "Stadium 0 (in Situ): Carcinoma in situ is treated with local ablative or excisional measures, such as cryosurgery, laser ablation, laser conization and diathermic loop excision. Excision is preferred as it allows further pathologic evaluation to rule out microinvasive disease. After treatment, these patients require lifelong surveillance. IA1 Stadium The treatment of choice for stage IA1 disease is surgery. Total hysterectomy, radical hysterectomy, and conization are accepted procedures. Lymphadenectomy (removal of lymph nodes) is not necessary if the depth of invasion is less than 3 mm and there is no lymphovascular invasion. Selected patients with stage IA1 disease, without invasion of the lymphovascular space, who wish to maintain fertility, can be treated by conization, but with strict monitoring, including cytology, colposcopy and endocervical curettage.  Internship IA2, IB or IIA For patients with stage IB or IIA disease, there are two treatment options: External radiotherapy combined with brachytherapy Chemoradiotherapy Radical hysterectomy with bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy Radical trachelectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy may be indicated for fertility preservation in women with stage IA2 and stage IB1 disease whose lesions are \u2264 2 cm. The main problems with pregnancy after trachelectomy are premature labor and the need to undergo a cesarean section for delivery.   Stage IIB, III or IVA The results of well-conducted prospective randomized clinical trials have demonstrated a dramatic improvement in survival when chemotherapy is combined with radiation therapy. Consequently, the use of cisplatin-based chemotherapy in combination with radiation has become the standard of care for patients with locally advanced cervical cancer. There are two types of radiotherapy treatment for cervical cancer: - External radiation: radiation is administered through a large device that focuses the radiation beam on the area to be treated with high precision. In most cases, women undergo 5 sessions per week, for 5 to 7 weeks, without needing to be hospitalized; - Intracavitary radiotherapy: radiation is administered by placing implants containing a radioactive substance in the vagina; the treatment may last just a few hours or up to 3 days, after which the implants are removed; this type of treatment requires the woman to be admitted to hospital and protective measures are taken to prevent other people from being unduly exposed to radiation. It may be necessary to repeat the treatment, which may be carried out two or more times over a period of several weeks. The goal of cervical cancer surgery is to remove all cancer cells. This may include Conization (removal of a cone from the cervix), Hysterectomy (in which the uterus and cervix are completely removed), or a Trachelectomy (which partially removes the cervix but retains the body of the uterus). During cervical cancer surgery, some lymph nodes in the pelvis may also be removed. Chemoradiotherapy Chemoradiotherapy is a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Chemotherapy destroys cancer cells, and radiation therapy uses ionizing radiation to damage the DNA of cancer cells, causing them to die. Chemoradiotherapy for cervical cancer involves giving external beam radiotherapy and/or internal radiotherapy (brachytherapy) at the same time as a course of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy may be used to treat some patients with locally advanced cervical cancer or as palliative treatment for metastatic disease. Radiotherapy can be used in cervical carcinoma as a definitive (single) treatment with the aim of eradicating the tumor, or as an adjuvant treatment (after a surgical intervention), in association or not with Chemotherapy. In selected cases there may be an indication to complete treatments using Intra-cavity Brachytherapy. The most used technique is Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy or Arc Therapy (IMRT/VMAT), which allows the radiation beam to be shaped and healthy tissues to be spared, thus reducing treatment toxicities. Targeted therapies are drugs that block specific cancer cell signaling pathways that encourage them to grow. The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor bevacizumab prevents tumors from stimulating the growth of blood vessels, depriving them of the oxygen and nutrients they need to continue growing. Cervical cancer treatment varies depending on the stage of the disease. For early invasive cancer, surgery is the treatment of choice. In more advanced cases, radiation combined with chemotherapy is the current standard of care. In patients with disseminated disease, chemotherapy or radiation therapy provides palliation of symptoms. Cervical cancer treatment requires a multidisciplinary approach. CUF's multidisciplinary team encompasses Gynecological Oncology, Medical Oncology, Radiotherapy, Anatomy-Pathology and Imaging. Because cervical cancer often affects women of childbearing age, fertility-preserving surgery is an important option to consider. Women who wish to preserve their fertility and have stage IA1 cervical cancer without lymphovascular invasion may be treated with conization or simple trachelectomy. In stage IA2, they may undergo conization or radical trachelectomy (in which most of the cervix is \u200b\u200bremoved along with the upper part of the vagina) with excision of the pelvic lymph nodes (pelvic lymphadenectomy). Stage IB1 cancers <2 cm in size can be treated with radical trachelectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy, while stage IB1 tumors >2 cm in size may require presurgical (neoadjuvant) treatment with chemotherapy before surgery. It is important to understand that fertility-sparing surgery for early-stage cervical cancer remains an experimental treatment; your doctor will explain in detail the pros and cons of the available options. Fertility preservation surgery is only offered to women who express a strong desire to become pregnant; if your desire to have children has already been fulfilled, radical surgery is considered the best treatment option. After finishing treatment, your doctor will schedule follow-up appointments. During these consultations, a clinical examination will be carried out, which will include an examination of the pelvic and rectal areas. Imaging tests such as a CT scan or pelvic MRI or PET/Scan may be requested. Even if you have received the best treatment available at the time of diagnosis, there is always a chance that the cancer will come back. This condition, called recurrence, occurs most often in the first few years after treatment, so a typical follow-up program includes visits every 3\u20136 months for the first 2 years after treatment, then every 6\u201312 months after 3 years, and annually after 5 years. In case of recurrence, the treatment that will be proposed will depend on the extent of the recurrence and the type of treatment already carried out. When the tumor appears as a recurrence in a single location in the pelvis after primary surgery, radiotherapy or pelvic exenteration (removal of the bladder, part of the intestine, ovaries, uterus, cervix and vagina) may be used.

    "Colon and rectal cancer": {
        "What is it?": "Colon cancer and rectal cancer are two of the most common types of cancer in men and women. Cancer that starts in the colon is called colon cancer and cancer that starts in the rectum is called rectal cancer. Cancer that affects any of these organs can also be called colorectal cancer. The difference between the colon and rectum lies in the anatomical location and the need for different treatment, however, the tumor biology is the same.  Colon and rectal cancer often begins in a polyp, which is an anomalous growth of epithelial tissue in the wall of the intestine. Not all polyps turn into cancer. Polyps can be removed before they become malignant. If malignant cells are identified in the removed polyp but do not invade other layers of the organ, the patient may be cured. When polyps are not removed and transform into cancer, the tumor cells can invade the various layers of the organ and spread throughout the body. This process is called metastasis. The colon and rectum, known as the large intestine, are part of the digestive tract. The colon measures approximately 1.5 meters and is made up of 5 parts: ascending, transverse, descending, sigmoid and rectum colon. The colon wall has 5 layers. The innermost layer that comes into contact with feces is called the mucosa. Mucosa has three types of tissue: epithelial, connective and muscular. The next layer is the submucosa, which has connective tissue and vessels. The third layer is muscular, the fourth is subserous and is made up of connective tissue, and the fifth is aserous.",
        "Prevention": "Preventing colorectal cancer fundamentally involves adopting healthy habits and carrying out tests for the early detection of polyps or lesions in the colon and rectum. According to international recommendations, early diagnosis should begin from the age of 50. However, the right time depends on each person's individual risk of developing the disease, so your doctor should evaluate your specific case and determine when to start this routine. Three types of tests are normally used for the early diagnosis of cancer. of the colon and rectum: Total colonoscopy - this is the most complete exam as it allows you to view the entire rectum and colon; colonoscopy consists of introducing a tube through the anus \u2013 a colonoscope \u2013 which allows the doctor to see inside and look for polyps and possible lesions; if polyps are detected, the doctor will perform a\u00a0polypectomy, that is, remove the polyps found for later analysis;;/ Flexible sigmoidoscopy \u2013 this examination only visualizes the rectum and the lower part of the colon, i.e. the sigmoid colon; it involves inserting a tube through the anus \u2013 a sigmoidoscope \u2013 which allows the doctor to see inside and look for polyps and any lesions; if polyps are detected, they are removed for later analysis, as in a total colonoscopy;;/ Fecal occult blood test \u2013 it is an indirect test to find signs of cancer and not the lesion itself; Polyps can bleed, so the presence of blood can be an important indicator and if found, a colonoscopy should be performed. However, other benign pathologies, such as hemorrhoids, may be the cause of the presence of blood.;/ There are other complementary tests for the early diagnosis of colorectal cancer, such as barium enema and CT colonography.",
        "Symptoms": "The symptoms of colon and rectal cancer are not exclusive, they can appear in other diseases. Just because you have one or more of the symptoms described here does not mean you have colon and rectal cancer.  You should be alert and consult your doctor if you have the following symptoms: - Diarrhea or constipation - Feeling that the intestines are not completely empty after having a bowel movement - Blood in the stool - Stools of different consistency - Pain or discomfort from cramps, feeling bloated or gassy - Sudden weight loss for no apparent reason - Extreme fatigue without any apparent cause - Nausea or vomiting",
        "Risk factors": "If one or more risk factors apply to you, it does not mean that you will necessarily develop colon and rectal cancer. Likewise, colon and rectal cancer can appear in individuals who have no known risk factors. It has not yet been possible to find the causes for colon and rectal cancer, but some risk factors are known.  The main risk factors are the following: -\u00a0Age- The risk of colon and rectal cancer increases with age. About 90% of cancer patients are over 50 years old. The average age of diagnosis for colon and rectal cancer is 72 years. - Colon polyps- Not all polyps are the same. They all grow from the mucosa, but differ in size, shape and appearance. The chance of having or developing cancer in a polyp depends on the type of polyp. The three types are: Hyperplastic polyps- These have rapidly growing cells, appear at the end of the colon and rarely contain or develop cancer;;/ Adenomatous polyps or adenomas- They have cells that look different from normal colon cells and are the most common. Most do not contain or develop\u00a0cancer, but most\u00a0cancer polyps begin as adenomas. Your risk of developing cancer in adenomas is high if you have more than 3 adenomas, if they are larger than 4 cm and/or if they look like a cauliflower (villous adenoma);;/ Inflammatory polyps - These rarely have or develop cancer and appear in the context of inflammatory bowel diseases.;/ -Inflammatory bowel disease- Patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease have a higher risk of colon or rectal cancer. -Personal history of cancer- A patient who has had colon or rectal cancer, even if they do not show any evidence of disease, has a greater risk of having the disease again. There are other cancers linked to colon and rectal cancer, related to a genetic syndrome, which are cancers of the uterus, pancreas and ovary. -Family history-If a first or second degree relative had this type of cancer, your risk is greater for having this disease. The risk is higher if several family members have had colon and rectal cancer, and if they had the disease at a young age. -Lynch Syndrome-\u00a0Two out of every 100 patients with colon and rectal cancer have Lynch Syndrome. The average age of colon and rectal cancer in these patients is 44 years. This syndrome is also known as hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer, in order to distinguish it from colon cancer in familial adenomatosis polyposis. Familial adenomatous polyposis is rare, patients have cancer at age 40, and represents only 1% of colon cancer cases. During colonoscopy in these patients, hundreds of polyps can be seen. -Diet- Some studies suggest that a diet poor in fruits and vegetables, calcium and fiber, and rich in fat, may constitute a risk factor, although this is not unequivocally established. -Smoking- Tobacco consumption is considered a risk factor, as it increases the likelihood of developing polyps in the intestine.",
        "Who should I contact?": "If you suspect cancer, due to symptoms or a complementary diagnostic test that presents an alteration, you should go to a Gastroenterologist, a General Surgeon or alternatively, less commonly, an Oncologist.  If you need help you can also contact one of our oncology managers.  The\u00a0CUF\u00a0Lisbon Hospitals (Hospital\u00a0CUF\u00a0Descobertas and Hospital\u00a0CUF\u00a0Tejo) are recognized by the Ministry of Health as a Reference Center for the treatment of rectal cancer. These centers are considered to be highly differentiated and high-quality entities for the treatment of certain diseases or more complex procedures. The Rectal Cancer Reference Center is managed by the Colorectal Cancer Unit of CUF Oncology. A pathology unit, made up of a multidisciplinary team specialized in malignant tumors of the colon and rectum.

Colorectal cancer is almost always adenocarcinoma, that is, a carcinoma originating in the glandular epithelium of the colon, and division into subtypes has not been carried out.",
        "Diagnosis and Staging": "In a patient with a clinical history and clinical examination with suspected colon and rectal cancer, some tests should be requested to confirm or rule out this suspicion. In addition to colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy, additional tests such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging may also be requested. However, the effective diagnosis of colon and rectal cancer is only possible by analyzing under a microscope, through Pathological Anatomy, polyps or samples of lesions resulting from their collection through colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy. Staging is the process by which we assess whether cancer cells have spread from the colon or rectum to other nearby or more distant structures. The information obtained through the staging process determines the stage of the disease, which is essential for planning treatment. Tests to stage colon and rectal cancer may include: total colonoscopy \u2013 if it was not carried out during the diagnosis phase; is performed to detect signs of other synchronous cancer(s) throughout the organ;;/ CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis \u2013 allows you to check whether the cancer has metastasized to the liver, lungs or other organs.;/ MRI of the rectum (for rectal cancer): allows the depth of the cancer to be assessed in the different layers of the rectal wall, and whether or not the lymph nodes in the vicinity of the rectum have already been invaded by the cancer.;/ endorectal ultrasound (for rectal cancer) \u2013 consists of introducing a probe through the anus and allows, if necessary, to complement the rectal MRI information: assess the depth of the cancer in the different layers of the rectal wall, and the status of the local lymph nodes -regional.;/ Sometimes, it is only possible to conclude the local staging of the disease unequivocally after surgery to remove the tumor and detailed analysis of it by Pathological Anatomy.  Based on the diagnostic tests performed, staging allows colon or rectal cancer to be classified as follows: Stage 0 \u2013 The cancer has not spread beyond the basement membrane, and is considered in situ, that is, it is confined to its site and has not invaded nearby tissues (in fact, it does not yet meet the criteria for \u201cmalignancy\u201d); Stage I \u2013 The cancer has invaded the submucosa or muscularis; Stage II\u2013\u00a0The cancer has invaded the serosa or organs neighboring the colon; Stage III- The cancer has invaded surrounding lymph nodes of the colon; Stage IV \u2013 Cancer has metastasized to distant organs Bearing in mind the importance of a quick and accurate diagnosis for the timely start of treatments, CUF Oncologia has organized a rapid response in the event of a strong suspicion of colorectal cancer.",
        "Treatment": "The multidisciplinary clinical team will decide the best treatment to follow, after an individual assessment of each case. However, in general, the recommendations for each stage are: Stage 0 and I\u2013 in these stages the treatment option is generally\u00a0surgery; Stage II \u2013 at this stage the treatment option is generally surgery, and systemic therapy (chemotherapy) may be applied in addition to surgery; in the case of rectal cancer, radiotherapy may also be indicated; Stage III \u2013 therapeutic options include surgery and chemotherapy; in the case of rectal cancer, radiotherapy may also be indicated; Stage IV \u2013 at this stage, treatment is very variable, with therapeutic plans being completely individualized. Surgical procedures for treating colon and rectal cancer can be: -laparoscopic surgery- consists of the introduction of a laparoscope and surgical instruments through small cuts in the abdomen (between 5 and 10 mm), allowing to reduce the trauma of the entire intervention, with numerous advantages for the patient, both from the point of view of recovery whether from the point of view of oncological control (due to less aggression to the defense/immune system); the part of the colon or rectum that contains the cancer and any affected lymph nodes are removed; Sometimes, other organs, or parts thereof, may also be\u00a0removed if they contain branches (metastases) of the cancer (for example, a part of the liver). -robotic surgery \u2013 similar to laparoscopic surgery, with the advantage of increasing the surgeon\u2019s precision and safety; This translates, especially in the case of rectal cancer, into fewer post-surgical sequelae: less anal and urinary incontinence, less sexual dysfunction and less need for permanent ostomies (that is, less need to place a \u201cbag\u201d on the belly to evacuate ); at the same time, the control of oncological disease appears to be better (i.e., a greater probability of curing cancer). -open surgery \u2013 a more or less long incision is made in the abdomen to access the abdominal cavity; it is used for the same purpose as laparoscopic surgery or robotic surgery; it is more aggressive and seems to result in more after-effects but is sometimes still necessary. When surgery to treat cancer involves removing part of the colon or rectum, whenever possible the surgeon connects the normal parts of the intestine to ensure normal intestinal transit. When this situation is not possible, the surgeon will perform a colostomy. A\u00a0colostomy\u00a0is a surgical procedure that consists of creating an opening in the abdominal wall \u2013 a stoma \u2013 connecting the upper part of the intestine to the outside, placing an outer bag to collect the feces that are expelled by the body through this opening . Typically, a colostomy is only necessary until surgical healing of the colon or rectum is complete, after which the surgeon reconnects the intestine and closes the stoma. However, in some cases, a colostomy may be necessary permanently, particularly in certain cases of rectal cancer very close to the anus; Fortunately, and thanks to currently available technology, this situation is increasingly rare. Radiotherapy in colorectal carcinoma is generally used with the aim of reducing the risk of local recurrence. It is usually indicated as neo-adjuvant treatment (before surgical intervention) in association with Chemotherapy, with the aim of tumor reduction and reducing the likelihood of definitive colostomy. Around 15 to 20% of tumors show a complete response, and active surveillance in these cases can be considered in the context of a clinical trial. Patients who have had colon or rectal cancer should be monitored by an oncologist, gastroenterologist or surgeon. Monitoring may include control colosnoscopy, CEA marker, Computed Tomography, among others.

    "Esophageal cancer": {
        "What is it?": "Esophageal cancer is one of the types of cancer of the digestive system. The epithelial cells of the esophagus are responsible for the formation of the mucosal tissue of the esophagus. In their normal state, these cells grow and divide into new cells, which are formed as they are needed; this process is called cell regeneration.  When cells lose their control mechanism and undergo changes in their genome (DNA), they become cancer cells, which do not die when they age or are damaged, and produce new cells that are not needed in an uncontrolled manner, resulting in the formation of cancer.  Unlike normal cells, esophageal cancer cells do not respect the organ's borders, invading surrounding tissues and can spread to other parts of the body. This process is called metastasis.",
        "Prevention": "There are no prevention or screening strategies for esophageal cancer.",
        "Risk factors": "Any behavior or condition that increases your risk of developing a disease is a risk factor. Just because one or more risk factors apply to you, it does not necessarily mean that you will develop esophageal cancer. Likewise, esophageal cancer can occur in people who have no known risk factors.  The causes of esophageal cancer have not yet been determined, but some risk factors are known. The main risk factors are:  Excessive alcohol consumption- consuming more than 3 alcoholic drinks per day increases the risk of developing squamous esophageal cancer. Combining excess alcohol with tobacco considerably increases the risk.;/  Smoking;/  Gastric reflux \u2013 very common, gastric reflux is the abnormal movement of acid from the stomach into the esophagus and can cause burning. The acid can damage the tissues of the esophagus, so prolonged gastric reflux over time (years) can lead to the development of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.;/  Barrett's esophagus - This premalignant condition involves the transformation of the glandular epithelium at the end of the esophagus into a different epithelium that is more similar to that of the intestine. The cells in this epithelium are more likely to transform into cancer cells. Gastric reflux can cause Barrett's esophagus and most people are unaware that they have it. The combination of gastric reflux and Barrett's esophagus is a greater risk factor than gastric reflux alone.;/  Age \u2013 is the main risk factor for esophageal cancer. The incidence points to the diagnosis of the disease around the 6th and 7th decade of life.;/  Being male \u2013 men have 3 times more risk of developing esophageal cancer than women.;/  Being of black race;/  Obesity;/",
        "Symptoms": "Esophageal cancer symptoms are not exclusive, they can appear in other diseases. Just because you have one or more of the symptoms described here does not mean you have esophageal cancer.  You should be alert and consult your doctor if you have the following symptoms: Pain or difficulty swallowing;/ Weight loss;/ Food regurgitation;/ Chest or back pain;/ Prolonged cough and/or hoarseness;/ Indigestion;/ Burning sensation (heartburn);/",

Meet our team of experts Make your contact request so we can follow up from the first moment. If you prefer, you can schedule an appointment via our toll-free line. There are two types of esophageal cancer that account for 98% of all cases, both diagnosed and treated in the same way:  Squamous, squamous cell, epidermoid, spinocellular or squamous cell carcinoma in which the cells originate from the stratified epithelium, this disease is more frequent in the cervical and thoracic anatomical parts;  Adenocarcinoma is a cancer of the esophagus that originates in the epithelial cells of a glandular layer in the abdominal part of the esophagus, next to the stomach.  However, the epidemiology is different. In the last 30 years there has been a change in the dominant histological type between squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, which is currently more frequent. The incidence of esophageal cancer increases with age, and on average, adenocarcinoma preferentially affects the age group of 50 to 60 years, on average 10 years earlier than squamous cell carcinoma.  In the Western world, the incidence by sex is also different between the two types of esophageal cancer, with squamous cell carcinoma being 3 to 4 times more frequent in males, while adenocarcinoma has an even higher incidence, being around 6 to 8 times more frequent in men.",
        "Diagnosis and Staging": "In a patient suspected of having esophageal cancer, tests may be requested to diagnose the disease. In a patient with a clinical history suspected of esophageal cancer, an upper digestive endoscopy should be performed. This procedure consists of introducing an illuminated tube \u2013 endoscope \u2013 through the patient's mouth or nose using local anesthesia. If the doctor finds a suspicious lesion, he will simultaneously perform a biopsy, that is, a tissue collection for later analysis. Only observation of suspicious cells under a microscope by Pathological Anatomy can confirm the diagnosis of esophageal cancer. Staging is the process by which we determine whether cancer cells have spread from the esophagus to other nearby or more distant structures. The information obtained through the staging process determines the stage of the disease, which is essential for planning treatment. Once the diagnosis of esophageal cancer is confirmed, the next step is to stage it. Oesophageal cancer, due to the nature of the organ's location in the thoracic cavity close to several important structures, such as the trachea, bronchi, heart and large vessels, requires a complex staging process, with the following tests being carried out: Bronchoscopy - This procedure consists of introducing a tube with a camera through the trachea and bronchi, similar to an upper digestive endoscopy. Biopsies of suspicious lesions may be necessary, possible by inserting a needle through the microscope;;/ Computerized Axial Tomography and/or Magnetic Resonance Imaging;;/ Echoendoscopy - this examination consists of introducing a tube - endoscope - through the throat with an ultrasound probe at its end, which allows the extension of the tumor in the esophageal wall to be assessed by emitting ultrasound; if an injury is suspected, the doctor may collect tissue for analysis by inserting a needle into the endoscope;;/ PET scan - is an exam in which sugar molecules are injected into the bloodstream and the presence of cancer and metastases is detected using equipment; as cancer cells are greedy for sugar, they absorb these molecules more frequently than normal cells, allowing their location to be identified using this technique;;/ Thoracoscopy or laparoscopy are surgical procedures under general anesthesia in which cannulas with cameras - laparoscope - are inserted into the cavities through small cuts, allowing the organs to be observed to identify the presence of cancer; the doctor may collect tissue for later analysis;;/ Bone scintigraphy \u2013 to identify the presence of metastases in the bones.;/  Often the staging of the disease is only complete after the treatment surgery, through microscopic analysis by Pathological Anatomy, of the esophagus, lymph nodes and other tissues collected during surgery.  Based on the diagnostic tests performed, the staging of esophageal cancer can be classified as follows: Stage 0 \u2013 The cancer is in situ, that is, it is confined to its site, found only in the epithelium of the esophagus; Stage I \u2013 In this stage the cancer has reached the submucosa; Stage II \u2013 At this stage, the cancer has reached the submucosa and invaded 1 to 2 lymph nodes, or the cancer has invaded the muscular layer and may have invaded the lymph nodes, or even invaded the serous layer of the esophagus; Stage III \u2013 Esophageal cancer may have invaded 3 or more lymph nodes, affecting the serous layer or neighboring organs such as the aorta, trachea or spine; Stage IV- The cancer has spread to distant organs, such as the liver.",
        "Treatment": "Taking into account the staging of esophageal cancer, the multidisciplinary clinical team will assess the best treatment to follow. Options may include surgery, radiation treatment, and chemotherapy. Stage I \u2013 in this stage the treatment option is surgery; radiotherapy and chemotherapy are occasionally used; Stage II \u2013 The treatment option is radiotherapy and chemotherapy; surgery is assessed on a case-by-case basis and may eventually be used; Stage III \u2013 Treatment options include surgery and radiation therapy; Stage IV \u2013 In this stage, treatment options include chemotherapy and possibly radiation therapy. The surgical procedure used is esophagectomy, which consists of the removal of the esophagus, totally or partially, and which may involve the removal of lymph nodes and also the partial or total removal of the stomach. It is a complex surgery and there are several techniques to perform it. If an esophagectomy has been proposed, you should discuss this procedure with your doctor. Radiotherapy is used in esophageal carcinoma as definitive treatment, in order to eradicate the tumor, or as neo-adjuvant treatment (before surgical intervention). It is usually prescribed in combination with chemotherapy, in order to allow the greatest possible tumor reduction, enabling surgery with fewer risks.  Patients who have had esophageal cancer may be regularly monitored in consultation by the oncologist or by the surgeon if they have undergone surgery. In addition to the physical examination and blood tests, imaging tests such as tomography, x-ray and even upper digestive endoscopy may be requested.

        "What is it?": "Stomach cancer is one of the types of cancer of the digestive system. The epithelial cells of the stomach are responsible for the constitution of the epithelial tissue of the stomach, the mucosa. In their normal state, these cells grow and divide into new cells, which are formed as they are needed; this process is called cell regeneration.

Stomach cancer usually starts in the cells of the inner lining of the stomach. Over time, the cancer can invade the stomach wall and spread to the outer lining, where it can invade organs such as the liver, esophagus, intestine, and nearby lymph nodes.",
        "Prevention": "Preventing stomach cancer involves practicing healthy habits, such as maintaining a balanced diet, rich in fish, poultry, fruits and vegetables, and free from smoked, salted or preserved foods in vinegar, as well as fatty meats and their derivatives. It also involves giving up tobacco and alcohol consumption, and doing regular exercise to control your weight. There are no established practices for early diagnosis of stomach cancer.",
        "Risk Factors": "Any behavior or condition that increases your risk of developing a disease is a risk factor. Although you may have one or more of the following risk factors for stomach cancer, it does not mean that you will develop the disease. On the other hand, the opposite also applies, that is, if you do not have any risk factors for stomach cancer, it does not mean that you cannot develop this disease. For stomach cancer, the most common are: Helicobacter Pylori infection \u2013 although evidence does not indicate that stomach ulcers are a risk factor for stomach cancer in themselves, some studies suggest that the bacteria Helicobacter pylori \u2013 which causes inflammation (gastritis) and stomach ulcers \u2013 constitutes an important risk factor for the development of stomach cancer;/  Inflammation of the stomach, chronic gastritis, especially atrophic gastritis (associated with a type of anemia called pernicious);/  Change in the epithelium of the stomach to an epithelium similar to that of the intestine, called intestinal metaplasia;/  Presence of stomach polyps, either in the context of familial polyposis or as an isolated event.

Stomach cancers can be of several types: -Adenocarcinoma- is the most common stomach cancer, accounting for around 95% of the total. In this type of cancer, the cells originate from the epithelium; -Stomach lymphoma- originates in lymphoid tissue cells, white blood cells in the stomach; -Gastrointestinal stromal sarcoma (GIST) - cancer of the tissues of the stomach wall that are neither epithelium nor muscle. It is a tumor of the connective tissue.  Adenocarcinomas of the stomach can present in the following subtypes: - Intestinal: Intestinal-type gastric adenocarcinomas are similar to the glandular epithelium of the intestine, hence they are sometimes indicated as \u201cwell differentiated\u201d or \u201cmoderately differentiated\u201d in the Pathological Anatomy report. The Pathological Anatomy report may include words such as tubular, papillary or mucous (mucus producing); - Diffuse: These stomach adenocarcinomas do not look like glands, therefore they can be described in the pathological anatomy report with the word \u201cundifferentiated\u201d associated with the diagnosis. These tumors may not form a rounded lesion in the gastric mucosa but have the appearance of diffuse infiltration of the stomach wall, which is called linitis plastica.",
        "Diagnosis and Staging": "In a patient with a clinical history and clinical examination suggestive of stomach cancer, some tests should be requested to confirm or rule out this suspicion. To diagnose stomach cancer, the following tests are usually performed: Physical examination: Your doctor will examine your abdomen for fluid, swelling, or other changes, and will also check for enlarged lymph nodes.;/  Testing for occult blood in the stool: stomach cancer can cause bleeding, although other benign pathologies can also cause blood in the stool, such as hemorrhoids. Testing for occult blood in the stool can detect the presence of bleeding, and if confirmed, additional tests are necessary to find its origin.;/  Upper digestive endoscopy: this is an examination of the stomach and esophagus that involves inserting a thin, illuminated tube \u2013 a gastroscope \u2013 through the mouth, passing through the esophagus to the stomach.;/  If the doctor detects the presence of any suspicious changes in the stomach through the gastroscope images, he or she will collect tissue for analysis, that is, perform a gastric biopsy. After collecting the suspicious tissues, they are sent to the Pathological Anatomy laboratory to be analyzed under a microscope and check for the presence of cancer cells.;/ Only a stomach biopsy observed under a microscope by Pathological Anatomy allows the diagnosis of stomach cancer. Staging is the process by which we assess whether cancer cells have spread from the stomach to other nearby or more distant structures. The information obtained through the staging process determines the stage of the disease, which is essential for planning treatment. In the case of stomach cancer, the following may be requested: Imaging exams such as CT scan;;/ Endoscopic exams such as echoendoscopy (exam that consists of an ultrasound performed inside the gastric cavity through a gastroscope);;/ Surgical tests such as laparoscopy. This surgical procedure can be useful because it allows the most accurate staging possible of the abdominal disease. Laparoscopy involves inserting a camera into the abdominal cavity through an incision in the skin, and thus allows the organs to be seen better than with any imaging test.;/ The stage of stomach cancer can be classified as follows: Stage 0 - there is the presence of cancer cells in the mucosa, also called carcinoma in situ, because it is in its location; Stage I - the cancer has invaded the submucosa and may have invaded 1 to 2 lymph nodes; Stage II \u2013 the cancer has invaded the serous layer and may have invaded up to 7 or more lymph nodes; Stage III - the cancer has invaded neighboring organs such as the spleen, colon, liver, diaphragm, pancreas, kidneys, adrenal glands or small intestine; Stage IV- the cancer has spread to distant organs.",
        "Treatment": "The multidisciplinary clinical team will assess the best treatment to follow on a case-by-case basis: Stages 0 and I \u2013 the treatment option is surgery, through a gastrectomy; Stage II and III \u2013 the treatment option includes, in addition to gastrectomy, chemotherapy; eventually, radiotherapy may be used; Stage IV - the treatment option consists of chemotherapy; Radiotherapy may eventually be used. The surgical procedure for stomach cancer is a gastrectomy, which consists of the partial or total removal of the stomach and surrounding lymph nodes. Often, the full staging of the disease is only achieved after gastrectomy, so the therapeutic strategy following surgery will be based on the analysis of the lymph nodes and other surgically removed tissues by pathological anatomy. It is a technically demanding surgery, if it was proposed, you must discuss this procedure with your surgeon and clarify any doubts. Chemotherapy can precede surgery or be performed in addition to surgery (in this case often associated with radiotherapy) to reduce the risk of recurrence. Patients who have had stomach cancer may be monitored by the oncologist or surgeon if they have undergone surgery. Follow-up tests may include imaging tests and blood tests. Weight loss is consistent after total or partial gastrectomy surgery; nutritional problems and deficiencies in iron and vitamin B12 absorption often result from surgery.

    "Liver cancer": {
        "What is it?": "Liver cancer is one of the types of cancer of the digestive system, and is also one of the types of hepatobiliary pancreatic tumors (liver, pancreas and bile ducts). Liver epithelial cells are responsible for the formation of liver tissue. In their normal state, these cells grow and divide into new cells, which are formed as they are needed; this process is called cell regeneration.  When cells lose this control mechanism and undergo changes in their genome (DNA), they become cancer cells. These do not die when they age or are damaged and produce new cells, which are not needed, in an uncontrolled manner, giving rise to the formation of cancer.  Unlike normal cells, liver cancer cells do not respect the boundaries of the organ, invading surrounding tissues or spreading to other parts of the body. This process is called metastasis.",
        "Prevention": "Patients with cirrhosis, whatever the cause, must undergo medical monitoring with\u00a0laboratory evaluation of the alpha fetoprotein tumor marker\u00a0and liver imaging tests.",
        "Risk factors": "Any behavior or condition that increases your risk of developing a disease is a risk factor. Just because one or more risk factors apply to you, it does not necessarily mean that you will develop liver cancer. Likewise, liver cancer can occur in people who have no known risk factors.  The causes of liver cancer have not yet been found, but some risk factors are known. The main risk factors are:  Hepatitis B or C virus infection;;/  Family history - having a close relative with hepatitis B virus infection and liver cancer;;/  Cirrhosis, which can be caused by excessive alcohol consumption;;/  Obesity;;/  Diabetes;;/  Consumption of foods colonized by aflatoxin, a substance produced by a fungus that can grow in foods such as legumes and nuts that have not been stored correctly.;/",
        "Symptoms": "The symptoms of liver cancer are not exclusive, they can appear in other diseases. Just because you have one or more of the symptoms described here does not mean you have liver cancer.  You should be alert and consult your doctor if you have the following symptoms: Appearance of a mass on the right side of the upper abdomen, below the ribs;/ Pain or discomfort on the right side of the upper abdomen, below the ribs;/ Pain in the right shoulder blade;/ Loss of appetite or feeling full;/ Weight loss for no reason;/ Nausea;/ Vomiting;/ Jaundice;/ Fatigue for no apparent reason;/",
        "Who should I contact?": "If you suspect cancer, due to symptoms or a complementary diagnostic test that presents a change, you should consult a Gastroenterologist, a General Surgeon or alternatively, less commonly, an Oncologist. Meet our team of experts Make your contact request so we can follow up from the first moment. If you prefer, you can schedule an appointment via our toll-free line.  There are several types of liver cancer: Primary liver cancer - cancer originating in the liver, uncommon;;/ Metastatic or secondary cancer- cancer that has disseminated or spread to the liver but has originated in other organs.;/  Primary liver cancers can present in several subtypes: Hepatocellular carcinoma (hepatoma or hepatocarcinoma) - These cancers originate in the epithelial cells that form the liver. Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common liver tumor in adults, and is the liver cancer discussed on this website;;/ Hepatoblastoma- These pediatric tumors originate in embryonic liver cells;;/ Liver sarcomas- These are very rare tumors that originate in liver cells that are not epithelial, they can be vessels, muscle or supporting tissues.;/",
        "Diagnosis and Staging": "In a patient with a clinical history and clinical examination suspected of having liver cancer, general blood tests should be requested, which include assessment of liver function and a tumor marker called alpha fetoprotein. Imaging tests should be performed, which may include ultrasound, computed tomography\u00a0and\u00a0MRI.  The doctor can perform a tissue biopsy, that is, collect liver cells for analysis under a microscope. A liver biopsy can be performed by introducing a fine needle through the skin into the organ, guided by computed tomography or ultrasound. Alternatively, laparoscopic surgery can be performed, a procedure in which the surgeon introduces equipment \u2013 \u200b\u200ba laparoscope \u2013 through a small incision in the abdomen, which contains a tool to remove part of the liver tissue.  Only when the material collected in a biopsy from the suspected liver mass is observed under a microscope is it possible to confirm the diagnosis of liver cancer. Staging is the process by which we determine whether cancer cells have spread to other nearby or more distant structures. The information obtained through the staging process determines the stage of the disease, which is essential for planning treatment.  When the diagnosis of liver cancer is confirmed, the next step is to stage it, and the following tests may be requested if they have not been carried out to obtain the diagnosis: Abdominal and thoracic CT scan;;/ Liver magnetic resonance imaging;;/ Bone scintigraphy;;/ Positron emission tomography (PET scan).;/  Often the staging of the disease is only complete after the treatment surgery, through microscopic analysis by Pathological Anatomy of the tissues collected during surgery.  Based on the diagnostic tests performed, the staging of liver cancer can be classified as follows: Stage I - The tumor is single and has not invaded the blood vessels of the liver, spread to the lymph nodes*, or to other parts of the body. Stage II - At this stage we have one of two situations: there is no single lesion and none of the lesions is more than 5 cm or, if there is a single lesion, it invades blood or lymphatic vessels; Stage III - Stage III is divided into the following three substages. In all cases, the tumor cells have not spread to the lymph nodes or to more distant organs: IIIA) There are several tumors in the liver and at least one has a diameter greater than 5 cm. IIIB)\u00a0The tumor invaded an artery of one of the main veins of the liver. IIIC)\u00a0The tumor has spread to an adjacent organ (other than the gallbladder) or to the outer lining of the liver. Stage IV- The tumor has spread to the lymph nodes* or to more distant organs. IIIA) Any of the above and invasion of a regional lymph node IIIB) Any of the above and spread of the tumor to other parts of the body  For liver cancer, there is yet another form increasingly used by specialists, called the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system, and its main advantage is that it identifies patients with early-stage cancer who can benefit from curative therapies (stage 0 and stage A), those of intermediate (stage B) or advanced (stage C) who can benefit from life-prolonging treatments and, finally, those with very limited life expectancy (stage D).",
        "Treatment": "Taking into account the staging of the liver cancer, the multidisciplinary clinical team will assess the best treatment to follow. This may include surgery, liver transplantation, ablation techniques, radiotherapy and\u00a0systemic therapy. Operable localized disease - usually treated by surgery;/ Locally advanced disease \u2013 treatment options include surgery with transplantation or other local techniques, radiotherapy and systemic therapy;;/ Disseminated disease \u2013 treatment options include systemic therapy and eventually radiotherapy.;/ The surgical procedure for liver cancer is called hepatectomy and consists of abdominal surgery that can be of two types: Partial hepatectomy - In this surgery, part of the liver that has cancer is removed;;/ Total hepatectomy - In this surgery, the entire liver is removed and the liver from a donor must be transplanted.;/ During this surgery, samples must also be taken from the lymph nodes. There are other local techniques used to treat liver cancer, performed by surgeons, interventional radiologists or radiation oncologists: Radiofrequency ablation \u2013 procedure that consists of introducing a probe containing small electrodes to destroy cancer cells through heat. Generally, the doctor introduces the probe through the skin, using local anesthesia and it may be necessary to use an ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging or CT scan to guide the probe to the tumor;;/ Cryosurgery \u2013 procedure that consists of introducing a probe to destroy cancer cells through cold;;/ Ethanol injection into the lesion \u2013 the doctor introduces a thin needle guided by ultrasound, injecting alcohol (ethanol) directly into the tumor and destroys the cancer cells. Generally the needle is introduced using local anesthesia, but if the patient has multiple liver cancers, general anesthesia may be necessary;;/ Embolization \u2013 This procedure consists of introducing a catheter into an artery in the leg to reach the liver artery. Through the catheter, the doctor injects particles that block the blood flow of the liver artery, causing the tumor to weaken. The liver continues to work normally as it receives blood through other vessels;;/ Transarterial\u00a0Chemoembolization (TACE)\u2013 this procedure is similar to embolization, in that the doctor injects a chemotherapy drug, which means it aims to kill the cancer cells and/or limit their growth. Through the blood vessels, the drug reaches cancer cells and normal liver cells, but the latter break down the drug before it reaches the rest of the body.;/ Radiotherapy treatment for liver cancer can be of two types: External radiotherapy \u2013 radiation treatment to the chest and abdomen, using equipment called a linear accelerator;;/ Internal radiotherapy \u2013 radiation treatment involving the introduction of small radioactive spheres injected through a catheter into the liver artery. These spheres block the blood flow in the liver artery, causing the tumor to weaken and delivering radiotherapy selectively to the affected area.;/ Regarding systemic therapy in liver cancer, classical chemotherapy is of little use. Currently, targeted therapies and immunotherapy are used.  Regarding targeted therapies, the use of a substance called surafenib has shown good results in controlling the disease.\u00a0This type of therapy slows the growth of the tumor and reduces blood flow to it.  Immunotherapy, particularly the drug nivolumab, can help reduce tumors in people with advanced metastatic cancer who underwent first-line targeted therapy and which did not work. Several studies are being carried out to determine whether immunotherapy can be administered as a first treatment option or in combination with other treatments. One of the therapeutic options that may be presented to you by your doctor and care team is participation in a clinical trial. Clinical trials help doctors better prevent, diagnose and treat cancer, namely liver cancer. There are different phases of clinical trials with the aim of determining the efficacy, safety and durability of the treatment being tested. Consult your doctor about the possibility of participating in a clinical trial.  Patients who have had liver cancer may be monitored by the oncologist or surgeon if they have undergone surgery. They must be observed during the consultation and the tests to be requested are imaging tests and blood tests, depending on the clinician's decision.

    "Ovarian cancer": {
        "What is it?": "Ovarian cancer is the most common cause of death from gynecological tumors in the United States. Malignant ovarian tumors include primary lesions (which arise from normal ovarian structures) and secondary lesions that are metastases from other cancers in other parts of the body. Primary lesions include epithelial ovarian carcinoma, which represents 70% of all ovarian tumors. Recent studies suggest that most of these tumors originate\u00a0in the fallopian tubes. Ovarian stromal tumors include germ cell tumors, sex cord stromal tumors, and other rarer types. Metastases to the ovaries are relatively common; The tumors that most frequently metastasize to the ovary are tumors of the endometrium, breast, colon, stomach and cervix. In this text we refer exclusively to epithelial ovarian tumors, that is, tumors that originate in epithelial cells (the basic tissue of the human body that covers the entire skin and mucous membranes).",
        "Prevention": "No type of screening for ovarian cancer is recommended in the general population, particularly with the use of serum CA125 level (tumor marker) or transvaginal ultrasound, as no benefit has been demonstrated in reducing mortality rates, and adding potential damage related to false-positive results. No tumor marker (CA125, HE-4, beta-human chorionic gonadotropin, alpha-fetoprotein, lactate dehydrogenase) is completely specific, therefore, the use of these tests should be done in conjunction with morphological and clinical findings",
        "Symptoms": "In the early stages, epithelial ovarian cancer may have few or no symptoms, making it difficult to diagnose. Symptoms are more commonly seen in advanced stages of the disease and may include: Abdominal or pelvic pain.;/ Vaginal bleeding.;/ Constipation;/ Distended abdomen.;/ Diarrhea.;/ Feeling of extreme tiredness.;/ Frequent need to urinate.;/",
        "Risk factors": "The causes of ovarian cancer have not yet been found, but some risk factors are known. The main risk factors are: Family history of ovarian cancer - the risk of ovarian cancer is greater the more first-degree and/or second-degree relatives who have had this disease. The risk is even greater if your family members had the disease at an early age, whether it be ovarian cancer or breast cancer. If this is the case, the woman may undergo genetic testing to detect whether she has any mutations that indicate a propensity to develop the disease.;/  Personal history of cancer \u2013 women with a history of breast, uterine or colorectal cancer are at increased risk of ovarian cancer;/  Inherited genetic mutations \u2013 approximately 6% - 25% of ovarian cancers have a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation. These mutations are most frequently seen in high-grade serous tumors. Inheriting a BRCA1 mutation increases a woman's risk of developing ovarian cancer by 15% - 45%, while inheriting a BRCA2 gene mutation increases her risk by 10% - 20%.;/ These genetic syndromes can give rise to a profile of cancers that may include only ovarian cancer, breast and ovarian cancer, and ovarian and colon cancer; Age \u2013 the older you are, the greater the risk;;/ Having undergone hormone replacement therapy after menopause;;/ Have taken drugs to treat infertility, namely ovulation stimulators;;/ Not having had children;/",
        "Who should I contact?": "The information contained herein is not intended to replace the advice of your doctor. Your doctor knows your complete medical history and will advise you on the best treatment for your case. If you suspect cancer, due to symptoms or a complementary diagnostic test that presents an alteration, you should always seek an Oncological Gynecologist.

Meet our team of experts Make your contact request so we can follow up from the first moment. If you prefer, you can schedule an appointment via our toll-free line. The four main subtypes of epithelial ovarian cancer are: Serous Carcinoma: This is the most common subtype and represents about 80% of advanced ovarian cancers. These cancers are subdivided into high-grade tumors and low-grade tumors.;/  Mucinous Carcinoma: this subtype represents 7-14% of all primary epithelial ovarian cancers, but may be associated with metastasis of intestinal tumors;/  Endometrioid carcinoma: this subtype is responsible for epithelial ovarian cancer in around 10% of women;/  Clear Cell Carcinoma: About 5% of women with ovarian cancer have this subtype.;/",
        "Diagnosis and Staging": "If your doctor clinically suspects the existence of ovarian pathology, additional tests will be requested to diagnose the disease. In addition to the gynecological examination, which will look for signs of the disease through palpation, in order to look for anomalous abdominal or pelvic masses or the presence of abnormal fluid in the abdomen (ascites), the following tests may be carried out: CA125 tumor marker analysis \u2013 consists of a blood test to determine the level and concentration of this marker, whose concentration may indicate the presence of cancer or other pathologies.\u00a0 The CA 125 marker is not specific for epithelial ovarian cancer; it may be increased in people with other types of cancer and also in women with non-malignant gynecological conditions. CA125 is important to help assess the success of the treatment to be followed if ovarian cancer is confirmed.;/ Abdominal and Pelvic Ultrasound;/ Abdominal and Pelvic CT Scan and/or MRI;/ Biopsy \u2013 if there is a strong suspicion of cancer, the gynecologist will take a sample of tissue or fluid for analysis by anatomical pathology. The biopsy is usually performed surgically through a laparotomy, but it can also be performed by laparoscopy.;/  Only observation of the tissues collected by biopsy under a microscope by Pathological Anatomy can confirm the diagnosis of ovarian cancer. Staging is the process by which we assess the extent of the disease in the ovary, nearby structures, or distant organs. The information obtained through the staging process determines the stage of the disease, which is essential for planning treatment.  Stage I\u2013 In stage I, growth is limited to the ovaries. Stage IA- Tumor limited to 1 ovary, capsule intact, no tumor on the external surface Stage IB- Tumor involves both ovaries, capsule intact, no tumor on outer surface Stage IC - Tumor in stage IA or IB, surgical rupture of the capsule (IC1), rupture of the capsule before surgery or tumor on the ovarian surface (IC2) or malignant cells in ascites or peritoneal washings (IC3)  Stage II \u2013 In stage II, the tumor involves one or both ovaries, with pelvic extension (below the pelvic floor) Stage IIA- Extension and/or implants in the uterus or fallopian tubes Stage IIB- Extension to other pelvic intraperitoneal tissues  Stage III \u2013 In stage III, the tumor involves one or both ovaries, with cytologically or histologically confirmed spread to the peritoneum outside the pelvis and/or metastases to the retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Stage IIIA- Positive retroperitoneal nodes and/or microscopic metastases beyond the pelvis Stage IIIA1- Only positive retroperitoneal nodes (IIIA1), metastasis \u226410 mm (IIIA1 [ii]) or metastasis >10 mm (IIIA1 [ii]) Stage IIIA2- Microscopic peritoneal involvement, extrapelvic (above the pelvic brim) \u00b1 positive retroperitoneal nodes Stage IIIB - macroscopic peritoneal metastasis, extrapelvic \u2264 2 cm \u00b1 positive retroperitoneal nodes; includes extension to liver/spleen capsule Stage IIIC - macroscopic peritoneal metastasis, extrapelvic > 2 cm \u00b1 positive retroperitoneal nodes; includes extension to liver/spleen capsule.  Stage IV\u2013 Stage IV comprises distant metastases, excluding peritoneal metastasis. Stage IVA - pleural effusion with positive cytology Stage IVB - hepatic and/or splenic parenchymal metastasis, metastasis to extra-abdominal organs (including inguinal lymph nodes and lymph nodes outside the abdominal cavity)",
        "Treatment": "Taking into account the stage of ovarian cancer, the multidisciplinary clinical team will assess the best treatment to follow. Stage I and II \u2013 in these stages the treatment option is generally surgery. Chemotherapy is considered a complement to surgery to prevent tumor recurrence from stage III onwards. Stage III and IV \u2013 therapeutic options include chemotherapy; the surgical option is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Standard treatment for women with ovarian cancer involves cytoreduction surgery and chemotherapy. Treatment will depend on how advanced the cancer is at the time of diagnosis. The surgery aims to confirm the diagnosis, define the extent of the disease and resect the entire visible tumor, and must be carried out in a specialized center with qualified and experienced teams. Postoperative chemotherapy is indicated in all patients with ovarian cancer except those with stage I disease with low-risk surgical-pathologic features. Standard postoperative chemotherapy for ovarian cancer is combination therapy with a platinum compound and a taxane (e.g., carboplatin and paclitaxel). Radiotherapy is rarely used in the treatment of ovarian cancer, only in palliative treatment situations. After finishing treatment, your doctor will schedule follow-up appointments. During these consultations, a clinical examination will be carried out, which will include an examination of the abdominal and pelvic area. Imaging tests may be requested, such as a CT scan or pelvic MRI or PET/Scan, and determination of the tumor marker Ca125. Even if you received the best treatment available at the time of diagnosis, there is always the possibility that the cancer will return, especially due to the aggressiveness of these ovarian tumors. This situation, called relapse/recurrence, occurs more frequently in the first years after treatment, and therefore a usual follow-up program includes consultations every 3 months during the first 2 years after treatment, then every 4 months in the 3rd year and every 6 months in the 4th and 5th years. In case of recurrence, the treatment that will be proposed will depend on the extent of the recurrence, its location and previous therapies.

    "Cancro do pancreas": {
        "What is it?": "Pancreatic cancer is a type of cancer of the digestive system, and is also one of the hepatobiliary pancreatic tumors (liver, pancreas and bile ducts). The exocrine and endocrine cells of the pancreas are responsible for the formation of pancreatic tissue. Endocrine cells produce hormones, while exocrine cells produce enzymes. In their normal state, these cells grow and divide into new cells, which are formed as they are needed. This process is called cell regeneration. When normal cells age or are damaged, they die naturally. When cells lose this control mechanism and undergo changes in their genome (DNA), they become cancer cells, which do not die when they age or are damaged, and instead produce new cells that are not needed in an uncontrolled manner, resulting in the formation of cancer.  Unlike normal cells, pancreatic cancer cells do not respect the borders of the organ, invading the surrounding tissues and spreading to other parts of the body. This process is called metastasis. Pancreatic cancer can metastasize in three ways: it can invade nearby organs such as the stomach and small intestine through its growth; it can detach from the main tumor, giving rise to new tumors on the affected peritoneal surface \u2013 peritoneal implants or peritoneal carcinomatosis \u2013 and it can spread through cells that are released from the main tumor, and can reach other distant organs through the lymph nodes or the bloodstream.",
        "Prevention": "There are no prevention strategies for pancreatic cancer. You should adopt healthy habits, such as not smoking and having a balanced diet, as well as paying attention to possible symptoms.",
        "Symptoms": "Pancreatic cancer symptoms are not exclusive, they can appear in other diseases. Just because you have one or more of the symptoms described here does not mean you have pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer usually has no symptoms in the early stages. You should be alert and consult your doctor if you have the following symptoms: - pain in the abdominal region, radiating to the dorsal region, which does not disappear when changing position; - jaundice - Jaundice translates into a yellowish color of the eyes and skin, and can be caused by a tumor that is blocking the channel that drains bile from the liver; - dark colored urine and/or light colored stools; - nausea and vomiting; - weight loss for no apparent reason; - anorexia; - fatigue; - loss of appetite and rapid feeling of fullness.",
        "Risk Factors": "Any behavior or condition that increases your risk of developing a disease is a risk factor. Just because one or more risk factors apply to you, it does not necessarily mean that you will develop pancreatic cancer. Likewise, pancreatic cancer can occur in people who have no known risk factors. The causes of pancreatic cancer have not yet been determined, but some risk factors are known. The main risk factors are: Smoking \u2013 the most important risk factor; smokers have a higher risk of developing pancreatic cancer than non-smokers, especially smokers with a heavy smoking history; Family history \u2013 the risk of developing pancreatic cancer is greater if there are direct relatives (parents, siblings) who have or have had the disease; Diabetes \u2013 diabetic people have an increased risk of having pancreatic cancer; Pancreatitis \u2013 pancreatitis is an inflammation of the pancreas that causes pain; chronic pancreatitis may increase the risk of pancreatic cancer; Obesity \u2013 obese individuals have a slightly higher risk of developing pancreatic cancer; Alcoholism \u2013 individuals with high alcohol consumption have an increased risk of developing pancreatic cancer; Risky professions \u2013 working in the oil, metals, industrial gas and chemical industries.",
        "Who should I contact?": "If you suspect cancer, due to symptoms or a complementary diagnostic test that presents an alteration, you should consult a Gastroenterologist, a General Surgeon or alternatively, less commonly, an Oncologist. Meet our team of experts Make your contact request so we can follow up from the first moment. If you prefer, you can schedule an appointment via our toll-free line.  Approximately 90% of pancreatic cancers begin in the exocrine cells that line the pancreatic ducts. This type of cancer is called ductal adenocarcinoma, the main type of pancreatic cancer, accounting for 75 to 90% of cases. Another type of tumor, less frequent, is neuroendocrine carcinoma, which originates in the endocrine cells of the pancreas. Pancreatic cancer in the form of sarcoma or lymphoma is very rare. Approximately 60% of cancers occur in the head of the pancreas, near the duodenum, 20% occur in the body and tail of the pancreas, and the remainder are diffuse tumors.",
        "Diagnosis and Staging": "In a\u00a0patient suspected of having pancreatic cancer, tests may be ordered to diagnose the disease. In addition to a physical examination to look for signs of jaundice or the presence of abdominal fluid, your doctor may order imaging tests to aid in the diagnosis. The most common in the case of the pancreas is a CT scan, but other tests may be requested, such as an MRI, ultrasound or endoscopy. Your doctor may, if suspected, request the following tests or procedures: -Endoscopic ultrasound (echoendoscopy) - consists of introducing a tube \u2013 endoscope \u2013 through the throat through the stomach to the beginning of the small intestine, allowing the formation of an image of the pancreas through ultrasound; -Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) \u2013 consists of introducing an endoscope through the throat that allows the introduction of a smaller tube into the bile and pancreatic ducts, injecting a substance through this tube (radiological contrast) that allows images to be produced. ERCP images allow the doctor to detect obstructions in the ducts due to a tumor or other patient-specific condition. ERCP is an important method in the differential diagnosis of tumors of the pancreaticobiliary junction, where the vast majority of pancreatic cancers begin; -Percutaneous aspiration biopsy \u2013 which consists of collecting tissue by pricking it through the skin, for analysis in the laboratory. The pancreas biopsy can be performed using an echo-endoscopy or guided by a computed tomography scan; -Exploratory laparoscopy, a type of surgery that allows the doctor to view your internal organs and assess the presence of disease. It is a minimally invasive, quick surgery performed on an outpatient basis; -Pancreas surgery \u2013 some patients undergo pancreas surgery, with the diagnosis confirmed by analyzing the samples collected during the procedure. Only observation of suspicious cells under a microscope by Pathological Anatomy can confirm the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Staging is the process by which we determine whether cancer cells have spread to other nearby or more distant structures. The information obtained through the staging process determines the stage of the disease, which is essential for planning treatment. When the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is confirmed, the next step is to stage the disease through imaging tests such as magnetic resonance imaging and CT scans to check its extent. Exams such as PET or staging procedures such as exploratory alaparoscopy may also be requested.  Based on the diagnostic tests performed, the staging of pancreatic cancer can be classified as follows: Tx \u2013 primary tumor, without classified staging T0 \u2013 No evidence of cancer Tis \u2013 Cancer in situ T1 \u2013 Cancer limited to the pancreas, measuring less than 2 cm T2 \u2013 Cancer limited to the pancreas, measuring more than 2 cm T3 \u2013 Cancer affects tissues other than the pancreas, but without involving the vessels, namely the superior mesenteric artery T4 \u2013 The cancer involves the blood vessels, and in this case it is not operable  The staging of the disease translates into the combination of the type of primary tumor, with the presence of disease in the lymph nodes and/or metastases. Stage 0 \u2013 pancreatic cancer is in situ, that is, it is confined to its site; Stage I \u2013 in this stage the pancreatic cancer is only in the pancreas; Stage II \u2013 in this stage the cancer has invaded surrounding tissue and possibly lymph nodes. The cancer has not yet reached the bloodstream; Stage III \u2013 pancreatic cancer has spread to nearby blood vessels; Stage IV - the cancer has spread to distant organs, such as the liver and lungs. Often the staging of the disease is only complete after surgery, through analysis by Pathological Anatomy under a microscope, of the pancreas, lymph nodes and other tissues collected. Given the difficulty of diagnosing this disease, in around 65% of cases pancreatic cancer presents as stage IV, in 21% of cases in stage III, and in only 14% of cases the stage is I or II.",
        "Treatment": "The multidisciplinary clinical team will assess the best treatment to follow. Options may include surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, either alone or in combination. Stages 0, I and II - the therapeutic option is normally surgery, by performing a duodenal pancreatectomy (DPC) or Whipple procedure, partially or completely removing the pancreas, duodenum, gallbladder and part of the stomach, exemplified in the image. If the cancer is located in the tail of the pancreas, a distal pancreatectomy is performed. The spleen and nearby lymph nodes can also be removed; the use of radiotherapy and chemotherapy based on the drug 5-flourouracil (5-FU) is evaluated on a case-by-case basis and may eventually be used in addition, before or after surgery; Stage III - in this stage, the treatment used is chemotherapy (5-FU and/or gemcitabine); radiotherapy is also generally used, as long as the patient is autonomous and has few symptoms; Stage IV - in this stage, the treatment used is chemotherapy; radiotherapy is generally not used. One of the therapeutic options that may be presented to you by your doctor and care team is participation in a clinical trial. Clinical trials help doctors better prevent, diagnose and treat cancer, namely pancreatic cancer. There are different phases of clinical trials with the aim of determining the efficacy, safety and durability of the treatment being tested. Consult your doctor about the possibility of participating in a clinical trial. Patients who have had pancreatic cancer may be regularly monitored in consultation by the oncologist or by the surgeon if they have undergone surgery.

    "Lung cancer": {
        "What is it?": "Lung cancer is, in the vast majority of cases, of epithelial origin and, as such, is classified as carcinoma. Lung carcinomas usually arise in the epithelial cells of the main bronchi (central tumor) or in small bronchi, bronchioles, or alveoli (peripheral tumor). Unlike normal cells, lung cancer cells do not respect the boundaries of the organ and can invade surrounding tissues and spread to other parts of the body. This process is called metastasis.",
        "Prevention": "Preventing lung cancer fundamentally involves adopting healthy habits, namely not smoking and avoiding smoking environments.\u00a0It also involves being alert to the symptoms of the disease and should consult your doctor if they appear. If you are a habitual smoker, you should have regular consultations with your family doctor or a pulmonologist to make an early diagnosis of lung cancer. You can also carry out a smoking cessation consultation at one of our units. In 2011, it was established that low-dose computed tomography (CT) is a valid and safe procedure for screening for lung cancer in populations at risk essentially based on smoking history.  The criteria for inclusion in an early diagnosis program are: Age between 55-74 years, with an indicator greater than 30 pack-year units (A - calculated by the number of packs per day multiplied by the number of years the patient has smoked) and smoking cessation for less than 15 years;/ Or Age over 50 years, UMA indicator greater than 20 and presence of other risk factors: lung disease (COPD, fibrosis), family history of lung cancer, occupational exposure or personal history of cancer.;/",
        "Risk factors": "Any behavior or condition that increases your risk of developing a disease is a risk factor. Just because one or more risk factors apply to you, it does not necessarily mean that you will develop lung cancer. Likewise, lung cancer can occur in people who have no known risk factors. The causes of lung cancer have not yet been found, but some risk factors are known. The main risk factors are as follows:  It is the main risk factor for lung cancer. Between 80 and 90% of lung cancer patients smoke or have smoked. Tobacco is considered to cause 70% of lung cancers, but only 20% of smokers develop lung cancer. On the other hand, 20% of women with lung cancer have never smoked but this number drops to\u00a0half in men.  As with almost all cancers, it is another risk factor as the median age of lung cancer patients is 71 years. The annual incidence in Portugal in more advanced age groups rises to more than 200 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in the age group between 70 and 74 years old.  The existence of familial aggregation of lung cancer suggests a possible genetic association, however this has not yet been proven and it may be due to similar environmental exposures in individuals from the same family.  Risk factor less well defined as causal.",
        "Symptoms": "Lung cancer symptoms are not exclusive, they can appear in other diseases. Just because you have one or more of the symptoms described here does not mean you have lung cancer. You should be alert and consult your doctor if you have the following symptoms: a pneumonia that does not heal;/ persistent chest pain;/ shortness of breathe;/ expectoration of blood;/ progressive weight loss;/",
        "Who should I contact?": "If you suspect cancer, due to symptoms or a complementary diagnostic test that shows a change (for example: x-ray or chest CT), you should go to a Pulmonologist, Medical Oncologist or Thoracic Surgeon as soon as possible.  If you need help you can also contact one of our oncology managers. Recommended for smokers and ex-smokers, over 50 years old. On the same day, you will have your Lung Cancer Early Detection consultation and the necessary exams, such as low-dose tomography. Consult one of our experts. Make your contact request so we can follow up from the first moment. If you prefer, you can schedule an appointment via our toll-free line. There are several types of lung cancer, divided into two main groups based on the appearance of the cells under the microscope, which behave differently in terms of how they develop and metastasize: non-small cell lung cancer and lung cancer of\u00a0small cells.  It is the most common cancer, normally accounting for 85% of lung cancer cases. This type of lung cancer generally grows and metastasizes more slowly compared to small cell cancer. It can be classified into the following subtypes: Adenocarcinoma - is the most common malignant epithelial lung cancer, accounting for 30-50% of cases. It is more common in women and non-smokers, and is therefore less associated with a history of smoking.;/ Squamous cell carcinomas - squamous cell carcinoma - represent about 25-30% of all lung tumours and occur mainly in men. It is strongly related to a history of smoking. However, although smoking habits have not changed considerably, the incidence of this type of cancer has been decreasing in relation to adenocarcinoma, probably due to changes in the constituents of tobacco.;/ Large cell carcinomas \u2013 rarer, representing 3% of cases.;/  It is a very malignant tumor and is strongly linked to smoking. This type of lung cancer occurs both in the large bronchi and in the periphery of the lung.",
        "Diagnosis and Staging": "The most frequently used tests for the initial diagnosis of lung cancer are imaging tests such as chest x-ray and computed tomography (CT). If the above indicate a suspicion of lung cancer, it will be necessary to perform a lung biopsy, that is, the collection of fragments of lung tissue for confirmation. This material can be obtained during a flexible bronchoscopy (flexible tube that is introduced through the nose or mouth and directed to the airways and lungs), transthoracic biopsy (needle placed through the chest and guided by imaging methods to reach the lung lesion generally in peripheral tumors) or echoendoscopy (similar to flexible, but with a probe at the tip). Biopsies may also need to be performed from locations other than the lung in case of suspected metastasis of the disease (extension to other organs). The collected material and cells are sent for study by Pathological Anatomy, which is the only way to confirm the existence of the disease.  Nowadays, after the Pathological Anatomy analysis, other procedures follow, namely molecular biology tests and other specific markers, in order to select the best drug for each person with cancer, allowing the so-called \u201cpersonalized\u201d therapy, when this is possible. The goal is to find genetic mutations - changes in genes - that may be linked to your type of cancer. For example, approximately 60% of patients with lung adenocarcinoma have tumors with\u00a0very specific mutations. All of these genetic mutations are only found in cancer cells, not normal cells, which means they will not be passed on to your children. The most frequent genetic alterations tested in the diagnosis of lung cancer are found in the EGFR, KRAS and ALK genes. Staging is the process by which we determine whether lung cancer has spread to other nearby or more distant structures. The information obtained through the staging process determines the stage of the disease, which is essential for treatment to be planned correctly. Based on the diagnostic tests carried out, which may include Computed Tomography, bronchial ultrasound, bone scintigraphy, PET (positron emission tomography) or magnetic resonance imaging, lung cancer is staged: which can range from Stage I (less severe, best prognosis) to Stage IV (most severe, worst prognosis) according to the current TMN classification for lung tumors (8th edition, TNM). TNM is short for tumor (T), lymph nodes (N), and metastasis (M): T. Indicates the size of the primary tumor and how far it has spread.;/ N. Describes whether there is spread of the disease to the nearest lymph nodes.;/ M. Indicates whether there is metastasis in other parts of the body.;/ Bearing in mind the importance of a quick and accurate diagnosis for the timely start of treatments, CUF Oncologia has organized a rapid response in the event of a strong suspicion of lung cancer. \"Early detection saved my life\" \u201cI always felt very well informed and supported\u201d",
        "Treatment": "Based on the staging (TNM) of non-small cell lung cancer mentioned above, it is possible to guide the most appropriate treatment: Stages I and II\u2013 at this stage the treatment option is generally surgery; Stage III \u2013 therapeutic options include chemotherapy and radiotherapy, in sequence or combined; rarely surgery. Stages IV \u2013 at this stage, the most common treatment is chemotherapy, although currently in a high percentage of cases there are already new medications, which allow \u201cpersonalized\u201d therapy in selected patients.  For the treatment of small cell lung cancer, treatments are almost exclusively chemotherapy. Radiotherapy is used in certain situations of the disease, particularly in limited stages of the disease. Surgery can rarely be performed in these cases. The main goal of lung cancer surgery is to remove all of the cancer. Your surgical team\u2019s priority is to keep you safe and do everything possible to maintain your quality of life after surgery.  The choice of the type of surgery to be performed largely depends on the size of the tumor and where it may have spread in the lungs. Sublobar surgery is indicated mainly for very small tumors or when resection of a larger part could have a very negative impact on the patient.;/ Sublobar surgery is indicated mainly for very small tumors or when resection of a larger part could have a very negative impact on the patient. Lobectomy is the complete removal of one of the lobes of the lung (there are three lobes in the right lung and two in the left).

Bilobectomy involves removing two lobes of the right-sided lung.;/ Bilobectomy involves removing two lobes of the right-sided lung. Pneumonectomy is the removal of the entire lung. It is performed when the cancer is located in the center of the lung and more localized surgery is not possible. Pneumonectomy is only performed in patients with good lung function, good recovery capacity and who can live without supplemental oxygen support.;/ Pneumonectomy is the removal of the entire lung. It is performed when the cancer is located in the center of the lung and more localized surgery is not possible. Pneumonectomy is only performed in patients with good lung function, good recovery capacity and who can live without supplemental oxygen support. Recently (in the last 5 years) the approval of immunotherapy drugs (directed at our immune system and not directly at the tumor) for an already very considerable group of patients, either as first-line therapy or after the use of other therapies, has increased the expectations of doctors dedicated to the treatment of lung cancer. Today, it is a growing area of \u200b\u200bdevelopment and there is great hope that in the short term we can change survival by 5 years, making lung cancer a chronic disease. The use of these therapies, in addition to increasing patients' survival, simultaneously increases their quality of life, as the side effects of the drugs are significantly smaller when compared to those of chemotherapy. The clinical indication for the use of immunotherapy is not directed to all patients with lung cancer. In the CUF network there are also several ongoing clinical trials that hope to contribute to a significant improvement in the lives of lung cancer patients. Keeping in mind that the likelihood of this type of cancer spreading to other parts of the body is high, the first treatment approach often involves chemotherapy, either as a single treatment or in combination with radiotherapy. This approach always depends on the stage of the disease.  Even in tumors that are completely removed during surgery or destroyed by radiation therapy, the cancer can return if microscopic cells have managed to break away from the primary tumor and travel to other parts of the body. Therefore, your clinical team may decide to give you chemotherapy treatment before or after surgery.  Radiotherapy treatment can be carried out with the aim of curing patients whose cancer is confined to the rib cage but cannot be removed by surgery. Through advanced technology it is now possible to treat these tumors using high doses of radiation with high precision which reduces the number of sessions and minimizes\u00a0side effects. Radiotherapy can also be used for palliative purposes to improve the quality of life of patients unresponsive to surgery or chemotherapy.  Patients who have had lung cancer must be monitored by an Oncologist, Pulmonologist or Surgeon if they have had surgery. Follow-up includes clinical history collection and clinical physical examination. It also includes imaging tests such as radiography, CT and others depending on the situation.  The entire process is usually monitored by a panel of specialists (Pneumologist, Oncologist, Thoracic Surgeon, Imaging Specialist, Anatomical Pathologist, among others) whose areas complement each other, in order to provide the best diagnosis, staging and follow-up for a person with lung cancer. The Lung Cancer Unit's mission is to diagnose, treat and monitor patients with malignant tumors of the trachea, bronchi, lungs, pleura and mediastinum. At CUF Oncology, this unit has coordination in the south and another in the north of the country, in order to standardize and mainstream best practices in the approach to lung cancer, in hospitals and clinics within the CUF network.

In fact, renal cell carcinoma and papillary carcinomas of the kidney, which are the majority of kidney cancers, originate from cells in the proximal convoluted tube. Tumor cells have changes in their genome that make them autonomous and difficult to regulate.",
        "Prevention": "There are no prevention or screening strategies for kidney cancer. You should maintain healthy habits and be aware of any symptoms. People with family members diagnosed with Von Hippel Landau disease should be tested for a possible VHL gene mutation.",
        "Risk Factors": "If one or more risk factors apply to you, it does not mean you will necessarily develop kidney cancer. Likewise, kidney cancer can appear in individuals who have no known risk factors. Tobacco is the main risk factor for kidney cancer. Other risk factors include high blood pressure and obesity. Therefore, it is important not to smoke, to control your blood pressure very well and to have healthy habits. Some kidney cancers are genetic, such as Von-Hippel-Lindau syndrome, Birt-Hogg-Dub\u00e9 syndrome, hereditary leiomyomatosis, hereditary papillary carcinoma, hereditary paraganglioma/pheochromocytoma and tuberous sclerosis. In these cases, these patients should seek advice from a urologist.",
        "Symptoms": "Most kidney cancers do not cause symptoms. In fact, most kidney cancers are currently diagnosed accidentally during an abdominal ultrasound or CT scan. However, you should be alert and consult your doctor if you have the following symptoms: Blood when urinating;/ Appearance of a mass in the lumbar region on one side;/ Lower back pain on one side that won't go away;/ Loss of appetite;/ Weight loss for no apparent reason;/ Anemia;/ Fever;/ Fatigue;/",

Type II carcinomas associated with leiomyomatosis have a poor prognosis.;/ Chromophobe carcinoma \u2013 are rare and originate from the interspersed cells of the nephron collecting tube.;/",
        "Diagnosis and Treatment": "In a patient with a clinical history and clinical examination suspected of having kidney cancer, general and urine analyzes should be requested. Imaging tests must be performed, which may include ultrasound, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. You may also be asked to perform a kidney biopsy - which consists of introducing a needle through the skin to collect a sample of tissue from the suspected kidney mass, guided by ultrasound or CT scan.

        "Treatment": "The multidisciplinary clinical team will assess the best treatment to follow. Most kidney cancers are treated by performing surgery to remove the kidney tumor. However, in cancers with metastases, treatments with immunotherapy or chemotherapy must be carried out. Surgical procedures for treating kidney cancer can be: Partial nephrectomy- In this surgery, part of the kidney where the tumor is located is removed; Radical nephrectomy \u2013 In this surgery, the entire kidney is removed; The techniques available at CUF are: Robot-assisted partial nephrectomy;/ Laparoscopic partial nephrectomy;/ Open partial nephrectomy;/ Laparoscopic radical nephrectomy;/ Open radical nephrectomy;/ For some patients, robot-assisted surgery may be an effective treatment option for certain types of cancer.\u00a0CUF\u00a0Oncology offers the combination of robotic technology with surgeons with experience and knowledge to help patients fight cancer. Robot-assisted surgery allows the surgeon to have greater ability and precision to perform surgical gestures in an easier and more comfortable way. Thanks to this precision, robot-assisted surgery can improve results and reduce the amount of tissue damage caused. Because the procedure is less invasive, patients experience: Faster surgery recovery time;/ Less pain and discomfort post-operatively;/ Reduced risk of skin infection;/ Minimal scars;/ Robot-assisted surgery is increasingly being recommended as the best way to surgically treat kidney tumors smaller than 4 cm, in order to remove the tumor and preserve the remaining renal parenchyma. This surgical procedure is called partial nephrectomy. Partial nephrectomy may also be indicated for kidney cancers larger than 4 cm, provided that it is technically possible and the tumor is confined to the kidney. Regarding systemic pharmacological therapy in kidney cancer, it may be necessary to undergo immunotherapy or chemotherapy Kidney tumors are usually radioresistant. However, high doses such as those used by Cyberknife can be used in certain situations when surgery is contraindicated. In our units we also use the Guided Image Radiotherapy technique, which allows us to control the effects of treatments and their clinical evolution with greater precision. For individuals at risk of surgical complications due to other health problems and who have a tumor smaller than 4 cm, the surgeon may choose to ablate the tumor using one of the following techniques: -Cryosurgery\u2013 the surgeon introduces an instrument into the tumor through a small incision to freeze it and thus destroy it. -Radiofrequency ablation \u2013 the surgeon introduces a probe through the skin or through a small incision into the tumor. The probe contains small electrodes that destroy kidney cancer cells through heat. If a kidney is removed in its entirety, the remaining kidney can usually perform the functions of both kidneys. However, if it is not functioning properly, dialysis treatments may be necessary. This period begins after the therapeutic plan drawn up for you by your care team.  In the defollow-up query, the following is performed: a review of recent medical history and physical examination;/ exams are requested to screen for cancer recurrence, such as blood tests and imaging tests such as tomography, MRI, PET.;/ recommendations are made for adopting a healthier lifestyle that includes nutrition, exercise, smoking cessation, among other recommendations;/ Patients who have had kidney cancer may be monitored regularly by a urologist or oncologist. At CUF Oncologia we believe that all patients should have the right to second opinions.

        "What is it?": "Uterine cancer is one of the tumors of the female reproductive system that forms in the tissues of the uterus. The uterus is a pear-shaped, hollow organ of the gynecological system where the fetus grows. The wall of the uterus has two layers of tissue: an inner layer, or lining, called the endometrium, and an outer muscular layer, the myometrium. The endometrium is the epithelial tissue that lines the inside of the uterus. It is located in the lower abdomen behind the bladder.",
        "Prevention": "Unlike cervical cancer, the use of a screening test is not recommended for endometrial cancer. Cervical cytology (used in cervical cancer screening) is not used to detect endometrial cancer, however, some vaginal cytology tests can detect abnormal endometrial cells, although this is not their purpose. Vaginal bleeding is the most common sign of endometrial cancer. After menopause there should be no vaginal bleeding of any kind, so its presence is not normal and if it occurs you should consult your doctor immediately. In premenopause, if a woman has vaginal bleeding between periods, or If you have heavy menstrual vaginal bleeding, you should also see your doctor. Endometrial cancer is not the only cause of vaginal bleeding and your doctor will do a more thorough examination to determine the source of this abnormal bleeding.",
        "Risk factors": "It is currently unclear why endometrial cancer occurs, but some risk factors have been identified that increase the likelihood of developing endometrial carcinoma. It is important to note that some women with these risk factors will never develop endometrial cancer, while other women without any of these risk factors may develop an endometrial tumor. Most endometrial cancers need estrogens to grow. Without estrogens they stop growing or grow more slowly. Thus, with some exceptions, endometrial cancer risk factors are linked to estrogens. The main risk factors for endometrial cancer are: - Aging: The risk of developing endometrial cancer increases as women get older. - Genes: Women with Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colon Cancer (HNCPC) syndrome, also called Lynch syndrome, have a high risk of developing colon and endometrial cancer. One in two women with this syndrome will develop endometrial cancer at some point in their lives. This syndrome is an inherited disease and is responsible for up to 5% of endometrial cancer cases. - Family history of endometrial cancer: having a first-degree relative (mother, sister, daughter) who has had endometrial cancer increases the risk of having endometrial cancer. - Personal history of breast or ovarian cancer: Having had breast or ovarian cancer increases the risk of having endometrial carcinoma. In women with a personal history of breast cancer, the risk is also higher if the patient has been treated with tamoxifen. Tamoxifen has a stimulating effect on the endometrium that may help the development or growth of endometrial cancer. - Personal history of certain gynecological diseases: Polycystic ovary syndrome: this syndrome produces higher than normal estrogen levels and therefore increases the risk of endometrial cancer. - Endometrial hyperplasia: in the case of simple hyperplasia, the risk of suffering from cancer is very low, but in atypical hyperplasia it is high. - Exposure to estrogens without or with insufficient amounts of progesterone, for example: the use or ingestion of external estrogens, especially in the form of hormonal therapies after menopause. - Overweight and obesity: being overweight or obese increases the risk of endometrial cancer, as it modifies the level of estrogen and its effects. - Diabetes: women with diabetes have a higher risk of endometrial cancer - Arterial hypertension: it has been suggested that hypertension is associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer, although the mechanism of this possible association is not yet clear. There are other factors associated with increased risk (alcohol consumption, lack of physical activity) or decreased risk (consumption of phytoestrogens found in soy, coffee, legumes...) of endometrial cancer, but studies are contradictory.",
        "Symptoms": "The symptoms of uterine cancer are not exclusive, they can appear in other diseases, namely benign tumors or other pathologies.

The most common uterine cancer is cancer originating from endometrial cells - endometrial carcinoma.\u00a0Another less common type is cancer originating from the cells in the muscular walls of the uterus, which is called desarcoma.  Uterine Sarcoma Uterine sarcoma is another type of cancer that forms in the body of the uterus. It forms in the muscle of the uterus (myometrium) or other tissues of the uterus. Although the treatment of uterine sarcoma and endometrial cancer has some similarities, the information presented here is valid for endometrial cancer but not for uterine sarcoma.  Endometrial Cancer Cancer that forms in the tissue lining the inside of the uterus. Most endometrial cancers are adenocarcinomas. Endometrial cancer usually occurs in women over 50 years of age and therefore after menopause, but in 25% of cases it can occur before menopause.",
        "Diagnosis and Staging": "The diagnosis of endometrial cancer is based on the following three tests: Clinical examination: Includes a gynecological pelvic examination, which will look for signs of the disease in the vagina, cervix, bladder and rectum, through palpation and visualization by inserting a speculum into the woman's vagina, to determine the location of the tumor and whether other organs are already affected.;/  Imaging: Includes performing a transvaginal ultrasound: the gynecologist or radiologist inserts a probe into the woman's vagina, allowing the endometrium to be visualized. If the endometrium shows thickening, the doctor may perform a biopsy. Other imaging tests may be performed, such as a chest X-ray, abdominal ultrasound, and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan to rule out the presence of distant metastases.;/  Histopathological examination: This examination will confirm the diagnosis of endometrial cancer and provide further information about its characteristics. The biopsy is usually performed by hysteroscopy (the most recommended method), which involves inserting a thin telescope into the uterus along with a special device to obtain the biopsy. It can also be obtained through curettage and/or with a device called a Pipelle.;/ Staging is the process by which we assess the extent of the disease in the uterus, nearby structures, or distant organs. The information obtained through the staging process determines the stage of the disease, which is essential for planning treatment. The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) 2008 staging system for carcinoma of the uterine body is as follows: Stage IA - Does not invade or invades less than half of the myometrium Stage IB - Invasion equal to or greater than half of the myometrium Stage II - The tumor invades the cervical stroma but does not extend beyond the uterus Stage III - local and/or regional spread of the tumor Stage IIIA - Tumor invades the serosa of the uterine body and/or the adnexa Stage IIIB - vaginal metastasis and/or involvement of parametria Stage IIIC -Metastases in pelvic and/or para-aortic lymph nodes Stage IIIC1 - positive pelvic nodes Stage IIIC2 - positive para-aortic nodes with or without positive pelvic nodes Stage IV - Tumor invasion of the bladder and/or intestinal mucosa and/or distant metastases Stage IVA - Tumor invasion of the bladder and/or intestinal mucosa Stage IVB - Distant metastases, including intra-abdominal and/or inguinal nodes.",
        "Treatment": "Taking into account the staging of the endometrial cancer, the multidisciplinary clinical team will assess the best treatment to follow. Options may include surgery, radiation treatment, and chemotherapy. Stage I \u2013 at this stage the treatment option is surgery; Stages II and III \u2013 in both stages, treatment options include surgery and radiotherapy; Stage IV \u2013 at this stage, treatment options include chemotherapy and possibly radiotherapy. After finishing treatment, your doctor will schedule follow-up appointments. During these consultations, a clinical examination will be carried out, which will include an examination of the pelvic and rectal areas. Imaging tests such as a CT scan or pelvic MRI or PET/Scan may be requested. Even if you received the best treatment available at the time of diagnosis, there is always the possibility that the cancer will return. This situation, called relapse/recurrence, occurs most frequently in the first few years after treatment, and so a typical follow-up program includes visits every 3-6 months during the first 2 years after treatment, then every 6-12 months from 3 to 5 years, and annually after 5 years. In case of recurrence, the treatment that will be proposed will depend on the extent of the recurrence and the type of treatment already carried out. Tumors that recur in distant organs are considered metastatic cancers and can be treated with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.

Secondary bone cancers are bone lesions that are formed by cells originating in other organs that circulate through the vessels and implant themselves in the bones. This condition is called bone metastases, common with prostate, lung and breast cancer.\u00a0Secondary bone cancer is much more common than primary bone tumors. As these are rare tumors, they must be treated by experienced teams, both in diagnosis and in the treatment of different types of cancer.",

There are several types of primary bone cancer according to its location and cell type. Bone cancers can appear in any type of bone tissue, whether in osteoid, which is compact bone, or in cartilaginous bone, which is resistant and flexible.  Osteosarcoma This type of primary bone cancer is most common in children and adolescents or young adults. It can appear in any of the 2016 bones in the human body, but about 50% appear near the knee. It can rarely originate in non-bone tissue.  Condrosarcoma It is one of the most common types of primary tumors and originates from the cartilaginous tissue that lines the ends of the bones and forms the joints. It is located in the pelvis, upper limb and shoulder.  Malignant fibrous histiocytoma It is rare and also originates in the cells that form new bone, just like osteosarcoma. Therefore, both have the same form of treatment. Bone cancers weaken the bone, making it more prone to fractures.  Sarcoma de Ewing Tumors in this family can also appear in bones or other tissues and are also treated in a similar way.\u00a0The cell that gives rise to these tumors is not certain, but it could be nervous tissue\u00a0and not bone. The most common locations are the spine, pelvis and less frequently the upper and lower limbs.",

Given the dispersed location of these cells in epithelia, neuroendocrine cancer can appear in numerous locations throughout the body. The most common is neuroendocrine cancer of the digestive tract or pancreas, but these cells can also give rise to neuroendocrine cancers in the respiratory and genitourinary systems, although less frequently. Neuroendocrine cancers are rare and grow slowly. Most originate in the appendix, small intestine or rectum. Sometimes more than one tumor forms.",

Some neuroendocrine cancers, particularly those of the stomach or appendix, may not cause symptoms. Neuroendocrine cancers are often diagnosed as an occasional finding during the investigation of other diseases. Neuroendocrine cancers of the small intestine (duodenum, jejunum and ileum), colon and rectum cause symptoms because of the way they grow or because of the hormones they produce. You should be alert and consult your doctor if you experience the following symptoms or a combination of them: Abdominal pain;/ Constipation;/ Diarrhea;/ Change in stool color;/ Nausea;/ Vomiting;/ Jaundice;/ Heartburn (burning sensation);/ Weight loss for no reason;/ Huge tiredness;/ Feeling of bloating;/ Diarrhea;/ Unreasonable weight loss;/ Bleeding in the stool;/ Pelvic pain;/ Constipation;/ The hormones produced by neuroendocrine cancer of the digestive tract are usually destroyed by substances produced in the liver called enzymes. If hormones produced by neuroendocrine cancer enter circulation or if the liver or other distant organs have already been invaded by neuroendocrine cancer and are unable to destroy them, patients may experience symptoms related to the presence of these hormones in the blood. This is called carcinoid syndrome and its symptoms are as follows: Red face and neck or feeling of increased temperature;/ Abdominal pain;/ Feeling of bloating;/ Diarrhea;/ Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing;/ Increased heart rate;/",

The digestive system is made up of a set of organs that form the digestive tract, connecting the mouth to the anus, through which food passes from being chewed until only the waste resulting from digestion remains, which is eliminated through feces. Lining each of the organs in the tube are epithelial cells that form the mucous membranes of all these different anatomical regions. Neuroendocrine cells are scattered throughout the mucous membranes of the digestive tract, most commonly between the stomach and the colon, particularly in the small intestine. Neuroendocrine cells are also found in the mucous membranes of the respiratory and genitourinary systems. Neuroendocrine cells have a different embryonic origin from other epithelial cells, forming close to the tissue that will give rise to the central nervous system and then migrating to these locations. For this reason, neuroendocrine cells are found throughout the respiratory, digestive and genitourinary systems. The digestive system has the largest number of these cells in the body. These cells have mixed characteristics: on the one hand, they are similar to the cells that form the nervous system \u2013 neurons \u2013 and, on the other, they are similar to the hormone-producing cells of the endocrine glands.

    "Candidiasis": {
        "What is it?": "Candidiasis is an infection caused by a fungus of the genus Candida. There are several species, but the dominant one is Candida albicans, which can cause inflammation in almost any part of the body. Candidiasis infections can be superficial, affecting the skin and mucous membranes, or invasive, and are more common in patients who are weakened by other diseases or undergoing medical or surgical treatments. This fungus is present in the oropharynx in 30% to 55% of healthy young adults and can be detected in 40% to 65% of normal fecal flora. Candida Albicans is considered opportunistic because it only causes infection when the host is in poor health. Genital candidiasis is one of its most common forms, affecting the vagina or penis. The Candida fungus normally resides on the skin and intestines. From these areas it can spread to the genitals. However, it is not usually transmitted sexually. Candidiasis has become very common, mainly due to the increasing use of antibiotics, oral contraceptives and other medications that modify the conditions of the vagina, favoring the growth of the fungus. It is more common among pregnant women, those who are menstruating and those with diabetes. Much less frequently, the use of drugs (such as corticosteroids or chemotherapy) and the presence of diseases that depress the immune system (such as AIDS) can facilitate infection. In 90% of women, vulvovaginal candidiasis is caused by Candida albicans. The other cases are caused by other species of Candida. About 75% will have at least one episode in their lifetime and 40% to 45% will have two or more. About 10% to 20% are asymptomatic carriers, and during pregnancy this can reach 40%. Invasive candidiasis encompasses a wide range of pathologies and tends to occur in critically ill patients. Its incidence has increased significantly in recent decades due to the increase in invasive procedures performed in hospital settings and new forms of immunodeficiency associated with organ transplants and viral infections (such as HIV/AIDS). This disease is a major cause of increased mortality, longer hospital stays and higher costs.",
        "Symptoms": "Symptoms will depend on the affected territory. In the case of female genital candidiasis, there is itching or irritation in the vagina and vulva and, occasionally, light, thick, odorless vaginal discharge. The vulva may become red from inflammation, and the vaginal wall becomes covered in a white cheese-like substance, although it may appear normal. Sexual intercourse can become painful. Candidiasis in men generally has no symptoms, but the end of the penis (the glans) and the foreskin may show signs of irritation and pain, especially after intercourse. Sometimes a small discharge appears from the penis. Its extremity and foreskin may be reddish in color, with small ulcerations or crusty vesicles and covered with a substance similar to white cheese. The cutaneous forms of candidiasis are manifested by the presence of an itchy rash with the formation of vesicles. When these become infected they become filled with pus. There may be forms of gastrointestinal infection (from the oropharynx to the esophagus), respiratory, urinary (bladder and kidneys), hepatic and invasive forms where several organs can be affected simultaneously, including the heart itself, the brain, the eyeball, the bones and joints. Each of these types of disease will present a different clinical picture and, likewise, the diagnosis and treatment must be differentiated.",
        "Causes": "These fungi are opportunistic agents and cause infection whenever the host's defenses are lowered. Thus, the use of medications (antibiotics, oral contraceptives, corticosteroids, chemotherapy), pregnancy, diabetes and all diseases that affect the immune system (such as HIV/AIDS) increase the risk of candidiasis.",
        "Diagnosis": "In the case of genital candidiasis, immediate diagnosis is possible by taking samples from the vagina or penis and examining them under a microscope. This is essentially a clinical procedure that can be confirmed in the laboratory by microscopic examination of fresh specimens and/or culture (in a culture medium specific for fungi). It is particularly important to document the frequency of episodes, establish the diagnosis and confirm it by culture. Depending on the location of the candidiasis, other complementary diagnostic methods may be requested to better characterize the severity of the infection.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment depends on the location of the infection and the patient's general condition, but is based on the use of antifungal medications. As this fungus can be resistant to some of these medications, it is important to first assess resistance patterns in order to select the most appropriate drugs. Antifungals can be used in the form of creams or ointments, orally or by injection, depending on the clinical picture.",
        "Prevention": "In the case of cutaneous forms, prevention involves keeping the skin clean and dry, appropriate use of antibiotics, adequate nutrition and a healthy lifestyle. Monitoring diseases that increase the risk of candidiasis, such as diabetes or HIV/AIDS infection, is essential.

    "Adhesive capsulitis": {
        "What is it?": "It is a disease of unknown origin, more common in middle-aged women, which is manifested by predominantly nocturnal pain that disturbs sleep and a progressive restriction of shoulder mobility. Adhesive capsulitis or \"frozen shoulder\" is a disease of unknown cause. But it is known that women between 45 and 55 years old, diabetics or those with a family history of this pathology and people with thyroid problems are more likely to develop it.",
        "Symptoms": "Sometimes patients associate its onset with a traumatic episode. Others cite occasional pain in the shoulder, which does not prevent them from carrying out daily activities and which progressively turns into a disabling condition. In this pathology, the inflammatory process within the joint leads to a progressive reduction in the axillary cul-de-sac, shortening of all the ligaments, formation of adhesions (bridges between various structures) and an increase in the thickness of the capsule, which loses its distensibility. These factors cause a limitation of passive mobility (that which the examiner looks for in the patient), especially external rotation. Three phases of this disease are classically described: A phase that corresponds to the period of greatest inflammation of the joint. The patient feels pain predominantly at night that does not allow for peaceful sleep and a progressive reduction in mobility that prevents him from raising his arm and reaching behind his back, for example.;/ A frozen phase in which the pain decreases, but the reduction in flexibility and the inability to live a quality life remain.;/ A resolution phase in which the patient progressively regains movement.;/ It is a pathology considered self-limiting as it lasts for around two years. However, it is impossible to ask a patient with intense pain, who cannot sleep and who has significant mobility limitations, to wait in these circumstances for this period to end. More recently, the benign nature of its course has been challenged as it was found that a significant percentage of patients who followed the natural history of the disease present mobility limitations that interfere with their quality of life.",
        "Causes": "Adhesive capsulitis is a disease of unknown cause.",
        "Diagnosis": "In the initial phase, it is difficult to make a differential diagnosis between this pathology and acute subacromial impingement syndrome or calcific tendinopathy, but a careful examination, focusing on pain, signs of conflict and mobility restrictions, allows its recognition. Complementary examinations are of limited value in this disease. X-rays may be normal, while ultrasound sometimes shows inflammatory changes in the tendons. Magnetic resonance imaging indicates variations in the joint capsule compatible with the disease and inflammatory or structural changes in the tendons.",
        "Treatment": "The initial aim of treatment is to reduce pain. Most individuals have already tried various medications, without success, and also physiotherapy with little improvement. It is important to emphasize that when this pathological condition exists, it takes precedence over all other conditions that the shoulder may have. Therefore, if there is a rupture of the cuff demonstrated on the MRI, it is essential to restore mobility and only later, if the cuff rupture persists, then treat this condition. Intra-articular injection is the medical procedure with the greatest chance of controlling the inflammatory process, leading to a significant reduction in pain and creating the possibility of the patient regaining lost mobility with physiotherapy. The vast majority recover it this way. However, there is a minority who are left with pain or who, even without suffering, are unable to recover lost flexibility with physiotherapy. These patients are indicated for surgery. Although a technique for mobilizing the shoulder under anesthesia has been described in which the joint is forced, thus breaking the structures that first give way, this practice is not used. Surgical treatment is performed by arthroscopy. The objective is to release the joint capsule under direct vision, obtaining practically normal passive mobility. Therefore, at the end of the intervention, the patient no longer has the structural restriction that impedes their motor skills and must immediately begin recovery. The protocol involves placing a catheter (very thin tube) during anesthetic induction, which allows the shoulder and arm to be anesthetized. In the immediate post-operative period, it is possible to demonstrate the mobility achieved. In the following days, bi-daily physiotherapy is performed under loco-regional anesthesia (of the shoulder and arm), thus facilitating the maintenance of the flexibility achieved. Physiotherapy treatments can be continued for another three months, daily in the initial phase, subsequently reducing the frequency as mobility gains continue. Most likely, in the end, the individual will regain motor skills that are very close to normal. The remaining restrictions are not impediments to any activities of daily living.",

    "Carcinoma": {
        "What is it?": "There are two types of carcinomas, with distinct characteristics: basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).",
        "Basal cell carcinoma": "",
        "How does basal cell carcinoma manifest itself?": "It may appear as a wound that does not heal, as a scab that when removed bleeds easily and forms a scab again, a small nodule or a pinkish or brownish spot that progressively increases in size.",
        "What are the causes of basal cell carcinoma?": "Ultraviolet (UV) rays received directly from sun exposure or tanning beds are the main cause of this disease. This type of radiation can, over time, damage the genetic code (DNA) of skin cells, giving rise to tumor cells.",
        "How is basal cell carcinoma diagnosed?": "A dermatologist should be consulted to analyze a wound that bleeds easily or does not heal within about two weeks, a wound that becomes crusted repeatedly without ever healing, or a scar in a place where there was no previous injury, to assess whether it can correspond to a carcinoma.",
        "What are the complications of having basal cell carcinoma?": "There is a risk of having a BCC again even if the previous one has been completely removed or an increased danger of having another type of skin neoplasm related to sun exposure. Usually, this carcinoma destroys locally and can, very rarely, spread to other parts of the body.",
        "How is basal cell carcinoma treated?": "There are a number of treatment modalities that are selected according to each case, depending on the individual characteristics of the patient, the location and type of BCC. The most common are curettage, electrofulguration, simple surgery, Mohs surgery, freezing and topical medications.",
        "Squamous cell carcinoma": "",
        "What is squamous cell carcinoma (or squamous cell carcinoma)?": "It is a type of skin cancer that is distinct from melanoma and basal cell carcinoma (also called basal cell carcinoma) and rarely causes problems if detected and treated early. If not, it can grow in size and spread to other areas.",
        "How does squamous cell carcinoma manifest?": "Although squamous cell carcinoma appears more frequently in areas exposed to the sun, it can appear in other locations, such as the mouth, anus or genitals. The appearance of the tumor is varied: a red, firm nodule that bleeds frequently; a stain that peels off easily and doesn't go away; an ulceration that appears on a scar; a wound that does not heal; or a lesion or white plaque in the mouth. Skin changes can be difficult to notice, especially if there are other mutations resulting from sun damage.",
        "What causes squamous cell carcinoma?": "They result from UV radiation received from exposure to the sun or in solariums, in areas of exposed skin mainly on the head, neck, chest, back, ears, lips, arms, legs and hands. It may also be associated with prolonged exposure to chemicals such as arsenic and have a hereditary cause.",
        "What are the risk factors for having squamous cell carcinoma?": "This tumor is associated with prolonged and cumulative exposure to ultraviolet radiation and usually appears in areas of the body exposed to the sun.",
        "How is squamous cell carcinoma diagnosed?": "Some squamous cell carcinomas can be difficult to detect (especially in the early stages), however, the sooner they are identified and treated, the better the prognosis. A dermatologist should be consulted if you have a wound that does not heal or a scab that does not go away.",
        "What are the complications of having squamous cell carcinoma?": "When treated early, this type of tumor rarely causes complications. If not cured, it can destroy the surrounding normal skin, spread to lymph nodes, and involve other organs.",
        "If you have already had squamous cell carcinoma, is it possible to have another one?": "Yes, if you have already had squamous cell carcinoma, you are more likely to have another one. That is why you should see a dermatologist regularly.",
        "What is the treatment for squamous cell carcinoma?": "Most squamous cell carcinomas can be completely removed with minor surgery. Treatment is defined in each case, depending on the size of the tumor, its location, and its aggressiveness, and may include one or a combination of several techniques: simple surgery, Mohs surgery, laser treatment, freezing, radiation and/or topical medications.",
        "Prevention": "You should avoid sun exposure during the hours of greatest radiation intensity, wear protective clothing or photoprotection in unprotected areas whenever you practice outdoor activities, avoid tanning beds and medications that can make your skin more sensitive to the sun, perform self-examination of your skin and undergo periodic clinical evaluations. In summer, achieving healthy, tanned skin is a difficult task. Is it possible with self-tanners? The sun is part of our life. It is a source of heat, a generator of well-being and a regulator of biological rhythms.

    "Tooth decay": {
        "What is it?": "Tooth decay is a very common disease, affecting almost 90% of the population. Its frequency is so high that it has been considered by the World Health Organization as a serious public health problem that affects people of all ages, regardless of race, gender or social status. In fact, no one is immune to the disease. In addition to the discomfort it causes, it harms general health by making chewing difficult, altering the development of the body and facial appearance, and can even cause speech disorders and lead to infectious complications. It is caused by the action of some bacteria that can lead to partial or total destruction of the tooth. Available studies suggest that diets high in sugar may be one of the causes of this common disease. Despite its frequency, there has been a substantial improvement in the oral health of Portuguese people in recent years, which allows us to admit that education and awareness efforts have yielded good results. For example, at age 12, the percentage of children free from cavities nearly tripled between 1983 and 2006.",
        "Symptoms": "The process is generally slow and the beginning is marked by the appearance of a white spot on the surface of the enamel that progresses to form a small cavity. Through this, the bacteria quickly reach the dentin (less hard than enamel) which is easily dissolved by the acids produced by the bacteria. During the initial stages (small cavities) no significant symptoms are detected. In the more advanced stages (deeper cavities) discomfort arises with increased sensitivity and bad breath or pain in the presence of different types of stimuli (hot, cold or sweet) or even the appearance of very intense spontaneous pain, which means that the cavity has reached the dentin, causing increasingly worse symptoms as it becomes deeper.",
        "Causes": "It's normal to have bacteria in your mouth, which convert food into acids. Bacteria, acids, food debris and saliva combine to form a thick substance that adheres to patients: plaque. It begins to form 20 minutes after a meal and, if not properly removed, can cause several changes to the gums and teeth. It is a disease of bacterial origin, involving the participation of several factors over a certain period of time for it to manifest itself clinically. In fact, the presence of bacteria in the mouth, associated with inadequate nutrition and poor oral hygiene, is a decisive factor in its development. When foods containing carbohydrates (such as sweets, cakes, chocolates, gum, among others) are ingested, bacteria decompose them, forming acids that dissolve the mineral content of the teeth, thus causing cavities. This effect is more evident when these foods are eaten very frequently outside of meals or at night, before bed. Not all teeth are affected in the same way, and some are more susceptible. Newly erupted molars and premolars, which, due to their more irregular shape, allow food debris to lodge more easily and for longer, are teeth that are more prone to developing cavities.",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis is simple and results from direct observation of the teeth. In the initial phase it is difficult to detect it and, therefore, a regular visit to the dentist is essential. Signs that should make you suspect its presence are changes in color, white, yellowish, brownish or black spots on the top of the teeth (grooves and cracks). Cavities located between the teeth are even more difficult to identify and can be discovered when flossing, which gets stuck or breaks in their presence. Sometimes it may be necessary to take an x-ray.",
        "Treatment": "There are several possible options, such as fillings, crowns or root canal treatments. The dentist, depending on the patient's condition, will define the best strategy for each case.",
        "Prevention": "Here are some simple rules that help prevent this condition; perform correct daily oral hygiene; brush your teeth at least twice a day with a toothpaste rich in fluoride after meals. Nighttime brushing is the most important, and then you should not eat any more food. This is because during the night, salivary secretion decreases and, therefore, defenses against food debris and bacteria are reduced. You should use dental floss between your teeth at least once a day, preferably at night; maintain a balanced diet and avoid \u201cpicking\u201d; Whenever brushing after a main meal is not possible, chew sugar-free gum, even though this practice never replaces it. It is also very important to maintain the habit of regular consultations with the dentist, who may recommend, whenever necessary, the use of a fluoride supplement or the sealing of fissures. The ideal rhythm will be every six months. An early diagnosis is also important because it allows intervention and reversal of the situation by stimulating the remineralization of the tooth structure, without the need to lose it.

    "Childhood cataract": {
        "What is it?": "Childhood cataracts are an opacity/loss of transparency of the crystalline lens (transparent lens, located inside the eye, behind the pupil), which occurs at birth (congenital) or during childhood. They function like opaque glass, and depending on their severity, can compromise the child's vision. It is one of the main causes of preventable blindness in pediatrics. It is estimated that worldwide, there are 200,000 children blind due to cataracts. Cataracts can be unilateral or bilateral, and may or may not be accompanied by other ocular anomalies. If it prevents good vision, it can secondarily cause strabismus (eye deviation) or nystagmus (constant eye tremor). Any of these symptoms should prompt observation by an ophthalmologist. The critical period of visual development occurs in the first years of life, as during this period adequate visual stimulation will lead to the correct development of vision. Loss of image sharpness during this period will lead to amblyopia (\u201clazy eye\u201d).",
        "Causes": "Most childhood cataracts do not have a defined cause, although they may be hereditary, or have other causes (such as intrauterine infections, chromosomal syndromes or metabolic diseases).",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of the disease can be made through the red reflex test, carried out by the pediatrician in the maternity ward, or later, detected by the pediatrician or parents, as a white spot/opacity in the pupillary area.",
        "Treatment": "In the case of significant cataracts, where they significantly impede the normal visual development of the baby/child, treatment must be early and consists of surgery. However, not all cataracts require surgical treatment. Surgery is not free of risks/complications, so if the child has good visual development, the approach should be wait and see. Small cataracts, with partial obstruction of vision, can be monitored and receive a clinical approach, which may involve glasses, occlusion and/or the use of eye drops. The ophthalmologist should define which cases should be operated on. The time between diagnosis and surgical procedure is essential for therapeutic success. The more significant the cataract, the earlier its treatment should be initiated. The most appropriate period will be before the 12th week of life in cases of dense bilateral cataracts, and in unilateral cases before the 6th week of life. After surgery, the visual rehabilitation period begins. This rehabilitation consists of using glasses, contact lenses or occlusive treatment, so that the brain \"learns\" to see again. This involves prolonged ophthalmological monitoring throughout childhood. Results depend on early diagnosis and treatment. We seek the best possible vision, respecting the potential of each case.

    "Waterfalls": {
        "What is it?": "Cataracts are the clouding of the lens of the eye - one of the structures in the eye responsible for focusing images and, as the name suggests, is transparent - causing a decrease in vision. When this transparency is lost, light passes through with greater difficulty and, as such, vision decreases. Cataracts can affect one or both eyes and can develop at different rates in each eye. They are not a contagious disease and therefore cannot be transmitted from one eye to the other. Most cataracts are age-related and correspond to a degenerative process, which is more common in older people. However, some degree of opacification of the lens may be evident after the age of 40, generally not associated with symptoms. Cataracts remain one of the leading causes of curable blindness in the world. In Portugal, it is estimated that around 170 thousand people suffer from this disease, with six in ten people over 60 showing signs.",
        "Symptoms": "The main manifestation of cataracts is a gradual reduction in vision, both near and far. In the early stages, the decrease in vision may not be apparent. As the lens changes color throughout the cataract formation process, becoming more yellow and brownish, vision takes on a different tone, making it difficult to distinguish certain colors. Other possible symptoms are: Presence of halos around lights;/ Decreased night vision;/ Double vision;/ Need to frequently change prescription glasses;/",
        "Causes": "In addition to age, cataracts may be associated with other conditions or caused by other diseases: They can form after surgery for another eye problem, such as glaucoma, and are more common in diabetic patients.;/ Be triggered by eye trauma.;/ In some cases, they form during embryonic life and, if they are dense, they must be removed promptly so as not to compromise the normal development of vision during childhood.;/ Radiation therapy may increase the risk.;/ Smoking, alcohol, prolonged exposure to ultraviolet rays and an unbalanced diet are other factors to consider.;/",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis is simple, as the lens is easily accessible during ophthalmological examination. Thus, in a routine consultation, it is possible to observe it directly and assess the presence of cataracts. Determining visual acuity allows quantifying the degree of disability that the cataract is causing, an important aspect in surgical planning. Observation of the ocular fundus and measurement of ocular tension are important in order to exclude other forms of eye disease.",
        "Treatment": "In the initial stages, changing glasses, using more powerful lighting, using anti-reflective lenses or a magnifying glass for close-up can help reduce the symptoms of cataracts. However, the only definitive treatment is surgery, in which the cataract is removed and replaced with an artificial lens. The indication for surgery is related to the impact of cataracts on daily life; While the patient managed to have a normal life, it can be postponed as there is no urgency in the intervention. There are cases in which surgery is more urgent, for example, when the presence of cataracts prevents other eye treatments from being carried out or the correct observation of the ocular fundus, which is essential for monitoring patients with diabetic retinopathy or age-related macular degeneration. As mentioned, congenital cataracts are a medical and surgical emergency, and urgent removal is essential for normal vision development. When the cataract is bilateral, surgery is usually performed first on the eye with the worse vision, with the second eye operated on after an average interval of one to two months. Removal can be done by a process that involves its fragmentation by ultrasound, aspiration and introduction of an intraocular lens or it can be removed en bloc by making a larger incision, with an intraocular lens also being placed. This type of surgery is usually performed on an outpatient basis.",
        "Prevention": "The formation of cataracts is almost always an inevitable process related to the aging of ocular structures. A balanced diet rich in antioxidants can result in a lower risk of developing it. Wearing sunglasses is also important, as is not smoking.

    "Blindness": {
        "What is it?": "It is defined as the absence of visual perception caused by an eyeball and/or neurological defect. From a legal perspective, blindness exists when the better eye has a visual acuity of less than 1/10 and/or the visual field is less than 10\u00ba. With increasing life expectancy, there is a tendency for the number of blind people to increase. It is estimated that in 2020 there will be 75 million worldwide. In fact, the increase in the global population, life expectancy and the lack of adequate ophthalmological healthcare are the main causes for the increase in these numbers. The prevalence increases after age 60 and 90% of cases occur in the poorest nations. Childhood blindness is still a dramatic problem in underdeveloped countries, with an estimated 1.4 million blind children, 90% of whom live in places with greater needs. A person can be considered blind when they have no visual potential even though they can sometimes have a perception of light. Regarding the moment of its installation, it can be congenital (from zero to one year of age); early (one to three years); acquired (after 3 years). In congenital blindness there are no visual references (mental image) and, as such, the patient has an intellectualized representation of the environment (colors, perspectives, volumes, reliefs) without having a visual concept. In acquired blindness, the individual has all the visual heritage prior to blindness and, therefore, there is the ability to represent an object or an environment by analogy. Partial blindness (also referred to as legal or professional) includes people who are only able to count fingers at a short distance and those who can only perceive figures. Closer to total blindness are those who only have light perception or light projections. In the first case, there is only the distinction between light and dark; in the second, the individual is able to identify the direction from which the light comes. Total blindness, or amaurosis, corresponds to the complete loss of vision.",
        "Symptoms": "It is manifested by the inability to see. Depending on the degree, there may be a total absence of vision or perception of lights, movements or figures. The way in which it is experienced depends on the moment of its onset and whether or not there have been previous visual experiences.",
        "Causes": "Blindness occurs whenever there is a serious and profound deficiency in the eyes, in the nervous structures that conduct images to the brain or in the brain. Therefore, the cause can be very diverse and includes traumas, diseases, malformations, malnutrition, in addition to congenital and hereditary forms. It is important to know that around 80% of the causes can be prevented or treated. Cataracts and refractive errors (myopia, astigmatism, hyperopia) continue to be the most common cause, accounting for around two-thirds of cases worldwide. As situations are simple to approach, it is important that global plans for their treatment are implemented. Glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy are two other important causes of blindness for which there are very effective therapeutic resources, as long as they are started early. Trachoma (a bacterial eye infection) and vitamin A deficiency (which is prevented with adequate diets) are characteristic of poor societies, represent around 15% of blindness cases and are easily preventable. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), pigmentary retinopathy and congenital anomalies of the visual system are more difficult to prevent and treat. AMD has been increasing in prevalence in more developed societies, where life expectancy is higher, and, fortunately, new treatments have emerged that slow its progression and, in many cases, manage to regress the changes already present.",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis is clinical, carried out by an ophthalmologist, sometimes in collaboration with other specialties such as Neurology, Neurosurgery, Endocrinology or Internal Medicine. There are several tests that can be requested taking into account the causes: from ophthalmological tests, laboratory tests or imaging studies. Currently, technology allows a very rigorous and detailed investigation of the eyeball and the entire visual system, allowing us to visualize it in detail and analyze its function.",
        "Treatment": "Most causes, such as cataracts or refractive errors, are easily treatable. For cataracts, treatment is surgical and relatively simple. For myopia, astigmatism and hyperopia, glasses or contact lenses can be used. Glaucoma is currently controlled with eye drops. Diabetic retinopathy can be managed with medication. In these cases, laser surgery can solve the problem. AMD can be controlled with intraocular medications or surgery. For all these situations, the key to success is a correct diagnosis as early as possible, in order to prevent diseases from progressing and causing irreparable damage. In untreatable forms of blindness, there are auxiliary means that allow residual vision to be enhanced, offering some quality of life and vision. On a social level, it is important to realize that a blind person is a fully valid element, capable of performing numerous functions with high quality and efficiency. The integration of these individuals into society is a moral and social imperative from which everyone can benefit and should be seen as an extension of medical treatment.",
        "Prevention": "Early diagnosis and correct treatment allow, in a large number of cases, to avoid blindness. Unfortunately, for many populations the conditions that allow for improved hygiene, nutrition and access to essential health care do not yet exist. Fundamental elements of prevention are a regular ophthalmology consultation, adequate nutrition, respect for safety rules at work, use of duly certified sunglasses and adequate control of diabetes and blood pressure. Of all, the elementary aspect is systematic screening, the only way to diagnose and treat diseases that can cause it early. It is worth remembering that blindness is not a disease in itself but the consequence of an illness or disorder that, in most cases, has not been properly controlled. By treating these diseases, blindness can be effectively prevented.

    "Cellulite": {
        "What is it?": "Cellulite is a condition in which the skin has fatty deposits, giving it a lumpy appearance, resulting from an uneven distribution under the skin's surface. It is also commonly known as \"orange peel skin\". It is important not to confuse it with infectious cellulitis, which corresponds to a serious and potentially fatal bacterial skin infection, which results in areas of redness, heat and pain on the affected skin that tend to spread quickly. Cellulite is classified into three degrees: Grade 1: no symptoms and only detected by microscopic examinations;/ Grade 2: the skin becomes paler and less elastic;/ Grade 3: visible roughness on the skin;/ Although it can affect both genders, cellulite is very common in women - around 80% have some degree of cellulite - partly due to their greater tendency to accumulate certain types of fat. Although it is not a serious illness, it can affect the self-esteem and, therefore, the quality of life of people affected by it.",
        "Symptoms": "Cellulite is manifested by the presence of uneven-looking skin. In milder forms, cellulite is only detected when the skin is compressed. In more advanced cases, the skin forms very pronounced irregularities, with depressed and raised areas. It tends to be most evident on the buttocks and thighs and generally occurs after puberty, but can also be visible on the chest, lower abdomen and arms.",
        "Causes": "Cellulite results from the combined effect of the connective tissue cords that connect the skin to the muscle and the accumulation of fat under the skin. While the fat pushes against the skin, the connective tissue cords attach it to the deeper layers and this set of forces translates into an uneven surface. The causes of cellulite are poorly understood. These include: Hormonal factors (estrogens, insulin, norepinephrine, thyroid hormones, prolactin);/ Genetic factors;/ A diet very rich in fat, carbohydrates and salt and low in fiber;/ Lifestyle habits, such as smoking, being sedentary, standing or sitting for long hours;/ Clothing that is too tight and restricts blood flow;/ Stress;/ Taking the pill;/ Age;/",
        "Diagnosis": "Cellulite is diagnosed by observing the skin.",
        "Treatment": "Although there are numerous treatments for cellulite, none of them are properly supported by scientific evidence. There are treatments that are based on mechanical or physical principles, such as: Massages;/ Lymphatic drainage;/ Heat treatment;/ Use of ultrasound;/ Radio frequency;/ Magnetic or radio wave therapy;/ Endermologie;/ Electrical stimulation;/ Other approaches to treating cellulite are based on the use of substances that supposedly help remove fat accumulated under the\u00a0skin, such as methylxanthines, caffeine, pentoxifylline, amino acids and ginkgo biloba. These agents can be applied locally or administered orally or injected, but none of them have fully demonstrated their effectiveness. Applying a 0.3% retinol cream twice daily for six months has been shown to improve the appearance of cellulite. Weight loss can help reduce cellulite, as can maintaining a healthy diet. Liposuction helps to sculpt the body, but it does not remove cellulite and can even make it more visible. There is a newer technique, performed using a laser, that destroys fat cells and firms the skin and which may be a more effective way of treating cellulite.",
        "Prevention": "Preventing cellulite involves a healthy diet that is low in fat and rich in fruit, vegetables and fibre. Regular exercise, maintaining a healthy weight and reducing stress are also important aspects. Wearing comfortable clothing prevents the formation of cellulite that results from wearing clothes that are too tight.

    "Cervicalgia": {
        "What is it?": "The cervical spine is formed by seven vertebrae, which extend from the thorax to the base of the skull, and which are separated by intervertebral discs whose primary function is to distribute weight and allow movement. For this reason the discs have a role in the entire shock absorber column. The neck is highly mobile and supports the weight of the head. Being less protected than the rest of the spine, the neck is vulnerable to various types of injuries that cause pain and limited movement. In most cases, neck pain is temporary. However, in some cases medical treatment is required. With aging and over the years, these discs tend to \u201cwear out\u201d and through a degenerative process they decrease in height, becoming narrower, thus contributing to the decrease in mobility of the cervical spine and compression of the foramina. (holes where the roots exit the spine). However, the literature shows that around 25% of people under 40 years old and around 60% of people over 40 years old present varying degrees of degenerative changes in the spine without, however, having typical symptoms. When these discs with degenerative changes tear, we find situations of cervical disc herniation with more or less acute symptoms, although in some cases the clinical picture is very much a diffuse degenerative disease. Although this degenerative disc disease is often associated with age, the truth is that lifestyle can also play a relevant role in the development and progression of these changes, often conditioned by a favorable genetic substrate. For this reason, regular and adequate physical exercise, correcting unhealthy work postures, as well as a balanced diet and abstaining from tobacco are so important.",
        "Symptoms": "The most common symptoms of this type of pathology are neck pain, stiff neck movements, often associated with tingling, and decreased sensitivity and muscle strength in the area of \u200b\u200bthat root (shoulder, arm, forearm and hand). Whenever a trauma involving the neck occurs, it is crucial to properly immobilize this region in order to prevent the occurrence of additional injuries that could cause paralysis. This immobilization should be performed by properly trained personnel. Neck pain can often radiate to the shoulders, arms or even legs and can be accompanied by a sensation of tingling, numbness or weakness in parts of the body. In the absence of trauma, any neck pain that is continuous, persistent, severe, that is accompanied by radiation to the arms or legs or that is associated with headache, weakness or tingling warrants a medical consultation. These symptoms in the setting of neck pain suggest compression of the spinal cord or other nerves. There may also be a burning sensation when touching the skin of the arm or hand or a shock-like pain that spreads to the arm and hand. Loss of control of the urinary sphinters or anus is a serious sign that reflects pressure on the spinal cord and requires urgent therapeutic measures.",
        "Causes": "Neck pain results from abnormalities in the soft tissues (muscles, ligaments, nerves) or in the bony structures of the cervical spine. The most common causes are injuries caused by trauma or excessive strain. More rarely, neck pain can result from tumors, infections or congenital anomalies and these possibilities should never be ignored. Rheumatoid arthritis can also destroy the cervical vertebrae and cause pain and stiffness in the neck. As the intervertebral discs function as impact-absorbing elements, their degeneration (which usually begins after the age of 40) causes a narrowing of the space between the vertebrae, increasing the overload exerted on the cervical vertebrae, with consequent increased wear. On the other hand, these discs can become displaced, compressing the spinal cord or other nerves (disc herniation). The fact that the neck is such a flexible region makes it more vulnerable to trauma. Motorized sports, swimming pool jumping, contact sports and falls can result in injury to the cervical vertebrae. Rear-end car collisions cause the neck to be hyperextended or hyperflexed beyond its normal limits, with damage to muscles and ligaments. In extreme cases, spinal fractures can occur, resulting in spinal cord injury and paralysis.",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of neck pain involves a medical examination, clinical history and evaluation of the neck region. Radiographic studies, computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging complement this assessment and should be requested whenever neck pain does not improve after a few weeks or when there is an associated trauma.",
        "Treatment": "Even if you have a cervical disc herniation or degenerative disease of the cervical spine discs, there is a very high probability that the symptoms will improve with conservative treatment. The first line of treatment is medication to treat pain. If the pain is radicular due to compression of the root, it may be necessary to resort to the use of cortisone, since anti-inflammatories do not act on the chemical mediator of neurological pain (only cortisone does). In some cases, it is worth combining physiotherapy to improve the clinical picture and posture. Treatment will depend on the cause. Many cases of neck pain can be easily controlled with medication, such as heat and anti-inflammatories. Heat has a muscle-relaxing effect that provides significant relief. In other cases, cold is more effective. The responses of neck pain to cold and heat have not been scientifically validated, but depending on the case and the person, they can be a valuable aid. It is also important to modify daily activities that can contribute to neck pain, such as your sleeping or sitting position. There are exercises that can increase neck flexibility. Massages, performed by properly qualified professionals, can also help. Surgery is necessary in the case of severe injury, evidence of spinal cord compression, presence of tumor or narrowing of the canal. When neck pain results from everyday activities, such as using a computer or sleeping position, it tends to improve over 4 to 6 weeks with just the use of painkillers, modification of these activities and some exercises. When they result from trauma, the recovery time without surgery is longer, and can take between 3 and 12 months, with intermittent pain. Neck pain can become chronic, especially with age, given the association with the progressive narrowing of the spinal canal and the phenomena of arthritis in the neck region. These cases greatly interfere with patients' quality of life and may be associated with fatigue, depression or anxiety. As such, they require special attention. The most common type of surgery to resolve pain caused by cervical degenerative disease is anterior arthrodesis of the cervical spine associated with discectomy and foraminectomy.",
        "Prevention": "It is important to avoid staying in positions that strain the neck for long periods of time, such as working in front of a computer. During this time, your back should be straight, your feet should be flat on the floor and you should take regular breaks. The computer should be at eye level. During the night, you should use a pillow that keeps your neck aligned and you should avoid sleeping on your stomach, as this position forces the neck to become twisted. Wearing a seat belt and helmet in motor sports reduces the risk of injuries to the cervical spine. While driving, the seat must be adjusted to keep your back straight. Maintaining an adequate weight is always important, in this and other cases.

        "What is it?": "It is a chronic inflammatory granuloma of a gland that causes a small nodule on the eyelid. Chalazion appears in adults and also in children as a small nodule on an eyelid. It may start as a small red, swollen and painful area on the eyelid and after a few days the pain tends to disappear while maintaining the swelling.",
        "Symptoms": "A small nodule or swelling may appear in the eyelid area with red, painful skin, accompanied by eye discomfort, watery, irritated eyes and blurred vision.",
        "Causes": "There are small glands in the upper and lower eyelids (meibomian glands) that produce oil that mixes with tears to moisten and protect the eyes. If the glands are blocked by inflammation or if the consistency of the oil changes, it can lead to chalazion. Sometimes an infection can be causing this, although this is rare.",
        "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis is based on symptoms and an eye examination, and no other tests are generally necessary. The attending physician may recommend a consultation with an ophthalmologist.",
        "Treatment": "To treat it, surgery is used, which consists of making a small vertical incision on the inner side of the eyelid. Its contents are then drained through this small cut. This procedure is painless and it may be necessary to use a suture if the chalazion is larger. There is no need for hospitalization, and the procedure lasts around 30 minutes. The patient is then discharged, with an occlusive dressing and therapy to apply.",
        "Prevention": "Cleansing the eye area should be part of daily facial cleansing. You should always remember not to rub your eyes and\u00a0 ensure your hands are clean before touching your eyes.

    "Cyclothymia": {
        "What is it?": "Cyclothymia is a rare type of mood disorder, however, it is not easy to estimate its prevalence with certainty, as many patients are not diagnosed or receive a wrong diagnosis, for example, of other types of mood disorders, such as depression. It is less severe and has less pronounced symptoms than bipolar disease type I and type II, in which there are fluctuations in the patient's emotions, fluctuating between periods of depression and hypomania for at least two years (or one year in the case of children and adolescents), interspersed or not with periods of normal and habitual behavior (which may last more than a month). In most people, this pattern is irregular and even unpredictable. This mood disorder can have a negative impact on the patient's life, particularly on relationships and even at work. People with a cyclotomy have a higher risk of developing bipolar disorder. This disease is as common in females as in males and usually appears during adolescence or in young adults - on average, at age 25.",
        "Symptoms": "In cyclothymia, the mood fluctuates between states of depression and hypomania (similar to an episode of mania, but of less severity, with a change in behavior that appears different from normal), which means that the symptoms of the disease also vary. varying.  Some of the symptoms of depressive states include: Sadness;/ Feeling hopeless or empty;/ Irritability, especially in children and adolescents;/ Loss of interest in activities that were once considered a source of pleasure;/ Want;/ Feeling worthless or guilty;/ Restlessness;/ Fatigue;/ Difficulty concentrating;/ Thoughts about death (however, these are more common in those with bipolar I or II disorder);/ Changes in weight;/ Sound problems;/  Some of the possible symptoms of hypomania are: Euphoria (exaggerated happiness or well-being);/ High self-esteem;/ Excessive physical activity;/ Extreme optimism;/ Talking more than usual;/ Tendency to be easily distracted;/ Difficulty concentrating;/ Less need for sleep;/ Uncontrolled thoughts;/ Adoption of risky behaviors and imprudent decisions;/ Irritability or agitation;/ Greater impulsiveness to achieve goals;/  Both depression and hypomania can last several days or even weeks. Even so, depressive symptoms tend to be more frequent and have a more significant impact on the patient and, therefore, are what often leads them to seek help. When faced with symptoms of cyclothymia, it is important to consult your doctor as soon as possible. . This problem can not only interfere with the performance of normal day-to-day activities, but also increase the risk of suffering from bipolar disorder.",
        "Causes": "The specific causes of cyclothymia are not yet known, but it is thought that there may be some genetic influence, as people with this pathology are more likely to have family members with bipolar disorder and vice versa. Furthermore, it may also be favored by differences in the way the brain works or even environmental factors, such as traumatic experiences or prolonged periods of stress.",
        "Diagnosis": "There are frequent cases in which cyclothymia is not diagnosed, which means that the patient does not receive treatment. This happens because the symptoms are often mild or undervalued and many people end up not seeking healthcare. To diagnose cyclothymia, during the consultation, the attending physician will collect the clinical and family history, carry out an objective examination and, possibly, request some complementary diagnostic tests, especially to exclude another pathology with a non-psychological cause. The consultation with a specialist doctor includes a psychological assessment of the patient's thoughts, feelings and even behavioral patterns. It is also important to monitor how the patient feels over time and, therefore, the attending physician may ask the patient to make a daily report of how they feel, sleep patterns and daily routines. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), from the American Psychiatric Association, for the diagnosis of cyclothymia the following must be present: Periods of hypomania and depression lasting at least two years or one year in the case of children and adolescents, with these mood swings occurring for at least half of that time.;/ Periods of stable mood that usually last less than two months.;/ Symptoms that have a significant impact on different areas of a person's life (social, professional, among others).;/ Symptoms that do not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, major depression, or another mental health problem.;/ Symptoms are not caused by taking any type of substance or by another health problem.;/",
        "Treatment": "The treatment of cyclothymia can involve several strategies, such as medication (for example, medications used in bipolar disorder, as there are no specific medications for cyclothymia) and psychotherapy (such as cognitive-behavioral therapy), always under the supervision of the attending physician. mental health specialist. These measures can help prevent mood fluctuations. The aim of treating cyclothymia includes reducing the risk of progression to bipolar disorder, reducing the frequency and severity of symptoms, preventing relapses and, eventually, treating problems with alcohol consumption or other substances that can worsen symptoms. In addition to the treatment prescribed by the attending physician, there are strategies that the patient should adopt to control cyclothymia: Maintain the prescribed medication with strict schedules and doses, even if you feel well.;/ Be alert to warning signs (early action can help prevent symptoms from progressing).;/ Do not consume alcohol or drugs.;/ Consult your doctor before starting to take other medications, which may interfere with the medication.;/ Keep a diary recording mood changes, routines and other events considered significant - this measure will allow the patient and the attending physician to perceive the effects of the treatment, as well as identify patterns of thoughts and behaviors associated with symptoms.;/ Know the disease and its possible complications and share this information with family and friends.;/ Attend a support group - the attending physician will be able to give the patient some suggestions.;/ Exercise regularly - helps maintain a stable mood and leads to the release of neurochemicals that promote a sense of well-being (endorphins).;/ Get the right amount of sleep - sleep has a significant impact on mood.;/ Implement relaxation and stress management techniques, such as meditation or yoga.;/",

    "Circumcision": {
        "What is it?": "Circumcision consists of the surgical removal of the foreskin (distal portion of retractable skin of the penis) that covers the glans (end of the penis). This procedure can be performed on both children and adult men. Circumcision does not affect men's fertility or sex life, and worldwide, about 33% are circumcised.",
        "Who is it for?": "The foreskin is completely attached to the glans in almost all newborns, making it impossible to retract - physiological phimosis. This is a natural condition that, as a rule, disappears spontaneously with growth and, in around 90% of cases, the foreskin becomes completely retractable by the age of 3. Therefore, circumcision in children should be considered in the presence of certain medical conditions: Dysuria (pain, discomfort, or burning when urinating) associated with phimosis;/ Recurrent balanoposthitis (joint inflammation of the glans and foreskin);/ Parafims;/  In adults, there are several medical indications for performing a circumcision: Phimosis: inability to retract the foreskin over the glans. It can cause pain when the penis is erect and, in some cases, make urination and sexual intercourse difficult.;/ Recurrent balanitis: inflammation of the glans.;/ Paraphimosis: this is a urological emergency that requires immediate surgical treatment to avoid complications such as restriction of blood flow to the penis.;/ Balanitis xerotic obliterans: chronic and progressive inflammation that causes phimosis and can affect the glans, foreskin, urinary meatus (external orifice of the urethra) and anterior urethra.;/ Balano-postite recurring;/ Posthitis: inflammation of the foreskin.;/ Foreskin neoplasia;/ Correction of urination difficulties (difficulty in directing the urinary stream).;/ Penile cancer: This is a very rare type of cancer and circumcision is only recommended when less invasive treatments are unsuccessful.;/",
        "How is the procedure done?": "The surgery is similar for newborns, children or adults and is usually performed on an outpatient basis, under sedation and/or local anesthesia. In the case of babies, circumcision is usually performed a few days after birth. Once anesthetized, the penis and the entire surrounding area are cleaned, a ring is applied to the penis and the foreskin is surgically separated from the glans, and dissolvable sutures are applied. After the procedure, analgesic ointment and topical antibiotics are usually applied. Circumcision is a relatively simple surgery, but it can carry some risks: Hemorrhage;/ Infection;/ Complications related to anesthesia/sedation;/ Dor;/ Irritation of the glans;/ Improper removal of the foreskin (it may be cut short or too much);/ Secondary phimosis (the remaining part of the foreskin may re-attach to the glans);/ Lymphatic edema;/ Glans necrosis;/ Stenosis of the meatus (narrowing of the urethra);/ Urethral fistula;/ Penile curvature;/",
        "Recovery and complications": "Recovery usually takes seven to ten days. Initially, the penis may be painful, red or swollen and may even release a small amount of yellowish fluid. The penis can be washed during the recovery period. In the case of babies, it is recommended that the dressing be changed at each diaper change and that it not be too tight. Sometimes a plastic ring is placed instead of a bandage. In this case, it will eventually go away on its own, typically a week after surgery. For adults, it is recommended that they wear looser clothing to avoid irritation to the penis, and that they refrain from having sexual intercourse for the period advised by the surgeon. As with any surgery, post-operative complications after circumcision may occur. Your doctor should be contacted if: There is no normal urination 12 hours after the procedure.;/ There is bleeding.;/ Presence of foul-smelling fluid or pus in the dressing.;/ The plastic ring has not come off naturally after two weeks.;/ Portuguese Association of Urology, Acta Urol\u00f3gica, August 2022 Cleveland Clinic, August 2022 Mayo Clinic, August 2022 NHS, August 2022 WebMD, August 2022 Endoscopic vaporization - Rezum - is an innovative technique that uses thermal energy released by water vapor to treat Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.

    "Liver cirrhosis": {
        "What is it?": "The liver performs multiple functions such as the synthesis of proteins (albumin and others), vitamins and coagulation factors that prevent bleeding, constitutes an energy reserve, contributes to the absorption of food, elimination of toxins from the digestive system, toxic substances (alcohol and medicines, for example) and defends the body against infections, among others. Liver cirrhosis leads to destruction of the liver. It is also called chronic liver disease and is characterized by the death of its cells, the appearance of scars (fibrosis) and changes in its structure. This organ has a very hard consistency and is full of nodules. This change compromises circulation and affects its function. In Portugal, around two thousand people die every year from liver cirrhosis and it is estimated that around 8% to 10% of Portuguese people have liver problems. It is the ninth cause of death, generally speaking, but it is the fourth leading cause of early death, that is, before the age of 70. Of these numbers, alcohol is the main culprit.",
        "Symptoms": "In the early stages, there are no symptoms associated with cirrhosis. The earliest symptoms are usually fatigue, loss of energy, appetite and weight, nausea, abdominal pain and small, spider-shaped lesions on the skin. Bleeding may occur more easily or bruising may form. In the decompensation phase, several signs occur such as: Jaundice (yellowing of the eyes and skin);/ Presence of ascites (water belly);/ Swelling of the legs;/ Digestive bleeding in the form of vomiting or bloody stools, most often caused by rupture of dilated veins in the esophagus (esophageal varices);/ Discolored stools;/ Mental changes that can lead to confusion, aggression and even coma (hepatic encephalopathy);/ Development of serious infections;/ Hormonal changes with erectile dysfunction and enlarged mammary glands in men;/ Liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatoma);/ The risk of developing liver cancer in cirrhosis of the liver is around 1% to 4% per year. This type of cancer has a high mortality rate if diagnosed at an advanced stage. For this reason, it is very important that all patients with cirrhosis undergo an abdominal ultrasound scan every six months, so that the tumour can be diagnosed while it is still small. In these cases, there are some effective treatments, such as liver transplantation, surgical removal, radiofrequency, alcoholisation, chemoembolisation or a drug (sorafenib) administered orally.",
        "Causes": "The most common cause in Portugal is alcoholic cirrhosis, followed by hepatitis C and hepatitis B. Other rarer diseases are liver diseases associated with obesity, primary biliary cirrhosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, hemochromatosis alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, bile duct abnormalities and primary sclerosing cholangitis.",
        "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis is based on medical examination associated with laboratory tests, ultrasound and/or abdominal computed tomography. In some cases, a small fragment of the liver is removed using a needle to be viewed under a microscope. This test corresponds to liver biopsy. There is another more recent exam, similar to ultrasound, called liver elastography, which can be very useful in diagnosing it, eliminating, in some cases, a biopsy.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment will depend on the cause. For hepatitis C, there are medications that eliminate the virus in more than half of cases, preventing the worsening of cirrhosis and sometimes causing its regression (pegylated interferon and ribavirin). For hepatitis B, it is also possible to control the virus, in the vast majority of cases, using various types of antiviral therapies and immune system modulators. For autoimmune hepatitis, corticosteroids are used. In the decompensation phase, treatment will depend on the symptoms and complications present. It is often carried out in a hospital setting. In the most serious cases, in which the liver is unable to perform its functions, liver transplantation, if there are no contraindications, is an alternative.",
        "Prevention": "Prevention involves avoiding all associated factors. Therefore, it is important to: Do not consume excessive alcoholic drinks (more than two to three for men and one to two for women, per day);/ Do not consume alcoholic beverages before the age of 18;/ Get vaccinated against hepatitis B;/ Do not share syringes or any material used in injecting drugs;/ Use a condom in case of multiple partners or risky sexual relations;/ Avoid being overweight by always maintaining a balanced and healthy diet;/ Ram\u00f3n Bataller et col., Liver fibrosis J Clin Invest.

        "What is it?": "For some patients, robot-assisted surgery may be an effective treatment option for certain types of cancer. CUF Oncology offers the combination of robotic technology with surgeons with experience and knowledge to help patients fight cancer.  Robot-assisted surgery allows the surgeon to have greater ability and precision to perform surgical gestures in an easier and more comfortable way. Thanks to this precision, robot-assisted surgery can improve results and reduce the amount of tissue damage caused. Because the procedure is less invasive, patients experience: Faster surgery recovery time;/ Less pain and discomfort post-operatively;/ Reduced risk of skin infection;/ Minimal scarring;/",
        "We can perform robotic surgeries to treat:": "Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) is the most commonly performed robotic-assisted procedure in the world. To date, more than 600 robotic surgical systems have been installed in Europe, and an estimated 46,000 radical prostatectomy procedures were performed in 2017. PRAR is indicated in all patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer and with a life expectancy of more than 10 years. Prostatectomy is indicated in patients with localized or locally advanced prostate cancer. The aim of RARP is to excise the prostate in order to remove the entire tumor while preserving urinary continence. In patients with localized prostate cancer and an intact capsule, erectile function can be preserved. Preoperative multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging is very important to check the integrity of the prostate capsule and decide whether to perform RARP with preservation of the vascular-nervous bundles in order to preserve erectile function. According to the guidelines of the European Association of Urology, pelvic nodes should be removed in patients with intermediate and high-risk prostate cancer, that is, if it exceeds 5%, according to the MSKCC nomogram.  Robot-assisted surgery is increasingly recommended as the best way to surgically treat kidney tumors smaller than 4cm, in order to remove the tumor and preserve the rest of the kidney parenchyma. This surgical procedure is called partial nephrectomy. Partial nephrectomy may also be indicated in kidney cancers larger than 4cm as long as it is technically possible and the tumor is confined to the kidney.  Robot-assisted surgery is the only surgical approach that allows the creation of a new bladder with intestine in a minimally invasive way. This new bladder made with intestine allows urination to be maintained through the urethra and thus avoids the use of collection bags (urostomy bags) in the abdomen. For this reason, the treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancers (invasion of the muscle wall), which involves excision of the bladder to cure the cancer, is one of the best indications for robot-assisted surgery.  The main indications for robot-assisted surgery in urology are the treatment of kidney cancers with partial nephrectomy, bladder cancers with muscle wall invasion, and localized prostate cancers.  0% incontinence and preservation of sexual function are two advantages of aquablation. Learn about this technique for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Both the patient and the surgeon benefit from robotic surgery, whenever its use is appropriate.

    "Juvenile idiopathic scoliosis deformity surgery": {
        "What is it?": "Scoliosis surgery is indicated for patients with large curvatures in which the probability of progression is inexorable (according to scientifically established criteria), associated with visible deformities and clear progressions monitored clinically. There are several surgical techniques for treating scoliosis, but most of them involve placing metal rods that restore alignment and fix the spine, reducing the deformity. The details of the surgery are defined based on classifications that consider the characteristics of the spinal curvatures and subdivide scoliosis into different types, which require different correction strategies. A specific derotation maneuver is performed, in most cases, to straighten the spine. The instrumentation will keep the vertebrae in a straighter position while the arthrodesis bone healing takes place. A bone graft can be used to fuse or arthrodesize the vertebrae by being taken from the patient himself (autogenous), bone processed from a bone bank (allogeneic) or using bone substitutes of synthetic origin.",
        "Indications": "In cases of very large curvatures, generally associated with neurological diseases, the deformity of the spine can compromise mobility and even the person's ability to breathe properly, making surgery mandatory. In some cases, the curvature causes an imbalance in the body, causing chronic pain and progressive deformity, which also requires surgery.",
        "Risks/Complications": "The risks of more serious complications in deformity surgeries have been greatly minimized today, both due to the evolution of techniques and due to care during surgery, such as intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring and care in the intensive care unit in the immediate postoperative period. In addition to the general complications inherent to any surgical procedure, we can highlight the following possible situations in the context of spinal surgery: Severe intraoperative neurological injury (<0.5%);/ Intraoperative vascular injury;/ Local or systemic infection;/ Failure of implanted material;/ Pseudoartrose;/ Pain at the bone graft harvesting site;/ Load more;/ In surgery, the O-arm allows you to view a 3D model of the spine.

    "Hand surgery": {
        "What is it?": "Hand surgery is one of the most delicate areas in surgical terms. Because it involves structures of a completely different nature, such as bones, tendons, arteries and nerves, it requires the integration of vast surgical and functional knowledge, and the Plastic Surgeon is often called upon to intervene in this area. The delicacy of the structures and their microscopic size often requires the use of microsurgical techniques. Hand pathology is divided into different subtopics, from traumatic pathology to degenerative pathology, including congenital malformations. It is an extremely common and disabling pathology. More common in women and people who have had manual work throughout their lives. It is characterized by pain and \"numbness\" of the hand, often at night. In more advanced stages it can progress to lack of hand strength, insensitivity and muscle atrophy. There are complementary diagnostic methods that help with the diagnosis, such as the electromyogram. Treatment is almost always surgical and significantly improves quality of life. Surgery is performed under local anesthesia and on an outpatient basis. This pathology can appear at any age. It manifests itself as a \"bouncing\" in a finger when trying to stretch it. There are children who can be born with a flexed finger that only stretches through the external force applied by an adult, we call this congenital trigger finger. It is relatively common and will not cause any consequences for the child if treated in a timely manner. It is a surgery that is performed under local anesthesia and does not require hospitalization. Finger and hand fractures are relatively common, especially in a sporting or even professional context, if your profession requires manual work. Parallel to the fingers there may be an injury to the metacarpals or carpus (bones in the \"body\" of the hand) that require appropriate diagnostic investigation and treatment. Surgery is not always the best option and sometimes conservative treatment is chosen. Tendons allow the hand to move. They are delicate structures that move in a sensitive balance. Given that they are superficially located, they are often struck in a traumatic hand injury. And the hand no longer has the proper function. The reconstruction of a traumatic tendon injury must be quick, effective and precise. After surgery, there is usually a period of immobilization with a splint and physiotherapy. Chronic tendon or even nerve injuries involve a study of each case and a longer recovery.  Arthrosis appears in older populations. The most common arthrosis of the upper limb is rhizarthrosis, arthrosis of the trapeziometacarpal joint, at the base of the thumb. Targeted treatment, whether surgical or medical, allows thumb function to recover functionally in terms of both range of motion and strength. Other systemic diseases such as Rheumatoid Arthritis, Gout, Psoriasis, among others, have disabling manifestations in the hand and are the target of treatment and care by our professionals. There is a diverse range of hand malformations in children. Among the most frequent are syndactyly, joined fingers or polydactyly, which means the existence of another finger. There are many other hand malformations with different frequencies and functional implications. The evaluation of these cases must be carried out by professionals accustomed to this pathology and the treatment carried out at the appropriate times. Dupuytren's disease is a pathology of the palmar aponeurosis of the hand, which is a superficial structure of the palm. This aponeurosis in some people can thicken and retract. The disease manifests itself in most cases as a progressive flexion (contracture) of the affected finger or fingers and the consequent limitation of extension. Sometimes painful nodules may form. Surgery is the best solution for more advanced cases, and there may be simpler solutions for milder cases. The surgery can be performed on an outpatient basis, although post-operative care is required, such as the use of a night splint.

    "Thyroid surgery": {
        "What is it?": "Thyroid surgery can be performed for benign or malignant diseases. Benign diseases include hyperthyroidism (increased thyroid function), goiter (enlarged thyroid gland), and nodular goiter. In the case of a suspicious nodule, a hemithyroidectomy (removal of half the gland) should be performed to reach a diagnosis. Malignant diseases include well-differentiated carcinomas and medullary carcinoma of the thyroid.  Before performing any thyroid surgery, thyroid function blood tests (T3, T4, TSH) must be carried out. Your otolaryngologist must perform a laryngoscopy to evaluate the function of the vocal cords, as the recurrent nerves, which innervate the vocal cords, are located next to the gland.  The ENT specialist will order an ultrasound of the gland. Certain aspects are suspicious: the presence of microcalcifications, hypoechoic solid nodules, hypervascularity, and the presence of irregular borders.  In the case of a suspicious nodule, aspiration cytology (a puncture to collect cells) should be performed.  In certain cases, a CT scan should be requested to assess the extent of the disease below the sternum, and whether or not there is compression of the trachea.",
        "What to do if you have a thyroid nodule?": "Most nodules are benign, but 5% to 10% are malignant. Any nodule measuring more than 1.5 cm must be investigated, even if it presents benign characteristics on ultrasound. Any suspicious nodule on ultrasound should be biopsied.  Ultrasound-guided aspiration cytology allows for more reliable results.  A benign nodule should be monitored with ultrasound scans, and if it increases by more than 20% of its size, or if suspicious characteristics appear, it should be minced again or excised.  When the aspiration cytology result reveals indeterminate cells (suspicious, follicular, or Hurtle cells), the risk of malignancy increases to 10 to 20%. In these patients, a lobectomy (excision of a lobe of the thyroid) is indicated for diagnosis. If the analysis reveals malignancy, it will be necessary to remove the rest of the thyroid.  In cases where the nodule is larger than 4 cm, or where there is a family history of thyroid carcinoma, a total thyroidectomy should be performed immediately.  Malignant thyroid tumors are normally treated with total thyroidectomy, with some peculiarities depending on size and appearance. For example, papillary thyroid carcinoma, which represents 80% of malignant thyroid tumors, is often multifocal, hence the indication is total thyroidectomy.  The presence of lymph node metastases requires emptying of the lymph nodes in the neck.  If you have thyroid pathology, consult your attending physician or a specialist in thyroid and endocrine diseases, so that they can advise, monitor and operate if necessary.  Load more;/ Did you know that one in ten Portuguese people may have thyroid disease? In\u00eas Sapinho, endocrinologist, and Maria Ol\u00edmpia Cid, general surgeon, talk about treatments. Hypoparathyroidism is a rare condition that results from a lack of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and is manifested by low levels of calcium in the blood.

        "Areas of intervention": "Fortunately, brachial plexus injuries are becoming increasingly rare. In general, we are talking about obstetric brachial plexus injuries, which are those resulting from trauma during childbirth, and adult brachial plexus injuries, which are mostly related to acute trauma. Surgical treatment, in short, is divided between nerve surgery and tendon surgery. The work of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation is essential for the success of surgeries.  Peripheral nerve pathology is extremely extensive and varied. These are very delicate structures, which makes surgery more difficult. Surgical options are multiple and innovative. It is an area in constant evolution and limits are reestablished daily. The most frequent pathologies are compression syndromes along the nerve path, acute injuries and tumors.  Facial paralysis is characterized by the lack of mobility of the facial muscles. Normally it only occurs on one side of the face, which contributes to a marked asymmetry. Since the face is so important in social interaction, the importance of reconstruction in cases of facial paralysis is understood. There are multiple causes, including strokes, tumors, infections, trauma, among others. Reconstruction addresses both functional and aesthetic problems. The aim of surgery is to create a face that is as symmetrical, functional and natural as possible. Febrile seizures scare parents, who don't know what they are and how they should act.

    "Diabetes surgery": {
        "Type 2 diabetes mellitus": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DMT2) is the most common form of diabetes, accounting for 95% of all cases. Obesity is the most important cause of T2DM and the alarming growth in the prevalence of diabetes is closely linked to the high prevalence of obesity worldwide. T2DM causes multiple diseases and health problems, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, blindness (retinopathy), kidney failure, neuropathy, amputations, sexual dysfunction, depression, cognitive impairment and increased mortality from certain types of cancer. The risk of premature death from T2DM is increased by about 80% and life expectancy is reduced by 12 to 14 years. Current therapy for T2DM includes lifestyle changes (weight loss, appropriate diet and exercise) and antidiabetic medications. Regular medical monitoring and strict adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen can help maintain acceptable blood sugar levels, although currently available medications and lifestyle changes never lead to diabetes remission. In fact, DMT2 tends to worsen over time, often requiring the combination of new medications or an increase in the respective dose to keep blood sugar levels under control. For this reason, T2DM was considered a chronic and progressive disease.  Some relevant numbers: Every 10 seconds a person dies worldwide from complications related to T2DM.;/ Diabetes is one of the top 10 causes of death in the Western world.;/ Diabetes consumes about 10% of healthcare spending.;/ Diabetic patients spend about 2.3 times more on health care than non-diabetics.;/ If current trends continue, T2DM or pre-diabetes is expected to affect half of the population of the Western world.;/ The prevalence of diabetes in Portugal is 13%. If diabetes and pre-diabetes (intermediate hyperglycemia) are considered, the prevalence in Portugal is 40%.;/ The incidence of diabetes in Portugal is 600 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants per year.;/ 90% of DMT2 cases are attributable to excess fat in the body.;/ Bariatric and metabolic surgery is the most effective form of treatment for T2DM in patients who concomitantly have some degree of obesity and results in remission or improvement of the disease in almost all cases.;/",
        "Metabolic Surgery": "Metabolic surgery improves T2DM in 90% of patients by lowering blood sugar levels, reducing the dose and type of medications needed, and improving problems associated with diabetes. Metabolic surgery induces remission of T2DM in 30-80% of patients (varies with operation and patient), normalizing blood sugar levels and eliminating the need for antidiabetic medications. In most cases, the effects are maintained in the medium and long term (\u2265 5 years). Metabolic surgery consists of a set of operations that are performed on the gastrointestinal system with the aim of treating type 2 diabetes mellitus (DMT2) and obesity. After the advent of bariatric surgery in the 1950s, it was observed that operations initially designed to treat obesity induced remission of T2DM in a large percentage of cases \u2013 more than would be expected for the resolution of obesity. In fact, in some cases, these operations were more effective in inducing remission of T2DM than treating obesity itself. Since 2000, several experiments have confirmed the direct effects of those operations on insulin and glucose metabolism and, since then, surgery has also been used to treat T2DM. Since 2016, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines have considered metabolic surgery as one of the therapeutic alternatives to consider in the treatment of T2DM.",
        "Candidates": "According to the 2nd Diabetes Surgery Summit, an international consensus conference that took place in 2016 and brought together a multidisciplinary group of 48 international experts (60% of whom are endocrinologists/diabetologists), surgery should be recommended or considered to treat diabetes mellitus type 2 (DMT2) in the following cases: Patients with T2DM and grade II or III obesity (BMI \u2265 35 kg/m2).;/ Patients with difficult to control T2DM and grade I obesity (BMI 30 \u2013 34.9 kg/m2).;/ In patients of Asian ethnicity, lower those BMI values \u200b\u200bby 2.5 kg/m2.;/",
        "Interventions": "The operations that are performed to treat diabetes are as follows: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass;/ Mini-gastric bypass;/ Switch duodenal;/ Scopinaro Operation;/ Sleeveless gastrectomy with ileal interposition GS+II;/",
        "Risks": "Every surgery has an associated risk and metabolic surgery is no exception. In general and summarized terms, the risks inherent to metabolic surgery are: The need to convert an operation that began with minimally invasive surgery (laparoscopic or robotic) into conventional open surgery. This is a very rare occurrence in specialized centers, but it can be frequent in centers with less experience, especially in revision surgery.;/ Therapeutic failure: occurs when there is no significant improvement in diabetes after surgery. Therapeutic failure can occur in up to 10-20% of cases, depending on the type of procedure performed and, above all, the patient's behavior.;/ Hemorrhage;/ Dehiscence (rupture) of sutures in the stomach or of sutures that connect the stomach and intestine. This is a rare or very rare type of complication in specialized centers, but it is very serious and difficult to treat when it occurs.;/ Intestinal obstruction due to adhesions or internal hernias.;/ Incisional hernia of one of the incisions in the abdominal wall.;/ Flatulence, foul-smelling stools and diarrhea. They are very rare in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy with ileal interposition. They are more frequent in duodenal switch and, above all, in the Scopinaro operation.;/ Nutritional deficiencies. They are very rare in sleeve gastrectomy with ileal interposition. They can occur in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, but they are easy to treat; As a general rule, protein deficiencies do not arise. They are more frequent in duodenal switch and, above all, in the Scopinaro operation, and protein deficiencies may arise that are difficult to treat.;/ Mortality: the overall risk of death (considering all operations) as a result of a complication of metabolic surgery is around 1\u2030: that is, one in every 1000 patients operated on. This risk is clearly lower than what is observed in other operations, some apparently simpler, such as removing the gallbladder or placing a hip prosthesis. If we consider only the most frequently performed operation, the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, this risk is reduced by less than half.;/  For the most frequently performed operation, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, the overall frequency of complications is 2-5%; if we consider only major (severe) complications the frequency is 0.5-1%; In the case of robotic surgery, the frequency of major complications is less than 0.5%. This incidence of complications is what has been published in the best scientific literature and corresponds to the experience of the Center for Surgical Treatment of Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes. Carlos Vaz, General Surgeon at CUF Tejo Hospital Load more;/ Diabetics are at risk for COVID-19 infection, not because they have a greater chance of contracting it, but rather because of the severity of the complications. Diabetes in children is increasingly common and is a chronic disease that can have several complications. Keeping it under control is essential.

    "Cystitis": {
        "What is it?": "Cystitis or bladder infections have a high incidence in females. It is difficult to determine the real prevalence of urinary tract infections in Portugal, but it is estimated that between 50% and 60% of pre-menopausal women will have at least one episode in their lives and, of these, 90% will correspond to cystitis. The peak incidence of uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections in women occurs between 18 and 39 years of age, a period that coincides with the age of maximum sexual activity in women. When it is acute, it occurs in women without underlying diseases and without functional or structural anomalies .",
        "Symptoms": "The main symptom of this group of diseases is bladder/suprapubic pain (\"lower abdomen\"), which typically increases as the bladder fills\u00a0and eases as it empties. This pain leads to increased urinary frequency as patients prevent their bladder from overfilling so that they do not experience pain. The bacteria that give rise to cystitis in the first stage colonize the vestibule of the vulva and the periurethral region. From these locations, a small number of these microorganisms can ascend to the bladder and, more rarely, to the kidney. Under normal circumstances, they are eliminated by the flow and antibacterial properties of urine. If they are not eliminated, colonization or infection will begin, depending on the balance between the virulence of the bacteria, local defensive mechanisms and the presence or absence of anatomical or functional changes in the urinary tract. If no inflammatory lesions occur in the bladder mucosa, then it is an asymptomatic colonization. When the microorganism manages to cause tissue damage that results in the appearance of symptoms, cystitis occurs. The most suggestive symptoms of cystitis are: Painful urination (dysuria);/ Sensation of urgency and having to urinate more often in small quantities (pollakiuria);/ Hematuria (presence of blood in the urine) may occur;/ Discomfort in the pelvic region;/ Sensation of pressure in the lower abdominal region;/ Mild fever;/ Urine tends to be darker, cloudy and have a strong odor;/ In children, cystitis can result in daytime episodes of enuresis (involuntary urination).",
        "Causes": "Uncomplicated cystitis is caused by a small number of bacterial species, and more than 95% are caused by Gram-negative aerobic microorganisms originating from the colon, given the proximity between the anal region and the urogenital area. Among these bacteria, Escherichia coli is the most common. A minority of episodes have an exogenous cause, that is, they are caused by environmental microorganisms that are introduced into the urinary tract during manipulation for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. As such, these cases occur mainly in hospital settings. Several factors increase the risk of infection in premenopausal women: Degree of sexual activity (the biggest risk factor is having had recent sexual intercourse);/ Use of spermicides;/ Delayed post-coital urination;/ History of recent urinary tract infection;/ Genetic factors;/ In addition to those mentioned, there are other reasons that contribute to the risk of cystitis: The use of diaphragms, especially when associated with spermicides;/ Pregnancy induces hormonal changes that also increase this risk.;/ The presence of bladder stones or an enlarged prostate, reduced immune system (diabetes, HIV/AIDS infection, immunosuppressive treatments) or prolonged use of a catheter;/",
        "Diagnosis": "The clinical history and medical examination are very important elements of analysis. To diagnose urinary infection, the most frequently used test is the reactive strip and, if the result is negative, a laboratory study of the urine is used, evaluating its sediment and carrying out cultural tests that allow the microorganism to be identified. Ultrasound, cystoscopy, or imaging studies may be helpful in some circumstances.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment is varied. Different types of antibiotics can be used, with different doses, dosages and durations of treatment. With the combination of these treatments and adequate monitoring, it is possible to control the symptoms and greatly improve the quality of life of patients with this problem.",
        "Prevention": "The following measures can help prevent: Perform careful hygiene of the genitals after sexual intercourse;/ Use neutral, unscented soaps for intimate hygiene; cleanse from front to back;;/ Empty your bladder completely when urinating, not postponing urination;;/ Avoid tight underwear and pants, prefer cotton clothing;;/ Patients with catheters/catheters should ask the nursing team for help.;/  It is predictable that most women will have at least one episode of cystitis in their lifetime and many will have more than one. When cystitis occurs in men and children, it is important to always consult a doctor. Male cystitis is more likely to be caused by another underlying condition, such as an infection, blockage or enlargement of the prostate, or cancer. Men in same-sex relationships are more likely to develop cystitis. In most cases of male cystitis, early treatment resolves the problem effectively, but untreated bladder infections can lead to inflammation or damage to the kidneys or prostate.

    "Cytomegalovirus": {
        "What is it?": "Cytomegalovirus is a common virus, part of the herpes virus family, that can infect anyone, regardless of age. Once infected, the virus remains dormant and can reactivate. In pregnant women or patients with a depressed immune system, this virus can cause complications.",
        "Symptoms": "When they first contract the virus, some individuals may experience flu-like symptoms, such as: Fever;/ Muscle pain;/ Tiredness;/ Manchas na pele;/ Discomfort;/ Sore throat;/ Enlarged lymph nodes;/  As a general rule, treatment is symptomatic - that is, the symptoms are treated. In some cases, cytomegalovirus can cause mononucleosis or hepatitis.",
        "You drink": "Most babies with congenital cytomegalovirus appear healthy at the time of birth. Some of them develop symptoms only later - sometimes months or years after birth. Among these late symptoms, the most common are hearing loss or developmental delay. A small number of babies may still develop vision problems. In the case of babies with congenital cytomegalovirus, who present symptoms right at birth, some of the most common are: Premature birth;/ Low birth weight;/ Yellow skin and eyes (jaundice);/ Enlarged and malfunctioning liver or spleen;/ Purple spots and/or rash;/ Abnormally small head (microcephaly);/ Pneumonia;/ Seizures;/",
        "Immunocompromised patients": "People with compromised immune systems may experience severe symptoms that affect multiple organs.",
        "Diagnosis": "The presence of cytomegalovirus can be detected through laboratory tests, for example, of blood or other body fluids. In the case of newborn babies, blood tests are not the best option; It is preferable to do a urine analysis. In pregnant women, there is the possibility of carrying out tests to check whether the woman is infected with this virus. In the case of pregnant women who already have antibodies against cytomegalovirus, the risk of reactivation of the infection - and consequent transmission to the fetus - is very low. However, if the doctor detects a new cytomegalovirus infection during pregnancy, performing an amniocentesis (taking a sample of amniotic fluid) can determine whether or not the fetus has been infected with the virus. Pregnant women who experience a viral/flu-like condition should speak to their attending physician who, if necessary, may prescribe tests to diagnose cytomegalovirus. The doctor may do this even if the woman has no symptoms. If the attending physician suspects that the baby may have congenital cytomegalovirus, it is important to undergo testing within the first three weeks after birth. If your baby is confirmed to have cytomegalovirus, your healthcare provider may recommend additional tests to assess the status of your organs, such as your liver, kidneys, vision, hearing, and brain. In the case of immunosuppressed patients, it is also important to perform tests to detect the presence of cytomegalovirus. For example, people who have HIV or who have had a transplant are monitored regularly.",
        "Causes": "Cytomegalovirus can go through several cycles/periods where it is \"dormant\" and then reactivates. In healthy people, this virus remains essentially inactive. During periods when cytomegalovirus is active in the body, we can transmit it to other people. Transmission occurs through bodily fluids \u2013 including blood, urine, saliva, breast milk, tears, semen and vaginal fluids. Casual contact does not transmit cytomegalovirus. Some ways the virus is transmitted include: Touching your eyes or the inside of your mouth/nose after you have come into contact with bodily fluids from an infected person.;/ Having sexual relations with an infected person.;/ Coming into contact with the breast milk of an infected woman.;/ Organ, bone marrow or stem cell transplants or blood transfusions.;/ The birth. An infected mother can pass the virus to her baby before or during birth. The risk of transmission is greater if a woman becomes infected for the first time during pregnancy.;/",
        "Treatment": "As a general rule, healthy children and adults do not need treatment for the infection caused by cytomegalovirus. They simply need to take some precautions to help their body fight the infection, such as rest and symptomatic treatment. On the other hand, newborns and immunocompromised people who show symptoms may need treatment, depending on the severity of the infection. Antiviral drugs are the most common therapy. Although they do not eliminate the virus, they can reduce its reproduction and the risk of more serious problems. New medications and vaccines are being studied to treat and prevent cytomegalovirus infection.",
        "Prevention": "The best strategy for preventing cytomegalovirus is good hygiene. In this sense, some important measures include: Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for 15-20 seconds, especially after contact with younger children or their diapers, saliva or other oral fluids.;/ Avoid contact with a child's tears and saliva, especially if you are pregnant.;/ Do not share food or drink from the same glass as other people.;/ Be careful with disposable items, such as diapers or wipes, that may be contaminated with bodily fluids. Before touching your face, wash your hands thoroughly.;/ Clean toys, countertops, or other surfaces that may have come into contact with a child's urine or saliva.;/ Practice safe sex.

    "Clamidia genital": {
        "What is it?": "Genital chlamydia is an infection caused by the bacteria Chlamydia Trachomatis. It is, along with infections caused by the bacteria Neisseria Gonorrhoeae, one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases and its incidence has increased. Considering that many of the cases are asymptomatic, it is likely that their occurrence is even greater than previously thought. In the United States of America, it is estimated that around 2.8 million new cases appear every year. In a study carried out in Portugal, there was a global prevalence of infection of around 3%, with a predominance of males (83.3%).",
        "Symptoms": "Some types of Chlamydia cause genitourinary infections and, if transmitted during pregnancy, can cause conjunctivitis or pneumonia in the newborn. Others cause a genital lesion known as lymphogranuloma venereum, which is more common in tropical countries. In men, genital infection is usually asymptomatic. Symptoms may include pain or a nonspecific burning sensation in the perineum or testicles, or urethral discharge. There may also be a burning sensation when urinating, and other symptoms such as epididymitis, prostatitis or proctitis may appear. Reiter's syndrome, defined by the presence of arthritis, conjunctivitis and urethritis, may also occur. In women, it is also common for the infection to cause no symptoms. In around 20%, symptoms such as discharge, burning and more frequent urination appear. Urethritis or cervicitis may also occur. In some patients, pelvic inflammatory disease appears, which can be complicated by infertility, ectopic pregnancy or occlusion of the tubes. In lymphogranuloma venereum, the primary lesion appears at the site of contact with the microorganism. A few weeks later an inflamed and enlarged ganglion appears (adenopathy, usually unilateral). These can grow, forming a plaque with a tendency to ulcerate and with the possibility of scarring, causing swelling in the affected limb.",
        "Causes": "Genital chlamydia is sexually transmitted, making it the most common sexually transmitted disease in the United States. Sexually active people and, especially, those with several sexual partners have a higher risk of contracting this pathology. The infection can be associated with urological and genital complications, infertility, arthritis and a three to six times higher risk of HIV transmission. As such, its identification and treatment are very important.",
        "Diagnosis": "Suspicion of an infection is often based on clinical symptoms. Laboratory amplification methods (PCR, LRC) are the best diagnostic procedures. This process is routinely used in many laboratories. Until recently, bacterial culture was considered standard.\u00a0This technique usually requires the collection of a\u00a0sample of urethral discharge in men or cervical secretions in women. But there are other laboratory tests available.",
        "Treatment": "With the antibiotics doxycycline or azithromycin. Alternatively, ofloxacin or erythromycin can be administered for seven days. Lymphogranuloma venereum therapy requires longer treatment, for at least three weeks. It is important that the medication is extended to the sexual partners of the person with chlamydia, otherwise the infection will tend to recur and perpetuate itself. When there is an early diagnosis, the prognosis is favorable, as antibiotics are very effective and the complications mentioned are very rare.",
        "Prevention": "Prevention requires annual laboratory screening for all sexually active women over the age of 25 or with new sexual partners. Using a condom is an effective way to prevent this infection.

    "Cholera": {
        "What is it?": "It is an infection of the small intestine caused by a bacteria (Vibrio Cholerae). This is capable of producing a toxin that stimulates it to secrete large quantities of a liquid rich in salts and minerals, causing very serious diarrhea. It is a form of acute infectious diarrhea that, if left untreated, can cause death within a few hours. According to the World Health Organization, it is estimated that three to five million cases of cholera occur each year, causing between one hundred thousand and two hundred thousand deaths. This disease is transmitted through ingestion of water, shellfish or other foods contaminated by the excrement of infected people. It usually appears in certain areas of Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America, with outbreaks occurring during the hot months. The incidence is higher among\u00a0 children. The infection can be caused by other species of the Vibrio bacteria. In this scenario, diarrhea is usually much less severe than cholera.",
        "Symptoms": "In about 75% to 80% of cases, no symptoms occur, although the bacteria are present in feces for seven to 14 days after infection. Therefore, infected people without symptoms can be a source of contagion for other people. In other cases, there is acute and very intense watery diarrhea that can cause severe dehydration that, without treatment, can be fatal. Cholera symptoms begin, on average, one to three days after infection. Diarrhea is usually sudden, painless and watery and may be accompanied by vomiting. In the most serious cases, fluid losses can be one liter per hour, although as a rule the amount lost is much smaller. In others, the large decrease in water and salt causes marked dehydration, with intense thirst, muscle cramps, weakness and minimal urine production. The loss of fluid in the tissues causes very sunken eyes and very wrinkled skin on the extremities. If left untreated, the severe imbalances in blood volume and increased salt concentration can lead to kidney failure, shock and coma. Symptoms usually disappear within three to six days. Affected individuals usually clear the organism within two weeks, but some become permanent carriers.",
        "Causes": "It is an infection of the small intestine caused by Vibrio Cholera and other species of the same bacteria. As they are sensitive to hydrochloric acid in the stomach, people with a deficiency of this acid are more susceptible to the disease. Those who live in areas where cholera is endemic tend to gradually develop a natural immunity against the infection.",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis is made through clinical history and medical examination, and is confirmed in the laboratory by isolating the bacteria in samples of fluid from the rectum or feces.",
        "Treatment": "Around 80% of cholera cases can be treated effectively using oral rehydration alone. In severely dehydrated patients who cannot drink, intravenous fluids are administered. The objective is to replace the amount of fluid lost through diarrhea and vomiting. As soon as this condition disappears, solid food intake is permitted. Early treatment with tetracycline or another antibiotic kills the bacteria and usually stops diarrhea within 48 hours. If these measures are taken quickly, mortality is less than 1%. Otherwise, it can exceed 50%.",
        "Prevention": "Providing clean water and proper sanitation are essential to prevent cholera and other waterborne diseases. Oral vaccines are an additional control measure. The purification of supplies and the correct disposal of human excrement are essential to control this disease. Other precautions should include using boiled water and not eating raw vegetables or undercooked fish and seafood. It is equally important to wash your hands frequently, drink bottled water and give preference to peeled fruit.

    "Cholesterol": {
        "What is it?": "It is one of several substances produced by the body and is important for our health. Some of the cholesterol is produced by our body - the liver and other cells produce about 75% of the total - and the other part, about 25%, comes from our diet, from the foods of animal origin that we eat. Cholesterol is one of the best known risk factors for the occurrence of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. At high levels, it is responsible for around a third of all cardiovascular diseases in the world, being estimated to cause 18% of total cerebrovascular diseases, 56% of total ischemic heart diseases and around 4.4 million deaths. representing around 7.9% of the total. In relation to Portugal, around 68.5% of Portuguese people have cholesterol values \u200b\u200bequal to or greater than 190 mg/dl. Approximately a quarter of Portuguese people have high-risk cholesterol (>240 mg/dl) and 45.1% are at risk moderate (190-239 mg/dl).",
        "Types": "Generally speaking, it is considered that there is a \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol and a \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol. An imbalance between them increases the risk of coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction or stroke.",
        "HDL: \"good\" cholesterol": "HDL corresponds to \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol, which prevents LDL (\u201cbad cholesterol) from lodging in the artery walls, reducing the risk of myocardial infarction or stroke.;/ Ideal HDL levels should be greater than 40 mg/dL in men and 50 mg/dL in women.;/ HDL levels can be increased through physical exercise and a balanced diet. Sometimes medications designed to increase your levels may be needed.;/",
        "LDL: \"good\" cholesterol": "When blood levels are high, there is a greater risk of narrowing of the arteries, causing heart or brain disease. These plaques are called atherosclerosis. If a clot forms in an artery already narrowed by these deposits, myocardial infarction or stroke may occur.;/ Although LDL is produced by the body, some people inherit a greater tendency to produce it in large quantities, making it very important to change your lifestyle or, if necessary, seek specialized medical help. Consuming fats and foods rich in cholesterol increases this risk.;/ Triglycerides are another form of fat produced by the body. Its levels may be elevated in cases of overweight, physical inactivity, tobacco or alcohol consumption and diets rich in carbohydrates. Generally speaking, those with high triglyceride levels also have high cholesterol and LDL levels and reduced HDL levels.;/ Average cholesterol values \u200b\u200bare quite similar between men and women. There is an increase in total cholesterol with age up to the 45-54 age group, after which it appears to stabilize at a value of approximately 220 mg/dl. The percentage of cases with high-risk cholesterol in Portuguese people aged 55 and over is three times higher than in young adults under 35.",
        "Associated diseases": "As mentioned, high cholesterol is one of the main causes of coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction and stroke. This risk will be even greater in the presence of high blood pressure or diabetes. On the other hand, there are several factors that can increase the risk, such as an unhealthy diet, smoking and heredity.",
        "Surveillance": "Although cholesterol is associated with serious diseases, its presence alone does not cause any symptoms, which means that the only way to detect high cholesterol levels is by carrying out blood tests. These tests can measure the levels of LDL, HDL, total cholesterol and triglycerides. As a rule, cholesterol analysis should be performed in the following cases: Presence of coronary disease;/ Peripheral artery disease;/ AVC;/ Age over 40 years;/ Family history of cardiovascular disease;/ Overweight;/ High blood pressure or diabetes or other diseases that increase cholesterol levels;/ Your doctor will always be able to advise you on the ideal time to perform these tests and help you interpret your results.",
        "Control": "The starting point for cholesterol intervention involves counseling on dietary modification, exercise, smoking cessation, and changes in other lifestyle aspects that increase the risk of arterial disease. Food;/ In the typical Western diet, 35% of calories come from fat, providing about 400 to 500 mg of cholesterol per day. Patients with high cholesterol should be advised to eat a diet low in cholesterol and saturated fat. It is also important to limit salt intake. Diets low in fat and high in soluble fiber (found in barley, oats, and fruits and vegetables rich in pectin) can help reduce fat. The consumption of margarines rich in vegetable stanol also contributes to reducing \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol (LDL) by around 5 to 10%. Medication;/ The use of medications can be important in controlling cholesterol, helping to prevent the development of arterial disease and stabilize early artery damage. On the other hand, obstructive lesions may undergo clinical reversal after aggressive treatment with these medications. This reversal takes 6 months to 2 years, which means that treatment with these medications will only be effective if continued for long periods of time. Family members of people with high cholesterol should also be monitored, undergoing regular tests, taking care of their diet and doing physical exercise, as they may have a similar condition.

    "Biliary colic": {
        "What is it?": "Biliary colic is the clinical manifestation of the presence of stones in the gallbladder. Also known as lithiasis, it is a common condition. In Europe, around 10% of people have this disease, and it is the most common of the bile ducts. In general, it is two to three times more prevalent in women than in men. Age is important and in females it varies from 5% to 20% up to the age of 50 and from 25% to 30% after this age limit.",
        "Symptoms": "Most people, around 80%, do not complain. Contrary to popular belief, \u201cpoor digestion\u201d, fat, heartburn, increased intestinal gas, nausea, vomiting or headaches cannot be attributed to gallstone disease. The main symptom is pain or cramping in the \u201cstomach\u201d region or under the ribs on the right, which can extend to the left side, back, chest or rest of the abdomen. This pain starts suddenly, sometimes during the night, and lasts for minutes or hours. Sometimes they are accompanied by nausea, vomiting, sweating and paleness. The discomfort is due to blockage of the cystic duct or bile duct by a stone. Complications may occur due to inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis), bile ducts (cholangitis) or pancreas (pancreatitis). In these cases, the pain may be more severe and last longer. Fever and jaundice (\u201cyellow eyes\u201d) may also occur and, in general, hospital admission is required. Gallstone disease is associated with an increased risk of gallbladder cancer. However, this type of carcinoma is rare.",
        "Causes": "Most stones form in the gallbladder, which is a small sac located next to the liver, under the ribs on the right. The gallbladder stores bile, which is produced in the liver; After meals, the gallbladder contracts and bile passes into the duodenum through the bile ducts. Bile contains bilirubin and cholesterol. These substances can \u201ccrystallize\u201d because the bile in the gallbladder becomes more concentrated. One can only verify the presence of multiple crystals which, when they come together, form stones. Most are cholesterol and are formed when the bile is very concentrated in this element or the gallbladder does not empty properly. Stones are thought to form when there is an imbalance in the various components of bile, especially when it contains too much cholesterol or bile pigments. Another cause is the malfunctioning of the gallbladder, with slow or incomplete emptying during digestion. Stones of other types, such as bilirubin, may also occur in certain diseases and situations. The main causes of risk are obesity, a diet with excess animal fats and few vegetables and fruit, lack of physical exercise, rapid weight loss, which occurs in some obesity treatments, long periods of fasting, use of hormones and contraceptives. Other factors are age (over 60 years), greater prevalence in females, lithiasis in family members, pregnancy, diabetes, hemolytic anemia and liver cirrhosis.",
        "Diagnosis": "The best test is an abdominal ultrasound. However, an abdominal CT scan can also be performed. Many cases are diagnosed during tests requested for other reasons.",
        "Treatment": "The presence of gallstones does not necessarily imply treatment if there are no symptoms. In this situation, complications may only very rarely arise. Treatment is indicated in the presence of symptoms, such as biliary colic, or other complications. Treatment is also recommended, even in the absence of symptoms, in diabetic patients or those taking immunosuppressants, in the presence of a calcified gallbladder, in the case of patients who live in or frequently travel to countries with poor health care, when there is rapid weight loss or when the stones are located in the bile ducts. Surgery to remove the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) is the ideal treatment for gallstones. It can be performed using the \u201cclassic\u201d approach (through a cut in the abdominal wall) or the \u201claparoscopic\u201d approach, in which the instruments enter the abdomen through small holes. This is recommended because it is less painful and the recovery is easier. The absence of the gallbladder does not cause any major problems. Very rarely are other therapies used to dissolve stones with medication or \u201cshock waves\u201d. When these are in the bile ducts, treatment should be attempted by endoscopic examination.",
        "Prevention": "It involves preventing the formation of stones, which can be achieved by correcting some risk factors, such as obesity, a diet with excess animal fats and few vegetables and fruit, lack of physical exercise, rapid weight loss which occur in some obesity treatments, long periods of fasting, use of hormones and contraceptives.

    "Colic in children": {
        "What is it?": "Colic is the term used to describe a baby's excessive crying in the first few months of life. Colic is a common problem, occurring in around 40% of babies, and its cause is not yet well established. Excessive baby crying is a cause of anxiety and family discomfort, with effects on the baby and caregivers. A baby with colic usually cries more than 3 hours a day on more than 3 days a week. This condition begins between the 3rd and 6th week of life and resolves spontaneously around 4 months. It is difficult to distinguish colic crying from the rest of the baby's normal crying. But there are some distinctive features: Crying episodes that last about 3 hours/day;/ They have a sudden onset, without a precipitating factor, usually at night.;/ The crying episodes are more intense, with higher-pitched crying, as if they were cries of pain.;/ Crying is associated with physical signs: red face, distended and tense abdomen, extension and flexion movements of the lower limbs, hyperextension of the trunk.;/ Crying that is difficult to console;/ Before attributing crying to colic, it will be necessary to check other possible causes: hunger, pain, cold or heat, tiredness or overstimulation.",
        "What to do?": "It is essential that the baby is in a calm environment, with gentle visual and auditory stimulation. If parents feel exhausted, they should ask for help (grandparents, uncles, friends) and take a break. Sometimes you just need a few minutes of silence to regain energy and face your baby's crying more calmly. Anxious parents can pass this anxiety on to their baby, making it more difficult to control periods of crying. There are some techniques that can be used to try to calm the baby: Pacifier;/ Rock the baby calmly in your lap with rhythmic movements of low amplitude, in a calm environment, reducing visual stimulation. Despite what people say, babies at this age are not manipulative, and holding them to comfort them won't spoil them too much!;/ Rocking the baby in the carrier;/ Change the environment, always keeping in mind that the visual and sound stimulus should be gentle.;/ Warm water bath;/ Massage the abdomen, with gentle movements;/ The feeding technique can also reduce the occurrence of colic. In bottle-fed babies, you should try to feed them in a more upright position, taking a few breaks to burp; prefer a bottle with an air escape system (anti-colic) to reduce the amount of air swallowed. In babies who are exclusively breastfed, not prolonging feedings excessively and pausing in between to belch can also reduce the amount of air swallowed. There are several medications and preparations available to relieve colic, but they should only be administered with medical advice.",
        "Warning signs": "There are some signs that may raise doubts as to whether the cause of the crying is due to colic. In this case, if any of these symptoms appear, you should seek medical observation: If the baby is crying, without periods of comfort, for more than 2 hours at a time;/ Refusal to breastfeed;/ Fever (Rectal Temperature > 38\u00baC);/ If the crying occurred after a fall or trauma;/ From hunger to sleep, there are several situations that can cause tears in your child.

    "Ulcerative colitis": {
        "What is it?": "It is a chronic inflammatory disease of the intestine that affects the layer that internally lines the large intestine or colon. This mucosa becomes inflamed and has small wounds on the surface that can bleed, in addition to producing an excessive amount of secretion that eventually contains pus and blood. It can affect a variable extent of the large intestine, from just a few centimeters of the rectum to the entire colon.\u00a0This disease has a major impact on patients' lives, causing recurrent symptoms of bloody diarrhea, rectal urgency and a painful sensation caused by contracture of the anal sphincter. The usual age at which symptoms appear has two peaks: between 15 and 40 years and between 50 and 80 years. However, it can appear at any age and in any gender. It is more common when there is a first-degree relative with an inflammatory bowel disease. In 20% of cases it begins during childhood or adolescence. It is estimated that, in Portugal, it affects around 20 thousand people. The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease in Europe is around 16 new patients per 100,000 inhabitants per year. The growth of this disease has occurred in the most industrialized countries due to eating habits, environmental factors and more sedentary lifestyles.",
        "Symptoms": "Symptoms vary depending on the severity and amount of colon affected. The most common signs are bloody diarrhea, colicky abdominal pain and the urgent desire to have a bowel movement. In more serious cases, fatigue, weight loss and fever may also occur. This disease has a variable course, with periods in which it is active and others in which it is not associated with any symptoms. Although most crises respond well to treatment, serious or fatal situations can occur. In many patients, extraintestinal manifestations appear, such as oral ulcerations, changes in peripheral joints and cutaneous manifestations. The main complications of ulcerative colitis are severe bleeding; intestinal perforation; sudden dilation of the colon; osteoporosis; renal lithiasis (stones); skin and joint diseases; and increased risk of colon cancer, which is higher in individuals with involvement of the entire colon and with more than 10 years of disease progression. Therefore, regular surveillance is essential through colonoscopy, an examination that uses a colonoscope, which is a flexible instrument that allows you to examine the entire interior of the large intestine and that can collect small fragments of the mucosa for microscopic study.",
        "Causes": "Its cause is unknown. It is thought that dysregulation of the intestinal mucosa's immune system may occur, leading to an exaggerated immune response against the normal intestinal microflora, causing the typical lesions of ulcerative colitis. This anomalous response can be triggered by a certain reason, such as a virus or bacteria, and can cause inflammation of the intestine, even when the causative agent is no longer present. On the other hand, there may be hereditary causes and the age factor, as the disease generally develops before the age of 30. It was previously thought that eating habits, stress and emotional issues could be responsible for the onset of ulcerative colitis. However, this hypothesis has not been confirmed. However, stress can worsen symptoms.",
        "Diagnosis": "In addition to the clinical history and medical examination, blood and stool tests may be requested. Confirming the diagnosis requires a colonoscopy.",
        "Treatment": "There is no cure for ulcerative colitis. Available treatments improve complaints and keep patients symptom-free for long periods of time. Therapy will depend on the severity and extent of the disease, the response to interventions already carried out and the number and severity of previous attacks. In individuals with severe, very frequent acute attacks or with colon lesions with a high risk of malignancy, hospitalization and surgical intervention may be necessary. Most patients can follow a normal diet, without dietary restrictions, with the exception of periods when diarrhea occurs, in which a low-fiber, lactose-free diet must be followed. The most commonly used medications are aminosalicylates, which help control inflammation, corticosteroids, immunomodulators and newer medications, such as infliximab, which are useful when patients do not respond to conventional treatment. Therapies can also be used to relieve pain, diarrhea or treat possible infections.",
        "Prevention": "As there is no known cause for ulcerative colitis, prevention is not possible. It is important to highlight that anti-inflammatories can worsen symptoms. Given the association between ulcerative colitis and colon cancer, regular colonoscopy screening is strongly recommended, at intervals of one to two years, always validated by the doctor.

        "What is it?": "Femoro-acetabular conflict was recently identified and corresponds to a condition in which there is a mechanical conflict between the femur and the acetabulum (cavity of the iliac bone where the head of the femur fits). In this condition, there is an anomaly in the shape of the bones in the hip region, which does not allow for proper fitting, causing excessive friction between them, which leads to wear. In femoro-acetabular impingement, bone spurs develop in the head of the femur and/or acetabulum that force the bones to bump against each other instead of sliding smoothly. This friction wears down the articular cartilage, causing osteoarthritis. It is the most common hip disease in young adults and mainly affects athletes, especially dancers, martial arts or yoga practitioners, roller hockey and football players. In fact, in these sporting activities, there are repeated large-amplitude hip movements, forcing anomalous contact between the different structures of the hip joint.",
        "Symptoms": "The number of people affected by femoroacetabular impingement is unknown, although it is estimated that this disease affects around 25% of people. Some people can live long, active lives with this problem and never complain. When symptoms appear, cartilage damage has already occurred and the disease is likely to progress. Most patients are young and active and the conflict manifests itself as pain in the groin area or, sometimes, on the outer side of the hip. Stiffness also occurs and some patients limp. The onset of complaints may be gradual or related to trauma, which may even be insignificant. These tend to be of the mechanical type, associated with certain movements or positions (such as getting out of the car, crossing your leg, getting up from a chair or sitting for a long time. The pain becomes worse during sports activities and prolonged sitting. In some cases, pain can be felt in the knee, which can create difficulties in diagnosis. In women with deep or prominent hips, groin pain may occur during sexual activity. There are other diseases that cause symptoms similar to those of femoro-acetabular conflict, such as changes in the lumbar or sacroiliac spine, hip synovitis, avascular necrosis of the femoral head, hip dysplasia, some tendinitis and weaknesses in the abdominal wall (with or without hernia). There are some cases in which there is femoroacetabular impingement without any symptoms, so correct diagnosis is essential for therapeutic success. Sometimes, it is during a sporting activity in which maximum hip flexion occurs that this previously latent disease becomes evident. In femoro-acetabular conflict, it is essential to evaluate joint range of motion and determine which movements are painful, as well as evaluating whether the tests reproduce the complaints that motivated the patient to come to the consultation.",
        "Causes": "As mentioned, this conflict occurs because the bones in the hip region did not form properly during the growth phase. When this occurs, there is little or nothing that can be done to prevent femoroacetabular conflict. Since people with intense physical activity exercise their hips more vigorously, in these cases painful symptoms may occur earlier than in less active people. In addition to sporting activities, there are other risk factors to consider, such as trauma, the use of corticosteroids or previous surgeries. However, it is important to remember that exercise is not the cause of femoroacetabular impingement.",
        "Diagnosis": "On physical examination, there is limited hip mobility, particularly internal rotation. Inguinal pain may be aroused or aggravated by internal rotation, flexion, and adduction of the femur. In fact, there are specific tests and maneuvers that the doctor will perform to make a correct diagnosis. Radiographic examinations, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are relevant for the correct characterization of this clinical condition.",
        "Treatment": "When symptoms first appear, it is important to identify the activities that caused the pain. Sometimes, stopping these activities, letting the legs rest and using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be enough to control the situation. If symptoms persist, it is important to seek medical help. The longer the conflict lasts, the greater the damage caused to the hip region. If the patient has conflict factors but has no complaints, nothing should be done. If there are complaints related to the sporting activity that the patient wishes to continue, the solution will be surgical. Surgery involves reconstructing the anatomy, correcting the conflict factors and associated injuries. This correction must be performed without delay in individuals with complaints before irreversible damage to the cartilage sets in. Physiotherapy, in an attempt to gain mobility, worsens the problem and is therefore contraindicated. However, some exercises can increase the range of movement of the hip and strengthen the muscles of this joint, thus relieving stress on the damaged cartilage. There are three techniques for surgical correction of the conflict: Arthroscopy is the least invasive technique, but it requires a lot of experience.;/ Surgical dislocation, the original impingement correction technique, is the most aggressive, but it is the only one capable of adequately correcting some types of impingement.;/ The anterior mini-invasive technique, associated with image intensifier and arthroscopy, is minimally invasive, allows rehabilitation very similar to arthroscopy and corrects most conflicts.;/",
        "Prevention": "Although it is estimated that femoroacetabular impingement may occur in 25% of the population, not all cases will progress to cartilage damage, with pain and osteoarthritis. Everything will depend on the overload exerted on the different structures in the hip region. In the case of practicing sports already mentioned as potentially associated with the development of this disease, due to the flexion and twisting movements they require, it is important to seek medical advice as soon as possible. As each person has a different natural rotation, it is important to practice the sport using this natural rotation. For example, in the case of running, some people run with their feet pointing forward and others place their feet slightly inward. It is important that you maintain the most natural posture throughout the run. It is important that you maintain the most natural posture throughout the run.

    "Conjunctivitis": {
        "What is it?": "There is a very thin and transparent membrane in the eyes, which covers the surface of the cornea and the inner part of the eyelids, protecting them from foreign substances. Sometimes this membrane - called the conjunctiva - becomes inflamed due to an allergic reaction or the action of a virus or bacteria. When this happens, the blood vessels in the eyes widen, turn red, and symptoms such as itching, tearing and discharge appear. Conjunctivitis can affect both eyes simultaneously and, although it is not particularly serious nor does it usually leave sequelae, it can become quite uncomfortable and make normal activities difficult.",
        "Symptoms": "Different types of conjunctivitis can have different symptoms. Some only occur seasonally and others are felt all year round. However, there are symptoms that are common to most cases: Red and watery eyes;/ Swollen eyelids;/ Itching or burning;/ Light intolerance;/ Feeling of sand in the eyes;/ Secretions;/",
        "Causes": "There are three main forms of conjunctivitis, distinguished according to their origin: Allergic Conjunctivitis is the most common of the three, and is estimated to currently affect a third of the Brazilian population. It occurs after exposure to allergens such as pollens (and is therefore particularly common in spring), animal dander or dust mites. It usually affects both eyes, but is not contagious. Infectious Conjunctivitis is transmitted by viruses, fungi or bacteria that come into contact with the eyes and can be contagious, being transmitted through direct contact with affected people, sharing face towels and other eye hygiene objects or even water from the pool. Toxic Conjunctivitis is caused by exposure to cigarette smoke, hair dye, cleaning products and other potentially toxic agents, as well as taking certain medications. Bacterial conjunctivitis usually causes thicker, yellowish and more abundant secretions than viral conjunctivitis (whiter) or allergic conjunctivitis (lighter).",
        "When should I suspect allergic conjunctivitis?": "Allergic conjunctivitis is a common ocular pathology with potential impact on the patient's quality of life. Generally associated with complaints of allergic rhinitis, it can also appear in isolation. Typical symptoms of the disease are itchy eyes, red eyes, tearing, swelling and local pain or discomfort (foreign body sensation). These signs can range from mild and seasonal to very intense and persist throughout the year. If the eyes tend to be red, painful, itchy or watery and if contact with dust, pets (cat, dog), pollen or other allergens causes itching and watering, this means that we have allergic conjunctivitis.",
        "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis is based on clinical observation and symptoms, and may require examination with a slit lamp in the ophthalmology office. If bacterial conjunctivitis is suspected, eye secretion can be collected with a cotton swab and sent for analysis in the laboratory.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment largely depends on the cause, but lubricating eye drops (such as artificial tears), antibiotic ointments and antihistamines may be prescribed to relieve symptoms. In general, you should: Wash your eyelids regularly to keep them free of secretions.;/ Wash your hands before and after applying eye drops or ointments;/ Apply cold compresses to reduce swelling;/ Do not wear contact lenses;/ Change pillowcases and face towels daily;/ Avoid direct exposure to light or sunlight;/ Decrease exposure to allergens or other potentially irritating agents (such as tobacco smoke);/ Avoid swimming in lakes or pools;/",
        "Prevention": "Although it is not easy to prevent conjunctivitis, some basic hygiene practices can reduce the risk of contracting it: Wash your hands and face frequently;/ Avoid rubbing or scratching your eyes;/ Do not share face towels;/ Do not share eye cosmetics or use other people's eye cosmetics.;/ Cleveland Clinic Load more;/ Prolonged exposure to television, cell phone and computer screens can have negative effects on your eyes.

    "Coxartrose": {
        "What is it?": "Coxarthrosis results from inflammation or injury to the coxofemoral joint with changes in the cartilage, pain, swelling and deformation of the joint. It is defined by an alteration of the femoral lame joint (pelvis and femur), with repercussions on mobility and the presence of symptoms and pain. In Coxarthrosis there is wear of the articular cartilage of the acetabulum and femoral head.",
        "Symptoms": "The earliest symptom of coxarthrosis is mechanical pain, with effort or exercise involving weight on the lower limbs. The pain is typically in the groin area but can also be located in the thigh, buttock, lateral region of the hip or even the knee. As the disease progresses, there may be a decrease in joint range of motion (joint stiffness), manifested by difficulty in squatting, putting on shoes or socks and even changes in gait.",
        "Causes": "The causes of osteoarthritis are not known. However, factors that can contribute to coxarthrosis include joint injury, advanced age, being overweight, and activities that involve significant wear and tear on the joints.",
        "Diagnosis": "X-rays are usually the first-line test. In them it is possible to identify the reduction of the joint interline, osteophytes, thickening of the subchondral bone and bone cysts. In the early stages of the disease, these changes may not be visible and MRI may be necessary to identify changes in the acetabular labrum, changes in the thickness and quality of the articular cartilage and the eventual occurrence of small bone cysts.",
        "Treatment": "In the initial stages, treatment is non-surgical and involves avoiding strain and exercises that put weight on the lower limbs, as well as controlling weight. It is advisable to maintain joint movement and muscle strengthening. Pain must be controlled with analgesic and anti-inflammatory medication. The main goal of treatment is to increase mobility, including improving hip joint function, control pain, and improve quality of life. Treatment plans may involve: Joint rest and/or guided exercise to promote recovery of mobility;/ Lose weight;/ Use of support (crusader, cane) to relieve weight on the affected hip;/ Use of non-pharmacological techniques for pain control;/ Pharmacological therapy for pain control, including: paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and other analgesics;/ Surgical techniques such as total hip replacement and deresurfacing technique;/",

    "Claw toe, hammer toe": {
        "What is it?": "Hammer toe, also known as claw toe, is a deformity of the fingers. A traumatic injury that produces a sudden and intense flexion of the distal phalanx. Generally caused by rupture of the extensor tendon or the tearing of a bone fragment from this joint. Deformities of the second to fifth toes are very common, affecting both the proximal interphalangeal joint (first finger joint) and the distal interphalangeal joint (second finger joint), resulting from an imbalance in the entire articular and muscular architecture of the foot. . These deformities are initially mild and correctable, but over time they become rigid and unrecoverable by manipulation. They are often associated with hallux valgus (bunion), metatarsalgia (pain in the sole of the foot), and retraction of the Achilles tendon or short calves. Other less common causes should also be considered, as treatment may be different in these cases.",
        "Symptoms": "Patients present calluses (hyperkeratosis) in places where these deformities come into contact with shoes (due to being tight or due to bone hyperpressure). Wounds or ulcers can even form, usually on the tips of the fingers or in the dorsal region of the interphalangeal joints, sometimes making it difficult to wear your usual shoes.",
        "Causes": "The muscles in each toe work in pairs; When an imbalance arises between the force exerted by the muscles, finger deformity may arise. Muscle imbalance puts exaggerated pressure on the tendons and joints of the toe, forcing it into a hammer shape. Risk factors include: Flat foot;/ Genes: There is a hereditary tendency to develop hammertoes based on flat or high-arched feet;/ Arthritis;/ Injury: ill-fitting shoes, especially those that are too narrow, short, pointed or high as they put excessive pressure on the toes;/ Aging;/",
        "Diagnosis": "A careful clinical examination and x-ray of both feet allow an accurate diagnosis to be made and the severity and associated changes to other structures of the foot to be assessed.",
        "Treatment": "In the initial phase, while the deformities are flexible, manipulation and stretching exercises of the leg and foot muscles are recommended. In the absence of wounds or infection, an insole or the use of specific silicone orthoses may also be used. The use of adapted shoes is an alternative in patients in whom surgical intervention is not an option. In cases of persistent pain and deformity, surgical intervention is indicated. The different types of surgical corrections depend mainly on the underlying cause and include excision (arthroplastic resection) or fusion (arthrodesis) of the painful joint, lengthening or transfer of tendons, and section (osteotomy) of the phalanx or metatarsal.",
        "Prevention": "Prevention of these problems is mainly based on wearing appropriate shoes and taking care of your feet. Regular monitoring of the condition of the foot - especially important in diabetic patients or with any other medical condition that causes poor circulation or numbness in the toes. This way, problems can be detected early.;/ Promoting good circulation in the lower limbs is essential - remember that even sitting, you must keep your feet elevated and exercise your legs; Foot massage also promotes circulation.;/  Above all, suitable shoes must be worn: Most people have one foot larger than the other; when trying on shoes, consider the foot with the larger volume.;/ Shoes must have good arch support and not be pointy or narrow.;/ When purchasing new shoes, you should wear the appropriate socks - for example, sports socks when purchasing sports shoes;/ As you age, your feet get bigger and you should only keep the same shoes as long as they fit comfortably.;/ You should keep about a centimeter and a half between the tip of your longest toe and the tip of the shoe.;/ The footwear should be sturdy, so that it only bends at the toe, but never buy footwear that feels tight in the expectation that it will stretch with use.;/ If you have hammer toes and bunions, you should avoid shoes with many seams and poorly malleable areas that do not adapt to the deformities.;/  Record: Your heel should not feel loose inside the shoe when you walk.;/ The higher the heel, the less safe it is;/ Children's shoes should be checked frequently to ensure they are still appropriate for the size of their growing feet.;/ WebMD Load more;/ Having a cast on your arm or leg helps you recover from fractures and reduces pain.

    "Attention deficit": {
        "What is it?": "Attention deficit corresponds to the occurrence of scarce or brief periods of attention and impulsiveness exaggerated for one's age. This deficit may or may not be associated with hyperactivity. Although it is more common in children, it can also affect adults. This problem affects about 5% to 10% of school-age children and is 10 times more common in boys than girls. The first manifestations usually appear before the age of four and almost always before the age of seven. Attention deficit, whether isolated or associated with hyperactivity, generates problems at home, at school, at work and in interpersonal relationships, which is why its recognition and approach are fundamental.",
        "Symptoms": "Its main characteristic is the difficulty in maintaining continuous levels of attention, concentration and persistence in tasks. A child suffering from this disorder may also be impulsive and hyperactive. Attention deficit disorder in preschool age is associated with anxiety, communication and relationship problems, and inappropriate behavior. Other common signs include constant leg restlessness, hand shaking and rubbing, impulsive speech, forgetfulness, and disorganization. Aggression is rare. About 20% of children with this condition have learning difficulties, and about 90% perform poorly at school. Depression, anxiety or aggression may occur during adolescence. Although impulsivity and hyperactivity tend to decrease with age, inattention and associated symptoms may persist into adulthood.",
        "Causes": "It is thought to be hereditary. Some studies indicate that it is caused by abnormalities in brain neurotransmitters. Attention deficit may be reinforced by the family or school environment. Some investigations suggest that it may be associated with environmental factors such as exposure to cigarette smoke or alcohol during pregnancy. It is thought that being exposed to high levels of lead (paint on old buildings) may be another cause of risk to consider.",
        "Diagnosis": "It is based on the quantity, frequency and severity of symptoms. This is a difficult diagnosis, as it depends on a subjective assessment. Symptoms may be present in other conditions and these children may present other problems that are associated with different manifestations.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment, as a rule, combines the use of medication with behavioral therapy carried out by a child psychologist, adapted to each case. When children are not very aggressive and are in a stable family environment, treatment with medication may be sufficient. Children with attention deficit disorder do not usually fully overcome their difficulties. The problems persist into adolescence and adulthood and include academic failure, low self-esteem, anxiety, depression and difficulties in maintaining appropriate social behavior. In general, these people seem to adapt better to work situations than to school. When left untreated, the risk of alcohol or drug abuse and the rate of suicide tend to be higher than in the general population. It is important to emphasize that therapy can alleviate many of the symptoms but there is no cure for this condition.",
        "Prevention": "During pregnancy, it is important to abstain from anything that could harm the development of the fetus, such as alcohol, tobacco, drugs or environmental toxins. Children must also be protected from tobacco smoke, industrial or agricultural chemicals, and lead paint.

    "Congenital deformities of the upper limb": {
        "What is it?": "Congenital deformities are deformities that are present at birth. Any type of deformity becomes a challenge as children grow. Those that affect the hands and remaining arms are particularly disabling as children learn to interact with the environment through the use of their hands. These anomalies range from simple to severe, examples of this spectrum being having less or more than 5 fingers, having fingers that do not bend, that are too short or too long, that are joined together, having arms that are curved, joints that are not completely formed and not moving as expected or having parts of the arm that have not formed. Some of these deformities appear associated with other problems, but others appear in isolation.  How to react? Although it is normal for parents to feel shocked, disappointed or guilty, it is important to realize that they could rarely have done anything to interfere with the baby's development and prevent the malformation from occurring. The baby, despite the deformity, has the same needs as any newborn and does not have pain or any type of suffering associated with the deformity it has. A hand surgery appointment should be scheduled immediately after birth. Although surgery is not always or immediately indicated, it is important to determine the need for rehabilitation with physiotherapy or occupational therapy and the possible referral for a genetics consultation.",
        "Causes": "There are many causes for congenital deformities, some can be explained but others have no known causes. The process of a baby's development from a fertilized egg is very complex, it involves millions of complicated steps and there can be errors in any of these. The upper limb, which comprises the arm, forearm and hand, forms between the 4th and 7th week of pregnancy, when the baby is less than 2.5 cm. It is estimated that 1 in every 20 babies will have some imperfection, of greater or lesser severity and complexity. Some congenital anomalies are inherited, but they can skip generations or may result from a combination of genetic anomalies carried by the parents. Other genetic alterations are new to the family, with the child having the anomaly for the first time but still presenting a risk of passing it on to their descendants. Other birth defects have non-genetic causes. Some medications, such as the well-known thalidomide and some drugs used in chemotherapy, are known to cause birth defects. Alcohol, tobacco and drugs affect the development of the fetus but are not specifically related to upper limb malformations. Congenital constrictive bands, commonly called amniotic bands, are amniotic bands equivalent to threads that, when wrapped around the upper limbs (arm, forearm and hands) or lower limbs (thigh, leg and foot) can lead to various deformities, from creases to or less deep up to amputations. In other situations, the reason for the malformation is not known. One of the numerous steps in the development of the fetus is not completed effectively, resulting in the changes found",
        "Treatment": "The goal for any child with a congenital malformation is to have function of the involved limb as close to normal as possible. To achieve this objective, it may be necessary to carry out rehabilitation with physiotherapy or occupational therapy, the use of splints or prostheses or surgery. Each child must be evaluated individually and treatment must be chosen according, not only to the deformity present, but also to difficulties in function.

    "Age-related macular degeneration": {
        "What is Age-Related Macular Degeneration?": "Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a degenerative disease of the central area of \u200b\u200bthe retina (macula) that leads to a marked and irreversible decrease in central vision, with preservation of peripheral vision. Its incidence and prevalence have been increasing, which is a result of the general aging of the population, the increase in the situations involved in its onset and also the improvement in diagnostic capacity. Age-old Macular Degeneration (AMD) is the main cause of blindness in Western countries. In general, the disease appears after the age of 55 and is progressive, increasing in prevalence with age. In Portugal, around 12% of people aged 55 or over suffer from Age Macular Degeneration (AMD). The earliest form accounts for around 85% to 90% of cases and, as a rule, does not cause relevant symptoms. Late or advanced forms (macular degeneration with geographic atrophy and exudative macular degeneration) are responsible for 10% to 15% of occurrences and can cause severe and irreversible loss of central or reading vision. It is estimated that in Portugal there are around 310 thousand people with the early form and around 45 thousand with the late or advanced form (30 thousand with the exudative form and 15 thousand with the geographic atrophy form). Every year around 45 thousand new cases arise with the early form of the disease and around five thousand with the late form. Early infections can progress to late injuries and the risk increases with age and the severity of the predisposing injuries, with the risk of annual progression reaching 10%. Age-old Macular Degeneration (AMD) has a significant impact on the lives of patients and their families and represents an enormous burden in economic terms for healthcare systems.",
        "Symptoms of Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)": "In most cases, in the first stage, it only affects one eye and the other will compensate for the loss of vision, so the patient may not notice the disease, which delays its diagnosis. The most common complaints are the perception of image distortion in the central area, which leads to a decrease in central visual acuity. This disorder prevents clear vision and impairs reading, with a progressive reduction in the central area of \u200b\u200bthe visual field. This progression can completely prevent reading. There is also a decrease in contrast sensitivity.",
        "Causes": "The causes are not yet well known. The following constitute risk elements: Age;/ Family history;/ Smoking;/ Deficiencies in vitamins and trace elements, chronic exposure to intense light and ultraviolet radiation, high blood pressure and atherosclerosis are cited as potential factors in the prevalence of the disease. Some studies suggest a relationship between daily consumption of acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin\u00ae) and a greater risk of developing macular degeneration. Other causes are gender (more common in women), ethnicity (Caucasians have a higher prevalence) and light-colored eyes.",
        "Diagnosis": "The use of a checkerboard grid (Amsler grid) placed at a distance of around 30 centimeters makes it possible to assess the presence of distortions in the different lines. This test must be performed with one eye at a time. The ophthalmological examination allows direct observation of the retina and macular area. Performing an angiography, which allows the retinal circulation to be seen, highlights macular degeneration, which can present itself in different stages, from the earliest to the most advanced forms, with a pattern of atrophy or exudation. Optical coherence tomography allows the evaluation of the different layers of the retina and provides very detailed information about the changes present.",
        "Treatment of Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)": "Treatment with a complete cure is still difficult, if not impossible. Prophylactic therapy for early forms, with high-dose vitamin and mineral supplements, such as zinc, may be indicated for patients at higher risk of progression. As for late forms, geographic atrophy has no known treatment. The exudative form can be treated with laser photocoagulation, photodynamic therapy or intraocular injections of substances capable of improving or controlling the degenerative process. Current therapies for exudative forms allow the vision existing at the start of treatment to be preserved in around 70% to 90% of cases and improve it in around 30%. For these treatments to be effective, early diagnosis is essential.",
        "Prevention": "Possible prevention is related to risk factors, namely smoking, hypertension, nutritional deficiencies and exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Adopting a healthy lifestyle can prevent the onset of diseases such as Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD), among others. Therefore, it is important: No smoking;/ Wear properly certified sunglasses to protect your eyes from UV rays;/ Wear a peaked hat to create eye shadow;/ Reduce saturated fats and cholesterol in your diet, as well as alcohol consumption;/ Keep your blood pressure low;/ Avoid being overweight;/ Practice physical exercise;/ Consult an ophthalmologist at least once a year;/ Eat a diet rich in fruit and vegetables (foods rich in antioxidants, such as carrots, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, spinach, corn, broccoli, peas, green beans, tomatoes, lettuce, turnip greens and turnip greens);/ Prof. J.

    "Dementia": {
        "What is it?": "Dementia is a generic term used to designate a set of diseases in which there is a deterioration in cognitive and behavioral performance, affecting autonomy. There are several types of dementia and few can be effectively treated or prevented. However, it is believed that a healthy lifestyle can delay the onset of most.",
        "Dementia without loss of autonomy": "When there is cognitive performance lower than age and education but the patient is able to perform all the tasks he previously assumed, he has a mild cognitive defect. This category represents a transitional state between normality and dementia, and conversion occurs at a rate of 15% per year.",
        "What functions can be lost with dementia?": "The main cognitive domains that can be affected are: The ability to organize, plan, decide and judge (executive functions);;/ The ability to retain and recall information (memory);;/ The ability for verbal expression and understanding (language);;/ The ability to recognize people and objects (gnosis);;/ The ability to orientate in space and produce sequences of motor acts (praxis).;/ Each category of dementia tends to affect these cognitive domains in a relatively typical pattern. This arises, on the one hand, from the predilection that each of them has for certain regions of the brain and, on the other, from the relevance that each of these categories assumes for each cognitive function.",
        "How are dementias classified?": "There are several classifications used, one of which has proven to be most clinically useful divides them into: Primary (degenerative, in which dementia is the disease itself);;/ Secondary (in which there is another pathology that manifests as dementia);;/ Among the latter, there are some that can be treated and/or prevented, highlighting the importance of a correct diagnosis, to which the detailed collection of clinical history, neurological and neuropsychological examination, and the comprehensive use of laboratory and imaging tests contribute.",
        "What are the most common dementias?": "The main ones are: Alzheimer's disease (which accounts for about two-thirds of all cases);;/ Frontotemporal dementia;;/ Dementia with Lewy bodies;;/ Vascular dementia (of these, the only secondary).;/",
        "What is the prevalence rate of dementia?": "When it comes to frequency, the most abundant epidemiological data refers to Alzheimer's disease. Its prevalence rate, which increases exponentially with age, varies from up to 1% between 60 and 65 years old to almost 50% over 90 years old, estimating a total of more than 150 thousand patients in Portugal and 35 million worldwide .",
        "Symptoms": "Symptoms are mainly due to memory changes that can worsen over the years: Loss of recent memories;/ Difficulty perceiving common time and space - where you are, what day or year it is;/ Difficulty in oral and written communication and use of incorrect words;/ Loss of common objects and difficulty with daily tasks;/ Loss of initiative and interests;/ Mood and personality changes, unexplained irritability;/",
        "Causes": "Dementia can be caused by loss of brain cells and neurodegenerative diseases that occur with age, however, aging does not mean dementia! Other causes of dementia can be: stroke, trauma, brain tumor, cerebrovascular disease, depression, alcoholism.",
        "Diagnosis": "It is performed by the attending physician who analyzes the patient's history and performs a physical examination. Important factors are: changes in attention, orientation, memory, judgment, language, motor and spatial skills; exclusion of other pathologies - by definition, dementia is not due to major depression or schizophrenia. Additional tests may include memory and psychometric tests, blood and urine tests, imaging tests (MRI, CT scan), electroencephalogram, etc., depending on the type of manifestations of the disease.",
        "Treatment": "If we exclude the small percentage of treatable causes of dementia, for the majority there is no curative treatment or treatment that alters the natural history of the disease. However, there are already very useful drugs, either to optimize cognitive functions (such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or memantine) or to reduce behavioral dysfunction (such as antidepressants and anti-psychotics).",
        "Prevention": "There is no definitive way to prevent dementia, but it is possible to indicate some precautions to be taken: In Alzheimer's disease, a healthy lifestyle is beneficial, with a balanced diet, regular physical exercise, moderate wine consumption and adequate control of vascular risk factors, especially high blood pressure.;/ In the case of vascular dementia, this takes on an even more relevant role, combined with pharmacological strategies to prevent new cerebral infarctions.;/ One of the most attractive theories points to cognitive reserve, resulting from multiple variables (such as intelligence quotient, level of education, participation in cultural and leisure activities), as responsible for greater resistance to cognitive deterioration. Thus, the greater an individual's reserve, the later he or she becomes clinically ill, although his or her brain may have already shown histological signs of the pathology for many years.;/ Cleveland Clinic Medical News Today There are some signs associated with memory loss that require medical advice and others that are not concerning.

    "Dengue": {
        "What is it?": "Dengue is an infection caused by a flavivirus and is transmitted through the bite of female mosquitoes of the genus Aedes, particularly Ae. aegypti, infected with the virus, with no person-to-person transmission. Ae. aegypti, also transmits zika and chikungunya. It is possible to contract dengue up to 4 times, as the virus has four different serotypes (DENV1, DENV2, DENV3 and DENV4), and one serotype does not generate immunity against the others. In the last 50 years, cases of dengue have increased worldwide. Every year, 390 million cases of dengue are recorded in the world and of these, 96 million manifest themselves at a clinical level. The World Health Organization estimates that around 4 billion people live in areas at risk of infection with the disease, which is present in 128 countries and is most common in tropical and subtropical areas. For example, in Brazil, where dengue is considered a public health problem, dengue epidemics have been identified since the 19th century. To date, no mosquitoes transmitting the dengue virus have been detected in mainland Portugal and all diagnosed cases were imported from endemic regions.",
        "Symptoms": "Dengue fever has an incubation period of 3 to 7 days, and can last up to 14 days. Dengue fever symptoms appear between 3 and 14 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito. The disease is generally manifested by: High fever;/ Headaches;/ Pain behind the eyes;/ Muscle and joint pain;/ Vomiting;/ Red spots on the skin;/ In more serious cases, a hemorrhagic condition occurs - hemorrhagic dengue - in the skin, mucous membranes and internal organs, which can cause death. The likelihood of the disease getting worse is greater in those who have previously contracted the infection than in those who have never been infected.",
        "Causes": "The dengue virus is contracted through a mosquito bite. This insect is small, brown, with a white stripe on each side of the thorax and several white stripes on the legs. Their feeding, reproduction and egg laying occurs during the day and the mosquito is most active in the early morning and late afternoon. Since females need human blood to mature their eggs, this is when the disease can be transmitted.",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of dengue is normally made through blood tests, which allow detecting the presence of antibodies against this virus. However, it does not allow identifying which of the four dengue serotypes is responsible for the infection.",
        "Treatment": "There is no specific medication against dengue fever and its treatment is symptomatic, including: combating fever, maintaining hydration, relieving pain and, in the most serious cases, hospital admission and intravenous therapy. It is important to drink plenty of fluids and you should not take medications containing acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, known as Aspirin\u00ae) or anti-inflammatories, as they can increase the risk of bleeding.",
        "Prevention": "Since 2015, there has been a vaccine against dengue, recommended for people between 9 and 45 years old who live in areas considered endemic or at risk. Currently, one of the most effective forms of prevention against dengue fever includes combating mosquitoes, eliminating the places where they lay their eggs, usually places with stagnant water (for example, abandoned material such as disused tires, cans, bottles, vase plates plants, animal drinking fountains, ponds, wells and swimming pools). For that: Avoid using saucers on plant pots and, if you do, fill them with sand up to the brim.;/ Keep trash cans covered and drains closed and unclogged.;/ Brush your pet's food and water bowls at least once a week.;/ Clean the house's gutters, removing debris that could obstruct the passage of water.;/ Flush seldom-used toilets at least once a week and keep their lids closed.;/ Good basic sanitation conditions are fundamental in the prevention strategy, as is the rational use of insecticides to combat mosquitoes.

    "Substance dependence": {
        "What is it?": "It is defined as a dependence on a \"toxic\" or drug that additionally causes psychological disturbances. Drugs are not all the same in terms of their toxicity: some are very toxic, others, like alcohol, can be ingested in a controlled way by many people without major problems. On the other hand, heroin, unlike alcohol, is a drug with fewer long-term toxic effects but has an enormous capacity to create dependence. It is important, therefore, to distinguish dependence caused by different substances because they have different characteristics and it is possible to use some of them in a non-abusive way. What makes a substance truly dangerous, as well as what induces and maintains its consumption, is a set of factors that interact dynamically and are related to the pharmacological properties of the substance, the psychological characteristics of the consumer and the social environment that surrounds them. This means that different people in different environments have a greater or lesser potential to become dependent on the same substance. Compulsion for drugs or other substances is defined when different criteria are present simultaneously: A strong desire to consume them;;/ Difficulties in controlling behavior, both in terms of start, end and consumption levels;;/ Physiological withdrawal state when use ceases or is reduced;;/ Evidence of tolerance, in which increasing doses are required to obtain an effect initially obtained with lower doses;;/ Progressive abandonment of alternative pleasures and interests in favor of their use and increasing the amount of time needed to recover from their effects;;/ Persistence in its use, despite evidence of manifestly harmful consequences.;/",
        "Symptoms": "Many begin merely casually, in a certain social context. This consumption becomes more habitual until it acquires the characteristics of an addiction, requiring increasingly larger quantities and increasingly frequent use. Over time, this substance becomes essential for a person to feel well and be able to function in their daily lives. Absence of this substance generates physical and emotional discomfort (withdrawal). Typical manifestations include the feeling of needing to consume it more and more regularly, the inability to stop, the need to always keep a supply of the substance, excessive spending of money, often beyond one's means, the impression that its use is essential to overcome daily problems, the carrying out of risky activities under the influence of this element and the increasing expenditure of time and energy in obtaining and using it. It is sometimes difficult to distinguish substance dependence from the behavioral changes that are common in adolescence. In adolescents, this problem should be suspected if they experience problems at school (absences, lack of interest, poor performance), lack of energy or motivation, unkempt appearance, changes in behavior, or excessive spending of money.",
        "Causes": "It is related to the chemical characteristics of the drug or substance, the psychological profile of the consumer and the environment in which he or she is inserted. In terms of characteristics, tobacco and coffee, for example, do not significantly alter consumer behavior and, therefore, are compatible with a normal social life. However, tobacco may not cause changes in behavior but can cause serious health problems. Marijuana, on the contrary, causes behavioral changes, which can make it dangerous, for example when driving vehicles, but the way in which it is consumed ( generally smoking fewer cigarettes per day), probably has fewer health implications than tobacco. In terms of their ability to cause addiction, heroin, cocaine and alcohol are the most dangerous. Tobacco, cannabinoids, coffee, ecstasy and LSD are those that cause milder dependence. In terms of the psychological characteristics of the consumer, adolescence is a difficult phase for around a third of young people, which can lead to frustrations that lead to an escape into these substances. Adolescence is, by definition, a time of experimentation and searching for the limits of the \"self\", which often leads to initiation into drugs. The male gender tends to be the most affected by its consumption, although women, after initiation, have a faster and more degrading path. Low tolerance to frustration, low self-esteem, the need for social approval, the systematic non-acceptance of social norms, and a predisposition to mental illness are other characteristics that make some people more susceptible to resorting to these substances and becoming dependent on them. It is important to note that cannabinoids are relatively harmless, but in certain predisposed individuals they can accelerate the onset of serious mental illnesses, such as psychosis. Cocaine, amphetamines, ecstasy and LSD can also induce psychotic episodes in certain users. On the other hand, there appears to be a genetic predisposition to addiction. With regard to the environment, the role of the family, school and workplace can be decisive in the emergence of an addiction or, conversely, in its early detection and correction. Socioeconomic level is also relevant, and the impact of social communication and advertising must also be mentioned.",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis often begins with a family doctor or family member but must be confirmed by a psychiatrist, in accordance with internationally defined criteria. Testing for substances in the blood does not allow for a diagnosis but aims to check whether recent consumption has occurred.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment should always be individualized. In some cases, an inpatient regimen is effective because it stops the progression and worsening of symptoms associated with the disease, as well as its impact on the patient's health, family, work or finances. On the other hand, it must include a psychosocial component, where the individual relearns new skills and abilities that provide him with a better quality of life. Psychosocial therapy includes the entire assessment and diagnosis process, in a safe treatment environment free from legal and illegal drugs, with permanent pharmacological support and supervision, a personalized and structured intervention plan, individual and group psychotherapy, education on addictions and abstinence, social activities, family programs and a post-treatment/integration phase, already on an outpatient basis for one year. All of these steps aim at the full recovery of the dependent individual and their reintegration into the community. This work can and should be complemented by medical treatment of all complications and/or illnesses that may be associated with or caused by substance dependence. Drugs are equally essential to offset the effects of withdrawal and allow for a less painful recovery.",
        "Prevention": "The best way to prevent addiction to a substance is to not consume it. As this can occur even with medications prescribed by a doctor, it is important to respect the doses and inform the healthcare professional about any symptoms of dependence. In adolescents, prevention involves good communication skills within the family, constant attention to warning signs, knowing how to listen and knowing how to set an example. In the case of recovered individuals, there is always a risk of relapse, which is why contact with the substance and all risk situations must be avoided.

        "What is it?": "Depression is one of the most common psychiatric illnesses. According to the World Health Organization, depression is one of the leading health problems in the developed world. It is estimated that one in four women and one in ten men may experience depression at some point in their lives and children can also be affected. There is no concrete data regarding its frequency in Portugal, but estimates refer to values \u200b\u200bof 2 to 3% for men and 5 to 9% for women for the most severe forms of depression and values \u200b\u200bgreater than 20% for more serious forms. mild severity of the disease.",
        "What distinguishes depression from sadness?": "Depression is a pathology that can go unnoticed, since its symptoms can be attributed to other causes (such as physical illnesses or stress). It is important to understand that everyone can feel sad, but that these feelings do not last long. On the contrary, depression interferes with daily activities and is associated with intense suffering. As such, depression, although common, is a serious illness. Many people with depression do not seek treatment, even though there are effective ways to treat it.",
        "Symptoms": "Depression is a mood disorder that should not be confused with feelings of sadness, which are generally reactive to life events, temporary and, generally speaking, not incompatible with a normal life. Depression can present different forms and degrees of severity and its symptoms can last for a long time, and may include: Feelings of sadness and annoyance;/ Feelings of irritability, tension or agitation;/ Feelings of distress, worry, unfounded fears and insecurity;/ Decreased energy, fatigue and sluggishness;/ Loss of interest and pleasure in daily activities;/ Sleep and sexual desire disturbance;/ Significant weight fluctuations due to appetite disturbances;/ Feelings of guilt and self-devaluation;/ Changes in concentration, memory and reasoning;/ Physical symptoms not due to another illness (headaches, digestive disorders, chronic pain, general malaise);/ Ideas of death and suicide attempts;/  Depression significantly affects work performance, family and school life and all activities of the patient, causing great suffering. In the most severe forms, symptoms may appear without any apparent relation to traumatic life events and last for several months. In milder forms, the intensity of symptoms is lower and allows daily activities to be maintained, although the feeling of fatigue, sadness and disinterest is present, and tends to last for years. In some cases, depression does not manifest itself in the form of sadness, but through symptoms such as fatigue, non-specific pain, a feeling of tightness in the chest, insomnia, digestive disorders (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), which raises the hypothesis that a different disease, making diagnosis difficult and delaying. Depression can be part of bipolar disorder, in which episodes of depression alternate with periods of excitement and euphoria. In the euphoric phases, patients' self-esteem is very high and they lose touch with reality, which can lead to excessive spending and impossible deals.",
        "Causes": "In general, depression results from a combination of genetic, biological, environmental and psychological factors: There is a hereditary tendency for some types of depression.;/ Traumatic life events contribute to the onset of depression and can trigger or facilitate depressive episodes.;/ The personality type and the way each individual deals with problems is also associated with a greater or lesser predisposition to depression.;/",
        "Treatment": "Treatment is important so that depression does not prolong and worsen. If symptoms are not recognized as part of an illness, negative evaluation by others will tend to accentuate poor personal image and reduced self-esteem. Suicide is a possibility that should not be forgotten and treatment is essential to reduce this risk and allow the symptoms of depression to improve. There are several possible treatments for depression, including antidepressant medication and psychotherapy, which should be chosen by a doctor on an individual basis. In general, these treatments must be continued for a significant period of time in order to be effective. Family and social support is an important complement to the treatment selected by the doctor. The prognosis for depression is good and depends essentially on the treatment instituted and adequate control of all risk factors present in each case.",
        "Prevention": "Although it is not possible to prevent depression, there are some lifestyle habits you can adopt to maintain your mental health: Find ways to manage stress and improve self-esteem.;/ Take good care of yourself: get enough sleep, eat a healthy diet and exercise regularly.;/ Seek support from family and friends in the most difficult times.;/ Have regular check-ups and consult your doctor if you are not feeling well.;/ Seek help if you feel depressed; don't wait, as this could make things worse.;/ American Psychological Association, 2013 Support Association for Depressive and Manic-Depressive Patients (ADEB), 2013 Gon\u00e7alves, B et al., Prevalence and diagnosis of depression in general and family medicine, Rev Port Clin Geral 2004;20:13-27 G.E.

    "Dermatitis": {
        "What is it?": "Dermatitis is an umbrella term that covers any medical condition in which inflammation of the skin occurs. There are multiple forms of this disease, the most common being seborrheic dermatitis and atopic dermatitis (eczema). Although it is not serious, it can cause intense discomfort and, as such, must be correctly diagnosed and treated. For example, contact dermatitis is the most common occupational disease, although not the most serious, and requires large losses of working days or even changes of profession. Dermatitis is a very common disease and, in relation to allergic forms, it is estimated that, in Portugal, around 10% of children present complaints compatible with dermatitis. In the case of atopic or allergic cases, in addition to cutaneous manifestations, the patient or family members present in around 80% of cases asthma and/or allergic ourinitis, which highlights the importance and impact of this type of disease.",
        "Symptoms": "Although each type of dermatitis presents different signs and symptoms, redness, swelling, itching and sores on the skin tend to be present. The main types of dermatitis and their symptoms are: Contact dermatitis, which results from repeated skin contact with irritating or allergenic substances. Symptoms appear at the point of contact (sometimes they actually outline this area) and are manifested by itching, redness and pimples, some with liquid content forming small water bubbles, or small wounds and crusts on the skin. These reactions are not immediate, they appear one or two days after contact and do not occur the first time you come into contact with the substance, requiring several exposures until the individual becomes allergic.;/ Neurodermatitis, a chronic dermatitis localized to specific areas of the skin, characterized by intense itching on the ankles, wrists, neck and arms.;/ Seborrheic dermatitis, a common type of dermatitis on the scalp and face that causes common dandruff. Sometimes the scales are dry, other times they have an oily appearance. This disease depends on the levels of sex hormones and, therefore, only manifests itself in newborns, who receive hormones from their mother, and after adolescence.;/ Stasis dermatitis, related to the accumulation of fluids under the skin in the lower limbs, interfering with the nutrition of the skin.;/ Atopic dermatitis, better known as eczema, associated with intense itching that appears and disappears. It is more common in children than in adults.;/ Perioral dermatitis, a type of dermatitis that affects the area around the mouth.;/ Diaper dermatitis, which corresponds to the traditional \u201cdiaper rash\u201d caused by irritation of the skin on the bottom of babies who wear diapers. The convex areas of the genital area become red and irritated with the bottom of the folds being spared.\u00a0It is estimated to affect between 25 and 65% of children, being most common between 6 and 12 months of age. It is caused by moisture, friction and contact with chemical and biological irritants such as urine and feces. These agents compromise the skin barrier and make the skin more vulnerable to infectious agents.\u00a0They usually resolve after 2 to 3 days without complications.;/ Dermatitis can be complicated by the appearance of infections or cellulitis, which corresponds to a serious bacterial infection and is manifested by swelling, redness, heat and pain when touched on the affected skin. Other possible complications are the formation of scars and changes in skin color.",
        "Causes": "The causes vary depending on the type of dermatitis, but generally speaking, the most common are: Other diseases;/ Allergic factors;/ Genetic factors;/ Physical or irritating factors;/ Stress;/",
        "Contact dermatitis": "Its main cause is direct contact with irritating or allergenic substances, such as detergents and other cleaning products, rubber, metals, perfumes, cosmetics, plants and some antibiotics, such as neomycin and bacitracin. The time of contact with an irritant is much longer than that required for an allergen for dermatitis to occur. When it develops for a certain substance, it will probably remain for life.",
        "Neurodermatite": "It is associated with dry skin, chronic irritation and eczema.",
        "Seborrheic dermatitis": "It is common in people with oily skin and hair. It appears and disappears depending on the seasons, has a hereditary tendency and is aggravated by stress.",
        "Stasis dermatitis": "The most common causes are varicose veins, obesity, pregnancy and other conditions that affect circulation, such as deep vein thrombosis.",
        "Atopic dermatitis": "It is associated with allergies and runs in families with asthma, hay fever or eczema. It tends to begin in childhood and is less problematic in adulthood. Dry or irritable skin and changes in the body's defenses are some of the factors associated with atopic dermatitis. Stress can accentuate it, but it is not a direct cause.",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis is essentially clinical, based on the clinical history and the appearance of the skin lesions. Although there are not many diagnostic tests, skin tests are available for contact dermatitis that allow you to identify the substances that cause it. To carry out these tests, a type of sticker is applied to the patient's back and the skin is observed after two days to see what substances the skin reacts to.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment depends on the cause and may consist of applying corticosteroid creams or moist compresses. It is important to keep the skin well hydrated - to prevent the occurrence of breakouts that could interfere with the skin's barrier function - and avoid contact with irritating or allergenic substances. In some cases, it may be useful to use anti-allergy medications to control itching. Regarding seborrheic dermatitis, there are specific shampoos and creams that can alleviate it. It's important to know that dandruff and excess oil do not cause hair loss. Diaper dermatitis is prevented and treated through the use of appropriately sized, superabsorbent diapers that must be changed frequently. Skin cleansing should be gentle, without friction and without the use of irritating products, such as alcohol or perfumes. The use of emollients or protective pastes after each diaper change reduces maceration and aids healing. It is not advisable to apply talcum powder due to the risk of respiratory inhalation.

    "Atopic dermatitis": {
        "What is it?": "Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease, usually beginning during childhood. Its incidence has increased over the last 40 years, and is currently estimated to affect between 10% and 20% of the pediatric population. It is a very common disease, more common in urban areas. It has an early onset, usually appearing in the first year of life. The prognosis is favorable in most cases, with approximately 60% of children experiencing a reduction or complete disappearance of lesions before puberty. In 90% of cases it appears before the age of five, with 60% of occurrences in the first year of life. Atopic dermatitis has a universal distribution and both genders are equally affected. In Portugal, it is estimated that around 10% of children are affected by the disease. In most situations, the pathology tends to improve a lot and even disappear with age, although it can remain for life. Persistence is more observed in cases where the onset is late. In general, atopic dermatitis affects people with a personal or family history of asthma, allergic rhinitis or atopic dermatitis.",
        "Symptoms": "It is characterized by skin itching, which tends to be recurrent, and the distribution of lesions varies with age. The typical ones in the acute phase consist of reddish eruptions, forming papules or vesicles, with exudation and crust formation that evolve, in the chronic phase, into scaly lesions. In early childhood, this dermatitis can affect the entire body surface, but generally spares the diaper area; during second childhood, it occurs mainly on the limbs, with particular emphasis on the flexor surfaces. In adulthood, the lesions are located on the hands and feet, on the flexible areas of the limbs and on the cervical region. The skin in these areas becomes thicker, rougher and darker. Although it tends to be localized in these regions, atopic dermatitis can become generalized, affecting large areas of the body. Scratching can cause skin excoriations and secondary infection. After childhood, the lesions may be completely eliminated, but generally the disease has a chronic course, with periods of improvement and worsening. It is common, after atopic dermatitis disappears, for it to be replaced by one of the other forms of atopy presentation (asthma or rhinitis). Another characteristic of the skin in these cases is its greater tendency to dry out, which can also give rise to the sensation of itching and peeling. Emotional stress can trigger periods of exacerbation.",
        "Causes": "The exact cause is unknown. Its origin appears to be immunological mechanisms of immediate hypersensitivity, common to other diseases such as bronchial asthma and rhinitis, and delayed hypersensitivity. The hereditary component is important. In a child where one of the parents has an atopic condition (asthma, allergic rhinitis or atopic dermatitis) there is approximately a 25% chance of also showing some form of atopic disease. This percentage increases to 50% if both parents have this pathology.",
        "Diagnosis": "It may take several visits before the doctor can make a diagnosis. There is no specific test for atopic dermatitis. The test is performed based on the characteristics of the lesions and takes into account the existence of possible allergies in other family members. Although it may look a lot like seborrheic dermatitis in children, it is important to distinguish it because the complications and treatment are different.",
        "Treatment": "There is no cure for atopic dermatitis but certain measures can be beneficial: It is important to avoid contact with substances that irritate the skin;;/ To avoid dry skin, baths should be quick and with lukewarm water. Avoid using too much soap and apply a neutral moisturizer immediately afterwards, before the water on your skin evaporates;;/ Corticosteroid creams can soothe lesions and control itching. Its use must always be carried out in accordance with the doctor's instructions;;/ It is helpful to apply petroleum jelly or vegetable oil to the affected areas to help keep them soft and lubricated;;/ Antihistamines can sometimes control itching, in part because they act as a sedative. Because these drugs can cause drowsiness, it is best to apply them at night;;/ Keeping your nails short can help reduce the damage caused by itching and decrease the chances of infection;;/ In case of skin inflammation, oral antibiotics may be necessary;;/ Ultraviolet light treatment combined with oral doses of psoralene, a drug that enhances the effects of ultraviolet light on the skin, may help adults. This treatment is rarely prescribed for children.;/",
        "Prevention": "If there is no known cause, atopic dermatitis cannot be prevented. What is important is to adopt measures that protect the skin, reduce dryness and keep it healthier: Bathing should be daily, quick and with warm water. Drying must be done without rubbing the skin and a cream must be applied immediately to promote hydration and maintain its barrier function;;/ It is important to emphasize that dry skin causes more itching, worsening the cycle of atopic dermatitis;;/ Nails must always be well cut and clean to avoid microbial infections secondary to scratching;;/ Sweat tends to aggravate atopic dermatitis and, for this reason, it is recommended to shower after playing sports;;/ Clothing that makes direct contact with the skin, including sheets, should be made from natural fibers, such as cotton. It is recommended that they be rinsed well to remove detergent residue, which often aggravates the disease;;/ Footwear must be made of leather and socks must be made of cotton, to allow good ventilation;;/ Excessive heat and sudden changes in temperature can be aggravating factors. Therefore, rooms should be well ventilated and heaters should be avoided.

    "Retinal detachment": {
        "What is it?": "It is an ophthalmological emergency in which there is a separation of the retina from its connection at the back of the eye and requires urgent surgery. It is a serious condition that occurs when the retina (the thin layer of tissue at the back of the eye that processes light) becomes detached from the supporting tissues of the eye. Retinal detachment can lead to permanent vision loss if there is no medical intervention within 24 to 72 hours. Early diagnosis is essential to prevent vision loss associated with retinal detachment.",
        "Symptoms": "It manifests itself with \u201cflashes\u201d of light, darkening of peripheral vision and floating points in the visual field, usually without associated pain. You should quickly contact an ophthalmological emergency service for surgery.",
        "Causes": "A person is more likely to experience a retinal detachment if they are severely nearsighted, have an eye injury, have had cataract surgery, or have a family history of this condition.",
        "Diagnosis": "In response to the patient's complaints, the specialist doctor performs an ophthalmological examination - applying eye drops that enlarge the pupil to check whether the retina is detached. Early diagnosis is essential to prevent vision loss.",
        "Treatment": "This is the most advanced procedure - Vitrectomy - surgical procedure carried out in the operating room, with strict aseptic conditions, generally under general anesthesia followed by hospitalization with mandatory rest.",
        "Prevention": "A regular eye examination can indicate early changes in the eyes, especially in myopic patients, where there is a higher prevalence of retinal detachment. Treating these cases can prevent future problems. You should continue to see your ophthalmologist every year, or more frequently if you have other associated conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure that increase the likelihood of eye diseases.

People with balance disorders feel unsteady or like they are going to fall.",
        "Symptoms": "People with balance disorders feel unsteady or like they are going to fall.",
        "Causes": "For the body to feel balanced, the brain requires information from the inner ear, eyes, muscles and joints as well as resulting from problems associated with the brain or heart. Other pathologies such as changes in blood pressure, cervical spondylitis, Parkinson's disease and diabetes can be a cause of imbalance.",
        "Diagnosis": "As the mechanisms to maintain balance are very complex, it is sometimes complex to find its exact cause, involving the contribution of several medical specialties in its research. The medical team assesses the type of disorientation, dizziness or vertigo; evaluates the inner ear, blood pressure, blood sugar level and other physical and laboratory aspects to find the possible origin of the pathology. Additional diagnostic tests may be necessary to define a treatment plan.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment may include medications, therapies, and lifestyle changes, depending on the cause found.

    "Diabetes": {
        "What is it?": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disease, which can have several causes and which results from several pathophysiological changes that lead to a permanent increase in glycemia (blood sugar concentration). This increase is essentially due to defects in the normal action of insulin and/or a lack of it. The incidence is growing and affects around 13% of the Brazilian adult population. It is estimated that there are around 400 million people with diabetes worldwide, and the numbers continue to increase. Sugar is necessary for the metabolism of cells. In order for it to be transported there, the pancreas produces insulin, a hormone that captures glucose from the bloodstream and takes it to cells throughout the body where it is used as energy. Anyone can suffer from this disease, however, exposure to risk factors can increase the likelihood of its occurrence. Around 90% of diabetes cases are classified as type 2 diabetes. This type mainly affects adults and elderly people, who are overweight or obese, sedentary and have unhealthy lifestyles, and there is often a family history. Type 1 diabetes is much less common and essentially results from the sudden and irreversible destruction of pancreatic cells, usually due to autoimmune inflammation. These patients are usually teenagers or young adults. In pregnant women, the new hormonal environment, combined with excess weight, a sedentary lifestyle and an unbalanced diet, can produce a type of diabetes typical of pregnancy, called gestational diabetes. It is usually controlled with diet and physical activity alone, but may require insulin treatment. The main problems with this type of diabetes, when left uncontrolled, are fetal and birth complications.",
        "Symptoms": "Symptoms are caused by the amount of sugar in the blood, either associated with an increase in its level (hyperglycemia) or a decrease in its level (hypoglycemia).",
        "Symptoms of hyperglycemia": "Hyperglycemia can occur in poorly controlled diabetics or when a large amount of sugar is ingested. This condition can cause blurred vision, a dry mouth, excessive sweating and fatigue.",
        "Symptoms of hypoglycemia": "Hypoglycemia usually occurs in diabetics who use medications to control the disease, whether insulin or oral antidiabetics. This condition can result from taking too much or incorrect medication, prolonged fasting or inadequate physical exercise. Blood sugar levels should not be below 70mg/dl. When taking medications to control the disease, it is necessary to pay close attention to what you eat so that your sugar levels do not drop too low. Unexplained tiredness, dizziness, blurred vision and difficulty thinking are the main symptoms of hypoglycemia.",
        "Causes": "The pancreas releases insulin, the hormone that controls the storage and use of sugar in the blood. Diabetes occurs when: The pancreas produces insufficient insulin or is unable to produce any insulin at all;/ When the body does not respond adequately to insulin - a condition of \"insulin resistance\";/  It is a public health problem that often results from the way people live and the habits they have. Its incidence has been increasing. In 2010, around 34.9% of the Portuguese population between 20 and 79 years old had diabetes or pre-diabetes and around 43.6% of cases were undiagnosed. This disease is responsible for several complications that reduce quality of life and can cause early death. It is an illness that has no cure. However, advances in treatments and understanding of the disease allow diabetics to lead practically normal lives. Often, careful eating and regular exercise are enough to prevent the disease or keep it under control. Some risk factors are possible to control (modifiable); others are not (non-modifiable). Modifiable risk factors: High blood pressure;/ Obesity;/ Sleep deprivation;/ Sedentary lifestyle;/ Smoking;/ Non-modifiable risk factors: Diseases of the pancreas or endocrine diseases;/ Family history;/ Newborn weighing more than four kilos;/ Gender and age: Women over 45 are most affected;/",
        "Diagnosis": "One of the main problems is that symptoms often go unnoticed, leading to late diagnosis. To do this, an analysis of the symptoms and risk factors is necessary. Generally, only one parameter is used to make the diagnosis. If two are used, they must be consistent and, if they are not, the analysis must be repeated two weeks after the first.",
        "Treatment": "Type 1 diabetics are treated with insulin (insulin therapy), which is administered subcutaneously several times a day from the beginning of the disease. This must be done together with correct blood glucose monitoring and a healthy diet and regular exercise. Type 2 diabetics monitor their blood sugar levels with oral antidiabetic drugs. Sometimes no medication is necessary, as this type of diabetes can be controlled by adopting a healthy lifestyle, restricting high-calorie foods, eating in portions, exercising, taking medications that facilitate the action of insulin, and in certain cases or more advanced stages of the disease, by administering insulin (if treatment with oral antidiabetics is not able to achieve the expected goals). Weight loss is essential for these patients.",
        "Prevention": "Although there is no cure, good blood sugar control can prolong life and prevent complications. Prevention involves three important points: Understanding diabetes: It is important for patients to understand their type of diabetes well. This is the only way to comply with and improve their treatment. The way patients deal with the disease is the main factor for success.;/ Control blood glucose: if it is within normal limits there is less chance of suffering complications.;/ Diet: One of the priorities for type 2 diabetics is to improve their eating habits and lose weight. As this is one of the risk factors that most contributes to the development of the disease and the appearance of complications, it is also one of the most important to control. Medication is not effective if eating habits do not improve.;/ Diabetes Portal (http:",

    "Diabetes ocular": {
        "What is it?": "Ocular diabetes is a group of eye problems that occur in people with Diabetes Mellitus. This group of diseases can, ultimately, cause significant visual loss or even in the most serious cases lead to blindness. The most common form of presentation is diabetic retinopathy (DR), but this disease can be associated with other changes, such as\u00a0cataracts or glaucoma.  What is diabetic retinopathy? The retina is a tissue located inside and at the back of the eye and is necessary for good vision. Any disease that affects the retina is called retinoptia. DR is the main cause of blindness and most often causes blood vessel changes, at different stages and in a very similar way in both eyes. It begins with visual disturbances that worsen over time and lead to vision loss.  What are the stages of Diabetic Retinopathy? DR has 4 stages: mild, moderate, severe and proliferative. Mild, moderate and severe DR are manifested by increasingly severe occlusive changes in blood vessels and increasingly reduced retinal blood flow. In the last stage - proliferative DR - the retina develops new blood vessels (neovascularization) to compensate for the occlusion and reduced blood flow. However, this neovascularization does not have a normal structure, is more fragile and is responsible for complications.",
        "Causes": "The main risk factor for developing DR\u00a0is Diabetes Mellitus (DM types 1 and 2). The risk also increases with the duration since DM diagnosis. Therefore, all patients with DM should undergo annual screening because in the early stages of the disease they may not present any complaints.",
        "Treatment": "To prevent the worsening of DR, systemic control of blood glucose, blood pressure and dyslipidemia must be carried out. In the first 3 stages of DR, eye treatment is not necessary, except in cases accompanied by macular edema. In the latter case, eye injections (intravitreal) are necessary. In the most severe cases, proliferative DR, the options depend on the presentation and are: LASER, surgery (vitrectomy) and intravitreal injections",
        "Prevention": "Controlling blood glucose allows you to delay the onset of DR, its worsening and the need for LASER treatments. Controlling blood pressure and dyslipidemia can also reduce the risk of vision loss. If you have DM without retinopathy, make sure you have an annual check-up with dilation. If you have DR, you should have a more frequent eye exam. Myopia, astigmatism and hyperopia often lead to the use of glasses or contact lenses. LASIK surgery can restore good vision.

It is caused by inflammation of the intestine, usually caused by an infection, which heals spontaneously or can take up to a week. In the case of diarrhea, younger children are at risk of dehydration due to greater loss of body fluids, so it is a condition that requires extra attention.",
        "Symptoms": "Numerous bowel movements in a few hours;/ Appearance of dark circles;/ To become prostrate or irritated;/ Wetting the diaper less or urinating less;/",
        "Causes": "Most cases of acute diarrhea in children are caused by infection in the gastrointestinal tract; the agents responsible for this infection are bacteria, viruses and parasites.",
        "Diagnosis": "The doctor evaluates the symptoms, medication intake, previous history of illness, onset of diarrhea, frequency of bowel movements, characteristics of the stool (whether there is blood in the stool, whether it is watery or has mucus) and whether there is fever or associated vomiting. During the physical examination of the child, the doctor also assesses signs of dehydration, loss of appetite or tiredness, which determine the severity or not of the clinical condition and its treatment plan. Stool tests in the laboratory may be necessary.",
        "Treatment": "If you breastfeed your baby, continue to do so as usual.;/ If your child drinks exclusively baby milk, he does not need to make any changes to his diet. You should consult your pediatrician;/ Offer more fluids than usual, but in small amounts. You can choose weak, sweetened black tea, hot or cold, or oral rehydration serum.;/ If your child has a fever and needs an antipyretic, use syrup instead of a suppository.;/ If your child already eats yogurt, choose this food over artificial milk.;/ Eat a diet without fats and without green vegetables;/ Do not force the child to eat;/",
        "Prevention": "Diarrhea prevention includes controlling the quality of drinking water and public sanitation conditions, especially waste and sewage treatment.

There are several types of vegetarian diets, in which meat and fish are always excluded, but which, in some diets, may include eggs and/or dairy products. It is a dietary regime that has been increasingly adopted in recent years, for philosophical, religious and cultural reasons. It is estimated that there are 30,000 vegetarians in Portugal. The various types of vegetarian eating can be nutritionally balanced, including essential supplies of proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and trace elements. Therefore, its implementation in infants and children must always be monitored by the attending pediatrician and a pediatric nutrition team, in order to guarantee this balance and the adaptation of the diet to each case. It should always be supplemented with Vitamin B12 as it comes exclusively from products of animal origin, and is an essential component for the normal growth and development of the child.",
        "Prevention": "The vegetarian diet must be supplemented with Vitamin B12 as it is only found in foods of animal origin. A lack of it can cause anemia and serious neurological damage in your baby. If another type of supplement is suggested by your doctor, it will be because he considers it essential for your baby and its proper growth and development. Foods that are difficult to digest should not be offered: fried foods, honey, preserved or smoked foods and foods that present a choking risk (nuts and stone fruits). Food prepared at home can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days or frozen. No salt, sugar or spices should be added until 12 months. Solid food should be offered with a spoon and never in a bottle. The maximum daily dose of fiber (0.5 g/kg/day) must be respected as this may limit the intake and adequate absorption of nutrients.

    "Learning difficulties": {
        "What is it?": "These are considered to be a set of learning problems that affect the way a child processes information, resulting in difficulties in their ability to speak, spell, listen, read, write, reason, organize information or perform mathematical calculations, interfering with their academic performance. They can, therefore, cause educational risks or imply special educational needs. These manifestations do not all appear in the same child, and it is important to approach each case individually. Learning disabilities interfere with the brain's ability to receive, process, store, respond to and communicate information. They are a group of disorders and are not, therefore, a single disease. They should not be confused with intellectual disability or with the various degrees of autism. On the contrary, these people have average or above-average intelligence but have problems acquiring important skills to improve their performance at school, at home, in the community or in the workplace. This condition accompanies the person throughout their life and, the sooner it is recognized, the sooner steps can be taken to overcome or minimize the challenges it poses. In fact, your diagnosis is important because the sooner you identify and evaluate these students, the greater opportunities they will have to become successful and productive adults since their Intelligence Quotient is average or above average. Learning disabilities are a permanent disorder that affect approximately 15% of American school-age children and adolescents. In Portugal, the problem is deserving more attention, an important aspect so that these students are not neglected and become victims of failure and school dropout.",
        "Symptoms": "They vary in their forms of presentation and according to age. Whenever parents suspect the presence of learning difficulties, they should record their observations and share them with teachers and doctors so that this suspicion can be evaluated. Its main characteristic is the existence of a marked and inexplicable disparity between what is legitimate to expect from a person's performance and their actual performance. These can be mild or severe and it is not uncommon for more than one type to appear in the same person. In about a third of cases, this condition coexists with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Although these two entities share some characteristics (difficulty concentrating, memory and organization) they are distinct. But they are often confused and seen as laziness or associated with emotional or behavioral changes.",
        "Causes": "They are not yet well known but it is thought that they may correspond to a disorder of neurobiological origin that results from a different brain structure or functioning. Some role of heredity is admitted, since, in some families, several cases occur. Illness or trauma during pregnancy, alcohol or drug use during pregnancy, prematurity or low birth weight, and prolonged labor appear to be other possible causes. The occurrence of a serious illness, head injury or exposure to toxins after birth can also contribute to learning difficulties. It is important to emphasize that they are not the result of cultural differences or economic problems nor are they related to a lack of educational opportunities. However, if a child does not have access to education at critical moments in their development, they will be at higher risk of showing signs of learning difficulties in subsequent years.",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis involves a careful assessment of information obtained from various sources, such as parents, teachers, doctors, psychologists or speech therapists and, of course, the individual themselves. This is the only methodology capable of correctly identifying the learning difficulty.",
        "Treatment": "There are several approaches that involve adapting the form of instruction/education in order to enhance learning and overcome the difficulties experienced. There are multiple treatment strategies, depending on the type and its manifestations, but, in general, these strategies should involve the family, teachers and specialized teams. An important aspect is to maintain children's self-esteem and prevent depression or anxiety from developing.",
        "Prevention": "They remain throughout life, but this fact should not prevent those affected from achieving their goals. It is not a disease and, as such, there is no type of treatment or intervention that is suitable for all cases. Although they cannot be prevented, early identification and seeking support from qualified professionals are the best ways to obtain good results and a better quality of life.

    "Dyscalculia": {
        "What is it?": "Dyscalculia belongs to the group of learning disorders, which affect a person's ability to acquire and use functions such as reading or calculation. Learning disabilities do not correspond to physical or mental disabilities and do not reflect a child's intelligence. However, these disorders affect their ability to use certain tools, which is important and can interfere with their academic performance. The most common learning disorders are dyslexia, which interferes with reading, dyscalculia, which interferes with the understanding of mathematical concepts, and non-verbal learning difficulties, which involve coordination and body language. These disorders can occur simultaneously in the same child. The term dyscalculia derives from acalculia, which corresponds to an acquired disorder of the ability to perform mathematical operations, after these have been consolidated. It is found mainly in children, has an evolutionary character or is related to development and is mainly associated with difficulties in mathematics, more specifically learning to calculate. But it can manifest itself at the level of reading, writing, numbers or symbols, mathematical concepts and rules, memorization of facts and concepts, and also in abstract reasoning. They may also be associated with problems learning to tell the time or deal with money.",
        "Symptoms": "It can be difficult to correctly identify a learning disorder. Telltale signs of dyscalculia include several difficulties: In number identification (visual and auditory);/ In establishing a reciprocal correspondence (counting objects and associating a number with each one);/ In perceiving sets and quantities;/ No calculation;/ In understanding the concept of measurement;/ In learning the hours;/ In understanding the value of currencies;/ In understanding mathematical language and symbols;/ In solving oral problems;/ Dyscalculia can be associated with poor visuospatial organization and nonverbal integration (children cannot quickly distinguish the differences between shapes, sizes, quantities and lengths), difficulties in observing groups of objects and saying which one contains a greater number of elements, in calculating distances, disturbances in body image, disorientation (in distinguishing left-right), in social perception and in making judgments and superior performance in intelligence tests in verbal functions compared to nonverbal functions. Children with learning disorders may have more difficulty understanding and following instructions, remembering what they are told, exhibit poor coordination when walking, playing sports or even in simple gestures such as holding a pencil, easily lose or misplace books and homework, do not fully understand the concept of time, tend to be reluctant to carry out tasks involving reading, writing or mathematics and may display hostile or defiant behavior in relation to these duties.",
        "Causes": "These disorders may have a hereditary basis, result from medical conditions, due to alcohol or drug use during pregnancy which can result in poor intrauterine growth, head injuries, or environmental factors such as exposure to high levels of lead. Dyscalculia occurs in association with genetic diseases such as Turner syndrome, Williams syndrome or fragile X chromosome. It is also more common in children with dyslexia, attention deficit and hyperactivity.",
        "Diagnosis": "It is important that this diagnosis is made as early as possible, to avoid school delays and frustration for the child. However, there is no test that identifies the problem at brain level. Therefore, distinguishing between a difficulty with mathematical concepts or dyscalculia involves a set of criteria. It is important to remember that difficulties in mathematics can result from inadequate teaching, changes in attention, anxiety, among other factors. Therefore, to diagnose dyscalculia it is important not only to identify a real and persistent difficulty in mathematical concepts, but also to exclude these other aspects. To this end, several tests have been created that must be administered by a specialist.",
        "Treatment": "Early intervention is essential because learning disorders tend to be a real \u201csnowball effect\u201d, in which one difficulty generates another, affecting the child\u2019s overall academic performance, causing anxiety, depression, loss of self-esteem and motivation. If dyscalculia is suspected, it is important to request an assessment by a psychologist to confirm the diagnosis. It is essential to rule out other causes, such as vision or hearing problems. A large part of the treatment involves closer, individualized and professional monitoring of these children, so that they can improve their performance and maintain good academic performance. In some cases, such as in the presence of depression or anxiety, medication may be necessary. Although learning difficulties tend to be long-lasting, it is important to remain hopeful. Early intervention will always be more effective and should involve both the family and the school. In everyday life there are small activities that can be useful in stimulating mathematical reasoning, such as card or board games. It is necessary to encourage the child to use numbers daily, for example, counting products in the supermarket, counting in descending order, or using songs and stories with numbers. In fact, many children can learn and memorize math concepts more quickly when music, rhyme, and rhythm are used in their teaching.",
        "Prevention": "With the exception of certain measures, such as avoiding alcohol or medication during pregnancy, there is no method for preventing dyscalculia. The important thing is to diagnose it early to minimize its impact on the child's schooling and overall development. Ideally, this should be done before the child starts school so that appropriate support can be provided. Load more;/ RSV infection can progress to bronchiolitis or pneumonia.

    "Discopathia": {
        "What is it?": "Discopathy is the\u00a0designation for the pathology of the intervertebral disc, which involves changes in\u00a0its characteristics and function. There may be a herniated disc, collapse (loss of disc height) or just painful symptoms. It is a condition usually related to advancing age that occurs when one or more discs between the vertebrae of the spine deteriorate, causing pain. There may be weakness, numbness and pain that radiates down the leg. The natural process occurs with aging: the discs between the vertebrae normally allow the back to flex, like shock absorbers; over time, the discs wear out and no longer allow this mobility.",
        "Symptoms": "It may cause no symptoms, the symptoms may slowly worsen, or it may cause\u00a0 pain so severe that daily activities cannot be performed. It usually starts with changes in the spine but over time it can affect other parts of the body. Symptoms generally worsen with age and can range from mild to severe causing disability. Disc disease tends to lead to osteoarthritis, with pain and stiffness - the most common initial symptom that can later involve other areas. If the injury occurs in the lower back, discomfort may extend to the buttocks and thighs, including tingling and numbness in the legs or feet. If the injury is cervical, in the neck region, the pain can radiate to the shoulder, arm and hand. The disease can manifest itself with attacks of intense pain, which can worsen when sitting, bending, lifting or turning. Depending on the type of injury and affected area, walking, lying down, and changing positions may help relieve pain.",
        "Causes": "The intervertebral discs (intervertebral fibrocartilage or spinal discs) are the padding between the vertebrae. They have an elastic structure, made of fibrocartilage tissue, with the outer part known as the annulus fibrosus (tough) and the inner core (nucleus pulposus) being soft and jelly-like. The intervertebral discs cushion the stress when the spine moves or bears weight, and allow the spine to flex and extend. As people age, repeated daily stresses on the spine can damage these discs, checking: Loss of fluid: the intervertebral discs of a young, healthy adult contain up to 90% fluid. With age, the fluid content decreases - the distance between the vertebrae becomes smaller and the disc becomes less effective in its role as a shock absorber.;/ Disc structure: Small cracks develop in the outer layer, and the soft, jelly-like material inside may leak out, resulting in a bulging, ruptured, or broken disc. When the vertebrae have less padding between them, the spine becomes less stable. To compensate, osteophytes (\"parrot's beaks\")\u2014small bony projections that develop along the bone boundary\u2014can press on the spinal cord or nerve roots, causing pain.;/ Other problems include: breakdown of cartilage, the tissue that cushions joints; a bulging disc, known as a herniated disc; narrowing of the spinal canal or spinal stenosis. These changes can affect the nerves, causing pain, weakness and numbness.;/  In addition to advancing age, the degeneration process can also be accelerated by: Obesity;/ Strenuous physical work;/ Smoking;/ Acute or sudden injury, such as falls;/",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis is based on a detailed description of the symptoms: when and where the pain occurs, the existence of tingling or numbness and which situations trigger the most pain; description of any falls, injuries or accidents. During the physical examination, the following can be assessed: Muscle strength: You can check for atrophy, loss or abnormal movements.;/ Pain with movement or in response to touch: If pressure applied to the lower back causes pain, it may indicate a degenerated disc.;/ Nerve function with reflex hammer: Weak or no response may indicate a compressed nerve root.;/ Heat and cold stimuli can be used to check how nerves react to temperature changes.;/ X-ray, CT scan, MRI, discogram may be necessary. To ensure a correct diagnosis, other causes of osteoarticular pain must be ruled out by a healthcare professional, such as tumors or other types of pathologies.",
        "Treatment": "Through a percutaneous procedure that allows you to confirm or obtain a diagnosis of the pathology, with the introduction of a needle into the intervertebral disc to inject a contrast liquid (visible on the X-ray). This practice also allows for the local administration of one or more \u00a0medicines with the aim of combating painful symptoms.\u00a0It is a procedure carried out under local anesthesia, on an outpatient basis in which the patient is discharged on the same day. To treat disc disease, it may also be necessary to replace the intervertebral disc with a prosthesis \u2013 arthroplasty \u2013 which maintains the disc\u2019s mobility characteristics. Or to promote the union between two segments of the spine (there may be more). In this case, the disc is replaced with a spacer and a bone graft is applied to achieve fusion/arthrodesis. It is also necessary to place implants (screws/bars) in order to stabilize and/or correct deformities. This procedure is performed under general anesthesia, with a hospital stay of two to five days.",
        "Prevention": "Practicing exercises helps to strengthen muscles, stabilize and increase mobility, including: walking, cycling, swimming, yoga and Pilates. Simple exercises to do at home are recommended: Lie on your back on the floor or a bed, with your feet supported. Press your lower back on the floor; hold the position for 5 seconds and repeat 10 times.;/ In the same position, squeeze your buttocks and gently lift them to form a bridge.

    "Dysphagia": {
        "What is it?": "This corresponds to difficulty in swallowing, which means that it takes longer and requires more effort to move solid or liquid food from the mouth to the stomach; it can be accompanied by pain and, in severe cases, can make swallowing impossible. It is usually caused by changes in the nerves or muscles, can be painful and is more common in the elderly and babies. There is a wide range of potential causes of dysphagia. Although an isolated episode probably does not correspond to a serious underlying problem, if it recurs it will require urgent medical observation. Occasional dysphagia can result from eating food too quickly or chewing it poorly, and is more common in older people; these cases are usually nothing to worry about. On the other hand, persistent dysphagia or dysphagia that gets worse may indicate a serious problem and should be evaluated urgently.",
        "Symptoms": "Patients may report pain when swallowing or being unable to do so. There may be a sensation of food remaining in the throat or chest, excessive salivation, hoarseness, regurgitation, burning behind the chest bone, weight loss, coughing or choking when swallowing. If not treated properly, dysphagia can cause malnutrition, weight loss, and dehydration or respiratory infections if food passes into the airway while trying to swallow.",
        "Causes": "It is not always possible to identify the cause of dysphagia. Generally speaking, there are two types of dysphagia: esophageal and oropharyngeal. In esophageal dysphagia, there is a sensation that food is stuck in the base of the throat or chest after swallowing. The most common causes are achalasia (weakness of the esophageal muscles), spasms or narrowing (due to a tumor or injury) of the esophagus, or the presence of a foreign body. Gastroesophageal reflux, eosinophilic esophagitis, scleroderma, or radiation therapy can also cause this type of dysphagia. In oropharyngeal, there is a weakening of the throat muscles that makes it difficult for food to pass from the mouth to the throat and esophagus, which can cause coughing, choking or even suffocation. If food passes into the trachea, pneumonia may develop. This type can result from neurological problems such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease, strokes, pharyngeal diverticula, or neoplastic lesions. On the other hand, aging is a risk factor for dysphagia, as is the presence of some forms of neurological disease.",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of dysphagia is made through medical observation, supplemented by contrast radiography, dynamic swallowing studies, endoscopy, esophageal pressure study (manometry), computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Depending on each case, the most appropriate tests are selected.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment depends on the type of dysphagia. In oropharyngeal dysphagia, there are some exercises and techniques that help coordinate the muscles involved in swallowing and stimulate the nerves that trigger this reflex. In the case of esophageal dysphagia, dilation of the esophagus using an endoscope may be necessary, or surgery may be necessary if a tumor or diverticulum is present. If there is gastroesophageal reflux, it should be treated by prescribing oral treatment that reduces gastric acidity. Treatment can be complemented by a liquid diet that allows you to maintain weight and avoid dehydration and, in severe cases, tube feeding may be necessary.",
        "Prevention": "Occasional dysphagia can be prevented by eating slowly and chewing food thoroughly. If gastroesophageal reflux is detected, it should be treated promptly to prevent the development of a narrowing of the esophagus. In other forms of dysphagia, prevention is not possible, but early diagnosis is recommended to minimize complications.

        "Causes": "The cause is unknown. Patients often report the onset of symptoms after an upper respiratory infection, a period of excessive voice use, or work-related or emotional stress. Spasmodic dysphonia occurs most often between the ages of 30 and 50, and about 60% of patients are women. There are two types: Adductor spasmodic dysphonia: Patients attempt to speak through spasmodic closure with a voice that sounds choked or strained. These episodes usually occur when pronouncing vowels, especially at the beginning of words.;/ Spasmodic abductor dysphonia: this is less frequent and involves sudden interruptions in sound caused by momentary paralysis of the vocal cords, accompanied by an audible escape of air when the patient tries to speak.;/",
        "Diagnosis": "There is no simple test to diagnose it. Its measurement is based on the presence of the typical characteristics and symptoms already described and the absence of other conditions that could cause similar problems.

        "Symptoms": "Pain or discomfort in the face, temporomandibular joint and/or masticatory muscles; headaches, earache and neck pain. Clinical studies have shown that the cervical spine can be a source of pain or dysfunction in the orofacial area. Likewise, it is common for patients with temporomandibular joint dysfunction to present signs and symptoms compatible with cervical pathology. Other common manifestations are in the field of otorhinolaryngology, such as tinnitus, sensation of hearing loss and vertigo. The pain can arrive suddenly or progressively, with fluctuations in frequency and intensity or over months or even years. Limitations in opening the mouth, blockage, deviation of the jaw when opening or closing, difficulties in chewing can also be associated with this dysfunction.",
        "Causes": "Its cause is rarely unique, and is normally considered to be of multifactorial origin, namely, jaw trauma (caused by road accidents), joint pathology (arthritis), clenching and grinding of the teeth (bruxism), and muscular and emotional tension.",
        "Diagnosis": "The initial diagnosis consists of a physical examination consisting of muscle and temporomandibular joint palpation with assessment of opening and closing movements as well as analysis of joint noises, and assessment of the oral cavity (dental and periodontal health, missing teeth, replacement of missing teeth). The use of auxiliary diagnostic methods such as X-rays, CT scans, MRI, according to the individual needs of each patient, serves as a complement to the clinical assessment.",
        "Treatment": "Some studies report control of signs and symptoms in approximately 90% of patients receiving conservative treatment.

    "Erectile dysfunction": {
        "What is it?": "Erectile dysfunction corresponds to the constant or recurrent inability to obtain or maintain an erection that allows satisfactory sexual activity for at least three months. This is a problem that can affect men at any age, although it is more common in older people. In general, this disease affects 29% of men between the ages of 40 and 49, 50% between the ages of 50 and 59 and 74% between the ages of 60 and 69. Despite being a benign disease, it has a major impact on the patient's sexual life with psychological and family repercussions. Given its impact on the self-esteem of affected patients, many prefer not to seek help, which tends to worsen the problem. However, in most cases, around 90%, erectile dysfunction is treatable. It is estimated that in Portugal it affects around 500,000 men (13%). It is a delicate subject that is very difficult for patients to discuss, whether with their family or with their doctor. Erectile dysfunction is often associated with cardiovascular diseases, which may precede them and act as a true risk marker.",
        "Symptoms": "The warning signs of erectile dysfunction are a decrease in sexual desire, changes in the quality of the erection and the resulting difficulty in penetration, as well as ejaculatory changes. These signs can manifest themselves progressively or, sometimes, suddenly, the latter being, as a general rule, a consequence of previous illness, trauma or surgery. Its characteristics, the moments in which it occurs, its duration, are aspects that help to understand whether the cause is psychological, physical or both.",
        "Causes": "Although erectile dysfunction was previously thought to have primarily psychological causes, various hormones, the pelvic nerves, and the blood vessels that supply the penis. Although this illness was previously considered to have primarily psychological causes, it is known that it almost always results from a physical origin, such as a chronic illness or a side effect of ongoing treatment. The most common causes are coronary heart disease, atherosclerosis, diabetes, obesity and high blood pressure. In some cases, erectile dysfunction may represent the first sign of these illnesses. Other important factors are smoking, chronic alcoholism, some medications (prostate cancer treatment, antihypertensives, antidepressants), neurological diseases (Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis), hormonal disorders, Peyronie's disease and pelvic trauma. Psychological causes account for 10% to 20% of cases and include depression, anxiety, stress, fatigue and difficulties in marital relationships. Cycling can also cause erectile dysfunction, due to prolonged compression of the perineal nerves and vessels.",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of erectile dysfunction involves taking a detailed clinical and psychosexual history, accompanied by a physical examination and laboratory and hormonal studies. A penile Doppler ultrasound, a neurological assessment or more specific tests that can help detect any abnormalities in the penile structures may be useful. A psychological assessment may also be important in some cases.",
        "Treatment": "Appropriate treatment will always depend on the cause(s) and their severity. There are oral medications that promote penile irrigation that may be useful in some cases but which, due to their mode of action, are contraindicated in patients with angina pectoris, severe heart disease, a history of stroke or diabetes. These drugs can interfere with other chronic medications and, therefore, their use always depends on medical evaluation and prescription. Other alternatives are hormonal treatments and, much less frequently, the use of vacuum pumps that promote erection, the implantation of penile prostheses or vascular surgery. Psychological counseling and sex therapy are good complements to other forms of erectile dysfunction treatment, especially when there is associated stress, anxiety or depression.",
        "Prevention": "This prevention involves the treatment and control of chronic diseases that may be present and the elimination of risk factors. The control of diabetes and coronary heart disease, the elimination of smoking, limiting alcohol intake, regular physical exercise, adequate sleep and good management of stress levels, in addition to the treatment of anxiety states and depression and regular medical consultation. Prevention and treatment should involve not only the man but both partners. Erectile dysfunction has repercussions on the sex life of both partners, so both partners should be involved in the entire therapeutic process.

        "What is it?": "Sexual dysfunction corresponds to situations in which the individual is unable to complete a sexual relationship or in which it is unsatisfactory for him and/or his partner. It can be characterized by a change in desire, the presence or maintenance of arousal and response to it, the ability to achieve orgasm, a painful disturbance, or the overlap of any of these situations. These cases can be associated with discomfort and interfere with various aspects of personal, family and professional life. Its prevalence is high, ranging between 25% and 63% worldwide, but the studies carried out are scarce and the data observed are quite heterogeneous.

According to other data, it affects around 19% of women and around 25% of men.",
        "Symptoms": "Symptoms are different in men and women. In men, the most common are difficulties in obtaining or maintaining an erection, changes in ejaculation, which may be absent, delayed or premature. In women, the predominant symptoms are decreased sexual desire, inability to achieve orgasm, insufficient vaginal lubrication and difficulty in relaxing these muscles, making penetration difficult or impossible. Generally speaking, they can be classified into four categories: those that affect sexual desire, those that interfere with sexual stimulation, erectile dysfunction and changes in orgasm. Painful conditions are quite common, especially in women, and may be related to poor vaginal lubrication or involuntary contraction of these muscles. Symptoms can be very varied and are not always assumed as such, since physical and psychological factors contribute to them.",
        "Causes": "It can have numerous causes, from physical (diabetes, cardiovascular, neurological, hormonal, renal, hepatic diseases, alcohol, tobacco or drug abuse, use of medications such as some antidepressants, antihypertensives and antihistamines, for example) to psychological, such as stress, anxiety, depression, concerns about sexual performance, marital problems, among others. During pregnancy, it is normal to experience some type of sexual dysfunction, such as decreased desire or pain during sex. For women, the premenstrual phase, postpartum period and menopause can also be accompanied by changes related to sex.",
        "Diagnosis": "To maximize the benefits of medications and behavioral techniques used in your treatment, it is important to take a comprehensive approach to the problem. Diagnosis is more difficult when affected individuals do not recognize the existence of the problem. A complete sexual history and assessment of general health and other sexual problems are very important. Assessing for anxiety, feelings of guilt, or stress are integral to an appropriate approach to sexual dysfunction. It is essential to exclude the presence of a medical condition that could be causing it. Sometimes the diagnosis requires approaching both elements of the couple, in order to try to understand their dynamics and relationship style.",
        "Treatment": "The success of treatment will depend on the underlying cause. Lifestyle changes are important. Excessive alcohol, tobacco and drug use are important causes of sexual dysfunction and controlling these alone can resolve the problem. For erectile dysfunction, there are several medications that should always be prescribed by a doctor. Depending on the origin of the change in sexual function, there are several medications, hormonal or otherwise, that can be useful. In some cases of erectile dysfunction, mechanical assistance (penile implants or vacuum systems) may be indicated and, in the case of women, there are dilators that can be useful in cases of narrowing of the vaginal canal. Sex therapy, psychological support, behavioral approaches, and psychotherapy are other options. The essential thing is to recognize and accept their presence, and that way it is always easier to identify their causes and correct them.",
        "Prevention": "It involves education, information and communication, since many cases have their origin there. On the other hand, adopting a healthy lifestyle allows you to avoid many of the most common causes. Food, exercise, not smoking are important steps towards a more balanced sex life.

    "Dyslexia": {
        "What is it?": "Dyslexia is a learning disorder characterized by reading performance that is substantially below what would be expected, in terms of accuracy, speed or comprehension, depending on chronological age, IQ (intelligence quotient) and level of education. It is, in essence, a specific learning disability, characterized by difficulties in correcting and/or fluently reading words. This problem persists throughout life and does not correspond to a temporary delay in maturation or vision problems. It is a neurological disorder that requires early and specialized intervention. The existence of inversion errors, that is, seeing letters backwards, arises from errors of phonological origin (confusion between consonants with the same place of articulation, one voiceless and the other voiced, such as \u201cd\u201d and \u201cb\u201d) and not of visual origin. Dyslexia is perhaps the most common cause of low performance and failure at school and, in most cases, it is neither identified nor properly treated. It is also probably the most common disorder among the school population, with a prevalence reported to be between 5 and 17.5%. Some studies in Portugal suggest a percentage of 5.4% of children with dyslexia, a value that falls within the prevalence ranges recently published in other countries. Initially, a higher prevalence was reported in males, but in recent years an equal distribution in both sexes has been reported.",
        "Causes": "Until recently, dyslexia was thought to be a behavioral disorder that primarily affected reading. Today, it is known that dyslexia is a partially inherited disorder with complex clinical manifestations, including deficits in reading, phonological processing, working memory, rapid naming ability, sensorimotor coordination, automatization, and early sensory processing. In addition to heredity, there are several theories that attempt to explain dyslexia based on changes in the brain's neurological system. These changes do not interfere with other brain functions and these children have normal or even above-normal intelligence. Dyslexia is associated with other disorders such as hyperactivity, motor coordination disorders, behavior, mood disorders and decreased self-esteem.",
        "Symptoms": "The most common complaints are difficulty in making rhymes and spelling words. This difficulty makes the process of learning to read more difficult, as well as the ability to understand sentences and recognize written words. When dyslexia goes undetected, other problems can arise, such as changes in behavior, loss of self-esteem and, in the case of adults, difficulties at work.",
        "Diagnosis": "Currently, there are several tests that allow the evaluation and diagnosis of children with dyslexia. There is no biological marker that, in clinical practice, can be used to confirm the diagnosis of dyslexia. This diagnosis is made based on family and clinical history and a set of psychometric, language, reading and spelling tests.",
        "Treatment": "There is no treatment that can correct the brain abnormality responsible for dyslexia, nor are there any medications to treat this disorder, except in cases where it is associated with other disorders, such as hyperactivity or attention deficit. As such, the treatment of dyslexia essentially involves education and teaching, which must be adapted to each case. Early identification and intervention are the keys to successful reading learning. The earlier dyslexia is identified, the sooner help can be obtained. It is essential to carry out a diagnostic assessment in order to define which skills have already been acquired and which remain to be acquired. Intervention in dyslexia involves specific learning strategies that encompass reading, writing and vision: All teaching should be adapted so that there is an evolution from easy and basic content to more difficult content.;/ The concepts taught must be systematically reviewed to maintain and reinforce their memorization.;/ Direct and explicit teaching is also necessary, in which the different concepts must be taught in a direct, explicit and conscious way and never by deduction.;/ Success in intervening in dyslexia requires close cooperation between the family and the school.;/ With adequate support and good communication, children with dyslexia will be able to maintain their self-esteem and overcome this difficulty. A person with dyslexia can be successful in their studies. In fact, many of these people are very creative, intelligent, gifted in mathematics, science and arts.

    "Dyslipidemia": {
        "What is it?": "Dyslipidemia is a condition in which abnormal levels of lipids occur in the blood. Lipids are an important component of the human body and enable normal cell function. They are also a source of energy. There are essentially two types of lipids: cholesterol and triglycerides. Blood cholesterol is carried by two types of lipoproteins: high-density (HDL or \"good\" cholesterol) and low-density (LDL or \"bad\" cholesterol). Triglycerides are carried by very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). Dyslipidemias can involve different types of molecules, such as high-density or low-density. The former transport cholesterol from the tissues to the liver. The latter allow cholesterol to mix with the water around the cells and in the bloodstream. Therefore, an excess of low-density lipoproteins is harmful to health, the opposite happening with high-density lipoproteins, as they are capable of removing cholesterol from the arteries. The presence of dyslipidemia affects the overall quality of health, contributing to the thickening and stiffness of the arteries, especially if it is not properly monitored and treated. As it does not cause symptoms for years, the disease can progress to a myocardial infarction or a stroke. When levels of \"bad\" cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood are very high, the risk of atherosclerosis and partial or total obstruction of blood flow to the heart and brain increases. Dyslipidemia is, in fact, one of the main risk factors for atherosclerosis, which represents the main cause of death in developed countries, including Portugal. Its\u00a0importance derives from its association with heart and cerebrovascular diseases, particularly atherosclerosis. A study carried out in Portugal indicated an incidence of hypercholesterolemia of 559 new cases of dyslipidemia per 100 thousand inhabitants. This incidence increased with age up to 54 years for males and up to 64 for females. There was a greater occurrence in men up to the age of 54, later reversing to an increased trend in women. In another study, hypercholesterolemia was detected in 47% of the population and increased LDL levels in 38.4%. Hypertriglyceridemia and reduced HDL were less prevalent, affecting 13% of the population.",
        "Symptoms": "For a long time, it is not associated with any symptoms. When they do appear, they can be very diverse, ranging from the simplest to those that are life-threatening. It can cause opacities in the cornea (the most superficial and transparent layer of the eye), sometimes in the form of a whitish arc, xanthomas (accumulations of cholesterol under the skin), difficulty walking, abdominal pain, changes in balance and speech, and confusion. Many of these symptoms reflect the obstruction of arterial circulation caused by dyslipidemia (atherosclerosis). In some cases, its first manifestation can be a serious event, such as a myocardial infarction or stroke, or even sudden death. These scenarios are more likely in patients who have not been under medical care for a long time and with very advanced forms of dyslipidemia.",
        "Causes": "The disease may have a genetic (primary) or acquired (secondary) origin. There are several factors that can contribute to abnormal lipid levels. It can occur due to a genetic tendency, a diet with high levels of cholesterol, saturated fats and alcohol, a sedentary lifestyle, age and gender. In fact, cholesterol tends to increase with age, women have lower levels, although they increase after menopause. There are other elements of risk, such as tobacco and obesity. Some medications, such as birth control pills, estrogens, corticosteroids, certain diuretics, and antidepressants also increase the risk of dyslipidemia. Type II diabetes is also associated with this disease. In fact, cardiovascular disease continues to be the main cause of death in patients with diabetes mellitus, accounting for 50% of all deaths.",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis is made through laboratory tests that measure and measure the levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, lipoproteins and other markers of dyslipidemia. Reference values \u200b\u200bvary between laboratories depending on the analysis method used, so the interpretation of the results should always be carried out by a doctor.",
        "Treatment": "It depends on the age and overall health of the patient, but is largely based on lifestyle changes. A balanced diet, low in fat and high in fiber, regular physical exercise, weight control and moderate alcohol consumption, as well as not smoking, are essential aspects of therapy. Medical treatment of dyslipidemia can be important and may include medications such as statins, cholesterol absorption inhibitors, bile acid sequestrants or niacin. Therapeutic goals vary depending on the profile of each patient and are always assessed by the health professional.",
        "Prevention": "Prevention is crucial because more than 50% of mortality and disability resulting from ischemic heart disease and stroke can be avoided by implementing simple measures at the individual and/or national level aimed at adequately controlling the main risk factors for these diseases. such as high blood pressure, hypercholesterolemia, smoking and obesity.

    "Dyspnea": {
        "What is it?": "Dyspnea, commonly known as shortness of breath, is the feeling that you are not getting enough air into your lungs. This health problem may result from more intense exertion, be caused by being at a high altitude, or may be a symptom of infection and lung or heart disease.",
        "Symptoms": "Difficulty breathing normally;/ Shortness of breath after exertion or due to a medical condition;/ Feeling of suffocation resulting from breathing difficulties;/ Feeling of tightness in the chest;/ Rapid, shallow breathing and difficulty taking a deep breath;/ Heart palpitations;/ Piella;/ Cough;/  Episodes of dyspnea can be acute (sudden) or chronic (long-lasting), appearing at rest or during exercise, in a moderate to intense manner. If dyspnea occurs suddenly or if symptoms are severe, it may be a sign of a serious illness.",
        "Causes": "In the case of acute dyspnea, the most common causes are: Asthma attack;/ Anxiety;/ Severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis);/ Pneumonia and other respiratory infections;/ Pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lungs);/ Blockage of the airway (such as when a person is choking);/ Heart attack (myocardial infarction);/ Severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis);/  In the case of chronic dyspnea, the most frequent causes are: Asthma, which can happen, for example, with exposure to allergens, such as pollen;/ Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD);/ Heart disease, including congestive heart failure and cardiomyopathy;/ Obesity;/ High blood pressure in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension);/ Interstitial lung disease (fibrosis);/  There are other conditions that can cause shortness of breath, such as panic attacks, lung cancer or anemia. Exposure to pollutants, such as chemicals, dust, and smoke, such as tobacco, are other factors that can trigger an episode of dyspnea.",
        "Diagnosis": "After the patient describes his or her symptoms - when they started, duration, frequency and severity - the attending physician will perform a physical examination and lung auscultation. Spirometry may be necessary, a test that assesses how much air the individual can inhale and exhale and how quickly. The specialist doctor may also order other tests, such as measuring blood oxygen levels with a pulse oximeter, blood tests, imaging tests, such as x-rays or computed tomography and electrocardiogram.",
        "Treatment": "The type of treatment to be carried out depends on the results of the tests. For example, if shortness of breath occurs after performing a more intense effort, it may be useful to practice relaxation and adapt the physical activity. In more serious cases, the administration of oxygen may be necessary or, if dyspnea is due to asthma or COPD, inhalation of bronchodilator medication. If the reason is an infection, appropriate treatment may include antibiotics. However, the patient's attending physician will draw up an individualized plan taking into account their clinical case, preventing acute episodes and stopping the progression of the disease.",
        "Prevention": "People who suffer from dyspnea can improve their breathing capacity by adopting measures such as: Do not smoke and avoid exposure to secondhand smoke.;/ Avoid other triggering factors, such as chemical fumes, dust, pollen, and animal hair.;/ Undergo respiratory rehabilitation, learning techniques that help you breathe more effectively and in a controlled manner.;/ Be more active to strengthen your muscles.;/ Adopt a healthy diet and, if necessary, lose weight.

    "Respiratory dystonia": {
        "What is it?": "Respiratory dystonia or vocal cord dysfunction is a disease with a mechanism similar to spasmodic dysphonia, but in which the vocal cords come together during breathing, making a movement opposite to that desired (paradoxical movement of the vocal cords), making it difficult for air to enter: instead of opening when inhaling and exhaling, they close, making it difficult for air to enter and exit the upper airway.",
        "Symptoms": "Shortness of breath, difficulty breathing or getting air into the upper airway;/ Tight feeling in the throat;/ Asphyxiation impression;/ Noisy breathing (wheezing or high-pitched sound);/ hoarse voice;/ A sudden, severe attack may require emergency hospital treatment.",
        "Causes": "Respiratory dystonia can be caused by: Upper respiratory infection;/ Strong odors or vapors;/ tobacco smoke;/ Acid reflux;/ Strong emotions stress;/ Intense physical exercise;/",
        "Diagnosis": "The doctor observes the patient's vocal cords under direct vision with a laryngeal mirror or inserts a small fiber-optic tube (laryngoscope) through the nose to the back of the throat, where the vocal cords can be viewed. This procedure is done under a small local anesthesia and on an outpatient basis. It may be necessary to perform spirometry, which, during the crisis, generally shows blockage of the air flowing into the trachea (spirometry may be normal if it is not performed during the dystonia crisis). It may also be necessary to inhale a medicine called methacholine to relieve symptoms of respiratory dystonia.",
        "Treatment": "Speech therapy plays an important role in controlling this condition. Botulinum toxin can also be used to reduce the intensity of muscle contraction of the vocal cords.",
        "Prevention": "Managing emotional stress with relaxation techniques and biofeedback are useful in controlling crises. Controlling concomitant underlying diseases, such as asthma and gastroesophageal reflux, are fundamental measures in preventing dystonia attacks associated with these pathologies.

    "Retinal dystrophies": {
        "What is it?": "Retinal dystrophies are a group of hereditary diseases that are associated with progressive loss of visual function. Individuals with these pathologies have genetic alterations that cause damage to one or more types of cells that make up the retina. An individual with retinal dystrophy may appear to have alterations only in the cells responsible for peripheral vision, while preserving their central vision (as in some cases of Retinopathy Pigmentosa). Alternatively, your central vision may be affected, with preservation of your peripheral vision (as in Stargardt's disease). Retinal dystrophies can be diseases exclusive to the eyeball or be associated with other manifestations, forming part of syndromes. These diseases are rare and affect less than 1 in 2,000 individuals.",
        "Symptoms": "Symptoms and their onset depend on the dystrophy and the gene involved. Patients with dystrophy often experience:  Loss of visual acuity: difficulty reading or seeing things clearly in the distance;/ Changes in visual fields: presence of areas of less clarity or changes in peripheral vision;/ Nyctalopia: visual difficulty at night or in dark environments;/ Photophobia: discomfort with bright light or seeing flashes of light;/ Dyschromatopsia: change in color perception;/",
        "Causes": "Retinal dystrophies are genetic diseases. This means that the individual has determined in their genetic code the changes that condition their disease. More than 250 genes have been associated with retinal dystrophies, making it impossible, in many cases, to isolate the responsible mutation.\u00a0 The pattern of inheritance depends on the disease and the gene. This means that while some patients have multiple family members affected, others may be an isolated case.",
        "Treatment": "There is still no treatment available for retinal dystrophies. There is intense research in this field, and gene therapy is rapidly developing.\u00a0 Several techniques are being developed that are expected to restore, stop or slow down the visual loss associated with these pathologies.

    "Diverticulitis": {
        "What is it?": "Diverticula are sacs or pouches that develop through weaknesses in the colon wall, usually located in the sigmoid or left colon, sometimes affecting the entire colon. Diverticulosis corresponds to the presence of these sacs and diverticulitis represents the inflammation of these diverticula or other complications associated with them. It is not yet clear why diverticula become inflamed. It is believed that mechanical forces, such as increased pressure in the colon or the closure of the diverticulum opening by feces, can lead to infection and inflammation. Colonic diverticulosis is a common situation, it is estimated that around a third of adults over 60 years of age present it asymptomatically. It is considered to affect around 50% of the Western population at least 60 years old and almost all at 80 years old. Only a small percentage of those who have colon diverticula experience symptoms, and surgery is rarely necessary. It is an important problem due to the mortality resulting from its complications, which include diverticulitis, abscess formation, perforation, peritonitis, fistulas, obstruction and hemorrhage. These complications develop in 10% to 40% of individuals with diverticulosis. Some studies indicate around 23,600 deaths per year in Europe due to complications from diverticulosis. In addition to the mortality associated with complications and the respective family, professional and social impact, it is also important to mention the high costs of this disease.",
        "Symptoms": "Diverticula generally do not cause symptoms (80% of cases). The main symptoms are abdominal pain (usually located in the lower left quadrant), diarrhea, cramps, changes in bowel habits (constipation or diarrhea) and, occasionally, rectal bleeding. These symptoms only occur in a small percentage of patients and are similar to those found in irritable bowel syndrome. When diverticulitis occurs, with inflammation or infection of a diverticulum, pain, chills, fever and changes in bowel habits may occur. In more severe cases, perforation of the colon and intra-abdominal infections may occur, with the formation of abscesses or fistulas in the bladder or vagina. Although mild cases can be treated with rest, dietary changes and antibiotics, more severe cases may require surgical intervention.",
        "Causes": "Initially, the consumption of nuts, seeds, corn or popcorn was admitted, as they were retained in the diverticula and could be the cause of their inflammation. But it has been shown that eating these foods does not increase your risk. However, it is known that a sedentary lifestyle, extreme obesity and smoking are associated with an increased risk of diverticulitis. Age and visceral fat were also considered important factors for the occurrence of this disease. In fact, the likelihood of developing diverticula is greater in people over 40 years of age. Diverticula are rare in countries where people eat a high-fiber diet, which keeps stools softer and bulkier, but they are common in industrialized countries such as Europe and the United States. It is thought that eating a low-fiber diet for years can cause increased pressure inside the colon, resulting in the development of diverticula. It is therefore believed that a low-fiber diet is an important factor in this condition.",
        "Diagnosis": "Diverticula can be detected during endoscopic examinations (colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy) or during imaging tests, such as barium enema, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. However, most diverticula are diagnosed during tests requested for other reasons.",
        "Treatment": "Diverticulosis that is not accompanied by symptoms does not require any monitoring or treatment. The treatment of complaints associated with diverticula is similar to that for complaints associated with irritable bowel syndrome and is based on increasing the fiber content in the diet, using laxatives or medications that reduce intestinal spasms. By increasing the fiber content in the diet (cereals, legumes, vegetables, etc.) and, in some cases, restricting certain foods, it is possible to reduce intra-colic pressure, reducing the risk of complications. There are other situations that require other types of treatment, which may require hospitalization and/or surgery. Diverticulitis requires a more aggressive approach. Moderate cases can be controlled without hospitalization. Treatment consists of oral antibiotics, dietary restrictions, and probably stool softeners. Severe cases require hospitalization, with intravenous antibiotics and more significant dietary restrictions. Surgery is indicated in repeated episodes and in patients with complications that do not respond to medical therapy.",
        "Prevention": "This involves a diet rich in fiber, drinking plenty of fluids, and exercising regularly. Reducing the consumption of fats and red meat, tobacco, and anti-inflammatory medications can also reduce the risk of developing diverticular disease of the colon.

        "What is it?": "A diverticulum is any pouch that forms in the wall of the digestive tract. As a rule, they appear isolated, except in the colon, where they are more frequent and sometimes appear in large numbers, a situation we call diverticulosis. These pouches appear when, due to the pressure exerted within them, the inner layer of the wall is pushed through weak points in the muscular wall of the colon. Factors that can increase the risk of colon diverticula: Older age: diverticula are more common after age 40;;/ Low-fiber diet: Diverticula are rare in countries where people eat a high-fiber diet.;/",
        "Symptoms of diverticulosis": "Although diverticula do not produce symptoms directly in many patients, several complaints have been associated with diverticula. The most common are abdominal pain, which can be relieved by defecation, and changes in bowel function, such as constipation or episodes of diarrhea. Since these types of symptoms are similar to those observed in individuals with a condition called irritable bowel syndrome, their relationship with diverticular disease is not yet fully understood.",
        "Causes of diverticulosis": "Diverticula can rarely lead to complications such as diverticulitis, bleeding, or, rarely, perforation. Diverticulitis occurs when there is inflammation or infection of one or more diverticula.

In the past, doctors thought that eating nuts, seeds, corn or popcorn, if they got stuck in the diverticula, could cause inflammation of the diverticula, but many studies have shown that eating these foods does not increase the risk of diverticulitis. Diverticulitis can cause severe abdominal pain and fever.",

    "Peripheral arterial disease": {
        "What is it?": "Peripheral Arterial Disease is characterized by being an obstructive disease of the arterial lumen, resulting in a deficit of blood flow to the tissues, the main consequence of which is the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms of ischemia. The obstructive component of the disease is associated with atherosclerosis in approximately 90% of cases. It affects about 3% to 10% of people, increasing to 15% to 20% in adults over 70 years of age. Cardiovascular disease is one of the main causes of mortality and morbidity in the Brazilian population, which is why its early diagnosis and treatment, as well as its prevention, are essential. This disease constitutes an important marker of the presence of a high risk of cardiovascular mortality. It is identical to coronary disease, distinguishing itself only by the arteries and territories affected. The most common risk factors are: Lack of regular physical exercise;/ Hypertension;/ Hypercholesterolemia;/ Family history of angina pectoris;/ Myocardial infarction;/ Stroke;/ Abdominal aortic aneurysm;/ It is estimated that people affected by it have a four to five times greater risk of suffering a myocardial infarction or a stroke. On the other hand, if not treated properly it can develop into gangrene, requiring amputation of a limb.",
        "Symptoms": "The main symptom of Peripheral Artery Disease is pain in the legs when walking (claudication) that improves when exertion is stopped. This discomfort results from the greater need for oxygen and nutrients during walking that are not sufficiently supplied by the obstructed arteries. Other signs are a feeling of numbness or weakness in the legs, colder and/or paler feet and legs, wounds that do not heal, and pain in the feet or fingers when resting. Over time, the skin may become darker or bluish. Its manifestations worsen over time, as a consequence of the progressive reduction in oxygen supply. Thus, discomfort initially appears after a certain distance covered, and this interval reduces, to the point where pain appears in the legs. In more serious cases, erectile dysfunction may even occur.",
        "Causes": "Smokers, diabetics, obese and/or hypertensive patients are the most affected, as these diseases increase the likelihood of damage to the innermost layer of the vessels, which leads to hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis). The presence of kidney disease associated with hemodialysis is another risk factor.",
        "Diagnosis": "Peripheral Arterial Disease often goes undiagnosed, which increases the risk of complications. A medical examination is very useful because it allows the detection of various signs of the disease, such as the color of the legs (which become paler), the presence of hair (which does not grow or falls out due to insufficient blood supply), the sensitivity of the skin, the presence of wounds and the presence or absence of pulses in various parts of the lower limbs. These elements, together with a history of pre-existing diseases (smoking, high cholesterol, diabetes, obesity, hypertension) are almost always sufficient for a diagnosis, which must be confirmed by performing imaging tests. These allow a better definition of the location and extent of the problem and are essential in planning medical or surgical treatment. The initial test is Color Doppler ultrasound, a special ultrasound that assesses blood flow in the vessels and identifies the presence of obstructions. In some cases, angiotomography, angioresonance or arteriography may be requested.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment will depend on the degree of obstruction and the patient's general condition. In most cases, it starts with changing your lifestyle. In fact, stopping smoking, controlling diabetes and high blood pressure, losing weight, reducing cholesterol and exercising are fundamental aspects of treating and preventing peripheral arterial disease. Physical exercise, such as walking, does not allow the unblocking of already clogged arteries, but it facilitates the creation of new pathways through which blood and oxygen can reach the tissues. There are, on the other hand, drugs that allow better dilation of the arteries, increasing blood flow. Medical treatment of diabetes, hypercholesterolemia and high blood pressure is equally essential. The use of aspirin or antiplatelet medications prevents the formation of clots and helps maintain blood flow. All of them must be selected on a case-by-case basis and always require a medical prescription. Surgery is an alternative for restoring blood flow. There are several techniques, from bypass to catheterization, but the areas of the obstructed arteries are dilated using a balloon, and then prostheses are inserted to keep them open.",
        "Prevention": "Quitting smoking, controlling diabetes and high blood pressure, losing weight, reducing cholesterol and exercising are factors that help keep your arteries in excellent condition.

    "Bipolar disorder": {
        "What is it?": "Bipolar Disorder (BP), previously called manic-depressive psychosis, is a chronic psychiatric pathology characterized by marked mood swings. Typically, it is manifested by periods of elevated mood and increased energy and activity (mania or hypomania ) alternating with phases of depression and decreased energy and activity. Either type can predominate in the same person, and their frequency can vary considerably. These episodes can be severe, moderate or mild and have a significant impact on the sensations, emotions, ideas and behavior of the person affected, with a significant loss of quality of life and autonomy. Fluctuations in mood, energy and activity levels interfere with all daily tasks. Bipolar disorder is different from the normal fluctuations in emotions and mood that occur over time. In this illness, the symptoms are more severe, impair relationships, school and work performance, and can lead to suicide. Despite all this, it can be treated and is compatible with a long and productive life. It often begins in adolescence or young adulthood. Half of all cases first appear before the age of 25. However, it can begin earlier or later in life. It is estimated that around 2% of the population suffers from this disease, in an identical percentage for both sexes, reaching 4% to 12% if other diseases on the bipolar spectrum are included. While Type I bipolar disorder affects men and women similarly, Type II is more common in women. Some available information regarding the national reality estimates that there are around 200 thousand cases of bipolar disorder in Portugal.",
        "Symptoms": "Periods of mania are characterized by euphoric or irritable mood, increased self-esteem, decreased need for sleep, accelerated thinking and/or speech, increased energy and greater involvement in pleasurable activities (excessive spending, sexual disinhibition, etc.), which are severe enough to cause social and work degradation. In some cases, psychotic symptoms may occur, such as hallucinations or delusions. Hypomania exhibits similar criteria, but in smaller numbers, intensity and, sometimes, shorter duration, with no psychotic signs or social or work-related deterioration. Mixed episodes require the existence of depressive and manic symptoms simultaneously. The first episode of the disease typically occurs in the 2nd or 3rd decade of life, although it can manifest at any age.",
        "Causes": "The cause of bipolar disorder has not yet been fully studied. Biological and psychosocial factors appear to be involved. The former include genetic factors (higher risk of the disease in patients with first-degree relatives with BP), neurochemical factors (dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, GABA, glutamate, acetylcholine), hormonal factors (changes in the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal and hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axes) and neuroanatomical factors (nonspecific structural and functional changes in the brains of these patients). Psychosocial factors such as stressful life events also appear to influence the onset of BP and future relapses.",
        "Diagnosis": "From a diagnostic point of view, BP is subdivided into Type I (BP I) and II (BP II), the first being characterized by the occurrence of at least one manic or mixed episode and the second by the occurrence of at least one hypomanic episode (without manic or mixed episodes). Early diagnosis is essential for correct treatment and a good prognosis. It is based on a detailed collection of the patient's clinical history, with additional diagnostic tests (appropriately guided interviews and laboratory tests), which are important for ruling out other pathologies. It is the psychiatrist's responsibility to assess these cases and confirm or deny the diagnosis. Generally speaking, a bipolar patient seeks help more easily in the depressive phase than in the manic phase.",
        "Treatment": "PB must be treated in the long term. There are two phases in treatment: the acute phase (manic, hypomanic, depressive, mixed) and the maintenance phase. Therapy is fundamentally pharmacological. Mood stabilizing medications can, in fact, control the disease, reducing the likelihood of relapses, both in depression and mania. Antidepressants or antipsychotics can also be used, and treatment selection should always be made by the doctor. Psychoeducation and cognitive-behavioral therapy can also be combined, in addition to individual and family psychological support. More serious crises tend to involve hospitalization.",
        "Prevention": "There is no specific method for preventing bipolar disorder. Since its exact cause has not yet been determined, it is especially important to be aware of its symptoms and seek early intervention. Regular and continued use of medications prescribed by specialist doctors can help control episodes of mania and depression. Cleveland Clinic Impulsivity, instability and self-harming behaviors are some of the signs that can alert you to a borderline personality disorder.

This pathology affects the small intestine of genetically predisposed adults and children. The disease causes atrophy of the villi of the small intestine mucosa, causing poor absorption of nutrients, vitamins, mineral salts and water.",
        "Symptoms": "Symptoms may include diarrhea, developmental difficulties (in children), and fatigue.",

Celiac disease is more common in some families, in people with type 1 diabetes, liver and thyroid disease, Down, Turner or Williams syndromes. As it tends to be genetic, in the presence of these pathologies, it is recommended to undergo medical examinations. Diagnostic tests include: gluten exposure test, genetic analysis (HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 genes) and blood analysis (antibodies in the blood). The diagnostic process should include digestive endoscopy (total colonoscopy with ileoscopy) with intestinal biopsies.",
        "Treatment": "There are no medications that treat celiac disease; the only effective treatment is a strict gluten-free diet. Nutritional monitoring is essential in order to develop a balanced nutritional plan. Wheat, rye, barley, Graham flours, malt and semolina should be avoided; some celiacs tolerate oats (labeled gluten-free). Wheat flour is a common ingredient in canned soup, salad dressings, ice cream, instant coffee, processed or canned meats, mustard and ketchup, yogurt, pasta and sweets. It may also be present in vitamins and supplements (wheat starch is used in the manufacture of tablets and capsules), toothpaste, mouthwash products and cosmetics, such as lipstick. The diet must complement nutrient deficiencies such as vitamins and minerals that are not absorbed properly, especially: iron, calcium, fiber, zinc, vitamin D, niacin, magnesium and folic acid. After starting a gluten-free diet, the intestine recovers and can absorb these elements again, but it may be necessary to take multivitamins or supplements to address these deficiencies.",

    "Addison's disease": {
        "What is it?": "Addison's disease is a rare chronic disease that affects both children and adults. It results from the failure of the adrenal glands in the production of steroid hormones (cortisol, androgens and aldosterone) essential for life. The secretion of adrenaline and noradrenaline is not affected. Addison's disease, or adrenal insufficiency, occurs when the outer layer of the adrenal glands is damaged. The adrenal glands, which are part of the endocrine system, are located above each kidney and produce hormones that affect all organs and tissues. They consist of two layers, the medulla (inner layer) and the cortex (outer layer).",
        "Symptoms": "Damage to the adrenal glands occurs slowly and symptoms develop gradually; the most common include: Abdominal pain;/ Abnormal menstrual periods;/ Craving salty food;/ Dehydration;/ Depression;/ Diarrhea;/ Irritability;/ Postural hypotension;/ Loss of appetite;/ Low blood glucose;/ Muscle weakness;/ Nausea;/ Dark spots on the skin, especially around scars, skin folds, and joints;/ Sensitivity to cold;/ Unexplained weight loss;/ Vomiting;/ Fatigue and extreme tiredness;/ In some severe, sudden cases\u2014such as injury, illness, or intense stress\u2014symptoms can come on quickly and cause an Addison's crisis, or acute adrenal insufficiency, which is considered a medical emergency (if left untreated, it can lead to shock and death). Symptoms of a crisis include: Restlessness, confusion, fear, or other sudden mental changes;/ Dehydration;/ Extreme weakness;/ Excessive drowsiness or total loss of consciousness;/ High fever;/ Dizziness or feeling faint;/ Pallor;/ Vomiting and severe diarrhea;/",
        "Causes": "Addison's disease\u00a0is caused by dysfunction of the adrenal glands, preventing the normal secretion of corticosteroids, from an autoimmune cause, genetic problems or other conditions, including tuberculosis and cancer.",
        "Diagnosis": "Addison's disease is diagnosed by evaluating symptoms, physical signs, and additional diagnostic tests. Examination of the patient usually reveals signs of fatigue, weakness, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation or diarrhea, dizziness, muscle and joint pain, and low blood pressure. Tests may reveal: abnormal elements - such as low sodium (hyponatremia), low glucose (hypoglycemia) or high potassium (hyperkalemia). Other more specific tests: cortisol levels in urine, morning cortisol in blood, cortisol in saliva; blood aldosterone and blood adrenocorticotropic hormone (individuals with Addison's disease, the cortisol level is below the reference level and the adrenocorticotropic hormone is elevated). Additional tests: computed tomography (allows checking the adrenal glands and pituitary gland); adrenocorticotropic stimulation test.",
        "Treatment": "To treat Addison's disease, your doctor may prescribe hormones similar to those produced by the adrenal glands, such as hydrocortisone tablets to replace cortisol. If the patient also lacks aldosterone, they may be given fludrocortisone acetate. If the patient is taking fludrocortisone, the doctor may ask you to increase your salt intake, especially in hot, humid weather and after vigorous exercise. In emergencies and during surgery, medications are administered intravenously.",

    "Crohn's disease": {
        "What is it?": "Crohn's disease is a type of chronic inflammatory bowel disease that causes inflammation of the digestive tract. It can cause pain, be debilitating and sometimes life-threatening. It can affect all age groups, especially young adults, aged between 16 and 40 years. It affects men and women in equal proportions, however some studies report a higher incidence in females. It appears to be more common in some families, as about 20% of patients with Crohn's disease have a family member, most often a brother or sister, or a father, mother or child, with some form of inflammatory bowel disease. In Portugal, in recent years, there has been an increasing incidence of this pathology. The estimated prevalence is 73 cases for every 100 thousand inhabitants.",
        "Symptoms": "Symptoms of Crohn's disease can vary, but the most common complaints are diarrhea, cramping abdominal pain, and weight loss. Symptoms unrelated to the digestive system, such as joint pain and skin lesions, may also occur. Other early manifestations include lesions in the perianal region, including fissures, fistulas, and abscesses. This disease has a variable course, with periods in which it is active and others in which it is not associated with any symptoms. Its most common complications are: Bowel obstruction, which may involve surgery;/ Ulcers in any area of \u200b\u200bthe digestive tract, including the mouth, anus and genital region;/ Fistulas, when ulcers extend through the wall of the intestine creating an abnormal connection (fistula) between two areas of the intestine, between the intestine and the skin or between the intestine and another organ such as the bladder or vagina;/ Osteoporosis;/ Inflammation of the skin, eyes, joints, liver or bile ducts;/ Increased risk of colon cancer;/",
        "Causes": "The cause of Crohn's disease is not yet known, but the most likely hypothesis is the existence of a certain factor (virus, bacteria) that causes the body's immune response. This will subsequently cause inflammation of the intestine, even when the causative agent is no longer present. Furthermore, there are hereditary origins that can contribute to an increased risk of its development. It is also necessary to take into account age (this disease generally develops before the age of 30, although it can occur at any age), family history, smoking (it is associated not only with an increased risk of developing the disease but also of becoming more serious), and the place of residence (it is more common in individuals who live in urban areas of industrialized countries). Stress can aggravate the symptoms of the disease.",
        "Diagnosis": "Depending on the location, several diagnostic tests may be necessary, including endoscopy, which allows the inside of the intestine to be examined and small fragments of the mucosa (biopsies) to be collected for microscopic study. Endoscopy provides an accurate diagnosis for most diseases that affect the colon and also allows for various treatments. CT or abdominal MRI may also be relevant, as well as some laboratory tests.",
        "Treatment": "There is currently no medicine that cures Crohn's Disease. There are, however, several treatments that improve complaints and induce remission for a long period of time, offering a better quality of life. Appropriate therapy depends on several factors such as symptoms, location, severity and extent of the disease, and the response to treatments already carried out, among others. Medication: The main drugs used to reduce inflammation are mesalazine and corticosteroids. These are used in the acute phase when symptoms are more severe. In forms refractory to treatment and in the disease complicated by fistulas, immunosuppressive drugs and biological therapies are used. Antibiotics are useful in the treatment of perianal complications.;/ Food: Most patients can eat normally and without restrictions, with the exception of periods when diarrhea occurs. During these phases, a low-fiber diet that does not contain lactose should be followed. Some patients must avoid milk altogether, as they cannot properly digest the sugar present in this food, as they lack a specific enzyme in their small intestine. In patients with malabsorption it may be necessary to administer vitamins and minerals.;/ Surgery: In patients with symptoms of intestinal occlusion, fistulas, severe or very frequent acute episodes, it may be necessary to resort to surgery. This is generally necessary when medical treatment is unable to control symptoms or when there is a complication (bowel obstruction, perforation, abscess, or bleeding).

        "What is it?": "Most patients with Cushing's disease have small tumors (microadenomas) in the pituitary gland. Diagnosis of Cushing's disease can be time-consuming and the disease should always be monitored by a doctor specializing in endocrinology. It results from the excessive production of the pituitary hormone called ACTH, which in turn leads to the production of cortisol by the adrenal gland above the levels necessary and desirable for the normal functioning of the body.",
        "Symptoms": "Physically, it manifests itself as an increase in fat on the trunk, keeping the arms and legs slim. Bruises or red stretch marks may appear on the skin and up to 50% of patients may experience changes in mood and sleep. Diabetes and hypertension are not uncommon in this situation.",
        "Causes": "Cushing's disease is caused by an excess of cortisol in the blood caused by a tumor in the pituitary gland that secretes adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), produced by the pituitary gland. ACTH stimulates the adrenal glands (located on top of the kidneys) to produce cortisol (the stress hormone).",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis is quite complex. If there is sufficient clinical and laboratory suspicion, it involves performing several screening tests followed by confirmation. Urine and blood tests often have to be repeated on more than one occasion. There is often a need to perform dynamic endocrinological tests.",

    "Dupuytren's disease": {
        "What is it?": "Dupuytren's disease is caused by an abnormal thickening of the palmar fascia (tissue between the skin and the tendon and vascular-nervous structures in the palm and fingers) that can limit the mobility of one or more fingers. In some patients, a subcutaneous cord forms that extends from the palm of the hand to the fingers, causing flexion of the fingers, limiting their extension. Sometimes the disease can cause thickening on the dorsal surface of the finger joints, contracture in the penis or on the plantar surface of the feet. It was described in 1832 by Baron Guillaume de Dupuytren and took his name. The cause of Dupuytren's disease is unknown and is more common in northern European populations and in men.",
        "Symptoms": "The disease does not usually cause pain. It normally develops slowly with the appearance of a nodule at the level of the distal crease of the palm of the hand, most frequently on the 4th and 5th fingers, later developing with a cord between the palm and fingers, leading to progressively retracting them onto the palm of the hand, interfering with daily activities. The skin may be involved, but the tendons and vascular-nervous structures are not affected. The disease affects the ring finger and little finger more, and generally progresses slowly over years, but it can also progress more quickly and cause severe contracture of the fingers.",
        "Causes": "The cause of the disease is unknown and there is no permanent cure. It is normally painless and has no tumor-like characteristics. It most frequently affects people of Celtic origin (often there is a family history), with men being more affected than women and an onset at an earlier age and they are usually more aggressive, as well as in people who have other areas of the body affected. Some forms may be associated with trauma, diabetes and ingestion of some medications (tuberculostatics)",
        "Diagnosis": "It is done through the patient's history and physical examination and generally does not require additional diagnostic tests.",
        "Treatment": "In mild and initial cases without affecting hand function, only clinical follow-up is necessary without surgery. In cases where the nodules are painful or where the inability to open the fingers affects the function of the hand, surgical treatment is necessary. This treatment can be done using minimally invasive techniques (needle pricks) or by opening the skin, depending on the case and the surgeon's experience. The treatment improves the function of the hand and allows the fingers to open; however, the disease may reappear, especially in younger patients. Non-Surgical Treatment The aim of treatment is to eliminate finger contracture and restore hand functionality. The mere presence of a nodule is not in itself an indication for surgery; the retraction of the fingers and the functional limitation caused are what determine the indication for treatment. Some non-surgical alternatives such as percutaneous cord interruption with a needle, but with a high recurrence rate. An alternative with a lower recurrence rate is the injection of a collagenase that causes the destruction of the cord in a specific area, allowing the finger to be extended. Surgical Treatment There is no definitive cure for Dupuytren's disease, and it may recur in the same site or appear in a new area, more or less frequently, but regional, extended or total fasciectomy is the method with the lowest recurrence rate. In some more serious cases, it may be necessary to interpose a skin graft or use a local flap to cover some tendon or vascular-nervous structures. When the contracture of the fingers is already very severe, full extension of the fingers may not be possible and in many situations it is necessary to establish a physiotherapy program until the hand functions normally.

    "Huntington's disease": {
        "What is it?": "Huntington's disease is a degenerative disease of the central nervous system, caused by the loss of cells in a part of the brain (basal ganglia). This lack affects cognitive capacity, emotional balance and motor skills. It is an inherited brain disorder that affects people from all populations, all over the world. Its name comes from the doctor George Huntington, who gave the first description of what he called \u201cHereditary Chorea\u201d. The term \u201cKorea\u201d originates from the Latin word choreus (which refers to \u201cdance\u201d) due to involuntary movements, one of the main symptoms of this disease. Symptoms appear very gradually, usually between the ages of 30 and 50. However, it can sometimes affect children or even the elderly. In most cases, patients can be independent for several years after the first symptoms appear, provided they are well monitored by doctors, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, nutritionists and other professionals. In the United States of America there are currently around 30 thousand individuals with this disease. In Portugal, although there are no absolute values, some studies indicate a prevalence similar to that in other Western countries, between five and 12 patients for every 100 thousand inhabitants. It is a pathology that can be passed from generation to generation through the transmission of altered genes. Men and women are equally likely to inherit it from an affected parent. Those to whom it is not transmitted do not develop the disease, nor can they pass it on to their children and other descendants. There is a genetic test available to determine whether or not an at-risk person carries the Huntington's disease gene.",
        "Symptoms": "The symptoms of Huntington's disease vary greatly, even within families. For some, the involuntary movements may be pronounced even in the early stages. For others, they may be less obvious and the emotional and behavioral signs may be more obvious. In general, it is important to consider: Emotional/behavioral symptoms, such as depression, irritability, anxiety and apathy, aggressive or impulsive behavior, mood swings and social isolation;;/ Cognitive/intellectual symptoms, related to a reduced ability to organize routine matters or to deal effectively with unexpected situations, changes in memory and the ability to concentrate;;/ Motor symptoms, such as muscle twitching, excessive restlessness, facial tics, or changes in handwriting.;/ These signs gradually evolve into involuntary movements (Chorea), which are often associated with difficulties in walking and balance. They tend to increase during periods of voluntary effort, stress or excitement and decrease during rest and sleep. Speech and swallowing can also be affected. In advanced stages, severe chorea may occur, but rigidity is more common. During these periods, patients become completely dependent on others for all personal care, are unable to walk, and are unable to make themselves understood through speech. Although cognitive abilities are also severely affected, it is important to remember that, in general, the patient is aware of his or her surroundings, continues to be able to understand language, and is aware of those around him or her. People do not die from the disease itself, but from complications associated with immobility, such as choking on food, infections or head injuries. Death usually occurs, on average, around 15 to 20 years after the onset of the disease, although the duration can vary greatly between individuals. Suicide is also common in this condition.",
        "Causes": "Huntington's disease is a genetic disease, caused by a defect in chromosome 4. It is hereditary of the dominant type, which means that one copy of the defective gene is enough for the disease to manifest itself.",
        "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis involves a medical, neurological and psychological examination and a detailed family history. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography are useful in ruling out other causes of the symptoms. Positron emission tomography may also be requested, as may an electroencephalogram. Genetic testing can be used to confirm or exclude the disease. However, a positive result is not sufficient to confirm the clinical diagnosis.",
        "Treatment": "There is no cure or strategy to prevent its progression. Therefore, the goals are to delay the onset of symptoms and keep the patient independent and active for as long as possible. Therapy can be effective for depression or anxiety, or it can help minimize involuntary movements. It is important that these patients are monitored by a neurologist who can coordinate work with other health professionals.",
        "Prevention": "Prevention involves genetic counseling, which is essential whenever there is suspicion or knowledge of the mutation's carrier status. This step allows you to define the risk of transmitting the disease to descendants. On the other hand, it is important to consider all forms of treatment as a mechanism to prevent complications and improve the quality of life of these people. Portuguese Association of Huntington's Patients National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine, Maio de 2013 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society, 2013 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, Maio de 2011 Dementia is more common in older adults, but it is not an inevitable consequence of aging.

    "Kawasaki": {
        "What is it?": "Kawasaki disease is a vasculitis, that is, an inflammation of small and medium-sized blood vessels. It is an acute, febrile and rare disease that affects children, in 85% of cases under 5 years of age. One of the most serious effects of this disease is inflammation and damage to the coronary arteries - those that transport the blood that feeds the heart. It is one of the main causes of acquired heart disease in children, but it is treatable if identified early. Most children recover from the disease without developing other health problems.",
        "Symptoms": "The diagnosis of Kawasaki disease is clinical, that is, it is made based on symptoms and signs that patients present. There must be a high, daily fever that is difficult to control with antipyretics for more than 5 days and at least 4 of the following symptoms: Pink, maculopapular rash, most common between the chest and legs and in the genital and groin area. Peeling of the skin on the hands and feet is common in the 2nd week of illness.;/ Redness and swelling of the back of the hands and soles of the feet.;/ Red eyes without exudate;/ Cervical lymph node, in the neck, larger than 1.5 cm.;/ Inflammation of the mouth and lips.;/ Red tongue.;/ There may be reference to other symptoms, called minor symptoms, which generally appear later, such as: Joint pain.;/ Abdominal pain.;/ Gastrointestinal problems such as diarrhea and vomiting.;/ Irritability;/ Kawasaki disease can cause heart problems, such as myocarditis and coronary aneurysms, especially if treatment is not started within the 10th day of illness. As the diagnosis is clinical, it is essential that the doctor suspects the disease, as timely treatment prevents cardiac complications. The incidence of these complications when the patient is not treated is 20 to 30%, while if treatment is carried out they will be 3 to 5%.",
        "Causes": "The cause of this disease has not yet been determined. The disease was first described in Japan. It may be associated with viruses, bacteria and other factors present in the child's daily life, such as chemicals. It occurs more commonly in winter and spring. Kawasaki disease is not contagious.",
        "Diagnosis": "There is no specific test for diagnosing Kawasaki disease. As mentioned, the diagnosis is clinical, based on the sum of symptoms and signs that the child presents. However, there are laboratory changes associated with this disease, so the doctor will carry out an analytical evaluation of blood and urine. When this disease is suspected, a cardiological evaluation is always carried out, namely an echocardiogram.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment for Kawasaki disease involves hospitalization. The essential therapy is the intravenous administration of human immunoglobulin, which will provide antibodies to combat vasculitis. Along with this therapy, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) is always administered initially in high doses. When treatment is started early, the risk of the child developing heart problems is much lower, as mentioned above.",
        "Complications": "Most children recover completely and have no future problems. The aforementioned cardiac complications are the most feared. However, there are cases described as atypical Kawasaki disease, which may be associated with more difficult diagnoses and, therefore, more complications. Every child diagnosed with Kawasaki disease should be monitored by their attending physician and, if there has been heart damage, by a pediatric cardiologist for a few months.

    "Lyme disease": {
        "What is it?": "Lyme disease is an infectious, non-contagious disease transmitted by tick bites. Its initial manifestations are dermatological and can evolve into chronic problems in organs such as the central nervous system or the heart. The greatest risk of bites from these ticks occurs in temperate climates, in forests and humid woodlands. The disease is also characterized by seasonality: the highest incidence occurs in spring and cold months. Portugal is considered a country where the presence of the tick responsible for transmitting Lyme disease is endemic. The disease is mandatory for medical notification, but cases are underreported.",
        "Symptoms": "The most common symptom is erythema migrans, a round, reddish spot, with a central clear area, around the tick bite. This spot on the skin must be at least five centimeters in diameter and is the most common skin manifestation of the disease. Some people develop borrelian lymphocytoma (a type of reddish nodule on the skin, more common in Europe) and chronic atrophic acrodermatitis (skin atrophy with prominent blood vessels, also associated with European cases). Early medical evaluation is essential so that treatment can be implemented before symptoms progress (even if the skin signs appear to have disappeared). Within a period of up to three weeks, the following may also develop: Fever;/ Fatigue;/ Headaches;/ Neck stiffness;/ Muscle pain;/ Joint pain;/ Swollen lymph nodes;/  The progression of the infection, months (or even years) after the bite, can affect other organs, such as the heart and central nervous system, and lead to other symptoms and complications, such as aseptic meningitis, cranial neuritis, encephalomyelitis, meningoencephalitis, radiculopathies, atrioventricular block or myocarditis.",
        "Causes": "The bite of a tick of the ixodes genus transmits bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi, Borrelia mayonii, Borrelia afzelii or Borrelia garinii, the last two being more common in Europe. For the infection to occur, the tick must feed on the skin of the person in question for a period of around 24 hours - ticks removed from the skin before this period do not transmit the disease. This disease is characteristic of areas with a temperate climate, being considered endemic in central Europe, the northeast of the United States of America, Scandinavia, northern Japan and other regions of Asia. Studies indicate that climate change may influence the areas of the globe where Lyme disease is most prevalent. The seasonality of this infection is also being impacted by global warming covering more months of the year, with a predominance of the cold months of September and March, in the case of adult ticks, and in spring, in the case of younger animals.",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis depends on the identification of symptoms (dermatological and others) and the relationship with identification, when possible, of risky situations in which the tick bite may have occurred; In cases where the bite is not immediately identified, it may be presumed due to a history of occupational exposure, etc. In addition, the diagnosis can be made through laboratory tests, especially in the presence of rarer skin manifestations of Lyme disease. Blood tests, serological tests (which look for the presence of antibodies to the bacteria) and a histopathological examination (microscopic analysis of the tissues) can be performed.",
        "Treatment": "When a tick is identified on the skin, it must be removed and the individual must undergo clinical surveillance for a period of 30 days. Antibiotic therapy is effective. Doxycycline, when administered at the first symptoms, is highly effective and the likelihood of the patient developing the most severe forms of the disease is very low.",
        "Prevention": "As most infections occur in woodlands, forests and similar environments with high humidity, it is important to start by identifying whether or not you are in an endemic area. If so, you should cover as much body surface as possible - without forgetting the scalp and feet. Clothing should be light-colored, which helps locate any ticks, and mosquito and tick repellent should be applied all over the body as well as on clothing and shoes. At the end of the day, in endemic areas, it is essential to meticulously analyze the entire body (exposed by clothing or not) to try to locate any ticks and remove them. As Portugal is one of the areas where the infectious tick circulates endemically, it is important to remain aware of its presence, especially by professionals such as forest rangers, farmers or campers and trekkers.

    "Meniere's disease": {
        "What is it?": "It is a chronic pathology of the inner ear. This contains tubular structures, the semicircular canals, which are filled with a liquid (endolymph). It is important in interpreting body position and maintaining balance. M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease results from the accumulation of large amounts of fluid in the inner ear. Symptoms tend to be triggered by situations such as stress, overwork, fatigue, pressure variations, excess salt or the intake of certain foods. There is currently no cure. M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease is named after the French doctor who described it in the 19th century. It can develop at any age, being more common between the ages of 40 and 60. Vertigo is the most obvious cause of dizziness, accounting for 54% of all cases. Of these, 90% are caused by three diseases, one of which is M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease.",
        "Symptoms": "The symptoms are very varied, being different before, during and after each outbreak. These may be preceded by an \u201caura\u201d that allows the patient to prepare in the best possible way before the crisis occurs. During this period, changes in balance, dizziness, headache, increased pressure in the ears, hearing loss or tinnitus, sensitivity to sounds or malaise may occur. During an attack, severe dizziness, intermittent hearing loss and a sensation of fullness in the ear, with or without tinnitus, may occur. Other symptoms may include anxiety or panic, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, blurred vision, cold sweats, palpitations and tremors. These symptoms generally worsen if the patient makes sudden movements. At the end of each attack, there is a period of extreme fatigue that requires a few hours of sleep. Between attacks, there may be anxiety, changes in appetite, difficulty concentrating, fatigue, headaches, loss of self-esteem, muscle tension, palpitations and changes in vision, or there may be no signs of the disease at all. An outbreak may last 20 minutes or 24 hours and recur several times a week or at intervals of months or years. The variety of symptoms and their unpredictable nature make this disease very disturbing, with a strong impact on patients' quality of life. As such, an effective education and communication process with affected individuals is essential so that they learn to deal with their pathology as best as possible. It's important to involve family and friends so everyone knows how to react whenever an attack occurs. During these crises, it is essential that the patient is placed in a safe, quiet place, avoiding head and eye movements and avoiding intense lights. Good hydration will also be important, especially if vomiting occurs. After the attack, rest is essential and it is equally important that activity is resumed gradually after each attack. Regular physical exercise can help, as can proper stress management. In the later stages of the disease, hearing loss becomes persistent, tinnitus becomes stronger and imbalance can interfere with walking. These signs are particularly problematic in conditions of low light, fatigue or in the presence of very intense visual stimuli. The most common complications are the inability to walk due to uncontrollable vertigo or hearing loss on the affected side.",
        "Causes": "Its causes are not well known, but it is believed that it may result from circulatory, allergic or genetic problems, or be related to viral infections or trauma. Tobacco and alcohol have also been identified as potential causes.",
        "Diagnosis": "It involves a neurological examination, hearing tests and more specific procedures such as caloric stimulation tests and others. An MRI scan may also be useful.",
        "Treatment": "It is important to remember that this disease is currently not curable. However, available treatments help manage your symptoms. They aim, on the one hand, to reduce the severity of each outbreak and, on the other, to reduce its frequency. As a general rule, available therapy has positive results in 60% to 80% of people. An important aspect is the adoption of a reduced sodium diet, which helps control water retention, thus reducing pressure in the inner ear. Diuretics can contribute to this relief. A widely used medication is betahistine, which helps with vertigo. Drugs that control nausea and vomiting, as well as some sedatives, may also be useful. There are other options that involve vestibular rehabilitation (an exercise program to reduce symptoms of imbalance and dizziness) or some types of surgery. The doctor must define the best therapy for each case.",
        "Prevention": "Considering that it is a disease that cannot be prevented, a correct approach requires that the pathology is well known to everyone involved so that it is easier to deal with it and make the most appropriate decisions at each moment.

    "Parkinson's disease": {
        "What is it?": "Parkinson's disease results from reduced levels of a substance that functions as a chemical messenger in the brain in the centers that control movement. This substance is dopamine. When its levels reduce, the brain cells that produce it die. It is a brain disorder named after the English doctor who described it in the 19th century. It is quite common and progressive, with key features being tremors, stiffness of the trunk and limbs and slowness of movement. However, new and promising treatments have emerged. It is estimated that around 20 thousand Portuguese people suffer from this disease. Central hospitals register more than 1800 new cases per year and it is expected that, with the increase in the longevity of the population, this disease will increase in the next 20 years, affecting around 30 thousand people. On a global scale, it is estimated that there are seven to 10 million individuals with Parkinson's. Its prevalence increases with age, being rare before the age of 50, and is more common in men than in women. However, in 5% of cases, it appears before the age of 40.",
        "Symptoms": "Since dopamine controls muscle activity, the symptoms are mainly related to movement. In addition to tremors, stiffness and slowness, there are other manifestations that affect sleep, thinking, speech and the mood of patients. The first sign of the disease is, in general, a slight tremor in a hand, arm or leg that occurs when the affected extremity is at rest, but which can increase in moments of greater tension. As a rule, it improves when the patient voluntarily moves the affected extremity and may disappear during sleep. As the disease progresses, the tremor becomes more diffuse and can affect the extremities on both sides of the body. When facial muscles are affected, expression may become dull and, in the case of other muscles, the patient may be unable to take care of themselves. Depression or anxiety are common in patients with Parkinson's, as are memory disorders. Visual, chewing and swallowing difficulties, urinary incontinence, changes in sexuality, cramps, and increased sweating may also occur. Postural instability and difficulties in walking make it quite disabling, making it difficult to sit down and stand up and forcing people to walk with small, shuffling steps and without the normal pendulum movement of the arms. It is important to note that each patient experiences their symptoms differently.",
        "Causes": "For Parkinson's symptoms to appear, 70% to 80% of brain cells must die. However, it is not known why they die and why some people develop the disease and others do not. Some factors that may be responsible for its occurrence include: family history, exposure to pesticides or industrial toxins, and aging.",
        "Diagnosis": "It depends on the clinical history and neurological evaluation. There is no laboratory test that allows a definitive diagnosis. In the face of a picture suggestive of this disease, carrying out a treatment trial with levodopa is useful. If symptoms improve during this trial, the likelihood of Parkinson's disease is high.",
        "Treatment": "Although there is no cure, symptoms can be controlled through different types of medications, which stimulate the release of dopamine, as long as there are still dopamine-producing brain cells. When this is not possible, another type of drug is used, such as levodopa, which is then converted into dopamine in the brain. There are also other classes of medications that imitate its action and others that prevent its degradation. The choice of appropriate treatment therefore depends on the stage of the disease. Some studies report interest in the use of some antioxidants and supplements with vitamin E and C. It is essential that the use of these other substances is always done with the doctor's knowledge and agreement. Regular physical exercise and a balanced diet are equally important, which allow you to offer a better quality of life and increase body control.",
        "What is the prognosis of Parkinson's disease?": "Parkinson's disease has no cure, but current treatments allow for much more effective control, improving all aspects of patients' lives.",
        "Prevention": "The cause of Parkinson's disease remains under investigation and therefore its prevention is not yet possible. Some studies suggest that aerobic exercise can reduce the risk of the disease, while other inconclusive studies link reduced risk to coffee and tea consumption. This evidence remains to be proven.

Its\u00a0 exact incidence is difficult to determine because many cases go undiagnosed. But in 20% there is a family relationship.",
        "Symptoms": "Difficulty walking and pain when moving due to muscle spasm. These symptoms result from irritation of the tissues around the hip. There may be only discomfort or discomfort in the groin and/or knee (in about 50% of cases, pain from the hip may radiate to the knee). An increase in bone density can be seen on x-rays. Then the head of the femur begins to fragment and, finally, revascularization occurs with late bone remodeling. The child may limp and complain of pain. Symptoms may be intermittent over weeks or months. Rest tends to alleviate these manifestations.",
        "Causes": "The exact cause is not known, although it may result from changes in coagulation phenomena with consequent formation of thrombi. Their occurrence compromises the circulation of the femoral head, thus developing the disease.",
        "Diagnosis": "Although early diagnosis is not very important in terms of treatment, the use of imaging allows us to differentiate this disease from other conditions that require more immediate treatment. X-rays are the classic test to confirm the diagnosis, although they are not very effective in the early stages of the disease;;/ Scintigraphy, capable of demonstrating the ischemic area early, appears to be useful in cases of acute synovitis, in which the signs last for two to three weeks, and to demonstrate the degree of tissue involvement and its revascularization;;/ Magnetic resonance imaging immediately shows necrosis and its extent.

    "Chronic liver disease": {
        "What is it?": "Chronic liver disease (CLD) is any form of advanced liver disease, in which the liver has been exposed, on a continuous basis, to one or more forms of aggression. The liver is an essential organ for maintaining the balance of our body, being responsible for such important functions as the formation of factors for blood clotting and the elimination of toxins. It has an enormous capacity for regeneration, that is, once damaged, it can recover by producing new cells from the existing ones. However, when these attacks are perpetuated over time, regeneration occurs incorrectly, resulting in scars (fibrosis) and nodules. At this stage, which is the most advanced stage of CLD, we can say that we are dealing with cirrhosis. This means that there is theoretically greater difficulty (resistance) in the passage of blood through the liver and that there may be compromise in the functions it performs.",
        "Symptoms": "During most of this process the liver does not produce any symptoms. The word cirrhosis is stigmatizing and most often misinterpreted. There are, broadly speaking, two phases of the disease. One in which episodes of decompensation have never occurred, that is, the disease has no symptoms and is often unknown; another, in which patients have complications, such as bleeding, jaundice, ascites (\"water belly\") or infections. The latter is the decompensated phase. Between one and the other, years can pass. In other words, a patient can have cirrhosis and be well for years. You may not even suspect its existence. But often the initial manifestation of the disease can be an episode of severe decompensation or the appearance of a tumor in the liver, which is much more common in patients with cirrhosis. Therefore, the idea that cirrhosis causes complaints and is always detected by changes in analyzes is false. The first manifestation can be severe and late. Despite this, doctors may sometimes notice small signs that lead to suspicion of the disease, whether clinical, laboratory (e.g.: a decrease in the number of platelets without another cause) or imaging (e.g.: detecting an enlarged spleen in a routine abdominal ultrasound).",
        "Causes": "The most common cause of CLD in Portugal is excessive consumption of alcoholic beverages. Infections with hepatitis B and C viruses, autoimmune hepatitis, hereditary hemochromatosis or primary biliary cirrhosis are examples of other possible causes. A growing cause of liver cirrhosis that is often underappreciated is non-alcoholic fatty liver, in which obesity plays the decisive role.",
        "Diagnosis": "Confirming the existence of cirrhosis is only possible, strictly speaking, by performing a biopsy, but this is rarely necessary. There are now non-invasive methods that, in some types of DHC, can replace biopsy. The most used is Fibroscan\u00ae, which assesses the degree of liver fibrosis. This examination is similar to an ultrasound and does not cause any discomfort to the patient.",
        "Treatment": "Up to a certain point, it is possible to intervene in most of the factors underlying cirrhosis. There is even talk of regression of cirrhosis when these factors are eliminated or are very well controlled. Eliminating alcohol consumption, treating hepatitis or losing weight are examples of possible strategies to reduce the degree of fibrosis and prevent progression to the decompensated phase of the disease, in which the only option is often a liver transplant.",
        "Prevention": "Cirrhosis is also preventable. Vaccination for hepatitis B or avoiding sharing syringes or material potentially contaminated with blood are indirect ways to prevent the disease Load more;/ Cases of acute hepatitis of unknown origin in children have been reported in Europe and the USA.

    "Inflammatory bowel disease": {
        "What is it?": "It is a condition in which the intestine becomes red, swollen and ulcerated. Inflammatory bowel diseases can be divided into two main groups: ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. The term inflammatory bowel disease essentially applies to chronic inflammatory bowel disease of unknown cause, as there are other bowel diseases that do not fit this definition. In addition to Crohne's disease and ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel disease also encompasses indeterminate colitis. There has been a marked increase in the occurrence of this pathology in countries in the southern hemisphere, although it continues to be more frequent in countries in the northern hemisphere and in higher socioeconomic strata. In Portugal, it affects around seven thousand to 15 thousand people and is estimated to be around 2.9 cases per 100 thousand inhabitants per year with ulcerative colitis and 2.4 per 100 thousand with Crohn's disease. The age of onset presents two peaks of highest incidence, one between 15 and 30 years, and a second between 60 and 80 years, this being more frequent in Crohn's disease. This condition should not be confused with irritable bowel syndrome, which affects the colon's contractility. In this case, inflammation never occurs and it is a much less serious disorder than inflammatory bowel disease.",
        "Symptoms": "The symptoms of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are different. In the first case, there is an attack on the lining of the large intestine, causing inflammation, ulceration and bleeding. During an ulcerative colitis attack, patients almost always have bloody diarrhea associated with cramps, fatigue, loss of appetite and weight loss. Removal of the colon is, in some cases, a therapeutic option. In the second case, inflammation occurs throughout the entire thickness of the intestinal wall and can occur anywhere in the digestive tract, from the mouth to the anus. The most common symptom is abdominal pain, which may be associated with diarrhea, bleeding, loss of appetite, weight loss, weakness, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, fever and anemia. Surgery may be necessary, but it does not cure the disease. Other signs not directly related to the intestine may occur in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Among these signs, arthritis stands out, with swollen, painful and stiff joints; oral ulcers; fever; red, painful and light-sensitive eyes; and skin rashes.",
        "Causes": "There does not seem to be any common characteristic among those with this disease. Any individual can develop the disease, regardless of gender, race or age. People are most often diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 25 and between the ages of 45 and 55. The causes are unknown and probably involve several factors. There may be a genetic tendency that, when interacting with environmental factors, triggers an uncontrolled immune response that causes the chronic inflammatory process in the intestine. Tobacco has been associated with the development of ulcerative colitis.",
        "Diagnosis": "It begins with a clinical history and medical examination, and is complemented by laboratory tests on blood and stool, and radiological and endoscopic studies that allow tissue samples to be collected for a more detailed assessment. It is important to check the entire digestive tract in order to understand the extent and severity of the clinical condition. Since its symptoms are identical to other pathologies, it is essential that the diagnosis is accurate in order to choose the most appropriate treatment. On the other hand, the patient must undergo these tests regularly, in order to monitor the evolution of the disease and the response to therapy.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment can be medical and/or surgical, depending on the type of disease and its extent. This should help alleviate symptoms and encourage healing of intestinal injuries. In general, it evolves through progressive steps until the desired response is achieved. It is also important to be able to interrupt inflammatory crises and prevent future relapses, which is currently more viable through new biological and immunomodulatory therapies. Controlling inflammation not only provides important symptomatic relief, it also reduces the need for surgery, the use of more aggressive medications and hospitalizations.\u00a0 Aminosalicylates and corticosteroids are useful in the acute phase of the disease and immunomodulators or biological agents are important when attacks are frequent in order to reduce the use of corticosteroids or when they are not effective. The manifestation of symptoms can also be minimized with the use of antidiarrheals, antispasmodics or drugs that help improve food absorption. All of these medications must be prescribed by a doctor. The prevention of osteoporosis is also important, as it can arise as a result of poor calcium absorption or as a result of the use of corticosteroids. Surgery may be necessary in more severe forms of inflammatory bowel disease.",
        "Prevention": "If there is no known cause, this disease cannot be prevented. Maintaining good general health and a balanced diet are important ways to reduce complications and avoid weight loss and anemia. Not smoking is essential and reduces the number of exacerbations of the disease. As this pathology increases the risk of colon cancer, regular evaluation is very important, with colonoscopy at intervals defined by the doctor. This makes it easier to diagnose and treat any complications that may arise early. Brazilian Inflammatory Bowel Disease Study Group, 2013 William A Rowe, Inflammatory Bowel Disease\u00a0Treatment & Management, Medscape, Nov. 2013 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2013 Colonoscopy is a minimally invasive procedure that allows you to identify and treat intestinal lesions.

    "Nodular thyroid disease": {
        "What is it?": "A nodule is a discrete lesion of the gland that results from the abnormal growth of thyroid cells. In turn, an increase in its total volume is called a goiter. Nodular thyroid disease is one of the most common and most prevalent in women. Its prevalence in the general population varies from 4% to 60%, depending on whether the nodules are diagnosed by palpation or ultrasound.",
        "Symptoms": "Most nodules are asymptomatic and are usually discovered during a routine examination or noticed by the patient as a lump in the neck. Some patients may complain of neck, jaw or ear pain. When they become large, they can cause difficulty in swallowing or breathing. Rarely, they cause hoarseness.",
        "Causes": "The nodules may be single or multiple and in most cases the cause is unknown, although they may occur in situations of iodine deficiency, be induced by medication, after radiotherapy to the head and neck or have a genetic cause. The vast majority of them are benign (non-cancerous), but a small percentage (5% to 10%) are carcinomas. A clinical evaluation is therefore essential to exclude malignancy.",
        "Diagnosis": "Physical examination and tests do not allow us to determine whether the nodule is malignant or not. Therefore, ultrasound is essential to determine its size and characteristics, since, as a general rule, only those larger than one centimetre or with a certain appearance should be evaluated as they have significant malignant potential. In these cases, fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is necessary, which collects cells from the nodule for microscopic study. Only in very specific situations should a thyroid scintigraphy be performed.",
        "Treatment": "The most common benign nodules are colloids, cysts and adenomas. In these cases, monitoring should be done every six to 12 months. If growth occurs or its characteristics change, it is necessary to repeat the CAAF. When surgery is indicated, it must be performed by a doctor with experience in thyroid surgery to reduce the likelihood of complications. Malignant nodules, despite being cancerous, are not as serious as other types of cancer, as they are almost benign in nature. In these cases, the initial indication is surgery, and it is often necessary to complete treatment with radioactive iodine. These patients require monitoring for the rest of their lives.",
        "Prevention": "Doctors aren't sure what causes most thyroid nodules, and they can't be prevented. Did you know that one in ten Portuguese people may have thyroid disease? In\u00eas Sapinho, endocrinologist, and Maria Ol\u00edmpia Cid, general surgeon, talk about treatments.

    "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease": {
        "What is it?": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) refers to a set of chronic, incurable lung conditions that limit the airways and cause difficulty breathing, the most common cause of which is tobacco consumption. It is characterized by irreversible or partially reversible bronchial obstruction with treatment.",
        "Symptoms": "Chronic cough and expectoration, respiratory infections especially in winter;/ Difficulty breathing (dyspnea) and wheezing;/ Sensation of chest tightness;/ Patients over 40 years of age, smokers or exposed to fumes or dust that are harmful to the respiratory system, who have a cough with sputum and dyspnea (tiredness), should consult a pulmonologist to screen for this pathology.",

        "Diagnosis": "Clinical assessment of the patient, signs and symptoms is essential. The patient's history usually shows persistent and worsening symptoms over time. Respiratory Function Tests are the best exam to confirm the diagnosis: spirometry (measures the amount of air and the speed of flow during breathing) assesses lung performance - if spirometry is inconclusive, a lung diffusion capacity test can be performed. Blood tests, X-rays and computed tomography scans may also be useful.",

    "Chronic kidney disease": {
        "What is it?": "Chronic kidney disease consists of kidney damage with progressive and irreversible loss of kidney function. In its most advanced stage, the kidneys are no longer able to maintain normality in the patient's internal environment. It is estimated that in Portugal more than 800 thousand people suffer from this disease. Every year, 2,200 new terminal cases are registered, and there are currently 14,000 patients dependent on dialysis, of which five thousand are transplanted. It can affect all ages and genders, although its incidence is higher in adults and the elderly. Diabetes, obesity and high blood pressure are three of the factors that contribute to the numbers being even higher in the future, which is why early diagnosis and treatment are essential. Kidney failure can be acute, when it appears suddenly, normally tending to recover, and chronic, when kidney failure occurs slowly and progressively, with no possibility of recovery. It is important to emphasize that a single healthy kidney is enough to maintain completely normal kidney function.",
        "Symptoms": "The absence of symptoms in the early stages of the disease causes a large part of the population to underestimate, ignore or postpone the care to be taken. This initial lack of signs results from the kidneys' ability to adapt to the progressive loss of their function, which means that signs only appear when the pathology is already very serious. An individual may be asymptomatic until kidney function is within 15% or 20% of normal values. In the presence of kidney disease, diabetes or hypertension (in very advanced stages, up to 90% of patients may have high blood pressure), a specialist doctor should be consulted to try to delay, as much as possible, the progression of the pathology, maintaining the quality of life. The main warning signs are burning or difficulty urinating; urinating frequently, especially at night; urinating with blood; presence of swollen eyes, hands and/or feet, especially in children; pain under the ribs that does not change with movement; high\u00a0blood pressure. Other common complaints are progressive tiredness, generalized weakness and fatigue when making small or moderate efforts. These problems result from anemia, common in kidney failure. Other times, progressive insomnia is observed, in which the patient has to take medication to be able to sleep. Quite often, in the face of a serious condition, there is a loss of appetite, nausea or vomiting. The kidney has the function of eliminating most of the liquids and waste from metabolism. Therefore, in the presence of abnormal kidney function there is a tendency for fluid to accumulate, more abundant in the legs as the day progresses, and on the face in the early hours of the morning, upon waking up. Some patients also have generalized itchy skin and a dry, pale complexion. Symptoms, which are rarer, include menstrual changes in young women and a tendency for bleeding into the skin or blood loss through the digestive tract.",
        "Causes": "The most common causes are glomerulonephritis, pyelonephritis, polycystic kidneys, diabetes and high blood pressure. There may be hereditary factors that increase the tendency to chronic kidney disease.",
        "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis involves carrying out blood and urine tests, and measuring blood pressure. Urinary tests make it possible to evaluate protein losses, as well as the elimination of salt and other elements. In diabetic patients it is necessary to maintain strict control of glucose levels in order to reduce its impact on kidney function. It may also be necessary to resort to ultrasound, tomography or magnetic resonance imaging.",
        "Treatment": "The type of treatment for chronic kidney disease depends on the stage the patient is in. Therapy makes it possible to correct problems caused by poor kidney function and prevent kidney failure or, if it is already present, slow down or stop its progression. Includes diet and medication. The diet helps control blood pressure and reduce the accumulation of substances such as urea, phosphorus or potassium, which diseased kidneys cannot eliminate in sufficient quantities. In this way, the signs tend to improve and it is possible to delay or stop the loss of functions. Medication is used to stabilize blood pressure, to supply hormones that the kidney is unable to produce, or to relieve vomiting or itching. The amount of liquids you should drink varies depending on the amount of urine you eliminate each day. When there is a lot of water, you need to increase your water intake. When there is little, you need to reduce the amount of liquids you drink so that they do not accumulate. If you have high blood pressure, you should eliminate salt and avoid eating sausages or canned foods. When the kidneys function less than half of normal, they are no longer able to eliminate substances resulting from protein intake, especially those from meat and fish. In these cases, it is useful to reduce them in the diet, compensating them with other foods. Potassium can also accumulate in the blood and must be monitored, as well as fats and sugar, especially in diabetic patients. On the other hand, whenever necessary, medications may be prescribed to control blood pressure and calcium and phosphorus levels, and to treat or control anemia. When kidney function is no longer sufficient to meet the body's needs, it is essential to do so mechanically, through hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. In both cases, the objective is to filter the blood, preventing toxic substances and excess fluids from accumulating. These treatments should be carried out, on average, three times a week.",
        "Prevention": "There are recommendations that apply to the general population: maintain a normal weight, avoid tobacco and alcohol, practice regular physical exercise, among others. The prevention of chronic kidney disease involves controlling all its risk factors, such as diabetes and hypertension, and early diagnosis and treatment of any kidney disease, thus preventing its progression. It is important to carry out periodic exams, comply with the prescribed treatment for diabetes and/or high blood pressure, control excess weight, follow a healthy diet and a periodic exercise program, stop smoking, avoid the heavy use of over-the-counter painkillers, take dietary changes, reducing salt and proteins, and limiting alcohol intake. Jo\u00e3o Egidio Rom\u00e3o Junior, Chronic Kidney Disease: Definition, Epidemiology and Classification, J Bras Nefrol XXVI (3, Suppl. 1), August 2004 National Kidney Foundation, 2013 Brazilian Society of Nephrology, 2013 National Kidney Foundation, 2007 The kidney is a very important organ for the body's balance. Kidney diseases are usually silent, hence the importance of knowing the warning signs. A cause for alarm for anyone who encounters this problem, blood in the urine can be an indicator of several diseases, so it should not be ignored. Hypertension, stroke, dementia, osteoporosis, excess weight. Excess salt can increase the risk of several diseases. The key is moderation.

    "Chronic venous disease": {
        "What is it?": "Chronic venous disease, or chronic venous insufficiency, corresponds to an anomaly in the functioning of the venous system caused by an incompetence of the valves in the veins, associated or not with obstruction of venous flow. The venous system is divided into superficial, perforating and deep, and this disease can affect any of these compartments. Venous function depends on the proper functioning of the valves and propulsive muscles, which ensure venous flow in the opposite direction to gravity. Valvular incompetence of superficial veins can result in weakening of the vascular walls or be secondary to thrombophlebitis, while deep venous incompetence usually arises as a result of obstruction. The frequency of this disease increases with age. In Europe, of adults aged between 30 and 70 years, 5% to 15% have this disease, with 1% already having a varicose ulcer. In the United States, around seven million people have this condition, which is the cause of 70% to 90% of all lower limb ulcers. This is a very common problem, capable of reducing quality of life and with socioeconomic repercussions, considering that its complications can be responsible for chronic and disabling pain and, consequently, the loss of working days and early retirement.",
        "Symptoms": "Sensation of heaviness and pain in the lower limbs, especially at the end of the day and, in some cases, itching. Tingling, hyperpigmentation of the skin (due to accumulation of hemoglobin), progressive replacement of the epidermis and subcutaneous tissue by fibrosis, swelling, presence of varicose veins and moles may also occur. Stasis ulcers, which occur in chronic venous disease, begin spontaneously or traumatically, vary in size and depth, and often heal and recur regularly. Its most common location is on the inside of the leg, close to the ankle. These ulcers are only painful when they are infected. They usually have irregular edges, with a red base, exudation with blood or pus, and pigmentation around them. If left untreated, the veins tend to dilate, making symptoms more severe, and severe venous insufficiency may occur, with a risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.",
        "Causes": "It is currently known that advanced age, family history and gender constitute important risk factors for the development of the disease. Women are more prone to illnesses, especially in the last 14 days of the menstrual cycle. In addition to these, there are other causes: Standing or sitting for many hours, especially with your legs crossed;/ Sedentary lifestyle;/ Prolonged stay in hot places, because heat dilates the veins and increases stasis;/ Prolonged sun exposure, hot baths, sauna and warm clothing;/ Constipation and excess weight;/ Very tight clothing;/ Shoes with high heels or flats;/ Pregnancy and oral contraception can aggravate the disease, as estrogens increase venous permeability and progesterone promotes their dilation.",
        "Diagnosis": "It is essentially clinical, based on medical history and physical examination. Its assessment can be complemented by various diagnostic methods, with emphasis on Doppler. Phlebography is indicated when non-invasive methods do not provide sufficient clarification and/or treatment guidance.",
        "Treatment": "It is important to treat reflux and venous hypertension and reverse the symptoms in order to improve the quality of life of patients. Pharmacological treatment is indicated for all types of chronic venous disease and should be used as an adjunct to compression therapy. These medications act on the macro and microcirculation, increasing venous tone, reducing capillary permeability, acting on the venous wall and valves and preventing venous reflux. They also improve lymphatic flow and have an anti-inflammatory effect. Their effectiveness in relieving symptoms such as pain, cramps, restless or heavy legs, itching and paresthesia has been widely confirmed. Compression is the most frequently used form of treatment for larger varicose veins, with edema, pigmentation changes or active ulcers. Elastic compression promotes the reabsorption of edema and prevents its formation, reduces venous caliber and increases flow speed, reduces reflux when standing and improves muscle contractility. It can be done using elastic stockings, elastic bandages, boots or bandages or through pneumatic devices, the first two being the most widely used. Elastic stockings can go up to the knee, to the base of the thigh or be tights. The doctor decides which model is best for each case. Mechanical extraction seeks to treat reflux and venous hypertension by removing varicose veins. Another therapeutic option is endovenous thermal ablation, a minimally invasive option that has proven to be very effective. It can be performed using laser or radiofrequency, on an outpatient basis and under local anesthesia. Sclerotherapy has been gaining ground because it is minimally invasive. It consists of the intravenous administration of sclerosing agents that cause endothelial damage, activation of the coagulation cascade, local thrombus formation and consequent venous occlusion.",
        "Prevention": "Standing or sitting for long periods of time, especially with your legs crossed, should be avoided as it can lead to the development of venous disease. If your work requires it, it is important to try to make circular movements with your feet or walk after work. Regular exercise is equally important, as it stimulates muscle contraction and venous return. Gymnastics, swimming, cycling or dancing should be preferred, which promote venous circulation, and basketball or tennis should be avoided as they require sudden movements, inducing pressure variations in the veins that cause their dilation and reduced return. venous. Hot places should also be avoided as they dilate the veins and increase stasis. On the other hand, running cold water and staying in cool places is recommended, as it stimulates venous function and relieves pain and the feeling of heavy legs. Constipation and excess weight also increase venous blood pressure. Therefore, it is useful to eat a diet rich in fiber (vegetables), stay well hydrated and reduce the intake of saturated fats (such as butter). Clothing that is too tight compresses the veins and hinders circulation, so it should be avoided. Wearing appropriate shoes is also important. Heels of three to four centimeters should be preferred over high-heeled or flat shoes. During sleep, the venous system is not stimulated, so it is advisable to perform pedaling movements before falling asleep, as well as elevating your feet (10 to 15 centimeters from the bed). Massaging the legs from bottom to top also stimulates venous return. U.S. National Library of Medicine, February 2014 Medeiros, Julia et al., Therapeutic strategy in chronic venous disease.

    "Rotator cuff diseases": {
        "What is it?": "The rotator cuff is a set of muscles and tendons that surround the shoulder joint, which is extremely important for its movement. If the shoulder hurts, it is possible that there is an injury to that area and that it could be caused by trauma or aging of the joint. A rotator cuff injury actually justifies the appearance of shoulder pain. This is, as a rule, a condition of tendinopathy, that is, a problem with the tendons. There are many causes of injury. It may be a simple tendinopathy, in which some repetitive movements can cause inflammation of the tendons (tendinitis). It may be a calcifying tendinopathy, with the formation of calcium deposits in the tendons, causing pain, reduced strength and mobility. Finally, a rupture of the cuff may occur, related to ageing itself or, sometimes, trauma that can cause partial or total ruptures of the cuff, resulting in a painful shoulder, with loss of strength and limited movement.",
        "Symptoms": "The most common symptoms are pain at rest and at night, especially when sleeping on the affected shoulder; pain when raising and lowering the arm or with specific movements; a feeling of weakness when raising or rotating the arm; a sensation of crackling when moving the shoulder in certain positions. Ruptures that occur suddenly, such as from a fall, cause very intense pain associated with immediate weakness of the forearm. The pain tends to be more evident when raising the arm from the outside of the body. In the initial stages, the pain is mild and only occurs when the arm is raised above the head, for example, to take something out of a cupboard. At this stage, anti-inflammatories and analgesics are effective. Over time, the pain becomes more noticeable at rest and does not go away with treatment. The arm becomes weaker, making daily activities, such as combing your hair, more difficult.",
        "Causes": "Generally speaking, these injuries result from trauma or a degenerative process. A fall with overextension of the arm or lifting a weight that is too heavy can tear the rotator cuff. Most injuries result from overuse of the tendon over time. It is a degenerative process that occurs over time and is most evident in the dominant arm. This degenerative process can be accelerated by several factors: Repeated efforts put pressure on the muscles and tendons of the cuff. Tennis, baseball, rowing and weightlifting are some of the sports that increase this risk.;/ Reduced blood flow that occurs with aging hinders natural repair processes, which can contribute to rupture.;/ Abnormal bone growth (spurs) can occur in the shoulder. When you raise your arm, these spurs rub against the shoulder cuff tendon, weakening it and increasing the risk of rupture.;/ This type of injury is more common after the age of 40, in athletes who practice the sports already mentioned, in painters, carpenters and other professionals who keep their arms above their heads for a long time. At younger ages, the most common cause is trauma, such as a fall.",
        "Diagnosis": "The medical examination allows the condition of the joint to be assessed. During this examination, palpation and movement of the shoulder will allow its strength, mobility and stability to be assessed. In addition to this, other imaging tests (such as radiography, ultrasound, tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) help to better determine the cause and type of injury, as well as the most appropriate treatment for the situation. Arthrography allows a rupture of the cuff to be determined by injecting an opaque product.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment is medical, surgical, or both. Whatever the option, it is important to perform simple exercises and learn how to correctly mobilize the shoulder. A mild shoulder injury does not require surgery and treatment involves rest and the use of analgesics and anti-inflammatories, sometimes in the form of infiltration. Rest helps to relieve pain. Therefore, it is recommended to walk with your arm against your chest, limiting your efforts. It is important to make regular movements to prevent stiffness in the joint. Electrostimulation is a method that can be used to control severe and persistent pain. The electrical impulses act by blocking the pain signals that come from the shoulder. Ultrasounds allow deep tissue to be reached, improving circulation and calming muscle pain. The associated use of a corticosteroid cream can help reduce inflammation. Depending on the case, heat or cold may be used. Surgery is indicated if other treatments have failed. The techniques currently available allow us to expect good post-operative results, although they are not, of course, risk-free. Arthroscopy allows observation of the inside of the joint, treatment of any associated injuries, reduction of post-operative pain and facilitation of immediate rehabilitation by avoiding opening the joint, with small scars. Open surgery may be necessary to repair a torn cuff. In this case, the incision is larger than in arthroscopy and the recovery is slower. In this surgery, the injury can be repaired, calcifications removed or, if necessary, total or partial replacement of the shoulder joint. After surgery, it is essential to keep the shoulder resting for about 1 month, placing the arm on the chest. You may need to start a rehabilitation program to prevent stiffness and swelling in your shoulder.",
        "Prevention": "For people who have already suffered from this injury, it is important to perform daily exercises to stimulate shoulder strength and balance. In addition to exercising the pectoral, shoulder and arm muscles, it is equally important to strengthen the muscles in the back of the shoulder. For people who carry out activities or sports associated with a greater risk of this injury, daily exercises to prevent it must be carried out and breaks must be respected when carrying out repeated activities with effort on the shoulder.

    "Thyroid diseases": {
        "What are they?": "The thyroid can be affected by several pathologies, generally more common in women. The main ones are: goiter, presence of nodules, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism and autoimmune diseases, such as Graves' disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis, which result from the production of antibodies that can stimulate or destroy the gland. Thyroid diseases are often silent but are very common, affecting more than one million Portuguese people and 300 million people worldwide. In Portugal, more than 400 new cases of thyroid cancer appear each year, one of the most serious diseases that affects this organ. Nodular thyroid disease is one of the most common diseases, being more common in women. Its prevalence in the general population varies from 4% to 60%, depending on whether the nodules are diagnosed by palpation or ultrasound. The thyroid is a gland located at the base of the neck, immediately below the \"Adam's apple\", and is made up of two lobes joined by a central part. Its function is to produce and release into the bloodstream two hormones, triiodothyronine (T3) and tetraiodothyronine (T4 or thyroxine), which are essential for the normal functioning of the body, through the control/speed of cell metabolism. Therefore, they are essential for the growth and development of the body, regulating body temperature, heart rate and blood pressure, bowel function, weight control, mood states, among other functions. Its activity is regulated by other glands located in the brain that detect blood levels of thyroid hormones and thus stimulate it to secrete more or less according to the body's needs.",
        "Symptoms": "Thyroid dysfunction, increased or decreased hormonal secretion known as hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, can cause exuberant symptoms and signs attributable to any other organ or system, due to the important action of thyroid hormones in its normal activity. Goiter and nodules correspond to a clinical situation in which the thyroid may be diffusely enlarged (simple goiter) or with the formation of nodules (nodular goiter). These can be benign or malignant. Generally speaking, thyroid cancer is not very aggressive. Single nodules, less than one centimeter, only require annual control. The larger ones should be evaluated by performing an aspiration cytology performed with a fine needle to check whether it is benign or malignant. In the case of multiple nodules (nodular goiter), discomfort or compression may occur in the neck, which may justify surgical treatment. In the case of hyperthyroidism, in which there is an excess of thyroid hormones in circulation, there is a faster metabolism throughout the body. This condition manifests itself as an increase in the size of the gland (goiter); weight loss despite increased appetite, palpitations (increased heart rate), irritability, nervousness, anxiety, insomnia, hand tremors, heat intolerance and excessive sweating, hair loss and nail changes, diarrhoea, menstrual irregularities and reduced or absent menstrual flow, muscular weakness, a fixed, lively gaze and/or prominent eyes. In hypothyroidism, on the other hand, the hormone levels produced by the thyroid are insufficient, compromising the normal functioning of the body. The main symptoms are a slight increase in weight (due to fluid retention), fatigue/easy tiredness, increased sensitivity to cold, constipation, dry skin, hair loss, menstrual irregularities, depression, muscle pain and tingling.",
        "Causes": "They vary greatly depending on the disease. In the case of nodules, there is often no explanation for their appearance. In others, they may be due to genetic causes, radiotherapy to the head and neck, certain medications or an iodine deficiency. Hyperthyroidism can result from an autoimmune disease, the presence of one or more nodules that produce excess thyroid hormones; thyroiditis (viral thyroid infection), or an excess of these hormones due to abundant intake of iodine from food (iodized salt, fish, shellfish and vegetables) or present in some medicines and products, such as amiodarone, lugol's solution or contrasts for radiological examinations. Hypothyroidism can also be caused by an autoimmune disease, a lack or excess of iodine, which is provided by food (iodized salt, fish, seafood and vegetables), a previous surgery with partial or total removal of the gland, the use of certain medications, such as amiodarone, lithium or interferon; exposure to radiation during radiotherapy for thyroid, head or neck diseases.",
        "Diagnosis": "Assessment of symptoms allows you to understand what type of change is present. Blood tests detect and measure the levels of thyroid hormones in the bloodstream. Its execution takes time, so obtaining results is not immediate. TSH, total thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) and their free fractions can be measured. Determining TRH using current methods is sufficient in most cases to assess possible hormonal changes. Other dosages will be ordered depending on each patient. Physical examination and tests do not allow us to determine whether a nodule is malignant or not. Therefore, ultrasound is essential to determine the size and characteristics of the nodules. In this scenario, fine needle aspiration cytology is necessary, which collects cells from the nodule for microscopic study. In more specific situations, a thyroid scintigraphy should be performed.",
        "Treatment": "In the case of hyperthyroidism, treatment may consist, depending on the case, of the administration of anti-thyroid drugs, radioactive iodine or surgical intervention. Other medications may be useful to alleviate symptoms. For hypothyroidism, treatment involves the administration of thyroid hormone, usually in the form of tablets. In both cases, it is important to regularly monitor the levels of these hormones in order to adjust the doses of the prescribed medications.",
        "Prevention": "There is no way to prevent these diseases. If there is a family history of thyroid disease, regular surveillance is important in order to make an early diagnosis. It is helpful to avoid exposure to radiation, tobacco, and environmental toxins. U.S. National Library of Medicine, February 2014 Cleveland Clinic, 2013 Did you know that one in ten Portuguese people may have thyroid disease?

    "Pigmentation diseases": {
        "What is it?": "The color of the skin, hair and iris is determined by a pigment, melanin, which is produced by melanocytes. These diseases result from changes in this pigment. These changes depend on racial factors, exposure to sunlight, which increases its production as a protective mechanism against ultraviolet radiation, and hormonal factors. Hypopigmentation, which corresponds to a reduced amount of pigment, is usually limited to small areas and tends to result from a previous inflammatory process. More rarely, it may represent a hereditary disease. On the contrary, the increase in the amount of melanin (hyperpigmentation) may be a response to hormonal changes, such as those that occur in Addison's disease, during pregnancy or with the use of oral contraceptives. The skin can also darken in diseases such as hemochromatosis or hemosiderosis, or as a response to various medications that are applied to the skin, ingested or injected.",
        "Types": "The most common are albinism, vitiligo, melasma and changes caused by lesions. Although the majority are benign and the diagnosis is simple, it is essential to exclude melanoma and its precursors and identify lesions that are manifestations of other clinical conditions.  Albinism It is an uncommon and hereditary disease in which melanin is not formed. In Europe, it is estimated that one individual in every 10,000 is affected by albinism, and around 2% carry the gene that determines the pathology without undergoing changes. People with albinism may have white hair, pale skin, and pink eyes. They often present with abnormal vision and involuntary eye movements. Because melanin protects the skin from the sun, these individuals are very prone to sunburn and, consequently, skin cancer. Therefore, it is essential to avoid direct exposure to sunlight, wearing sunglasses and applying sunscreen with a high protection factor to uncovered parts of the skin. There is no cure for albinism.  Vitiligo The loss of melanocytes produces smooth, white patches on the skin. In Portugal, it affects around 1% of the population. The incidence in men and women is identical. In 25% to 50% of cases, there is a family history. In some people, only one or two well-defined spots appear; in others, the spots are more extensive. The changes are more visible in patients with dark pigmentation. As with albinism, non-pigmented skin is extremely sensitive to sunburn. Those affected by vitiligo also produce white hair because the hair follicles lose their melanocytes. This pathology can appear after physical trauma and can be associated with Addison's disease, diabetes, pernicious anemia and thyroid disease. This illness can have an important psychological impact, due to its effect on image and self-esteem. There is no known cure for vitiligo. Small areas can be camouflaged with various dyes that do not stain clothing and whose effects last for several days. Treatment with photosensitive drugs combined with ultraviolet A rays is sometimes effective; however, the therapy takes time and must be continued indefinitely. Sunscreens and sunscreens are essential to prevent burns.  Loss of pigment after skin injury The skin can lose its pigment after recovering from certain illnesses and skin infections such as vesicles, ulcers or burns. In this case it is not as white as in vitiligo and, over time, it may return to its normal pigmentation. Cosmetics can camouflage this type of stain.  Melasma It usually appears on the face (forehead, cheekbones, forehead or chin) in the form of dark brown hyperpigmented plaques, often well defined, on both sides of the face, in a symmetrical shape. Melasma appears mainly in women (90% of cases), particularly during pregnancy, although it can also appear when taking oral contraceptives. The darkening generally disappears shortly after giving birth or discontinuing these contraceptives. People with melasma should use sunscreens on dark plaques and avoid exposure to the sun to prevent the disease from worsening.  Caf\u00e9-au-lait stains These spots are light brown in color and measure between one and 20 centimeters. They tend to be present from birth or appear in the first months of life. They correspond to an increased concentration of melanin in melanocytes and can appear anywhere on the body, especially on the trunk. They affect around 10% to 30% of the population. They do not cause symptoms and only require treatment for cosmetic reasons, which can be performed by laser or surgery. When more than six spots appear with a diameter greater than five millimeters before puberty or greater than 15 millimeters after puberty, other diseases such as tuberous sclerosis, neurofibromatosis, Albright syndrome or Fanconi anemia should be investigated.",
        "Diagnosis": "It involves taking a clinical history, a medical examination and, whenever necessary, collecting skin samples for laboratory testing. When a general disease is suspected, specific tests are requested.",
        "Prevention": "Many of these diseases, such as vitiligo or albinism, are not preventable. However, avoiding excessive sun, adequate cleansing and hydration tend to keep the skin healthier and prevent the appearance of changes in its pigmentation. Smoking, poor sleep, and excessive sun exposure are all enemies of healthy, youthful skin. But there are other mistakes you can avoid to prevent premature aging. A long, hot bath can be relaxing, but it can also dry out and irritate your skin. Understand how wrong habits can do more harm than good. There are some benefits to taking cold showers and baths, however, there are also risks for heart patients. Learn about them.

    "Intervertebral disc diseases": {
        "What is it?": "Intervertebral discs are located between the vertebrae and function as shock-absorbing elements. When subjected to stress or trauma, the discs can swell, compressing the surrounding structures and causing various symptoms. This condition corresponds to a herniated disc. Disc disease is a common cause of pain in the adult population but is relatively rare in the younger population involved in sport. This type of disease may or may not be associated with sciatic pain (pain that radiates down the leg). The most common disc diseases are degenerative diseases, ruptured discs and sciatica. In degenerative diseases, the water content of the discs decreases with age, making the discs thinner and more rigid. As such, friction between the vertebrae increases, causing the formation of bone spurs that are associated with pain. This is one of the most common causes of chronic pain in older adults. In disc ruptures, there is a break in the outer layer of the disc, allowing its gelatinous content to leak out. When this material comes into contact with nearby nerves, it causes pain and alters the function of these nerves. Ruptures occur most frequently in the lumbar region. The risk of disc rupture decreases with age, due to the degenerative process mentioned above which reduces the water content of the discs and therefore reduces the extravasation of gelatinous material from any breaks that may occur. Sciatic pain results from compression of the sciatic nerve, which runs from the spinal cord to the back of the leg. One of its causes is a ruptured disc. Due to its importance and frequency, sciatic pain will be discussed separately.",
        "Symptoms": "Symptoms of disc disease vary depending on its location and severity. In many cases, this disease progresses without any symptoms. The most common complaints are low back pain, pain that radiates down the legs, worsening of the pain with bending the trunk or sitting for long periods, worsening of the pain with coughing or sneezing and a tingling or stinging sensation in an arm or leg. The symptoms of a herniated disc also depend on its location and the extent of the herniation. If the disc does not compress any nerves, there may be no symptoms. Compression of the nerve causes pain, numbness or weakness in the area of \u200b\u200bthe body where the nerve is located. When the herniated disc is located in the lumbar spine, sciatica may occur. If it is in the upper part of the lumbar spine, near the last ribs, the pain may radiate to the front of the thigh. If the hernia occurs in the neck, the pain and numbness are located in the shoulders, arms or chest. Pain in a leg caused by a herniated disc usually occurs in only one of the lower limbs, can have a sudden or gradual onset, can be constant or intermittent, can worsen with coughing, sneezing or with the effort exerted during evacuation, can worsen even more with the sitting position, standing for long periods or with twisting and flexing movements. This pain can be relieved by walking, lying horizontally, or other positions that reduce pressure on the injured disc. Deeper muscle pain or even muscle spasms may also occur.",
        "Causes": "The most common causes of disc disease are vehicle-related trauma, heavy lifting, and falls. Age, obesity, poor posture and disc degeneration are other factors to consider. Tobacco consumption, poor muscle tone and a sedentary lifestyle are other relevant factors. It is important to remember that low back pain is not always the result of disc disease. For example, muscle pain is an even more common cause of lower back pain than disc disease. In these cases, the pain does not radiate down the leg and, in general, does not require treatment. Fractures related to osteoporosis in the elderly are another cause of low back pain. Tumors can also cause lower back pain. The presence of severe, nocturnal pain and weight loss are reasons to raise this hypothesis.",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis involves a medical examination and MRI, which allows us to understand whether the pain is due to a disc injury or other causes that may simulate this injury.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment will depend on the cause, location and severity of the disc disease and can range from rest to surgery. As a general rule, it is important to modify activities that aggravate symptoms and put pressure on the spine. There are low-impact exercises that increase muscle strength and reduce stress on the discs. The use of heat, cold, traction techniques, electrical stimulation and ultrasound may be recommended in particular cases. Anti-inflammatories and analgesics, used under medical supervision, can significantly relieve symptoms. In some cases, corticosteroid injections may be administered directly into the affected disc. As a rule, time is a good ally in treatment and most symptoms disappear after 4 to 6 weeks. Surgery is necessary in about 10% of cases when other treatments have not been effective.",
        "Prevention": "As already mentioned, most disc diseases resolve spontaneously. Here are some tips to prevent this from happening: Do not remain seated for long periods of time;/ Avoid lifting heavy objects;/ Don't forget that bending and twisting movements put pressure on injured discs.;/ Exercise your abdominal muscles to strengthen them and improve support for your lower back;/ Maintain correct posture when sitting, standing and walking;/ Perform exercises that increase the flexibility of your spine and strengthen your muscles to improve your mobility and reduce muscle tension.;/ Roberto Basile J\u00fanior et al., Spinal injuries in sports, Rev Bras Ortop, Vol. 34, No. 2, February, 1999 Spine-health.com, 2012 American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 2013 North American Spine Society Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, Jan 2013 In\u00eas Campos et al., Low back pain in sport.

    "Sciatica pain": {
        "What is it?": "Sciatica pain corresponds to the presence of pain, weakness, numbness or tingling in one leg. It is not a disease but rather a symptom of an underlying medical condition. Sciatica involves pain, tingling, weakness or numbness that originates in the lower back, travels down the gluteal region to the back of the leg, following the path of the sciatic nerve. This is the longest nerve in the body and runs from the lumbar region of the spinal cord to the back of each leg, then branches out to the foot. Sciatica results from compression or irritation of this nerve and therefore follows its course. Its frequency varies, according to studies, between 1.6% and 43% of the populations evaluated. It is more common in middle age, rarely occurring before the age of 20. In general, the evolution is favorable but in around 30%, the symptoms last a year or more. Most cases result from a herniated intervertebral disc that compresses a nerve root. Other possible causes include narrowing of the canal surrounding the spinal cord, and tumors or cysts that compress the nerve roots.",
        "Symptoms": "Symptoms can vary depending on the type, location and severity of the condition causing the sciatic pain. It is usually intense and sharp and occurs only in one buttock or leg, although rarely it can affect both sides. Sitting tends to aggravate the pain, which is accompanied by a burning or tingling sensation. On the contrary, there is improvement when lying down or while walking, but when it is very intense, it can make it difficult to stand or walk. Coughing or sneezing can accentuate the pain. This can affect the lumbar region of the spine, although it is more intense in the leg. The presence of weakness or a feeling of numbness can make it difficult to move the leg or foot. This pain can be inconstant or permanent, becoming, in this case, disabling.\u00a0 In most cases, there is improvement after a few weeks or months, just using painkillers. If the symptoms are very severe or disabling, surgery may be necessary. Although the symptoms of sciatica can be very disabling, permanent and irreversible nerve damage is rare.",
        "Causes": "When the jelly-like contents of a disc leak out, it compresses the nerve roots that make up the sciatic nerve. These roots become inflamed and irritated by chemicals released from the disc nucleus. Pain results from compression of the sciatic nerve, which can occur from outside or inside the canal where the spinal cord passes through. This constriction can be caused by a herniated disc (the most common cause), a muscle contracture around the sciatic nerve, a pinching of the canal where the spinal cord passes through, or a misalignment of a vertebra. Often, a specific event or trauma does not immediately trigger sciatic pain; it only develops later. Runners can be affected by this injury due to the nature of running, which creates a compressive force on the spine that is about four times its weight. This phenomenon causes degenerative changes in the spine, such as narrowing of the canal, joint changes or herniation of a disc.",
        "Diagnosis": "In addition to the clinical history and careful medical observation, the diagnosis of sciatica is based on imaging methods, such as magnetic resonance imaging. Other neurological examinations may be important to assess the condition of the sciatic nerve. Most cases of sciatica correspond to compression of the nerve roots of the fifth lumbar vertebra (L5) or the first of the sacral spine (S1).",
        "Treatment": "Since it is a symptom, treatment consists of resolving its causes. For most people, treatment is conservative, with surgery reserved for the most severe cases. Around 80% to 90% of cases can be resolved without surgery and around half of the attacks last less than six weeks. Properly planned exercise and heat or cold to relieve pain and spasm are good non-medical options. Physiotherapy can also be effective. Although rest is important, some level of activity should be maintained, as movement helps reduce inflammation. Anti-inflammatory medications and muscle relaxants help reduce pain and inflammation. However, they can have side effects and should always be prescribed by a doctor based on each patient's medical history. In cases of very intense pain, a corticosteroid injection may be given in the epidural region to reduce inflammation more quickly. There are also several other types of alternative treatments such as spinal manipulation by a chiropractor, acupuncture, cognitive behavioral therapy or osteopathy. In general, most cases of sciatica resolve within a period of between four and twelve weeks. After relieving the acute pain, the patient must enter a rehabilitation program to improve various aspects of the vicious posture, which is often aggravated by pain, thus preventing other crises from occurring. Ergonomic assessment of the workplace as well as lifestyle assessment can also contribute to reducing the frequency of recurrent sciatic and low back pain attacks. Surgery is only indicated when the pain is so intense that it becomes disabling, compromises the bladder and anal sphincter, impairs muscle strength, does not improve after six to 12 weeks and aims to correct the cause of compression of the sciatic nerve. As disc herniation is its most common origin, removal of the intervertebral disc that causes this constriction is the most frequently performed intervention, allowing symptomatic relief in 90% to 95% of patients. After surgery, it is important to avoid driving, sitting for long periods, lifting weights or bending your torso for about a month. Exercises to extend the spine may be recommended. However, in around 5% of cases, a new disc rupture may occur, and after five years, studies indicate the return of back pain in a high percentage of cases.",
        "Prevention": "Although the degenerative processes that lead to herniated discs cannot be avoided, there are some measures that help protect the spine. It is important to adopt correct techniques when lifting weights, keeping your back straight. Correct posture at all times is important to help reduce pressure on the spine. Physical exercise strengthens the back and abdominal muscles, and also has beneficial effects. You should not sit for long periods of time. Finally, tobacco should be avoided as it accelerates the degeneration of the intervertebral discs.

    "Regional door from also": {
        "What is it?": "Compared to other areas of the body, the hip joint is a model of endurance. In fact, it takes considerable force to injure a healthy hip because the large muscles of the thigh, lower back and glutes are subjected to such intense stress. Even so, sports-related injuries can occur. Hip injuries are quite common, accounting for approximately 5% to 6% of musculoskeletal complaints in adults and approximately 10% to 24% of complaints in children. This type of injury is more common in certain types of athletes, such as those involved in dancing, running and football, given the increased effort and extreme hip movements involved in these activities. Regional hip pain is a complex problem that can be related to the lumbar spine and the gluteal region, often radiating to the groin region.",
        "Symptoms": "Regional hip pain is a common complaint that affects the hip or the structures surrounding the hip and can be associated with a number of problems. More precise location of the pain can provide very useful information for identifying the underlying cause. Generally speaking, problems with the hip joint cause pain in the inner region of the joint or in the groin. When the pain is located in the outer region of the hip, upper thigh or buttocks, the cause tends to be in the muscles, ligaments, tendons or soft tissues surrounding the hip joint. Sometimes regional hip pain can be caused by conditions that originate in other areas of the body, such as the lumbar spine or knees. Occasionally other symptoms appear, such as weight loss, night sweats, fever, abdominal or genitourinary complaints and, in these cases, the underlying disease may have a different origin.",
        "Causes": "The main risk factors for hip injuries in sport are a poor warm-up and too rapid an increase in training pace. Almost always, the cause of regional hip pain in the sporting context is a traumatic event, such as a fall or violent impact. Injury can also result from extensive, repeated movement. Regional hip pain in athletes can involve several diagnoses that vary with age. In young people and adolescents, injuries to the extremities are more common due to the lack of ossification in the growth plates, and synovitis. Tendinitis and bursitis occur in older athletes, such as trochanteritis already discussed. Here is a list of some of the conditions that can cause regional hip pain: Arthritis (rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, septic arthritis);/ Injuries (bursitis, dislocations, hip or pelvic fracture, tendonitis);/ Pinched nerves (herniated disc, sacroiliitis, sciatica, spinal canal tightness);/ Cancer (bone metastases from other tumors, leukemias);/ Other problems (avascular necrosis, Legg-Calve-Perthes disease, osteomalacia, osteomyelitis, osteoporosis, Paget's disease of bone, synovitis);/ Fractures are one of the most common and serious causes of regional hip pain. These fractures are more common in older people, given the presence of osteoporosis, which makes the bones more fragile. This type of fracture significantly affects quality of life. In fact, less than 50% of people with a femoral neck fracture are able to return to their previous levels of activity.",
        "Diagnosis": "Medical examination allows you to identify the cause of regional hip pain and radiographic studies complement this information. This medical examination is largely based on clinical history, the patient's age and a set of tests that seek to identify the origin of the pain. The medical examination is based on observation, palpation and specific tests of muscle and joint strength and mobility. Radiological examinations, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging provide additional information, and laboratory studies are sometimes useful to exclude other diagnoses.",
        "Treatment": "Considering the vast number of illnesses and injuries that can be associated with regional hip pain, it is not possible to review all treatments here as they will depend on each diagnosis. As important aspects, it is worth mentioning the need for a medical consultation whenever complaints persist in order to make a correct and early diagnosis.",
        "Prevention": "It is always advisable to avoid activities that aggravate the pain and to use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, under medical supervision. Using a pillow between your legs at night can help reduce pain. When it comes to physical exercise and sport, it is essential to never forget to warm up and cool down properly before and after exercise. The hip muscles must be properly stretched and warmed up. You should avoid running on surfaces that slope downwards. In these cases, it is better to walk. Flat, soft surfaces are also ideal for running. Cycling or swimming are better than running for preventing hip pain. It is not necessary to stop exercising, but it may be important to reduce this activity. Losing excess weight reduces the strain on your hips and wearing appropriate footwear is essential. It is also worth highlighting the importance of adequate nutrition, with emphasis on calcium and vitamin D.

    "Drepanocitose": {
        "What is it?": "Also called sickle cell anemia, it is a disease that affects red blood cells. Under normal conditions, these cells are rounded and their function is to transport oxygen from the lungs to the tissues and carbon dioxide from them to the lungs. In this pathology, red blood cells are shaped like a waning moon or sickle and, therefore, are unable to transport oxygen adequately, are less deformable and tend to obstruct blood vessels, last less time and their premature destruction causes anemia, jaundice, paleness and painful crises that require hospitalization. This is a hereditary disease, more common in black people, although it can also affect Caucasians. It is a genetic disorder, but for a child to be affected, they must inherit the gene from both their parents (autosomal recessive transmission). When only one parent transmits it, there are no symptoms, although the gene can be passed on to the next generation.",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis is essentially laboratory-based, and it is possible to investigate the presence of an abnormal form of hemoglobin and the presence of atypical red blood cells in a blood sample. On the other hand, the analyses of these patients also reveal the presence of anemia. In addition to diagnosis, it is important to assess the risk of cardiovascular complications, using different technologies, such as ultrasound.",
        "Causes": "Sickness sickness is a hereditary disease caused by a mutation in hemoglobin, which alters the shape of red blood cells. Some of the factors that can lead to this deformation are low oxygen or fluid levels in the tissues, dehydration, sudden changes in temperature, infections, excessive exertion and stress, closed and polluted environments, inadequate nutrition and long periods of fasting.",
        "Treatment": "A bone marrow transplant could potentially cure the disease. However, it is a complex procedure with significant risks and, for this reason, it is not performed routinely. The treatment of sickle cell disease aims to avoid painful crises, alleviate symptoms and prevent complications of the disease. Regular surveillance is important to measure red blood cell levels and assess the patient's general health status. Therapy may involve the use of painkillers, blood transfusions or, if necessary, oxygen support. The use of antibiotics and vaccines is important both in the prevention and treatment of infections, which are very common in this disease. Hydroxyurea reduces the frequency of painful crises and may reduce the need for blood transfusions. For sickle cell disease there are a series of experimental interventions, such as gene therapy and new medications, which can correct the genetic defect that is at its origin, in the first case, or improve circulation and oxygen transport to tissues, in the second. Taking folic acid supplements, maintaining a healthy diet, drinking plenty of fluids, exercising regularly but without excess are equally useful aspects. It is important to avoid extreme temperatures and to use over-the-counter medications, such as nasal vasoconstrictors, with caution, as they tend to further hinder blood circulation. If traveling to places located at high altitudes, it is important to consult your doctor in advance to determine the need for oxygen supplementation.",
        "Prevention": "Being a genetic disease, it cannot be prevented. Genetic counseling is important to check whether both members of a couple are carriers of this gene. Pregnancy in women with sickle cell disease is considered high risk, due to the greater possibility of crises during pregnancy and a high susceptibility to developing other diseases such as high blood pressure or kidney disease. In addition, hemorrhages may occur during childbirth.

    "Eco doppler": {
        "What is it?": "Echo Doppler is a non-invasive test that allows estimating blood flow through blood vessels using ultrasounds that shine on blood cells.  Echo Doppler is useful in diagnosing the presence of blood clots, the functioning of the valves in the veins of the lower limbs, heart valves, congenital heart disease, arterial occlusions, peripheral arterial disease of the lower limbs, aneurysms or narrowing of arteries, such as those in the neck.  This test allows you to estimate the speed of blood flow.",
        "Indications": "Arterial vascular Doppler ultrasound is indicated for diagnosing and quantifying the process of atherosclerosis. The main manifestations of atherosclerosis in which vascular Doppler ultrasound is used are cerebrovascular disease, aortic diseases and peripheral arterial disease. In addition to atherosclerosis and its complications, such as thrombosis, arterial vascular Doppler ultrasound is also indicated for diagnosing other diseases, such as embolisms, aneurysms and congenital malformations. This type of Doppler ultrasound does not require fasting or other special care for its performance.  Carotid Doppler ultrasound is widely used to assess whether there is thickening of the inner lining of these arteries. This increase in thickness is an early sign of atherosclerosis and these patients are considered to be at higher risk for clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis, such as myocardial infarction and stroke.  Venous Doppler echo is indicated for the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis and also allows the evaluation of superficial veins and perforating veins, which connect superficial veins to deep veins), better studying cases of venous insufficiency.",
        "Advantages and benefits": "Eco Doppler has the advantage of being an alternative to more invasive examinations, such as arteriography or venography, which involve the injection of contrast substances and the use of X-rays. In Eco Doppler, no needles, injections or radiation are necessary. On the other hand, it is a widely available technology, easy to use and less expensive than other imaging studies. In the case of carotid echo doppler, the detection of a narrowing allows the implementation of treatment measures that can prevent a stroke.",
        "Methodology": "It is a non-invasive, painless examination that does not involve the use of radiation and has high applicability and reproducibility.  During the examination, the ultrasound probe is pressed against the skin in the area to be studied and moved from one location to another.

    "Echocardiogram": {
        "What is it?": "An echocardiogram uses sound waves to produce images of the heart, allowing the doctor to see how the heart contracts and pumps blood.  The images obtained allow the identification of various anomalies of the heart and its valves.  Depending on the information that needs to be obtained, the echocardiogram can be performed in different ways.",
        "Methodology": "The echocardiogram can be performed via the transthoracic route, in which the probe that captures the images is placed directly on the patient's chest, or via the transesophageal route, in which the probe is inserted into the esophagus.  This technique is used when images obtained through the chest are not informative.  Transthoracic Echocardiogram In a transthoracic echocardiogram, a gel is placed on the patient's chest and the probe is firmly applied to the skin. The probe sends ultrasound waves toward the heart, and a translator records the echoes produced by the heart. These echoes are then converted into images using a computer.  Transesophageal Echocardiogram No special preparation is required for a conventional echocardiogram. In the case of a transesophageal echocardiogram, the patient should not eat for a few hours beforehand. Since this examination is performed under sedation, the patient should not drive in the hours following, so they should be accompanied.  Stress Echocardiogram It is also possible to perform an overload echocardiogram, identical to the stress electrocardiogram, in which the patient walks on a treadmill to be able to evaluate the behavior of the heart and valves during physical effort and, in some cases, contrast substances can be used. for additional information. Stress tests are useful because some heart diseases, such as angina pectoris, only manifest themselves under stress.  The doctor will choose the most appropriate test in each case. The echocardiogram takes, on average, less than an hour.",
        "Advantages and benefits": "Through this examination, it is possible to visualize the heart valves, the heart chambers and observe how it contracts. It is, therefore, a very dynamic examination.  Some of the information it provides is the size of the heart, the strength of its contraction, the presence of lesions in the heart muscle, lesions in the valves or heart defects.  This information allows us to diagnose many heart diseases and select the most appropriate treatment.",
        "Indications": "An echocardiogram is indicated whenever the presence of damage to the heart valves, the walls of the heart or changes in its ability to pump blood properly is suspected. It is also indicated for the diagnosis of congenital heart defects even before the baby is born.  The main indications are: Definition of the dimensions of the heart cavities and the thickness of their walls;/ Assessment of mitral, tricuspid, aortic and pulmonary valves;/ Assessment of systolic and diastolic function of the ventricles and their contractility;/ Analysis of the anatomy of the pericardium;/ Study of congenital heart diseases;/ Assessment of the aorta, pulmonary artery and vena cava;/ Investigation of the presence of intracardiac thrombi;/ Assessment of the presence of heart disease in patients at risk, such as those with high blood pressure or cardiac symptoms (shortness of breath, chest pain, angina, palpitations);/ Evaluation of competitive athletes to exclude some causes of sudden death in athletes;/",
        "Side effects": "This is a relatively simple exam.  In the case of a transthoracic echocardiogram, some discomfort may be felt when the electrodes are removed from the chest.  In the case of a transesophageal echocardiogram, the throat may be sensitive for a few hours after the exam.  If the examination is performed under stress, changes in heart rhythm may occur, and more serious complications such as a myocardial infarction are very rare.

        "1st Quarter": "This ultrasound confirms the gestation period with high reliability, by measuring the CCC (craniocaudal length), assessing the viability of the fetus and its heart rate, studying the basic anatomy (shape) of the fetus, biophysical screening for chromosomal anomalies (e.g. trisomy 21, 13, 18) and, through the evaluation of some ultrasound markers (nuchal translucency, nasal bones, venous duct, etc.) which, together with the biochemical examination (blood analysis), allows a risk calculation for chromosomal anomalies to be carried out with a detection rate of around 95%.",
        "2nd Quarter Morphological": "At this stage, the fetus is the ideal size for a more accurate assessment of its anatomy, which is why the main objective of this examination is to detect congenital malformations. Fetal growth is also assessed by measuring the head circumference, abdominal circumference and femur length, as well as the amniotic fluid, placenta and umbilical cord. In most cases, the sex of the baby can be determined during this examination.",
        "3rd Quarter": "The main objective of this exam is to check the growth of the fetus and its well-being. The 3rd trimester examination must also include the study of fetal anatomy, considering that some fetal malformations can only be diagnosed at this point in pregnancy, while other structures are no longer easy to assess at this stage, given the size and posture of the fetus. Whenever there is reason to doubt the gestational age or it is impossible to calculate it, an Early Obstetric Ultrasound should be performed to date the pregnancy (generally before 10 weeks). This exam aims to: Exclusion of an extrauterine pregnancy (ectopic pregnancy);/ Confirmation of gestation time,;/ Verification of the number of fetuses present and their viability.;/ In most cases, this ultrasound is performed vaginally, given the better image quality obtained this way. 3D and 4D Obstetric Ultrasound allow you to observe the baby in three dimensions (3D) and in real time (4D). They can be performed at any stage of pregnancy, although it is more common to perform them from 26-28 weeks onwards, due to the realism of the images obtained. Note that it is not always possible to obtain images of the fetal face, which is limited to the position of the fetus, amount of amniotic fluid and maternal obesity. These are optional exams and never substitutes for the previous ones and are sometimes important as documentation of morphological changes. In certain situations, it may be necessary to perform more ultrasounds during the pregnancy, particularly in cases of diagnosed fetal anomaly, maternal pathology (Diabetes, Hypertension, etc.), changes in fetal growth or in the amount of amniotic fluid. Obstetric ultrasound is a useful and essential complementary diagnostic test for monitoring all pregnant women. It is used to monitor the progress of the pregnancy, ensure good fetal development and detect any abnormalities in the fetus. Other complementary diagnostic tests may be necessary to clarify suspected/detected clinical situations (amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling, fetal echocardiogram, fetal magnetic resonance imaging, etc.). Despite technical improvements and constant training of doctors, this examination does not guarantee 100% certainty, as there are inherent limitations that may lead to the non-detection of an anomaly or the suspicion of a non-existent anomaly. These limitations include, among others: the position of the fetus, the amount of amniotic fluid, and maternal obesity.",

        "How does it work?": "SONOVEIN ecotherapy uses ultrasound waves identical to those used in a normal ultrasound device but with higher energy waves. This energy is transmitted in the form of thermal energy at the level of the vein, causing retraction and sealing of the vessel. This technology is similar to using sunlight on an eye lens to create a hole in a leaf. The main advantage of this technique is that these ultrasound beams can pass through the skin without causing damage to the surrounding tissues, which allows for greater precision in the treatment. The result is seen on the screen, allowing immediate evaluation of the results.",

        "What  are the causes of allergic contact eczema?": "It results from the reaction to allergens that come into contact with the skin. In susceptible people, these cause itching, redness, and sometimes vesicles or blisters. To discover its cause, it is necessary to carry out epicutaneous tests or contact tests.",
        "Diagnosis": "It is generally done through contact tests. These tests use a technique in which small amounts of allergens are applied to the skin on adhesive strips and then removed after 48 or 72 hours. A positive reaction consists of a red, itchy spot at the site of contact with the allergen.",
        "Treatment": "Mild eczema usually responds to corticosteroid creams and oral antihistamines prescribed by a dermatologist. More severe eczema may require treatment with oral or injectable corticosteroids, other anti-inflammatory drugs, and immunomodulatory agents. People with allergic contact eczema should: Avoid the allergen that causes the reaction and chemicals that cross-react with it.;/ Replace some products with others that do not cause reactions. Your dermatologist can recommend the most suitable ones.;/",

    "Electrocardiogram ecg": {
        "What is it?": "It is one of the most frequently used complementary non-invasive diagnostic tests to assess cardiac function.  An electrocardiogram is a test that detects the electrical activity of the heart. Each contraction of the heart muscle or heart valves is controlled by small electrical impulses generated in the heart itself. The ECG can identify the normal patterns of transmission and generation of these electrical impulses.  Therefore, the ECG is the most suitable test for evaluating cardiac arrhythmias and for the initial investigation of cardiac ischemia.",
        "Advantages and benefits": "The ECG is an important complementary test for interpreting heart rhythm and detecting heart ischemia.  The electrocardiogram is also of great value in the evaluation of other types of cardiac abnormalities, including heart valve disease, cardiomyopathy, pericarditis, and cardiac sequelae of high blood pressure.  Being a harmless and inexpensive examination, it is extremely useful for studying the heart.",
        "Methodology": "The resting electrocardiogram is performed with the patient lying down and with the torso bare.  Ideally, the patient should not have made any type of effort in the last 10 minutes, nor smoked in the 30 minutes before the exam. They should also avoid drinking cold water before the exam because it can alter the tracing obtained.  Six electrodes are fixed to the chest, using adhesives, and 4 more pads, also with electrodes, are placed on the wrists and ankles. Typically, a little gel is used between each electrode and the skin to increase electrical conduction.  In some cases, the 6 electrode patches attached to the chest are replaced by rubber pears with a metal base, which are attached to the skin using a vacuum, like suction cups.  After the electrodes are correctly placed, they are connected to the machine that will read the heart's electrical activity.  The test is very quick, lasting just a few seconds. The machine captures the heart's electrical signals and prints a trace on a special graph paper.",
        "Indications": "The most common indications for ECG are arrhythmias, congenital heart defects, heart valve problems, coronary disease, current or old acute myocardial infarction.  The electrocardiogram, because it is cheap and easily accessible, is the first test performed on patients who present with complaints of chest pain, fatigue, difficulty breathing, dizziness or other symptoms that may suggest heart disease.

    "Pulmonary embolism": {
        "What is it?": "Pulmonary embolism is the sudden obstruction of a pulmonary artery caused by an embolus. These cross the veins, the right heart chambers and the main pulmonary tree, originating from the veins of the lower limbs in 95% of cases. An embolus generally corresponds to a blood clot (thrombus), but there may also be emboli of fat, amniotic fluid, bone marrow, tumor fragments or an air bubble that travel through the bloodstream until it obstructs a vase. Their formation may begin in the right heart when there is atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, endocarditis or, rarely, myocardial contusion. Thrombi originating here are rare and are associated with a mortality rate of around 30%. In general, unobstructed arteries are able to send enough blood to the affected area of \u200b\u200bthe lung to prevent tissue death. In cases of obstruction of large blood vessels or when there is lung disease, the volume supplied may be insufficient to prevent tissue death. In these situations, which account for 10% of the total, pulmonary infarction occurs. Damage is minimized when the body quickly breaks down small clots. Large clots take longer to break down and therefore cause greater damage. This is why they can cause sudden death. Venous thromboembolism is the most frequent embolic complication in the postoperative period, being rare in the pre- and intraoperative period. In the United States of America its prevalence is 600 thousand cases per year, although only 260 thousand receive treatment, because more than half of individuals do not present symptoms. The annual mortality from venous thromboembolism is estimated at between 50,000 and 100,000. In Portugal, between 2002 and 2006, an increasing incidence was found from 3.1 to 3.6 occurrences per thousand patients hospitalized annually. Mortality associated with pulmonary embolism ranged between 26% and 23.4%.",
        "Symptoms": "Small emboli do not cause symptoms, but most cause difficulty breathing. This may be the only sign if it does not progress to a heart attack. Some of the symptoms include rapid breathing, anxiety, agitation, sharp chest pain, especially during deep breathing (which may radiate to the shoulder, arm, neck or jaw), increased heart rate, nausea, fainting or seizures that result from a sudden decrease in the heart's ability to supply enough oxygenated blood to the brain and other organs, and an irregular heart rhythm. People with occlusion of one or more of the large pulmonary vessels may have bluish skin (cyanosis) and sudden death may occur. Pulmonary infarction causes coughing, blood-streaked sputum, sharp chest pain when breathing, and fever. Symptoms appear within hours. Signs of pulmonary embolism usually develop suddenly. The risk of death depends on the size of the embolus, the size and number of obstructed pulmonary arteries, and the patient's health status. In people with recurrent episodes of small pulmonary emboli, signs such as chronic shortness of breath, swelling of the ankles or legs, and weakness tend to develop progressively over weeks, months, or years. Approximately 50% of people with untreated pulmonary embolism will have another episode in the future, and about half of these relapses can be fatal. Treatment with drugs that inhibit clotting (anticoagulants) can significantly reduce the frequency of relapses.",
        "Causes": "The most common type of embolus is a thrombus that is produced in a vein in the leg or pelvis. These clots tend to form when blood circulates slowly or stagnates, as happens when someone remains in the same position for a long time. When the person resumes movement, the clot may break away. More rarely, they form in the veins of the arms or on the right side of the heart. When a clot from a vein breaks off and passes into the bloodstream, it usually moves to the lungs. There are factors that increase the predisposition to blood clotting in the veins, such as: surgery, especially if extensive and time-consuming; invasive medical procedures; prolonged bed rest or inactivity (sitting for a long time, traveling by plane, among others); stroke and myocardial infarction; obesity; fracture of the pelvis or leg; and increased tendency of the blood to clot (certain forms of cancer, use of oral contraceptives, hereditary deficiency of a blood clotting inhibitor). The risk of pulmonary embolism is also higher in patients over 40 years of age; hospital stay for more than six days; in situations of immobility; and in associated diseases (previous thromboembolic accident, malignant diseases, obesity, and heart and venous failure of the lower limbs).",
        "Diagnosis": "The medical examination is very important and should be complemented by an electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, more specific laboratory tests such as D-dimer measurement, computed axial tomography with contrast administration, Doppler ultrasound study of the veins of the lower limbs, and pulmonary scintigraphy or angiography.",
        "Treatment": "The treatment of pulmonary embolism encompasses two essential aspects: acute cardiovascular and ventilatory support, and definitive treatment. Hemodynamic and ventilatory cardiovascular support is essentially a symptomatic therapy, involving ventilation and cardiovascular support measures. As a rule, initial treatment involves the administration of oxygen and, if necessary, painkillers. Definitive treatment involves anticoagulants, such as heparin, which are administered to prevent existing blood clots from increasing in size and to prevent new ones from forming. Heparin is administered intravenously to obtain a quick effect, and the dose must be carefully regulated. Warfarin is then administered, which also inhibits clotting but takes more time to act. The duration of anticoagulant treatment depends on the patient's situation. He should have periodic blood tests throughout the duration of warfarin therapy to determine whether the dose should be modified. When the severity of the clinical condition is greater and there is a risk to life, there are two other forms of treatment: thrombolytic therapy and surgery. Thrombolytic drugs (substances that dissolve the clot) such as streptokinase, urokinase or tissue plasminogen activator can be effective. The surgery consists of removing the embolus from the pulmonary artery and can save the patient's life.",
        "Prevention": "There are several ways to prevent blood clots from forming in the veins of people at risk of pulmonary embolism. For post-operative patients, especially those of older age, it is recommended that they wear compression stockings, do leg exercises, and start getting up and doing physical activity as soon as possible. Heparin (an anticoagulant) is the most widely used treatment after surgery to reduce the chances of clots forming in the calf veins. It is injected in low doses, under the skin, immediately before the intervention and for the following seven days. Not all patients can be treated with heparin, and medical prescription is mandatory. Dextran, which is administered intravenously, also helps prevent clots but, like heparin, can cause bleeding. Warfarin is administered orally in some surgical interventions with a greater risk of clot formation, such as the placement of a hip prosthesis. When emboli recur despite all preventive treatments or if anticoagulants cause significant bleeding, a filter can be placed, through surgery, at the level of the vena cava that collects circulation from the lower part of the body. It prevents clots from reaching the pulmonary artery. Jo\u00e3o F.

    "Encephalitis": {
        "What is it?": "It corresponds to irritation and swelling (inflammation) of the brain, almost always caused by an infection. This is a rare condition, most common in the first year of life, and its incidence decreases with age. However, the most severe forms occur in young people and the elderly.",
        "Symptoms": "Sometimes, symptoms are preceded by complaints of a cold or gastroenteritis. When encephalitis is not very serious, the signs are similar to those of other diseases: mild fever, moderate headache, fatigue and loss of appetite. Confusion, imbalance, disorientation, irritability, sensitivity to light, stiff neck and neck, and vomiting may also occur. In newborns and children, it may be more difficult to recognize the clinical picture, which tends to be characterized by body rigidity, irritability, frequent crying (which increases when the baby is held), poor feeding, more prominent fontanelles, and vomiting. Encephalitis should be considered an emergency when there is loss of consciousness, lack of response to stimuli or coma, muscle weakness or paralysis, convulsions, severe headaches and sudden change in mental state (indifference, memory loss, loss of judgment). The prognosis is variable. Some cases resolve quickly and without sequelae. However, encephalitis can be serious, causing permanent problems or even death. The acute phase usually lasts one to two weeks, after which the fever and other symptoms gradually disappear. Some people may take months to fully recover. When brain injury occurs, it can affect hearing, memory, muscle control, sensation, speech or vision.",
        "Causes": "The most common causes of encephalitis are viral infections. Exposure to the virus can occur through breathing (particles emitted by an infected person), contaminated water or food, mosquito (or other insect) bites and direct skin contact. Encephalitis can also be caused by an allergic reaction to a vaccination, autoimmune diseases, infections with bacteria, fungi or parasites, or be a consequence of cancer. It causes swelling of tissues, with destruction of nerve cells, hemorrhage and, sometimes, brain damage. The viruses responsible vary by geographic location and season. Encephalitis caused by the herpes simplex virus is the most common for all ages, including newborns. Routine vaccination has significantly reduced this disease caused by other viruses, such as those associated with rabies, polio, mumps, measles or chickenpox.",
        "Diagnosis": "A medical examination is essential, revealing many of the signs mentioned. It is important to carry out imaging studies (MRI, CT scan), collection of cerebrospinal fluid by lumbar puncture, blood and urine tests, electroencephalogram and laboratory tests to search for viral agents.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment should provide medical support (rest, nutrition, and fluids) to help the body fight the infection and alleviate symptoms. Medications may include antivirals, antibiotics, anticonvulsants, corticosteroids (to reduce brain swelling), sedatives, analgesics and antipyretics. In case of brain injury, physical therapy and/or speech therapy are necessary to improve lost functions and increase quality of life.",
        "Prevention": "Children and adults should avoid contact with encephalitis patients. In areas where the infection is transmitted by mosquitoes, they must be properly controlled (use of repellents and nets, removal of sources of standing water, clothing that adequately covers the body). Compliance with the vaccination schedule is important and, if traveling to potentially dangerous areas, the recommended vaccines must be administered at the traveler's appointment.

    "Endocarditis": {
        "What is it?": "It is an infection of the inner lining of the heart (endocardium). Endocarditis generally occurs when a bacteria or microorganism from another part of the body (such as the oral cavity) spreads through the bloodstream and adheres to damaged areas of the endocardium. If left untreated, it can damage or destroy the heart valves and cause potentially fatal complications. The characteristic lesion of endocarditis is an infected clot made up of platelets and fibrin and containing other cells. This can be located anywhere on the endothelium, but frequently occurs on the surfaces of heart valves and valve prostheses, in the case of operated patients. Endocarditis is rare in normal hearts, so people at risk are those with diseased heart valves, artificial valves (after surgery) or other types of heart anomalies. Despite the severity of infective endocarditis (its in-hospital mortality varies between 10% and 26%), the disease is rare, with an incidence of three to 10 episodes per 100,000 patients annually.",
        "Symptoms": "It can manifest gradually or suddenly, depending on the agent and the pre-existing heart disease. The most common signs are fever, night sweats, chills, changes in cardiac auscultation, fatigue, joint and/or muscle pain, difficulty breathing, paleness, persistent cough, weight loss, blood in the urine, pain in the spleen region (on the left side of the stomach), small red spots on the skin (petechiae), red and sensitive subcutaneous nodules on the fingers. If left undiagnosed and untreated, it can cause complications such as damage and infections to other organs, stroke, heart failure or death.",
        "Causes": "Endocarditis occurs when a microorganism enters the bloodstream and lodges in previously damaged heart valves or the endocardium. The most common microorganisms are bacteria, but it can also be caused by fungi. Its entry into circulation can occur after brushing your teeth or during a meal, especially if your gums are not healthy. For the same reason, some oral health procedures may be the cause. Skin diseases, sexually transmitted diseases or inflammatory bowel diseases can also be the starting point for endocarditis. The use of catheters or needles during medical interventions, tattoos or piercings also creates an opportunity for these microorganisms to enter circulation, as does the sharing of syringes and needles. The immune system usually destroys these microorganisms, and they often pass through the heart without attaching themselves or causing disease. However, the presence of a heart valve or other damaged heart tissue creates an ideal rough surface for microorganisms to attach themselves, multiply, and cause disease. Risk factors include the presence of artificial heart valves (especially in the first year after their implantation), congenital heart disease, previous episodes of endocarditis, rheumatic fever (causes damage to the valves), and intravenous drug use (due to sharing contaminated needles).",
        "Diagnosis": "Clinical suspicion is possible based on the history and medical examination. In this context, auscultation is very useful. Endocarditis can mimic other diseases and, therefore, more precise tests are necessary, including blood tests, echocardiography, electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging.",
        "Treatment": "First-line treatment is antibiotics. If the heart valves are severely damaged, surgery may be necessary. Antibiotics should be administered intravenously in a hospital setting and should be selected based on the results of laboratory tests. As a rule, this therapy lasts between four and six weeks and, after clinical stabilization, can be continued on an outpatient basis.",
        "Prevention": "Prevention involves adequate oral hygiene, avoiding skin infections caused by tattoos or piercings, whenever there is previous heart damage, taking prophylaxis with antibiotics before any oral intervention or other interventions involving the airways, skin or deeper tissues. Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, Agosto 2011 Ana Santos Ferreira, Infectious endocarditis \u2013 an ever-present suspicion, Rev Port Med Geral Fam 2013;29:54-60 Prophylaxis of Bacterial Endocarditis in Pediatrics, General Directorate of Health, December 2012 The Johns Hopkins University, 2013 Duarte Cacela and R\u00faben Ramos, CUF cardiologists, explain the advantages of using custom prostheses in the treatment of tricuspid heart failure.

    "Endometriosis": {
        "What is it?": "The endometrium is one of the layers that makes up the uterus and corresponds to its internal lining. During the menstrual cycle, it is cyclically regenerated through a process of desquamation. This corresponds to menstruation and allows the renewal of all tissue elements. Endometriosis is the name given to the clinical process in which the cells that make up the endometrium are found outside their normal location, for example in the pelvic peritoneum, ovaries, bladder, appendix, intestines or even the diaphragm. In addition to these forms, which manifest in the abdominal cavity, endometriosis can, although more rarely, affect more distant organs, such as the lungs, nose or skin. The prevalence of endometriosis is approximately 10% in the population of reproductive age. In women with infertility, this prevalence increases to approximately 25% to 45%.",
        "Symptoms": "In 80% of cases, pain is the main manifestation. In 20% of cases, it is associated with infertility and may also be, although more rarely, asymptomatic. Endometriosis pain is very debilitating and has a strong impact on many aspects of a woman's life. Its presentation varies greatly and depends on the severity of the disease and the location of the endometriosis foci. This pain may occur during menstruation and initially subsides with treatment with anti-inflammatories or the pill. As it becomes more intense, it stops responding to treatment. In other cases, the pain manifests itself during sexual intercourse (dyspareunia). Depending on its location, the pain varies: it may occur in the pelvic region or may appear as intestinal cramps, especially during menstruation, associated with diarrhea or, more rarely, constipation. If it affects the bladder, the pain occurs during urination, and there may be blood loss in the urine (hematuria). Rectal bleeding (rectorrhage) occurs when endometriosis invades the rectal mucosa. If it is present in the ureters, irreversible kidney failure may occur. Many women also report heavy menstruation. It is important to note that when left undiagnosed and untreated, it tends to progress and invade other tissues. On the other hand, there appears to be a correlation between this pathology and clear cell carcinoma of the ovary, which reinforces the need for early diagnosis and treatment. Infertility is another of its manifestations and results from the invasion and occlusion of the fallopian tubes by endometrial tissue.",
        "Causes": "The origin of endometriosis is still not fully known and is therefore a matter of controversy. Retrograde menstruation through the tubes, a normal phenomenon in many women, can facilitate the implantation of endometrial tissue in the pelvic region and, therefore, is one of the accepted mechanisms for the development of the disease. On the other hand, the influence of genetic, hormonal (high levels of estrogen), racial (higher risk in Caucasian women), environmental (toxic substances, such as dioxins) or social (stress) factors is also possible.",
        "Diagnosis": "Clinical history and medical examination are important in the diagnosis, but in the absence of endometriomas (localized lesions of endometriosis), there are few non-invasive diagnostic methods capable of detecting the disease. Of these, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging are the most effective. Depending on the complaints and their location, it may be necessary to perform a cystoscopy, rectosigmoidoscopy, a barium enema or a CT scan. However, the ideal method is laparoscopy. Only through this technique can a complete diagnosis be obtained.",
        "Treatment": "Since it is not possible to cure endometriosis, treatment should be aimed at relieving pain and other symptoms, increasing the chances of pregnancy and reducing the number of foci. Surgical treatment consists of removing the foci by laparoscopy. Whenever possible, attempts are made to eliminate only these spots. If this is not possible, as is the case with more extensive forms of endometriosis, surgery will involve excision of the affected pelvic organs. In some cases, it is possible to resort to laparoscopic treatment, with a laser. Regarding medical treatment, it consists of controlling pain through the use of analgesics, anti-inflammatories or hormonal therapy.",
        "Prevention": "It is not possible to prevent the development of endometriosis, but this possibility can be reduced by reducing estrogen levels in the body. In this sense, it is important to choose the most appropriate method of contraception for each woman, practice physical exercise regularly, in order to reduce fat mass (source of estrogen) and avoid excessive consumption of alcohol and caffeine.

    "Myocardial infarction": {
        "What is it?": "Myocardial infarction is the name also given to a \u201cheart attack\u201d. It occurs when one or more arteries that supply the heart become blocked and this organ does not receive blood and oxygen in the quantities it needs. Under these conditions, cells in the affected area die. A myocardial infarction is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment. Most myocardial infarctions are caused by clots, which in turn result from the process of atherosclerosis, which involves narrowing and stiffness of the arteries. The presence of high levels of triglycerides and LDL cholesterol leads to the formation of plaques within the arteries, reducing blood flow. In the last two decades, there has been a significant reduction in the mortality rate from cardiovascular or circulatory system diseases in the Brazilian population. Even so, these pathologies are still the main cause of death in Portugal, and in all European countries. In 2011, the mortality rate from myocardial infarction in Portugal was 24.2 cases per 100 thousand inhabitants, with 4366 deaths.",
        "Symptoms": "Myocardial infarctions can manifest themselves in a variety of ways, sometimes quite misleading. The most common are a tight, heavy or pressure-like pain in the center of the chest. The pain tends to radiate to the back, left arm, jaw or neck. Breathing becomes irregular and rapid, as does the heart rate. Dizziness, weakness, nausea and vomiting, sweating and a feeling of panic occur.",
        "Causes": "Myocardial infarction results from the interruption of blood flow to the heart, resulting in the death of the non-irrigated tissue. The most common cause of this blockage is atherosclerosis. Factors such as high blood pressure, high levels of LDL cholesterol (the \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol), accumulation of the amino acid homocysteine, smoking, diabetes and chronic inflammation contribute to it. In other cases, blood flow to the heart is interrupted by a spasm in a coronary artery. The main risk factors are tobacco, a diet rich in fats, high levels of LDL cholesterol, lack of physical exercise, excess weight, family history of heart attack, diabetes, high blood pressure, stress and, in the case of women, menopause.",
        "Diagnosis": "When faced with symptoms suggestive of a myocardial infarction, it is essential to go to a hospital immediately. The more time passes, the smaller the chances of recovery. Diagnosis is based on clinical evaluation, electrocardiogram and blood tests. Additional tests may be requested, such as a chest x-ray, echocardiogram or cardiac catheterization.",
        "Treatment": "The aim is to re-establish the interrupted blood flow, in order to preserve the heart muscle and its function as much as possible. Nitroglycerin has a vasodilatory action and is useful while waiting for the emergency medical team to arrive. In the hospital, medications and/or techniques are used to unblock the clogged artery, such as angioplasty. In the hospital setting, some of the medications prescribed are aspirin, which helps prevent blood clotting, nitroglycerin, painkillers, thrombolytic agents, which dissolve clots and must be administered within the first two hours after the heart attack, and anticoagulants, such as heparin. In certain cases, surgery may be necessary. This includes catheterizations followed by angioplasty, which consists of dilation of the occluded artery with the placement of a structure (stent) that keeps it unobstructed, or a graft (bypass) that allows the occluded artery to be bypassed and reestablish blood flow. After discharge from hospital, important lifestyle changes (diet and exercise) are essential, as well as the use of medications that reduce the risk of new episodes. These medications include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, which dilate blood vessels, beta-blockers, which reduce heart rate and blood pressure, and statins, which help to lower cholesterol levels. Niacin or bile acid sequestrants, which help to reduce cholesterol, fibrates, which help to control triglyceride levels, and anticoagulants, which prevent the formation of clots, may also be useful.",
        "Prevention": "It is possible to reduce the risk of a heart attack by stopping smoking, doing aerobic exercise (walking, swimming, cycling) for at least 30 minutes a day, five days a week, reducing stress levels and adopting a healthy diet, low in saturated fats and rich in fruit, vegetables and cereals. Maintaining a healthy weight is also very important. If the patient has high blood pressure, diabetes or cholesterol, it is essential to treat and control these conditions as they tend to increase the risk of a heart attack.

    "Pulmonary emphysema": {
        "What is it?": "Pulmonary emphysema is a pathology in which the small air sacs (alveoli) where gas exchanges occur during breathing are gradually destroyed, reducing the surface area available for these exchanges and, therefore, decreasing the amount of oxygen that is transported to the blood, which makes breathing difficult.",
        "Symptoms": "Generally, symptoms of emphysema develop between the ages of 40 and 60. It is a disease that may not cause any symptoms for years. The most common complaint is difficulty breathing, which sets in gradually. First after physical exertion and, in more advanced stages, even at rest. Breathing also becomes noisier and wheezing may occur. Nails and lips tend to acquire a bluish or grayish color, which reflects the difficulty in oxygenating the extremities of the body, and can cause difficulty in concentrating and an increase in heart rate, given the effort that the heart makes to try to compensate for the reduced oxygen transport. There is associated weight loss, although in more advanced stages, due to the inactivity that the disease requires, there may be an increase in weight.\u00a0 In the absence of treatment, emphysema can be associated with a collapsed lung, respiratory infections or heart problems.",
        "Causes": "Pulmonary emphysema is one of the forms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and its main cause is tobacco. In fact, smoking constitutes a serious public health problem, being responsible for 90% of lung cancer cases, 86% of bronchitis and emphysema cases, 25% of heart ischemic processes and 30% of extrapulmonary cancers. According to the Portuguese Society of Pulmonology, in Portugal it is estimated that 5.42% of the population between 35 and 69 years old suffers from COPD. The pathology mainly affects men (because there are more who smoke) than women. Around 8.7 individuals die annually for every 100,000 inhabitants. Secondhand smoke is also a risk factor. There are other substances that can cause pulmonary emphysema, such as inhaling marijuana, environmental pollution, silica and tar dust and some industrial fumes. There is also a hereditary form of this disease, resulting from the absence of a protein that protects the elastic structures of the lungs. This type of emphysema is called alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency.",
        "Diagnosis": "The medical specialty that diagnoses and treats pulmonary emphysema is Pulmonology. The exams normally used are a chest x-ray or a lung tomography, laboratory tests that evaluate the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood and lung function tests that determine the degree of impairment of the lungs of the patient with emphysema.",
        "Treatment": "There is no cure because the changes in the lung structure are irreversible. The goal is to alleviate symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. Treatment is always defined in a personalized way and may include medications that help reduce or stop tobacco consumption, bronchodilators that improve breathing or corticosteroid inhalers that allow easier breathing. In addition to medications, it may be necessary to resort to a pulmonary rehabilitation process, where breathing exercises are learned that improve patients' quality of life and nutritional strategies are defined to help reduce weight, whenever this is necessary. In more advanced forms, the use of oxygen at home, sometimes for 24 hours, may be relevant. Surgery is indicated in more severe cases and allows the removal of damaged lung tissue. A transplant is the last resort solution when other options have not been effective. These forms of treatment can and should be complemented by lifestyle changes that help stop the progression of the disease and prevent its complications. Of all, the most important is to stop smoking and also protect yourself from secondhand smoke, in addition to avoiding some paints, car exhaust, cooking odors, certain perfumes, scented candles and incense. It is also important to keep the air conditioning filters properly clean.",
        "Prevention": "Regular physical exercise is useful because it increases lung capacity. Cold air should be avoided, which causes bronchi spasm, worsening breathing difficulties, and special attention should be paid to respiratory infections.

    "Knee sprain": {
        "What is it?": "Knee sprains correspond to an injury to your ligaments.  Sprains range in severity from a slight strain to a complete tear of a ligament. Mild injuries cause pain and swelling. Moderate injuries are partial ligament tears and involve greater disability. Severe injuries are complete tears and require surgical repair.  Most sprains involve the internal lateral ligament, the anterior cruciate ligament, with injuries to the posterior cruciate ligament being rarer.",
        "Causes": "Sports that involve accelerations and decelerations, such as basketball, football, field hockey, skiing, are those most associated with knee sprains, mainly affecting the anterior cruciate ligament.  However, this type of injury can occur in any sport in which movement with acceleration and rotation of the knee occurs.  In football, the trauma occurs with the foot fixed to the ground, or attached to the opponent's leg, causing abnormal internal or external rotation of the femur in relation to the tibia. The ligaments and menisci are subjected to stress above that which can be tolerated, triggering a reflex with contraction of the thigh muscles, in an attempt to protect the joint.  When the energy of the trauma is greater than this defense mechanism, there is deformation and rupture of the structures involved. The result is muscle strains, ligament and meniscal strains and tears.  Sprains caused by someone squatting and rotating their knee in an abnormal way can also cause injury and, statistically, are more linked to meniscus injuries. It occurs, for example, when a climber moves his knee in an abnormal and sudden way to climb a rock.  Another mechanism of injury is sudden deceleration, classically when the individual kicks the air instead of the ball, or the opponent, in the case of fights. This is the most common form of isolated injury to the anterior cruciate ligament.  As mentioned, the ligament most affected in sprains is the internal lateral ligament. This ligament can be injured following a blow to the external surface of the knee, especially if the foot is well supported on the ground at the time of the blow. This blow forces the knee to move to the inside and stretches the ligament, causing pain on the inner side of the knee. In these cases, the knee appears to lose its strength and give way on the inside.  A sprain of the outer side of the knee, affecting the outer lateral ligament, is caused by a blow to the inner side of the knee, which forces the knee outward. This type of injury is rarer because a blow to the inside of the knee is less likely.",
        "Symptoms": "Disability can be almost immediate, caused by pain and swelling, sometimes appearing 1 to 4 hours after the trauma. However, the fact that it is almost immediate does not allow us to conclude that it is a serious injury.  Some patients report that the knee \u201cgives in\u201d and a popping sound can be heard that strongly suggests a tear in one of the menisci.  A rule to remember is the following: if the pain is on the same side as the impact, it should only be a bruise and the pain will tend to disappear quickly. If the pain appears on the side opposite to the impact, it is likely a more serious injury.  As a rule, if there is an injury, there is pain and muscle contracture and, often, this is greater in partial ligament ruptures, as there is greater activation of the pain receptors in the structures involved.  When there is instant swelling, in 80 to 90% of cases it is a rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament, associated or not with injury to other structures. This swelling results from bleeding within the joint (hemarthrosis).",
        "Diagnosis": "In the initial assessment, traditional treatment is instituted (ice, discharge, joint protection and analgesia) and the need for radiological examinations is discussed.  The existence of bone fractures sends the athlete to an orthopedic consultation.  The objective examination at 48-72 h with joint effusion and/or ligament instability requires the performance of a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). The presence of lesions with surgical indication has an orthopedic approach.  In the absence of instability, joint effusion or the absence of injuries with a very likely surgical indication on MRI, the athlete is indicated for Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation treatments.  On the 14th day, the athlete should be reassessed. Favorable clinical progress allows the athlete to move on to the rehabilitation phase with functional return.  The maintenance of complaints requires referral to an orthopedic doctor and possible diagnostic/therapy arthroscopy.  As described above, a sprain is very painful and can disable the individual from participating in sports. Until proven otherwise, a sprain followed or not by swelling is serious and sports should not be continued unless the patient is somewhere remote and must walk to get help.  Recourse to an orthopedic doctor must be immediate and must not be delayed in order to avoid a worsening of symptoms.",
        "Treatment": "To treat a knee sprain, the English \"PRICE\" concept is followed: Protection, Rest, Ice, Compression and Elevation. The knee should be immobilized in a slightly compressive manner.;/ Ice must be used, and it is advisable to use it every 4 hours for 20 minutes, without direct contact with the skin to avoid frostbite;/ Keep the affected limb elevated;/ The use of axillary crutches is important and the affected limb should not be stepped on.;/  Surgery should be used for moderate to severe injuries, depending on the work and sporting demands. It is also useful when pain occurs during daily activities, such as walking or simple twisting maneuvers. If there is muscle atrophy, it is important to strengthen them before surgery.  Sometimes, several surgeries may be necessary to remove cartilage fragments.  Recovery involves taking time off for about 6 weeks, performing light tasks for 4 to 5 months, and returning to contact sports just 9 months later.  In mild sprains, a rehabilitation program using an exercise bike can be useful in order to stimulate knee mobility. Leg extensions are also useful for increasing muscle strength.",
        "Prevention": "Preventing these injuries involves warming up correctly before practicing sports, with extension exercises.  Sudden increases in load during training should be avoided.  Equipment and footwear must be appropriate for each sport to avoid twisting movements at the knee.

    "ankle sprain": {
        "What is it?": "Ankle sprains are probably the most common musculoskeletal injury. It is estimated that 15-25% of all musculoskeletal injuries are of this type.  The overwhelming majority are external sprains (around 95%).  They are usually benign lesions and resolve without sequelae, but even the most serious lesions can evolve favorably if subject to an appropriate therapeutic approach.  The ankle ligaments hold the bones and joint in position, protecting the ankle joint from abnormal movements such as twisting, rotating, and rolling the foot.  These ligaments are elastic structures that stretch to their limit and then return to their normal position. If a ligament is forced beyond its normal capacity, a sprain occurs, which in severe cases can be associated with a rupture of the elastic fibers that make it up.",
        "Symptoms": "Warning symptoms for a serious sprain include the presence of immediate and excruciating pain, the perception of a rupture on the external surface of the ankle accompanied by a clicking/noise and the rapid appearance of swelling/edema.  Night pain, hematoma formation, instability in movement and the inability to bear weight on the ankle may occur.  The amount of force involved in the trauma allows sprains to be classified into different degrees. Grade 1 - The mildest, only slight stretching of the ligament occurs Grade 2 - Partial rupture of the ligament Grade 3 - Complete rupture of the ligament  The symptoms will be more pronounced the more severe the sprain.  Having a sprain in the past that was not treated correctly increases the risk of further sprains.  When sprains occur repeatedly and the pain remains for more than 4 weeks to 6 months, it is considered a chronic sprain. These chronic injuries alter proprioception and generate imbalance and muscle weakness that increase the risk of new injuries.",
        "Causes": "The main risk factors are, in addition to predisposing anatomical changes (such as differences in the length of the lower limbs or ligament laxity), a history of repeated sprains and all sports that involve pushing/jumping and running movements.",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis is made based on clinical elements. Radiography makes it possible to exclude an associated fracture.  Magnetic resonance imaging allows better study of the ligaments involved",
        "Treatment": "Most patients with mild sprains do not require medical attention. In these cases, immobilization is not necessary; strength and flexibility exercises are sufficient. Rest, application of ice for 20-30 minutes 3 times a day, use of a bandage and elevation of the ankle above the level of the heart for the first two days are very helpful measures.  Patients with severe sprains, due to swelling, pain and functional impotence, should seek medical help.  Since walking can be painful, the use of crutches may be helpful.  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs help control pain and inflammation.  In grade 2 sprains, immobilization associated with physiotherapy becomes more relevant and, in grade 3, surgery may be necessary, although some cases can only be treated with adequate immobilization.  In most cases, the healing process takes 4 weeks to 6 months. Early incorporation of movement in ankle injuries is important to prevent stiffness.  In the rehabilitation process, electrical or ultrasound stimulation helps control pain and swelling and prevents the problem from becoming chronic. A suitable exercise program completes this rehabilitation process, allowing the recovery of strength and flexibility in this joint.  Surgery is rarely necessary and is only used when medical treatment is ineffective. Surgery can be performed using arthroscopy, which allows visualization of the joint and detection of bone or cartilage fragments, as well as direct assessment of the affected ligament.  Surgery allows reconstruction of the ligament and should always be followed by a full rehabilitation program for a few weeks to months.",
        "Prevention": "The best prevention involves adequate maintenance of the strength, flexibility and balance of the ankle joint.  In the case of sport, it is essential to warm up correctly and define specific training programs for each modality and wear appropriate footwear. These shoes should be replaced when wear on the sole is visible.  In the case of running, very uneven surfaces should be avoided.  Whenever signs of fatigue occur, rest is crucial.

    "Entropy and triquiase": {
        "What is it?": "Entropion corresponds to a change in the position of the eyelid, which inverts, leading to direct contact between the skin and eyelashes and the ocular surface. It can be involutional (progressive relaxation of tissues with age), spastic (associated with exaggerated contraction of the eyelid muscle) or cicatricial (caused by scarring of the conjunctiva, the mucosa that internally covers the eyelid and eyeball). Trichiasis corresponds to a change in the orientation of the eyelashes while maintaining the position of the eyelid margin. These eyelashes can be difficult to identify without the aid of magnification and the diagnosis is usually made by an ophthalmologist.",
        "Symptoms": "Inversion of the eyelid and/or eyelashes can cause a sensation of irritation, pain, foreign body sensation, and a red eye. Contact with the ocular surface can\u00a0lead to the development of corneal abrasions and ulcers, which can be complicated by infections and permanent scarring.",
        "Treatment": "Variable. The correction of trichiasis depends on its extent, and abnormal eyelashes can be removed using laser, electrocautery, cryotherapy or surgery. Entropion requires repositioning of the eyelid margin, with the surgical technique selected on a case-by-case basis. Myopia, astigmatism and hyperopia often lead to the use of glasses or contact lenses. LASIK surgery can restore good vision. Whether for aesthetic reasons or to improve vision, blepharoplasty is a surgery that allows you to correct, for example, droopy eyelids, but not only that.

    "Nocturnal enuresis": {
        "What is it?": "Enuresis in children is defined as a dysfunction characterized by involuntary loss of urine, day or night, anomalous in relation to the child's age and which is not a consequence of lack of bladder control, neurological disease, epileptic seizure or any structural change in the urinary tract. It may have always been present or be related to emotional or behavioral changes. This condition is defined by repeated loss of urine, in bed or on clothes, at least twice a week, for three consecutive months, in children over five years of age. Nocturnal enuresis refers to the loss of urine during sleep and has a significant impact on the child or young person's behavior, well-being and social life, in addition to being a source of stress for the family. In a study carried out in Spain, nocturnal enuresis occurs in around 7.8% between the ages of six and 11, 70% of which are boys, and decreases significantly with age. Two Portuguese investigations revealed a prevalence of nocturnal enuresis between 6.1% and 15.6% in primary school children. This disorder is two to three times more common in boys than girls and has a spontaneous resolution rate of about 15% per year. This probability is lower the longer the enuresis lasts.",
        "Symptoms": "Generally, the only symptom is loss of urine during the night. The presence of other symptoms \u2013 loss during the day, feeling of frequency or urgency to urinate, burning during urination, changes in the characteristics of the urinary stream (intermittency, irregularity), cloudy urine, constipation or fecal incontinence \u2013 may suggest psychological, neurological or renal problems that should alert the family and doctor to the possibility of other associated disorders.",
        "Causes": "The causes of this condition are not well understood. Nocturnal enuresis can be a symptom resulting from a number of predisposing factors, of a social, psychological and anatomical nature. It is more common in children who urinate more often during the day, those who have difficulty sleeping or those who have bladder dysfunction. There also appears to be a genetic predisposition to this condition. It has not been shown that stressful social events or family changes are related to nocturnal enuresis. The psychological problems detected in these children seem to be more a consequence than a cause of nocturnal enuresis. And so it should not be considered an act of rebellion.",
        "Diagnosis": "In this case, the clinical history is essential, as is the medical examination. In this way, several factors can be detected that, alone or in combination, can cause this disorder. It is very important to rule out organic causes of the disease, such as spinal cord anomalies, urinary tract infections and other pathologies of the male and female urinary system. Constipation may be present in children with nocturnal enuresis. Urine tests should also be performed. In addition, a renal ultrasound may be useful in some cases.",
        "Treatment": "It is expected that a child will not wet the bed after the age of five, and treatment is generally only considered for children over the age of seven. Treatment includes a variety of pharmacological and behavioral approaches, the use of alarms, acupuncture, psychotherapy techniques, and training programs. The most commonly used medications are desmopressin and tricyclic antidepressants. In general, they should not be used in children under six years of age. Behavioral interventions range from simple reward methods to urinary retention training or behavioral methods that involve the entire family. The use of alarms of different types has proven to be effective and even superior to the use of medications. You should never blame or punish the child, but rather reward him for the successes achieved.",
        "Prevention": "Since it is a disorder of unknown cause, there is no specific way to prevent it. There are only rules to reduce its impact and occurrence.

    "Migraine": {
        "What is it?": "Headache and migraine are different entities. Migraine is one of the most common and well characterized, but there are 14 broad categories that can be subdivided into more than 200 different forms. Migraine itself has about 20 different genres. In general, headaches are divided into two large groups: primary and secondary. Primary illnesses correspond to a disease, not reflecting other health problems and represent around 90% of the total. Secondary symptoms are symptoms of diseases of the nervous system or other organs of the human body. They can occur in cases of flu, alcohol poisoning or withdrawal, minor head trauma, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels) or a high blood pressure crisis. Migraine is a primary headache in which very intense episodes of pain occur interspersed with periods without symptoms. In general, it begins between the ages of 15 and 40, but it can appear in childhood or shortly after the first menstruation. If it appears for the first time after the age of 45, other causes must be excluded. Some of its characteristics are closely associated with the female reproductive cycle: higher prevalence after the first menstruation or during the menstrual period; occasional worsening due to taking birth control pills or hormone therapy; attenuation or disappearance during pregnancy or menopause. Before adolescence, migraines affect boys and girls equally. From then on, it is two to three times more common in females. It is estimated that 8% to 15% of individuals living in Western countries (including Portugal) suffer from this problem. The fact of reaching people in the productive phase implies large economic, social and family costs.",
        "Symptoms": "It appears recurrently, several times throughout life, but always with completely free intervals. If it occurs every day, it is probably overuse of painkillers or other medications. Drug abuse can convert a migraine into a chronic daily headache. There are people who preferably appear on the weekend. These crises can be precipitated by changes in sleep schedule, failure to eat breakfast, reduced stress or alcohol abuse. In these cases, it is important to consider a lifestyle change over the weekend. The symptoms are intense and often prevent work or study. The pain tends to be throbbing, worsening with physical exertion or head movements. In general, it affects only one side of the head, and is accompanied by nausea, vomiting, intolerance to light, noise and some smells. It is not mandatory that all of these elements are present simultaneously. And they can occur twice a week or just a few throughout a lifetime. During attacks, people seek a dark, quiet place to rest or fall asleep. An episode can last from a few hours to three days. Between attacks, there are usually no complaints. Some types of migraines may have more complex symptoms (with aura). These forms are less common, affecting around 15% of people with this problem, and include transient neurological symptoms, originating attributable to certain areas of the brain. The other signs are identical to those of migraine without aura. The most common auras are temporary vision disorders, in the form of loss of vision on one side of the visual field, blurred images, perception of bright points, geometric figures or bright zigzags. Other auras can be translated as tingling or numbness on one side of the face or one of the hands. There are people who have difficulty speaking or even temporary paralysis of their limbs, usually only on one side of the body. These changes last about 10 to 30 minutes and precede the pain. In children, migraines tend to be bilateral, less intense and of shorter duration. Vomiting and dark circles can be exuberant. Disturbances in sleep and meal schedules are common precipitating factors. Treating these crises is easier than in adults. Sleep usually gives good results. At these ages, the occipital location is not normal and, when present, requires a medical consultation. Likewise, the presence of headaches with morning vomiting or other unusual symptoms in very young children should be seen by a healthcare professional.",
        "Causes": "It is caused by a combination of brain processes: excitation/depression of cells, dilation of arteries and release of chemicals. People with migraine are more sensitive to certain stimuli, environmental or from their own body, that can trigger these brain processes. It is also thought that there is some genetic susceptibility. Some individuals can identify the signs of their attacks. The most common are cheese, chocolate, strawberries, seafood, wine, artificial sauces, changes in sleep patterns, stress, menstruation, fasting, physical exercise, and minor trauma. Others cannot identify them at all. People who drink coffee regularly may experience headaches when they stop this habit.",
        "Diagnosis": "The key to diagnosis lies in the clinical history, physical and neurological examination. Observation of the fundus is a very important part of these procedures. In some cases, it may be necessary to resort to computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to exclude other diseases.",
        "Treatment": "Migraines have no cure but can be controlled. There are medications and behaviors that can reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks. Symptomatic treatment, during acute periods, involves resting in a quiet, dark place. Pressure or cold can be applied to the area of \u200b\u200bpain. At this stage, analgesics, anti-inflammatories, antiemetics and triptans are very useful.",
        "Prevention": "People with migraines should create calendars that allow them to identify their symptoms and assess their impact on their quality of life. The first step in prevention is to identify and eliminate precipitating factors, whenever possible. In some cases, it is necessary to use daily medication to reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of attacks, but there are no drugs specifically developed for their prevention. However, there are some drugs used in other contexts that have proven to be effective, such as beta-blockers, antidepressants or antiepileptics, and these should always be prescribed by a doctor.

    "External epicondylitis": {
        "What is it?": "Epicondylitis is the most common cause of elbow pain, which can affect the dominant or non-dominant arm. It is due to degeneration and inflammation of the extensor tendons of the forearm muscles at the level of their origin on the lateral surface of the elbow. It may also be referred to as \"tennis elbow\". This tendinitis is related to the repeated forearm exercises that occur in sports such as tennis. However, it can occur in any sport or activity that involves this type of movement. This tendinitis is related to the repeated forearm exercises that occur in sports such as tennis. However, it can occur in any sport or activity that involves this type of movement.\u00a0Painters, joiners, carpenters are also some of the professionals most at risk of developing this specific type of tendonitis, as well as professional drivers, cooks and butchers. As a rule, tennis elbow is most common between the ages of 30 and 50.",
        "Symptoms": "Epicondylitis is associated with pain in the lateral aspect of the elbow, which can be aggravated by performing repeated movements, carrying weight or extending the wrist against resistance. Edema or \"clogging\" of the painful area may also be seen when palpated. Symptoms develop gradually and worsen over weeks or months, and there is no specific trauma associated with the onset of symptoms. In addition to the pain, swelling and a burning sensation may occur on the outside of the elbow, with loss of strength in the wrist. Symptoms worsen when holding a racket, turning a doorknob or shaking someone's hand. Although the dominant arm is the most affected, this entity can affect both arms.",
        "Diagnosis": "Clinical suspicion is confirmed by performing provocation tests that increase the patient's pain: palpation of the affected area and increased pain when extending the wrist against resistance. On X-ray, calcification of the corresponding area can be seen, but the diagnosis is usually carried out by Ultrasonography and/or Magnetic Resonance Imaging to visualize and evaluate the extent of the lesion at the level of the tendon.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment is carried out by modifying activities that are associated with increased pain in the patient, prescribing anti-inflammatories, applying protective orthoses and complementing them with physiotherapy programs. In cases refractory to treatment, and in a selected manner, infiltrations with corticosteroids or growth factors may be used as a complement. The duration of treatment will be shorter and its effectiveness greater the sooner the patient begins medical treatment. Surgical treatment, by excision of the degenerated segment of the tendon, should only be used exceptionally in individuals in whom previous therapeutic measures have failed. Complaints tend to improve with rest, ice, anti-inflammatories, ultrasound and physical therapy. Ultrasounds create small, controlled traumas that stimulate the normal healing process. Conservative treatment is effective in approximately 89 to 95% of cases. Sometimes, corticosteroid infiltration is used. Surgery will only be necessary in very serious cases and if conservative treatment is not effective after 6 to 12 months. After surgery, a period of immobilization followed by physiotherapy will be necessary.

    "Epilepsy": {
        "What is it?": "It is a neurological disease that involves the nervous system. Epilepsy is defined as the occurrence of at least two episodes of seizures that are not related to alcohol withdrawal, hypoglycemia, heart problems or other conditions. In some cases, one seizure is enough to diagnose epilepsy, provided there is a high risk of more occurring. Seizures result from a change in the electrical activity of the brain and may result from trauma, familial tendencies, or have no identifiable cause. This activity or discharge has an unpredictable onset and is, in general, of short duration (seconds to minutes, rarely exceeding 15 minutes) with normal brain functioning maintained between attacks. These tend to recur over time, with frequency varying between patients. Epilepsy affects several mental and physical functions and is a very common condition, occurring in around 65 million people worldwide. In the United States, it is the fourth most common neurological disease, surpassed only by migraine, stroke and Alzheimer's disease. In Portugal, it is estimated that it affects four to seven thousand inhabitants. However, the number of individuals who, although not epileptic, may have a seizure during their lifetime is approximately one in every 20. It is more common in very young or elderly people, but can occur at any age. Although treatment allows many patients to live with this condition, for others the seizures are uncontrollable and affect their quality of life in all its aspects.",
        "Symptoms": "Epilepsy does not manifest itself in the same way in all patients, and can occur in simple or complex seizures. Furthermore, they depend on the location of the discharge focus in the brain, and can affect gait, face, specific activities, or cause various types of alteration in the state of consciousness, often accompanied by automatic, unplanned movements (getting dressed or undressed, walking, chewing or swallowing). They can occur during sleep and the patient may be conscious or not remember anything after the seizure ends. Seizures themselves can be of different types, with muscles being relaxed, contracted or showing spasmodic movements. Some exhibit signs that precede them (aura) while others occur without warning.",
        "Causes": "In a large number of cases it is not possible to determine a cause. But any injury that reaches the brain can leave a \"scar\" that is a potential starting point for epileptic seizures.",
        "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis is a complex process that involves several steps. The clinical history, neurological examination and laboratory tests are generally the first steps, as they allow the occurrence of seizures unrelated to the disease to be ruled out. Electroencephalogram, magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography scans allow the exploration of possible causes. Finding the origin of epilepsy is very important because it allows the selection of the most appropriate treatment.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment must be highly personalized, taking into account the patient's own risks and the dangers of further seizures. It is therefore important to consider the patient's age, the characteristics of the seizures, associated factors and the patient's social and professional context. Many antiepileptic drugs have significant side effects and this risk requires careful consideration. In some cases, one type of medication is sufficient, but for other patients, it may be necessary to combine several. As a rule, treatment is started with a reduced dose of the selected medication, with a gradual adjustment based on the clinical response. The goal is not to cure epilepsy but to control the occurrence of seizures. For this to be successful, good cooperation from the patient is essential, since in some cases, the patient may have to stop the treatment after a period of time without seizures. When medications are not effective, alternatives such as a ketogenic diet or surgery may be considered: The ketogenic diet uses a high percentage of fat, few proteins and carbohydrates and a total suppression of sugar. Creates a metabolic state called \u201cketosis\u201d, which appears to reduce epilepsy seizures;;/ The surgery aims to remove the areas of the brain responsible for the electrical discharges or to interrupt the transmission of the electrical signal. Stimulation of the vagus nerve is performed using a small device surgically implanted under the skin, just below the collarbone, and allows the desynchronization of convulsive activity in the brain.;/ For each case, the neurologist decides which path to follow.",
        "Prevention": "Seizures are often associated with specific triggers or changes in daily routines, such as: Stress;/ Anxiety;/ Excessive alcohol consumption;/ Tobacco;/ Changes in sleep rhythm;/ Tiredness;/ Changes in ongoing medication;/ Very intense stimuli (bright lights, television, video, computer);/ Hormonal changes in women;/ Some of them can be avoided.

    "Epistaxis": {
        "What is it?": "Epistaxis is the medical term for a nosebleed. Due to the nose's position in the middle of the face and the large number of blood vessels it contains, most people will experience a nosebleed at some point in their lives. Nosebleeds are often caused by local trauma, foreign bodies, infections, and inhalation of dry air. Spontaneous nosebleeds are quite common in children, as are people taking blood thinners, with high blood pressure, or with blood clotting disorders. Other, rarer causes of nosebleeds include tumors and vascular malformations. Although rarely a cause for alarm, epistaxis can be fatal in rare cases.",
        "Symptoms": "Blood from the nose runs down the face, exiting one nostril (usually only one is affected) or runs down the throat if the nosebleed occurs while lying down. Serious nosebleeds require immediate medical attention and include: Heavy bleeding;/ Persistent or recurrent bleeding;/ Palpitations;/ Shortness of breathe;/ Paleness or fainting;/",
        "Causes": "It may originate from inflammatory changes in the mucosa, nasal trauma, capillary fragility or hemorrhagic lesions. Nosebleeds can be classified as anterior or posterior. In anterior epistaxis, blood comes from the wall between the two nostrils, in the area of \u200b\u200bthe nose that contains many delicate blood vessels; It is the most common and can usually be treated easily at home. In posterior epistaxis, there is usually more severe blood loss that may require medical attention.",
        "Diagnosis": "The doctor observes the patient and characterizes the nosebleed, including: Duration of blood loss;/ Approximate amount of blood lost;/ How many times has the patient had nosebleeds?;/ If one or both nostrils are involved;/ It is important to know: the medications the patient is taking, including drugs to thin the blood (such as aspirin and other anticoagulants), treatment for colds or allergies, alcohol intake or any use of drugs, especially if they were inhaled through the nose (use of cocaine, for example). Medical observation to determine the origin of the bleeding and its cause may involve the use of a small speculum and a light or an endoscope to see inside the nose. Sometimes additional tests may be necessary - x-rays, CT scans or blood tests.",
        "Treatment": "The approach consists of identifying the source of the bleeding, controlling it by chemical or electrical cauterization and, if necessary, nasal packing. In extreme cases, arterial embolization is performed.",
        "Prevention": "Avoid traumatizing and scratching the inside of the nose, especially by inserting nails, pencils, etc.;/ Apply lubricating ointment, especially to children whose nosebleeds are attributed to crusts inside the nostrils.;/ Use a humidifier if you are staying at high altitudes or in dry climates.;/ Do not exert any effort after an episode of nosebleeds and consult your doctor in case of doubt or unexplained or persistent nosebleeds.;/ Medical News Today Cleveland Clinic The presence of blood in the stool is a sign of bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract and can have several different causes.

    "Epitrocleite": {
        "What is it?": "This condition is also known as golfer's elbow or inner epicondylitis. It is a tendinitis that is associated with pain in the inner region of the elbow. This pain can radiate to the forearm and wrist. It is a disorder similar to tennis elbow but, unlike this tendonitis which affects the external region of the elbow, here its internal region is affected.",
        "Symptoms": "The classic symptom is pain located on the inside of the elbow that worsens with physical activity and decreases with rest. This pain may extend along the inside of the forearm. There may be stiffness in the elbow, a feeling of numbness or tingling that may radiate to the fingers. This pain may have a sudden or gradual onset and is aggravated by swinging a racket or golf club, squeezing a ball or someone's hand, turning a doorknob, lifting weights, picking something up with the palm facing down, or flexing the wrist. The elbow's range of motion is maintained because the inside of the joint is not affected. If left untreated, golfer's elbow can cause chronic pain, reduced range of motion, or a fixed contracture of the elbow.",
        "Causes": "It is important to note that tennis players and other athletes (baseball, gymnastics) who repeatedly use their wrist, clench their fingers, perform bending or weightlifting movements can also develop golfer's elbow. Activities such as painting, carpentry, computer use, and cooking can also cause golfer's elbow. This injury can be associated with other conditions such as carpal tunnel syndrome, tendinitis of other muscles and osteoarthritis. Age is also a risk factor, especially over 35 years of age.",
        "Diagnosis": "In addition to the medical examination, an X-ray study is important to detect possible changes in the bone or joint. The X-ray may show the presence of calcifications in the tendons, a sign that the process is already old. Ultrasound allows the tendons to be studied and, in some cases, it may be important to perform an MRI scan.",
        "Treatment": "In most cases (90%), medical treatment and physiotherapy are sufficient. In the remaining cases, surgery is recommended, and it is advisable to wait 6 to 12 months before opting for this solution. Medical treatment involves the use of ice, anti-inflammatories, corticosteroids and rest. Surgery involves removing damaged tissue and any calcifications present, with post-operative rehabilitation being important to prevent stiffness and muscle atrophy.",
        "Prevention": "Preventing this and other injuries involves a simple set of measures and a lot of common sense. It is essential not to start a sporting activity without proper guidance. In the case of older people, whose musculoskeletal system is more rigid, it is recommended to take a few classes with a properly qualified teacher. The choice of materials and equipment is very important and must be adjusted to the characteristics of each person. Warming up before starting a sporting activity should never be forgotten. Whenever any sign of tiredness occurs, rest breaks should be taken or the activity should even be interrupted. Training programs must be appropriate and tailored to age and general health status. In case of persistent complaints, a doctor should be consulted. Finally, in the event of an injury and after recovery, one should not rush to resume activity until the process is completely resolved.

    "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis": {
        "What is it?": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a rare degenerative neurological disease that progresses progressively. In this disease, the motor neurons that conduct information from the brain to the muscles (passing through the spinal cord) die prematurely. As a consequence, the muscles, which allow the most varied movements (walking, talking, chewing, swallowing...), become progressively weaker. It is estimated that there are three to five cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis for every 100,000 people. Although it can appear between the ages of 40 and 75, most patients are over 60 years of age. However, this disease can manifest itself at any age. It is more common in men than women and more in Caucasians than blacks.",
        "Symptoms": "The main symptoms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are lack of strength, muscle atrophy, involuntary muscle spasms, cramps, fatigue, muscles that are stiff due to increased tone (spasticity) and increased saliva production. There are different forms of this disease. The medullary form, the most common, involves the muscles of the arms or legs, causing difficulty walking. If it involves weakness of the muscles of the hands, it may be difficult, for example, to button a coat. There are also problems with articulation of words, chewing and swallowing, as well as shortness of breath and coughing, among others. There is usually progressive involvement of the body's muscles in a diffuse manner, with its rate being very variable. When muscle weakness involves the muscles of the neck or back, we are dealing with the axial form of the disease. When complaints occur associated with several parts of the body, we speak of the diffuse form. This disease can be associated with a form of dementia, in which case there is a greater likelihood of there being a genetic basis, with several family members affected.",
        "Causes": "In most cases, the cause is unknown. However, it is thought that in around 10% of cases, it may have a genetic origin. The potential role of some environmental factors (toxic or infectious agents), physical trauma and behavioural or occupational factors has been evaluated, but there is currently no concrete data.",
        "Diagnosis": "There is no specific test for this disease. Therefore, the diagnosis requires a neurological examination as well as a series of analyzes that exclude other pathologies that can simulate amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. As a rule, electrophysiological studies are performed, such as electromyography, laboratory blood and urine tests, magnetic resonance imaging, myelogram and muscle and/or nerve biopsies.",
        "Treatment": "There is currently no cure for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A drug, Riluzole, was approved in the United States, which appears to reduce nerve damage, increasing patients' quality of life. However, this drug does not allow existing lesions to be reversed. It is equally important to resort to therapies that can alleviate symptoms such as fatigue, muscle cramps, spasticity, constipation, pain, depression and improve sleep quality. When breathing becomes difficult due to muscle weakness, it may be necessary to resort to ventilatory assistance at night and/or during the day. This approach requires the participation of multidisciplinary teams that include doctors, pharmacists, physiotherapists, nurses, nutritionists and, in some cases, social workers. In this way, it is possible to design individualized support plans tailored to the needs of each patient.",

    "Multiple sclerosis": {
        "What is multiple sclerosis?": "Multiple sclerosis is an important and still poorly understood disease. According to a study carried out in our country, two thirds of Portuguese people do not know what multiple sclerosis is. It is estimated that, in Portugal, it affects around 60 individuals per 100 thousand inhabitants. On a global scale, data indicates that there are around 2,500,000 people with multiple sclerosis and in Portugal more than five thousand. It is a chronic neurological disease, more common in young adults, and which usually appears in the third decade of life, with twice the frequency in females. Most cases are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50, but can affect people aged between two and 75. Although it is not fatal, it is very disabling, significantly influencing all aspects of patients' lives. Multiple sclerosis affects the central nervous system. The nerve fibers of the cells of the nervous system are covered by a sheath called myelin, which is essential for the correct propagation of stimuli. In this pathology, the myelin is destroyed, preventing proper communication between the brain and the body. On the other hand, the inflammatory process that occurs in this disease damages the nerve cells themselves, causing permanent loss of various functions, depending on the areas affected. Its evolution is very variable and impossible to predict. As a rule, there are four types: The relapsing-remitting form, in which attacks occur lasting days to weeks, followed by recovery;;/ The secondarily progressive form, in which deficits accumulate after each crisis;;/ The primarily progressive form, which evolves from its beginning;;/ The relapsing-progressive form, in which the disease progresses clearly but there may be symptom-free periods.;/ The first is the most frequent.",
        "Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis": "The first symptoms are of a sensitive nature, such as loss of sensation or tingling that begins in one extremity and extends throughout the limb, over the course of three or four days. These signs can last from one to two weeks and then gradually disappear. Blurred or double vision, motor deficits, tremors, difficulty walking and speaking, balance changes, memory and concentration problems, fatigue, or even paralysis and complete loss of vision are also common. Symptoms always depend on the areas of the nervous system where there is loss of myelin and the consequent inability to transmit nervous stimuli. Progression to complete paralysis is rare, although many patients may require assistance in walking, given the presence of fatigue, weakness and imbalance.",
        "Causes of Multiple Sclerosis": "Its exact cause is unknown, but it is believed that there may be factors of a genetic, immunological, viral, bacterial, environmental nature (diet, industrial toxins present in soil or water), reduced levels of vitamin D, allergies, physical trauma, among others. Smoking has also been suggested as a potential cause. However, it is not a contagious disease nor is it hereditary.",
        "Diagnosis of multiple sclerosis": "In the early stages of multiple sclerosis, diagnosis is very difficult because symptoms can be very variable and tend to disappear over unpredictable periods of time. There is no laboratory test that is specific for multiple sclerosis and, as a rule, it is an MRI that confirms the presence of the disease. Some neurological examinations may also be useful.",
        "Multiple sclerosis treatment": "Multiple sclerosis has no cure and the available medications can only \u201cmodify\u201d or slow its progression, reduce the frequency and severity of flare-ups, reduce the accumulation of damaged areas in the nervous system and help patients deal with the symptoms. The most commonly used groups of drugs are corticosteroids, which help combat inflammation, and interferons, which reduce the risk of flare-ups, their severity and the damage they cause. In more severe cases, other types of medication may be used, such as cytostatics. All of these should be supplemented with other types of support, defined according to the difficulties experienced by each patient.",
        "Prevention of multiple sclerosis": "Considering the number and variety of possible causes of multiple sclerosis, it is difficult to prevent its occurrence. However, stopping smoking, increasing vitamin D levels and avoiding contact with environmental toxicants can be significant steps towards prevention.

    "Scoliosis": {
        "What is it?": "The normal spine has curves that cause the highest area of \u200b\u200bthe trunk (thoracic region) to protrude slightly outward (kyphosis) and the lower back slightly inward (lordosis). However, there are people who have curves to the sides. These curves are unnatural and are called scoliosis. Unlike bad posture, these curves are not corrected just by straightening your shoulders or sitting up straight. Scoliosis is a complex disease characterized by the existence of a severe deformity, in several planes, and which involves several segments of the spinal column. This type of spinal deformity affects around two in every 100 people globally. However, there is a strong family trend: if any family member has scoliosis, this number increases to around 20%.",
        "Symptoms": "If scoliosis progresses over time, it can result in: Severe pain;/ Marked deformity;/ Difficulty breathing;/ Some of the signs that can be observed are: Asymmetrical or uneven shoulders;/ Prominence of one shoulder blade;/ Waist asymmetry;/ Uneven haunches;/ Tilting the trunk to the side;/ If any of these signs exist, a medical evaluation (by a family doctor, pediatrician or pediatric orthopedist) is advisable.",
        "Causes": "The causes of scoliosis can be of different nature, including postural. However, in most cases it is not possible to identify the causes or reasons for the disease, which is called idiopathic scoliosis. Typically, scoliosis develops around the beginning of puberty in healthy young people and is more common in girls than boys. However, it can appear at any age. Some known causes of this deformation include, for example: Paralisia cerebral;/ Congenital malformations of the vertebrae;/ Muscular dystrophy;/ Tumors;/ Scoliosis tends to get worse over the years, due to the bad postures we adopt in different aspects of our lives.",
        "Diagnosis": "Although it is not possible to prevent scoliosis, early detection is the best way to prevent an existing problem from getting worse. X-rays of the entire spine in different views and angles provide diagnosis and guide treatment. In certain situations, additional studies such as Computerized Axial Tomography or Magnetic Resonance Imaging may be necessary.",
        "Treatment": "Sometimes scoliosis is only detected in adults, but it can result from the progression of a curve that was not treated during growth, and what began as mild scoliosis continued to worsen in the absence of treatment. Although most curves remain very small and only need to be monitored by a pediatric orthopedist to detect signs of progression, there are cases in which treatment is necessary. There are several factors that must be taken into account when drawing up a scoliosis treatment plan, such as: Family history;/ Age at which the curve appeared;/ Location of the curve;/ Curve Gravity;/ As it progresses, braces may be used to try to control it. This type of treatment allows any child to maintain all types of normal physical and social activities. If the treatment with the brace is not effective, it may be necessary to resort to surgery, which, nowadays, is an extremely effective and safe method of correcting curves. This procedure promotes the fusion of the segments involved \u2013 instrumentation \u2013 and is performed under general anesthesia, involving a hospital stay of approximately four to seven days. Other methods, such as electrical stimulation, specific physical exercises, manual therapy methods and manipulations, have not been shown to be effective.",
        "Prevention": "Scoliosis cannot be prevented, however early detection is the ideal way to prevent a problem that already exists from getting worse. When we use our cell phones, we tend to adopt a posture where we are looking down. It's called \"SMS neck\". Find out what it is and how to prevent it.

    "Juvenile idiopathic escoliosis": {
        "What is it?": "Juvenile and adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is... A deviation in the coronal/frontal plane (lateral deviation) in relation to the center of gravity or natural position of the spine;;/ Measured in angles and can vary or remain stable throughout growth.;/  It is divided into two types: Postural: results from the action of elements external to the spine that promote curves that can be corrected through postural reeducation, physical activity, physiotherapy, ocular prisms, insoles, osteopathy, among others. It is therefore considered reversible.;/ Structural: presents fixed curvature, generally progressive. It can be divided into three subtypes: congenital, when it is related to the malformation of the vertebrae at birth; neuromuscular, if it results from a muscular imbalance in the spinal stabilizing muscles or some pathologies of the central nervous system; and idiopathic when the cause is unknown. Among children and adolescents, the most common type of structural scoliosis is idiopathic scoliosis.;/  According to the Scoliosis Research Society (SRS), it can be classified according to age at the time of initial diagnosis, developing with maturity: Children \u2013 up to 3 years old;;/ Juvenile \u2013 from 4 to 9 years old;;/ Adolescence \u2013 from 10 to 18 years old.;/",
        "Symptoms": "If scoliosis progresses over time, it can result in severe pain, marked deformity, and difficulty breathing. Scoliosis cannot be prevented, however early detection is the ideal way to prevent a problem that already exists from getting worse.  These are some of the signs that can be observed: Asymmetrical or uneven shoulders;/ Prominence of one shoulder blade;/ Waist asymmetry;/ Uneven haunches;/ Tilting the trunk to the side;/  Any of these signs advises that a medical evaluation be carried out (by a family doctor, pediatrician or pediatric orthopedist)",
        "Causes": "The causes of idiopathic scoliosis are unknown, however, the literature states that it is a multifactorial pathology with genetic predisposition.",
        "Diagnosis": "At younger ages, it is the parents, physical education teachers or pediatricians who give the warning sign that something is wrong with the spine. And generally, the first signs of the presence of scoliosis are based on the asymmetry between the shoulders and pelvis and the length between the legs. When there is vertebral rotation, costal gibbosity may appear. However, the diagnosis is confirmed by the orthopedic doctor after performing an X-ray.  The progression of scoliosis normally occurs during the growth phase of children and adolescents, progressing until they reach the mature growth phase. The risk associated with curvature progression is greater in female children, when the curvature appears before menarche (first menstruation); when there is a double curvature or when its evolution is increasing. The longer it takes to finish growth, the more likely scoliosis is to progress.\u200b In general, scoliosis curvature can reach different degrees depending on the age at which it is diagnosed. Generally, curves that reach 40\u00ba/45\u00ba at the end of growth can continue to progress, while curvatures below this value tend to stagnate and not progress.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment with a brace/orthosis is one of the options in the treatment of idiopathic scoliosis and consists of applying an external force to the trunk, which in turn alters the rotation of the spine and prevents the progression of scoliosis. There are two basic types of orthoses: cervico-thoraco-lumbar-sacral (CTLSO) and thoraco-lumbar-sacral (TLSO). The first type of orthosis (CTLSO) is indicated for the treatment of thoracic curves with an apex at or around T8, double thoracic curves and other double curves with the apex of the thoracic component above T8. The Milwaukee brace is an example. As this type of orthosis immobilizes from the spine to the pelvis, it requires continuous and full-time use, which is why acceptance by adolescents is very low. In turn, the second type of orthosis (TLSO) is indicated for the treatment of lumbar and thoracolumbar curves, as well as thoracic curves with an apex at or below T8. Examples are the Boston, Lyon, Ch\u00eaneau, or Charleston, Providence brace (these two for some thoracolumbar and lumbar curves), among others. Due to the fact that they are placed under clothing and do not immobilize the neck, and that their use is not continuous (18 to 23 hours depending on age and protocols), they are more widely accepted by teenagers. The Charleston or Providence vests are night orthoses (minimum 8 hours of daily use) which is why they are most preferred by teenagers, whenever possible. Indication for use of vest Curves between 25\u00ba and 30\u00ba, with progression greater than 5\u00ba;;/ Curves between 30 and 40\u00ba;;/ Patients with immature skeleton;;/ Risser score less than 3;;/ Motivated Patients/Caregivers;;/ Most common types of braces: Boston, Charleston and Providence  Care to be taken with the vest The vest must be well adapted to your body;;/ Skin care;;/  Warning signs that arise when wearing a vest Numbness in the arm;;/ Pain in the rib cage;;/ Pain in the anterior superior iliac spine;;/ Pressure zones caused by the use of the vest;;/ Itching.;/  The details of the surgery, which has evolved a lot in recent years and with excellent aesthetic results, are defined based on classifications that take into account the characteristics of the spine curvatures and the patient's age, among other factors, and which are necessary to define the surgery strategy. surgical treatment.\u00a0 These strategies allow the restoration of spinal alignment and fixation, aiming to reduce curvature and prevent it from worsening. This type of surgery takes place over a long period of time and must be performed by a multidisciplinary team with the necessary resources.  Surgical approach It consists of correcting and fusing the vertebrae that are deviated, causing loss of movement in the operated segment of the spine. Spinal fusion or spinal arthrodesis is generally performed via the posterior approach (through the back). In very severe curves (greater than 70\u00ba) and other less common types of curves, surgery may be indicated via the anterior approach (through the thorax or abdomen) complemented by the posterior approach. Another surgical alternative for these severe curvatures consists of placing the young person in halo-gravitational traction for a few weeks (4 to 8 weeks). The scar is generally long and depends on the extent of the scoliosis (depending on the number of vertebrae affected). Complications associated with this type of surgery have decreased significantly in recent years. Currently, the most common complications involve nausea and vomiting and changes in respiratory flow (addressed with physiotherapy).  Use of implants Screws, bars, bands and hooks are applied to the spine in order to correct the deformity and fix the spine in the most correct position, allowing the vertebrae to fuse with the autologous bone graft taken from the ribs or the iliac bone (from the spine itself). In patients with idiopathic scoliosis, this type of fixation eliminates the need for any type of orthosis in the post-operative period, which is why some adolescents prefer this type of treatment without considering the risks of this type of surgery.  Post-operative follow-up - After hospital discharge The first post-discharge dressing is performed approximately 15 days after surgery.;/ First consultation is held approximately one month after surgery;/ Subsequent consultations are held monthly up to 6 months after surgery and from the 1st year onwards, annually up to 5 years. After this period, the patient is discharged from the hospital.;/  Scar care It is recommended to apply a greasy cream to the scar twice a day and massage in the direction of the suture;;/ It is recommended to use a sun protection cream (+50) on the scar site for the first 6 months after surgery.;/ It is recommended to use creams or bandages to prevent the formation of colloids (hyper scarring);/ It is recommended to contact the orthopedics unit in case of a sudden change in the appearance of the scar, namely: heat, pain and redness.;/",

    "Esophagitis": {
        "What is it?": "When the inner lining (mucosa) of the esophagus - the muscular tube that transports food from the mouth to the stomach and which is located, for the most part, in the chest - is inflamed, there is a sensation of chest pain or difficulty in swallowing. This problem is called esophagitis.",
        "Symptoms": "The main symptoms are chest or throat pain that resembles a burn. It radiates towards the neck and usually appears less than an hour after meals, and may worsen when lying down or leaning forward. It can be constant or intermittent. Another common symptom is difficulty swallowing, with chest pain worsening when the patient swallows or a feeling that food is stuck in the chest after eating. Sometimes these complaints can be confused with heart problems. In cases of more intense esophagitis, there is the presence of bleeding, in the form of blood in the vomit (with a brighter color) or in the feces (with a dark color resulting from the presence of digested blood). Both can cause anemia. There is also regurgitation, in which food returns to the mouth, without the effort of vomiting. Other possible manifestations are coughing, shortness of breath, hoarseness, ear pain or gingivitis. In some situations, complications may arise, such as ulcers and strictures.",
        "Causes": "Esophagitis has several causes. The most common is the reflux of stomach acid into the esophagus (gastroesophageal reflux), which results in a chemical burn of the lining of the esophagus and can cause inflammation, heartburn and a burning sensation in the chest. This reflux is caused by an imbalance between the defense and aggression factors of the esophagus. Elements that can attack this mucosa are foods (tomato products, citrus juices, chocolate, caffeinated drinks), tobacco, alcohol, some medications (nitrates, estrogens, oral contraceptives, calcium channel blockers, alendronate, among others), and the acidic contents of the stomach and bile, when biliary backflow occurs. If there is a hiatal hernia, a situation in which a portion of the stomach passes through the diaphragm into the thoracic cavity, dysfunction of the lower esophageal sphincter occurs, increasing reflux. Increased intra-abdominal pressure (tight clothing, pregnancy, coughing, obesity, sudden physical exercise that increases intra-abdominal pressure, constipation) is another cause of reflux. Like acid reflux, frequent vomiting can cause acid burn of the esophagus. Some drugs may also be associated with esophagitis, such as aspirin, doxycycline, iron supplements, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen, naproxen, and others), and medications for the treatment of osteoporosis (alendronate, risedronate, and others). Chemotherapy and radiation therapy for cancer can, in some cases, damage the lining of the esophagus, causing esophagitis. Infections in the esophagus can also be the cause, and usually occur in people with a deficient immune system. This is common in patients with HIV, people who take corticosteroids for long periods of time, those who have undergone organ transplants or those who have undergone chemotherapy.",
        "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis is often made based on symptoms. It is confirmed by performing an endoscopy, which allows direct observation of the inside of the esophagus. Using an endoscope, the doctor can identify esophagitis and the presence of areas where erosion or ulceration has occurred. If necessary, this technique allows biopsies to be performed, which consist of collecting small samples of the mucosa through the end of the endoscope, which are subsequently studied. Since esophagitis is only one possible cause of symptoms of chest pain or difficulty swallowing, further tests may be needed to evaluate the heart, lungs, and rest of the digestive system to rule out other problems.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment depends on its cause. In the case of acid reflux, medications that block acid formation, such as proton pump inhibitors, may be used. In others, which are more difficult to treat (generally when symptoms do not improve with medication), surgical intervention on the stomach may be necessary to help prevent reflux. When esophagitis results from taking medication, drinking a full glass of water after taking the pill may be helpful. In fact, it is important to know that all over-the-counter and prescription medications should be taken while standing or sitting and swallowed with water. This is especially important for those that can cause esophagitis. However, in general, it is necessary to stop taking the drug, at least temporarily, until the mucosa heals. Since acid can aggravate medication-induced esophagitis, your doctor may also prescribe an acid blocker. In the case of infections, the choice of treatment depends on the infectious agent responsible for the esophagitis. Some situations are difficult to treat with oral tablets or liquids, and may require intravenous treatment in a hospital setting.",
        "Prevention": "Since acid reflux is the most common cause of esophagitis, there are some measures that can minimize its occurrence, such as: Avoid heavy meals, especially in the hours before bedtime.;/ Reduce tobacco and alcohol consumption;/ Avoid consuming large amounts of caffeine, chocolate, peppermint and foods with a high fat content.;/ Keep your weight under control or, if necessary, lose weight;/ Do not wear tight clothing;/ Raise the head of the bed about 15 centimeters while sleeping;/ Portuguese Society of Gastroenterology Jo\u00e3o Cl\u00e1udio Barroso Pereira, Lung diseases and gastroesophageal reflux disease, Rev Port Pneumol 2009; XV (5): 899-921 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, Abril 2012 University of Maryland Medical Center, Outubro 2012 We don't all react to foods the same way, but some are more likely to cause heartburn.

    "Esophageal spasms": {
        "What is it?": "When food is swallowed, it moves from the mouth to the pharynx. The upper esophageal sphincter opens, allowing it to enter the esophagus, where a series of muscle contractions, called peristaltic waves, propel the food downward. The food then passes through the lower esophageal sphincter and into the stomach. If these contractions are not harmonious and sequential, it does not progress into the stomach and pain and difficulty in swallowing occur. Spasms correspond to a disorder of the propulsive movements (peristalsis) of the esophagus, caused by a malfunction of the nerves. The normal contractions that move food through the esophagus are periodically replaced by non-propulsive contractions. In 30% of people with this problem, the lower esophageal sphincter opens and closes abnormally. It is estimated that, in the United States of America, esophageal spasms affect one in every 100,000 people per year. However, considering that many of these cases go unnoticed, because they are associated with mild symptoms or are confused with other disorders, the real incidence may be higher. Although this disease is rarely fatal, it is associated with weight loss and malnutrition resulting from the inability to swallow. On the other hand, esophageal spasms can be disabling, interfering with daily activities and causing psychological disorders.",
        "Symptoms": "Muscle spasms along the esophagus are generally felt as chest pain behind the breastbone, which coincides with difficulty swallowing liquids or solids. This can occur at night and be severe enough to interrupt sleep. Very hot, very cold or fizzy liquids can worsen this symptom. Eating quickly also tends to aggravate the symptoms. Some patients also report a sensation of an object stuck in the throat. Others experience regurgitation of food or heartburn. In some individuals, severe pain without difficulty swallowing occurs. This, often described as a pressing pain behind the breastbone, can accompany exercise or exertion, making it difficult to distinguish it from angina pectoris. Symptoms tend to be intermittent and variable throughout the day and can last from minutes to hours. Anxiety and depression are common in these patients. If not diagnosed and treated, this condition can evolve, after many years, into achalasia (dilation of the esophagus with loss of its contractile capacity).",
        "Causes": "Although the cause is not known, it is clear that esophageal spasms are more common in white people, in females and rare in childhood, increasing in incidence with age. Some theories attribute the cause of this disease to gastric reflux or a neuromuscular disorder, but there is still no scientific validation.",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis is based on clinical evidence and can be confirmed by performing an X-ray study. X-rays taken while a contrast agent (barium) is ingested can reveal an abnormal downward movement and demonstrate that the contractions of the esophageal wall are occurring in a disorganized manner. Oesophageal gammagraphy (a highly sensitive imaging test that shows the movement of food through the oesophagus) is used to detect abnormal movements of food through the oesophagus. Measurements of oesophageal pressure (manometry) also allow detailed analysis of spasms. Endoscopy may be useful. If these studies are inconclusive, a manometry may be performed when the person eats food or administers a substance that triggers painful spasms.",
        "Treatment": "Spasms of the esophagus are difficult to treat. However, symptoms can be relieved with nitroglycerin, long-acting nitrates, dicyclomine, or calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine. Sometimes strong painkillers are needed to relieve pain. In some cases, a balloon is inflated into the esophagus or tubes (metal dilators) are inserted to widen the esophagus. If these therapeutic modalities are not effective, surgery is used, with a section being made in the muscular layer of the esophagus along its entire length, in order to reduce the occurrence of spasms.",
        "Prevention": "Since the cause is unknown, it is not possible to prevent the development of this condition.

    "Spina bifida": {
        "What is it?": "Spina bifida is a congenital anomaly of the nervous system that develops in the first two months of pregnancy. It represents the defect in the formation of the neural tube (abnormalities that occur in the development of the spinal cord and brain of some babies) most common in the United States, with an estimated incidence of 1 in every 1000 newborns. However, there is still no statistical data on the incidence of spina bifida in Brazil. These defects are an important cause of infant mortality. In this condition, there is incomplete development of the brain, spinal cord and meninges. There are four types of spina bifida: Hidden: the most common and lightest.;/ Closed neural tube defects: intermediate severity.;/ Meningocele: like the previous one, it is of intermediate severity.;/ Myelomeningocele: is the most serious type, in which the spinal cord is exposed, resulting in partial or complete paralysis of the area of \u200b\u200bthe body located below the opening of the spinal cord. It is also associated with urinary and fecal incontinence.;/",
        "Symptoms": "The symptoms of a person with spina bifida vary greatly, depending on the type of anomaly. Closed defects are identified earlier by the presence of a tuft of hair or a patch of skin at the site of the spinal malformation. In meningocele and myelomeningocele, a sac filled with fluid forms that protrudes through the skin near the spine. This sac may be covered by a thin layer of skin (meningocele) or, especially in cases of myelomeningocele, this covering layer is absent, leaving the anomalous tissue completely exposed.",
        "What impact can it have on the patient?": "Spina bifida can be associated with various complications, from the mildest, such as some functional limitation, to the most serious with severe physical and mental disability. Most people with this condition have a normal level of intelligence. The impact of spina bifida depends on the location and size of the malformation, whether or not it is lined, and which nerves are involved. As a rule, all nerves that are located below the malformation will be affected to a greater or lesser extent. Therefore, the higher the location of the malformation, the greater the nerve damage and loss of motor and sensory function.",
        "What is the relationship between spina bifida and hydrocephalus?": "One of the neurological complications associated with spina bifida is Chiari II malformation, especially in children with myelomeningocele. In this malformation, the brain stem and cerebellum protrude into the region of the spinal canal or neck, compressing the spinal cord and causing symptoms such as difficulty in eating, swallowing and controlling breathing, and changes in the function of the upper limbs (stiffness and weakness). In this case, the flow of cerebrospinal fluid may also be blocked, causing a condition called hydrocephalus, in which there is an abnormal accumulation of this fluid in and around the brain. This accumulation causes an increase in intracranial pressure, with damage to brain structures. Hydrocephalus is treated by placing a shunt in the brain, which allows excess fluid to drain into the abdominal cavity.",
        "Consequences in newborns and adulthood": "Some newborns with myelomeningocele may develop meningitis, which can cause brain damage or be fatal. When myelomeningocele and hydrocephalus occur, children may have learning and attention difficulties. At a more advanced stage of life, these patients with spina bifida may develop latex allergies, skin or gastrointestinal problems and are more prone to depression.",
        "Causes": "The causes for the development of spina bifida are not known. It is thought that genetic, nutritional and environmental factors may contribute to this condition. Some studies suggest that insufficient maternal folic acid intake may be a key factor in the development of neural tube defects. For this reason, prenatal vitamins always contain folic acid.",
        "Diagnosis": "In most cases, the diagnosis of spina bifida is made prenatally. However, some milder cases may only be detected after birth. In the milder type (spina bifida occulta), where there are no symptoms, the diagnosis may never be made. Prenatal diagnosis is usually carried out in the second trimester of pregnancy through maternal serum alpha fetoprotein (MSAFP) measurement and ultrasound. Amniocentesis may also be helpful. Postnatal diagnosis of spina bifida is usually performed through an imaging test (x-ray, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging).",
        "Treatment": "There is no cure for spina bifida. Damaged nerve tissue cannot be repaired, nor can lost function be restored. Treatment will depend on the type and severity of the condition. In milder forms of spina bifida, no treatment is necessary, although in some cases surgery may be indicated when children are older. In cases of myelomeningocele, it is essential to prevent infection of exposed tissues and protect them from trauma. In addition to surgery, various devices can be used to facilitate movement and increase the autonomy of affected children. In the case of hydrocephalus, a shunt is implanted to drain the cerebrospinal fluid. Physiotherapy is an important complement to the treatment of this condition.",
        "Importance of surgery in children with spina bifida": "As a rule, children with spina bifida will undergo surgery to close the defect and minimize the risk of infection and/or trauma. Some clinical centers perform prenatal surgery, even in the womb. The theoretical advantage is earlier correction of the defect and a better prognosis. However, this is still an experimental procedure. In about 20 to 50% of cases of myelomeningocele, there is a progressive blockage of the spinal cord, which becomes attached to other structures, such as the vertebrae, placing the spinal cord under tension as the child grows. This results in loss of muscle function in the legs and urinary and fecal incontinence. Surgery is essential to release this blockage and prevent further neurological deterioration in the person with spina bifida.",
        "Prevention": "Folic acid intake is an essential aspect of preventing the development of spina bifida. All women of childbearing age should ingest around 400 micrograms daily, either through their diet or through multivitamins. In the case of women with spina bifida or who have already had a child with spina bifida, a daily intake of a higher dose of folic acid is recommended before considering pregnancy.

    "Spondyloarthritis": {
        "What is it?": "It is the name given to a family of rheumatic inflammatory diseases that cause arthritis. The most common form is ankylosing spondylitis, which mainly affects the spine. This group of pathologies includes reactive arthritis, psoriasis arthritis and arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel diseases (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease). They affect around 0.6% to 1.9% of the population and ankylosing spondylitis occurs in between 0.1% and 1.4% of people. In Portugal the prevalence is unknown. However, some data suggest that 2.5 to 3 million Portuguese people suffer from rheumatic disease, of which 60 thousand have spondyloarthritis. Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory disease that mainly affects young men, around the age of 20, affecting the sacroiliac joints, the spine and peripheral joints. The most affected region tends to be the sacrum and iliac region and in some cases it can progressively progress to ossification and ankylosis, in which the vertebrae fuse together. All of these pathologies have an important impact on quality of life and inability to work. In the population over 50 years of age, rheumatic diseases account for approximately half of chronic illnesses.",
        "Symptoms": "The main symptom is pain in the lower back and sometimes swelling in the legs and arms. Spondyloarthritis differs from other types of arthritis because it involves the ligaments and tendons, causing inflammation, pain and stiffness. When the inflammatory process continues without treatment, bone destruction occurs, with deformation of the spine and loss of mobility in the shoulders and hips. Many patients also have osteoporosis, which increases the risk of fractures. Eye inflammation (uveitis) is also common (with an incidence of 40%) and causes pain, blurred vision and redness. In some cases, there may be inflammation of the aortic valve, psoriasis or intestinal inflammation.",
        "Causes": "The causes are not well known. Ankylosing spondylitis is hereditary and is associated with several genes. Of these, the most common is HLA-B27, which is used in the diagnosis of this disease. In the case of inflammatory bowel diseases, their origin is not clear and may be related to the presence of bacteria that cause inflammation in this organ. Chlamydia is one of them.",
        "Diagnosis": "It essentially involves a medical examination, laboratory tests, imaging tests (such as radiographic studies or magnetic resonance imaging) and radiological studies, which are very relevant for the investigation of HLA-B27 when ankylosing spondylitis is suspected.",
        "Treatment": "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can help relieve pain, stiffness, and swelling. In some cases, corticosteroid injections into the affected joints may be helpful. Sulfasalazine can also help reduce symptoms and prevent joint damage. Biological therapies are newer and are useful in patients who respond poorly to anti-inflammatory drugs. Exercise and physiotherapy are important as a complement to medical treatment. In more advanced cases, when joint destruction has occurred, surgery may be helpful.",
        "Prevention": "Although primary prevention is not possible, secondary prevention resulting from early or timely recognition of the disease allows a broad field of action in which it is possible to improve diagnostic sensitivity and adopt correct treatment strategies that may, in early stages, determine large differences in functional prognosis in the medium term.

    "Ankylosing spondylitis": {
        "What is it?": "Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic rheumatic disease of an inflammatory nature. Its name is due to the fact that the vertebrae become inflamed and \u201cweld\u201d together, causing ankylosis (fusion) of the spine and sacroiliac joints (those that connect the lower part of the spine with the pelvis). The result ends up being limited mobility and loss of flexibility in the spine (it becomes more rigid). Worldwide, ankylosing spondylitis (AS) affects, on average, one in every 200 individuals. It usually appears between the ages of 20 and 30, and is rare after the age of 45. It is more prevalent in men than in women. When it occurs in women, it usually has a more favorable evolution. Although, in most cases, it appears in isolation, it can appear associated with other clinical conditions, such as psoriasis or inflammatory bowel diseases.",
        "Symptoms": "Ankylosing spondylitis manifests itself gradually with severe pain, difficult to define but mainly in the lumbar region, accompanied by difficulty in mobilizing, stiffness and muscle weakness. Stiffness: difficulty in moving the spine, more intense in the morning upon waking, lasting more than 30 minutes and can last for hours.;/ Inflammatory back pain: pain in the dorsal spine, more intense at night;/ Inflammatory low back pain: pain in the lower back, more intense in the morning and at night, in bed. Improves with movement and physical exercise.;/ Pseudo-sciatica: pain in the buttocks (gluteal pain) and sometimes in the back of the thighs, alternating between the right and left sides (tilting pain).;/ Talalgia: pain in the heel region caused by inflammation of the Achilles tendon and plantar fascia.;/ Tendinitis: inflammation of the tendons, which causes swelling and pain in the Achilles tendon and patellar tendon (in front of the knee).;/ Peripheral arthritis: inflammation of the joints, which predominantly affects the lower limbs (hip, knee and ankle).;/ Red eye: inflammation of the eye (uveitis), which requires urgent treatment to avoid sequelae, such as decreased vision.;/ As it is a systemic disease, ankylosing spondylitis can affect other organs, such as the lungs and heart. Lung function may suffer a decrease, caused by reduced chest elasticity, which is an additional reason why those suffering from ankylosing spondylitis should not smoke.",
        "Causes": "The causes behind ankylosing spondylitis are still unknown; It is known, however, that there is an association between this disease and the HLA-B27 antigen (a genetic marker), which appears to trigger an abnormal response to the action of certain microorganisms. This is probably the process that triggers the disease.",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis is made based on physical symptoms and observation of the patient. Blood tests may be necessary to rule out other pathologies and allow genetic typing to search for HLA-B27 can help to strengthen the diagnosis, although it can also be associated with other diseases. X-rays of the pelvis and spine allow us to check for changes in the sacroiliac joints and vertebrae, however, these changes are generally very late in relation to the onset of symptoms. When diagnosis and treatment of AS are early, most patients have a good quality of life and joint stiffness rarely becomes disabling.",
        "Treatment": "As a rheumatic, chronic and progressive disease, treatment objectives include relieving pain and stiffness, maintaining good joint function, avoiding deformities and enabling a good quality of life. Drugs: These include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, sometimes sulfasalazine or methotrexate. Recently, biological treatments have emerged that specifically target the components of the immune response involved in the disease and can be used when traditional medication is not effective.;/ Rehabilitation: One of the most important aspects of treatment is daily spinal and respiratory rehabilitation exercises to strengthen muscles and prevent stiffness and loss of mobility.;/ Surgery: It has a limited role in treatment, but prosthetics may be necessary when there is a very damaged joint (most common at the hip).;/",

    "Spondylolisthesis": {
        "What is it?": "Spondylolisthesis occurs when one of the vertebrae in the spine slips from its normal position, usually moving forward over the vertebra immediately below it. It is most common in the lower back. Spondylolysis, an associated condition, corresponds to a defect in the pars interarticularis (small segment of bone that joins the facets of a vertebra) of a vertebra.  Spondylolisthesis is divided into types and degrees, based on its origin: Type I: In some cases, people are born with spondylolisthesis. A child may also develop the condition naturally during development. In both situations, there may not be any symptoms until later in life.;/ Type II:\u00a0 The most common, occurs when there is a problem with a section of the vertebra called the pars interarticularis. Type II fractures only become spondylolisthesis if they force the vertebra to move forward. Type II includes: IIA, which involves microfractures caused by excessive use of the vertebrae and hyperextension; IIB, which includes many microfractures that heal with the formation of extra bone, causing stretching and misalignment; IIC corresponds to a complete fracture caused by trauma (sports injury or accident);;/ IIA which involves microfractures caused by overuse of the vertebrae and hyperextension;;/ IIB which includes many microfractures that heal with extra bone formation, causing stretching and misalignment;;/ IIC corresponds to a complete fracture caused by trauma (sports injury or accident);;/ Type III:\u00a0 It is associated with aging and natural bone wear;;/ Type IV: This is a fracture that occurs in any area of \u200b\u200bthe vertebra, except in the pars interarticularis region;;/ Type V: Due to tumors in the vertebrae;;/ Type VI: This is a rare spondylolisthesis caused by weakening after surgery.;/  This pathology is also classified into degrees according to the percentage of anterior sliding of the vertebral body: Grau 1: 25%;/ Grade 2: Between 25% and 50%;/ Grade 3: Between 50% and 75%;/ Grade 4: Between 75% and 100%;/ Grade 5: The vertebral body appears completely disconnected;/",
        "Symptoms": "In many people, spondylolisthesis has no symptoms. In reality, although this condition often develops early in adolescence, it is typically not detected until adulthood. Children and teenagers often endure low back pain for many years before being evaluated by a doctor. Some studies report that 2.3 to 10% of the population with spondylolysis is generally asymptomatic. However, around 25% of patients with this defect may experience low back pain. The pain usually spreads along the lumbar spine and may resemble a muscle spasm. Spondylolisthesis can cause spasms that cause stiffness in the spine and muscles, which is associated with changes in posture. If the slippage is significant, nerve compression and narrowing of the spinal canal can occur. Some of the most common signs of spondylolisthesis include: Difficulty walking or running:;/ Pain in the lower back or buttocks;/ Pain in the back of one or both legs;/ Weakness in one or both legs;/ Lower back and leg pain aggravated by movement;/ Increased inward curve of the spine (lordosis);/",
        "Causes": "There may be a hereditary basis - it is possible to be born with thinner vertebral bone, which makes it more vulnerable, and periods of rapid growth can encourage slippage (spondylolisthesis). The risk decreases in middle age and increases again between the ages of 60 and 80. In addition to these factors, all activities that require hyper-extension or hyper-flexion of the lumbar spine increase the risk of these conditions occurring. Some sports, such as gymnastics, weightlifting or football, put a lot of pressure on the bones in the lumbar spine, which increases the risk of a fracture on one side of a vertebra. Typical causes include: Fractures;/ Joint injury;/ Degeneration (overuse of the vertebrae or aging);/ Congenital bone defect;/ Spondylosis, defect or fracture in the pars interarticularis region;;/ Tumors;/ Surgery;/",
        "Diagnosis": "The radiographic study confirms the presence of spondylolisthesis, that is, a fracture at the level of the vertebra. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging provide more detail about the fractured vertebra, its potential for slippage and the possible presence of nerve compression. Sometimes the images on an X-ray appear normal and it is these tests that allow the correct diagnosis to be made. The tests should be repeated regularly to check whether the vertebra is changing position.",
        "Treatment": "Fusion (union) of the segments involved and their instrumentation (implants) are the surgical procedures indicated to correct the deformity and achieve stability. This procedure is performed under general anesthesia, in a two to three-day hospital stay. Surgical intervention should be considered when there is an associated neurological deficit and/or progression of listhesis or if low back pain does not respond to treatment and interferes with daily activities. However, most people respond well to conservative treatment, which consists of a period of rest, with possible trunk stabilization orthosis (placement of a joint stabilizing device), followed by physiotherapy with exercises that focus on flexion, abdominal muscle strengthening, tendon stretching and specific exercises for dynamic stabilization of the lumbar spine. In addition to rest, anti-inflammatories are very useful.",
        "Prevention": "This condition cannot be completely prevented. However, it is known that certain activities, such as gymnastics, weightlifting and football, increase the stress on the vertebrae and therefore increase the risk of spondylolisthesis. They should therefore be avoided. If not properly treated, this condition is associated with chronic pain in the spine or legs, as well as tingling or weakness in the legs. More severe compression of the nerves can cause loss of control of the sphincters, but this complication is rare. The prognosis is generally good and most cases recover with conservative treatment.

    "Spondylosis osteoarthritis of the spine": {
        "What is it?": "Spondylosis is a form of degenerative (aging) disease of the joints of the spine. It primarily affects the intervertebral discs, and also the interapophyseal joints and ligaments of the spine.",
        "Symptoms": "The typical symptom of spondylosis is lumbago, back pain of varying severity. Standing usually aggravates the complaints, which are relieved by lying down. Other symptoms include stiffness, limited mobility and deformity of the spine, as well as osteoarthritis involving other joints (hip and knees). Although the joint aging process is inevitable, the symptoms progress unpredictably and may even disappear temporarily or even permanently.",
        "Diagnosis": "X-rays may show arthritic changes in the spine, such as collapse of the disc space, bone spicules (\u201cparrot beaks\u201d), hypertrophy of the interapophyseal joints or slippage of one vertebra over another (spondylolisthesis), but the specificity of these changes is limited since they are present in most people, even if they are asymptomatic. Computed Axial Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) may be indicated in some cases.",
        "Treatment": "Conservative, non-surgical treatment is indicated in most cases and is effective. The modalities consist of physiotherapy, modification of daily activities, weight loss, orthotics, anti-inflammatories and analgesics, and oral corticosteroids. In selected cases, joint injections, nerve blocks or radiofrequency may provide lasting symptomatic relief. Surgery (fusion or arthroplasty) is only very rarely indicated in these cases.

    "Heel spur": {
        "What is it?": "A heel spur is a small projection of bone that forms on the heel bone, the calcaneus. It results from intense pressure on the sole of the foot over long periods of time. During walking, each heel alternately supports the weight of the entire body. This load is relieved by layers of tissue located under the heel. When you practice sports without adequate warm-up, you can overload the calf muscles and the Achilles tendon, which is inserted into the heel bone. When this tendon is under stress, this pressure is transmitted to the sole of the foot, causing inflammation or small tears in the tissues. During rest, the muscles in the sole of the foot contract to try to protect the affected area and the pain gradually decreases, returning after walking or running again. To compensate for this repeated injury, the body will attempt a repair process similar to that which occurs after a fracture, creating bone tissue around the inflamed area. This is how the projection of bone called a \u201cheel spur\u201d is formed. The calcaneal spur itself does not cause pain and is just the result of a process of continued overload. The pain results from inflammation of adjacent structures. It is estimated that 11 to 27% of the population have radiographic evidence of a calcaneal spur, which is not always associated with pain. Women are more affected and calcaneal spurs are more common in older people, especially after 40 years of age, and those who are overweight.",
        "Symptoms": "Heel spurs are characterized by intense pain in the lower or inner region of the heel. When the weight of the body is placed on the affected heel, the pain is severe enough to cause immediate immobilization of walking. This pain eases with rest, worsens with exertion and tends to be more pronounced in the morning. The nerves and capillaries adapt as you walk, which is why the pain is worse at the beginning of the walk. When you rest, the capillaries and nerves also rest. As soon as you start walking again, the level of demand on the blood vessels and nerves increases, causing the pain to return until these structures adapt to the spur again. Walking on hard surfaces or carrying heavy objects, such as a backpack, increases the pain. A jump makes the pain more intense. The pain may be more localized at first but tends to cover the entire heel. In extreme cases, this pain can interfere with daily activities.",
        "Causes": "Heel spurs are more common in older people, especially after 40 years of age, and in those who are overweight. Osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, circulatory failure and other degenerative diseases are also associated with an increased risk of heel spurs. There may be a genetic tendency for this condition. The presence of \u201cflat feet\u201d or a very pronounced plantar arch also increases the risk of developing heel spurs. When it comes to sport, long-distance running is an important factor. Running on the beach or on steep surfaces also makes it more likely that a heel spur will develop.",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis is based on a medical examination and is confirmed by X-ray or magnetic resonance imaging, which allows other causes of pain, such as gout or arthritis, to be ruled out.",
        "Treatment": "Calcaneal spurs can be difficult to treat. However, in many cases, the changes are discrete and recover over time. Treatment involves rest, use of ice, compression of the affected area and elevation of the lower limb. In some cases, heat is beneficial in relieving pain. Anti-inflammatories help control pain and inflammation. Sometimes a corticosteroid injection into the affected area can be helpful. The heel can be supported by using a special sole, which must be prescribed by the doctor. Some cases benefit from treatments such as diathermy or ultrasound. Surgery allows the spur to be removed and is indicated when more conservative measures are not effective.",
        "Prevention": "Warming up before starting any sporting activity is essential. It is equally important to maintain adequate levels of activity without overexertion or overload.

    "Schizophrenia": {
        "What is it?": "Schizophrenia is a serious, chronic and disabling psychiatric illness, often incorrectly described as a \"personality split\". It profoundly affects a person's way of thinking, their emotional life and their behavior in general. In addition to the patient himself, everyone around him suffers from this pathology, given the difficulties in social, family and professional relationships that it causes. Schizophrenics are rarely violent, although delusions of persecution and drug use increase this risk. When violence does occur, it usually involves family members and occurs within the home. The risk of suicide is significant: around 10%, especially young male adults, die by suicide. There are several types, although a patient rarely fits into just one of them. In Portugal, in the 2001 Psychiatric Census, schizophrenia was, in all hospitalizations, consultations and emergencies, the most frequent illnesses (21.2%), being the main cause of hospitalization and the third in consultations. It affects around 1% of the population and tends to appear in late adolescence. Although it does not distinguish between sexes, races or cultures, the most affected populations are rural populations and social groups with low socioeconomic and cultural levels. The disease appears earlier in males (between 15 and 25 years of age) and later in females (between 25 and 30 years of age). It is a pathology that rarely occurs after the age of 45.",
        "Symptoms": "The symptoms of schizophrenia are very diverse and complex and, in general, reflect a loss of contact with reality. Hallucinations: auditory, visual or olfactory. The patient is often convinced that others can read his thoughts, control them, or that they wish to harm him. This conviction terrifies him, tending to move away or become very agitated.;/ Confused speech: Often makes no sense and may stop suddenly in the middle of a sentence. Thoughts tend to be very disorganized.;/ Movement changes: The patient may sit for hours without moving or speaking, or repeat certain movements over and over again. At other times, the patient may appear to be perfectly fine.;/  Some symptoms of schizophrenia are more vague: Absence of expression in the voice or face while the patient speaks;/ Lack of pleasure in daily activities;/ Inability to initiate and maintain planned tasks;/ Difficulty understanding information, making decisions, or staying focused;/ Inability to use information immediately after learning it;/",
        "Causes": "Genetics are important in schizophrenia. Although the disease affects about 1% of the population, it affects 10% of people who have a first-degree relative with the condition. It is thought that in many cases, an interaction between genetics and the environment is necessary for the disease to develop, although these interactions are not well understood. Another possible origin is a chemical imbalance in the brain, with regard to the neurotransmitters dopamine and glutamate. These substances allow different areas of the brain to communicate with each other and, as such, their balance is fundamental. Differences in the brain structure of 52 patients with schizophrenia were also identified. These changes can occur during brain development and only manifest themselves at puberty.",
        "Diagnosis": "The occurrence of schizophrenia in younger age groups makes it difficult to diagnose, because many of the symptoms correspond to typical behavioral changes in young people (lower academic performance, change of friends, sleep disorders, irritability). However, some factors, when combined, make it possible to predict up to 80% of young people who are at risk of developing schizophrenia: isolation, withdrawal, increased number of thoughts and suspicions, and family history of psychosis. However, there are no specific tests that can diagnose schizophrenia. In addition to the medical evaluation and clinical history, the health professional requests some tests to exclude other diseases that can also cause the same symptoms. This assessment is essential because the manifestations of schizophrenia are complex, sometimes poorly defined and may be associated with facts that have nothing to do with the disease. Psychiatric evaluation is essential to assess whether sufficient criteria for a diagnosis of schizophrenia are present.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment for schizophrenia focuses on eliminating symptoms, using medication and psychotherapy. There are several antipsychotic drugs available, and the psychiatrist must select the most appropriate one for each case. Some of them have significant side effects and must be carefully monitored. Each patient responds differently to treatment, and it is often necessary to test different medications and doses. It is very important never to interrupt or stop treatment without medical advice. Psychotherapy is useful for patients who have already stabilized, helping them to reintegrate into their daily activities.",
        "What is the prognosis for schizophrenia?": "Although there is no cure yet, its prognosis is\u00a0improving. New therapies allow for a life with more quality and autonomy. The success of schizophrenia treatment depends on the involvement of family and loved ones, so that they can facilitate the patient's adaptation to their condition and so that everyone can learn more about the disease.",
        "Prevention": "Although there is no proven way to prevent it, there do appear to be ways to make it less likely by controlling the consequences of some important life events such as postpartum depression, traumatic childhood experiences and drug use.

        "What is it?": "It is defined by a decrease in the size of the foramen (hole), which causes compression of the spinal cord, that is, of the nerves in the affected region.

        "Symptoms": "People with this condition may experience the following symptoms in their legs or feet: Dor;/ Numbness;/ Muscle weakness;/ Changes in the sexual organs;/ Difficulty walking;/ These symptoms may start slowly and worsen over time. In severe cases, the person may experience partial or complete paralysis of the leg. This is a medical emergency and requires hospitalization.",
        "Causes": "It occurs when the spaces between the vertebrae, or bones of the spine, narrow, which compresses the spinal canal, causing disruption to the spinal cord and nerve roots. It can result from a narrow spinal canal, spinal injuries and trauma, tumors, bone diseases, previous spinal surgeries, and rheumatoid arthritis.",
        "Diagnosis": "The doctor or rheumatologist asks the patient about their symptoms and medical history. They then perform a physical examination, which may be supplemented by: Spinal X-ray to detect osteoarthritic changes;/ Magnetic resonance imaging;/ CT scan to check for changes in the tissues in and around the spinal canal;/ Myelogram in which an injection of dye into the spine differentiates various types of tissue;/ Electromyogram in which an electrode measures electrical activity in nerves and muscles;/ Your doctor may also order other tests, such as blood tests.",

    "Cervical stenosis": {
        "What is it?": "Cervical canal stenosis is the tightening of neurological structures in the spinal (cervical) canal due to a decrease in the area available for these structures. These structures include the spinal cord as well as the nerve roots that exit the spine at each level from the base of the skull to the end of the spine. These nerves/roots will motor and sensory innervate not only the limbs but also the bladder and intestines. Compression of the spinal cord and cervical nerve roots will compromise some of the functions of the spinal cord, causing a variety of clinical symptoms including pain, stiffness, changes in sensitivity and even muscle strength in the upper and lower limbs. The spinal cord involvement can even compromise the functions of the bladder and intestines. It is a progressive disease that can have devastating consequences if not identified and treated promptly. Cervical stenosis consists of a narrowing of the spinal canal, compromising the spinal cord and/or nerve roots. In most cases, it occurs as a result of a natural aging process of the spine that leads to protrusion of the intervertebral discs, hypertrophy of the intervertebral joints and thickening of the ligaments, resulting in a decrease in the diameter of the spinal canal, which leads to deterioration of the spinal cord (myelopathy).",
        "Symptoms": "Symptoms of cervical myelopathy include loss of manual dexterity, balance and coordination, muscle weakness, spasticity and difficulty walking. Many people over 50 years of age have reduced cervical canal dimensions without having any complaints. The stenosed cervical canal only gives symptoms when there is compression of the spinal cord or cervical nerve roots but the symptoms usually appear slowly and gradually and are essentially: neck stiffness and pain with or without muscle weakness of the shoulder, arm, forearm or hand;/ changes in balance and motor coordination such as shuffling gait and frequent stumbling;/ loss of control of urine and feces (in more severe cases);/ Occasionally, and in the context of a diagnosed cervical stenotic canal, we may see a sudden worsening of the symptoms with a very exuberant picture of spinal ataxia and motor and balance incoordination that can set in within a few hours, only requiring urgent surgical intervention for decompression.",
        "Causes": "Cervical canal stenosis is generally caused by age-related changes, particularly in the shape/alignment and size of the spinal canal, most commonly in people over 50 years of age. The aging of the discs can cause diffuse disc protrusion as well as calcification of the ligamentous insertions (parrot's beak). This aging process of the intervertebral discs also affects the interapophyseal facets with the typical wear of osteoarthritis processes (without cartilage). All these degenerative changes contribute to the reduction of the free area within the spinal canal at this level, thus causing tightening and compression of the neurological structures. In rare cases the cervical canal is stenotic from birth, taking into account the dimensions of the vertebrae themselves.",
        "Diagnosis": "Once a compatible clinical condition has been diagnosed, the patient must undergo imaging tests \u2013 X-ray, Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Tomography. However, the doctor must order a series of blood tests to help exclude other diseases with similar symptoms, namely Multiple Sclerosis and Vitamin B12 deficiency.",
        "Treatment": "In less severe cases, symptoms can be controlled with the use of medication to relieve pain, physiotherapy to maintain muscle strength and flexibility, and moist heat to reduce muscle spasm. If the symptoms are severe enough, there is often a progressive decrease in muscle strength and in this circumstance we should consider surgical treatment to decompress the neurological structures. This type of surgery can be performed either in front of or behind the cervical spine, depending essentially on where the greatest compressive component is located. In selected cases, epidural injections (interlaminar or transforaminal) may provide lasting symptomatic relief. Due to the progressive nature of the disease, surgical decompression of the spinal cord is the indicated treatment. It can be performed via the anterior or posterior approach, depending on the characteristics of the disease, the patient, and the surgeon's preference. Options include microdiscectomy or corporectomy and anterior arthrodesis, laminoplasty, and laminectomy (with or without posterior fusion). Some surgical techniques to achieve decompression end up removing more movement from the cervical spine and thus making it an even more rigid spine (anterior cervical arthrodesis with or without corporectomy), but other techniques exist in which it is possible to widen the dimensions of the cervical canal while preserving the mobility of this segment of the spine (laminoplasty).

    "Carotid stenosis": {
        "What is it?": "The carotid arteries are the two main arteries in the neck, which run from the heart and supply oxygen-rich blood to the brain. With age, atheroma plaques (accumulation of fat, a process called atherosclerosis) accumulate within the carotid arteries, which can lead to their narrowing and reduced ease with which blood circulates. This phenomenon - which can occur in one or both arteries - is called carotid stenosis. Typically, plaque buildup occurs in the area where the carotid artery bifurcates. Carotid stenosis increases the risk of stroke, depending on how narrow the artery is. Small clots can form next to atheroma plaques that break off and travel to the brain, causing a stroke.",
        "Symptoms": "Carotid stenosis often does not cause early symptoms and progresses silently, especially in situations where the blockage develops slowly over years. Therefore, this disease is often discovered in the course of routine diagnostic examinations. Sometimes, this problem can cause tinnitus or fainting, as a result of a reduced blood supply to the brain, which can be earlier signs, but difficult to interpret, which the patient himself does not know how to report accurately. The first signs of carotid stenosis may even be a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) - which occurs when a clot briefly blocks the artery that supplies blood to the brain - such as weakness or numbness on one side of the body, face lying on one side, difficulty speaking and sudden loss of vision in one eye. When faced with these symptoms, it is essential to contact an emergency medical service, as quick care can not only save the person's life, but increase the likelihood of full recovery. The side of the body that is affected by the symptoms gives the doctor very important information about the problem. When carotid stenosis is associated with the left-sided artery, vision loss should occur on the left side and weakness and numbness or drooping face should affect the right side of the body. When carotid stenosis occurs in the right artery, exactly the opposite happens, that is, it is contralateral.",
        "Causes": "Aging is a risk factor for carotid stenosis, and may be increased by other factors, such as: Smoking history;/ High blood pressure;/ High cholesterol and triglycerides;/ Heart disease;/ Diabetes;/ Obesity and sedentary lifestyle;/  Furthermore, the development of atherosclerosis may also be associated with a family history of this problem, as well as a high-fat diet. Those who suffer from coronary artery disease and atherosclerosis in other blood vessels also have a higher risk of carotid stenosis. People who have undergone radiation therapy to treat head and neck cancer may also develop carotid stenosis due to the effects of radiation.",
        "Diagnosis": "Because carotid stenosis may not cause early symptoms, it is important that individuals who are at higher risk are monitored regularly. It is common to diagnose carotid stenosis when trying to diagnose other diseases, such as through an X-ray of the cervical spine. It may also be associated with obstruction in the artery that supplies blood to the retina. The attending physician's assessment includes listening to the heart and some blood vessels with a stethoscope. Certain sounds emitted by the carotid artery may raise suspicions of obstruction due to plaque build-up inside it. In these cases, the patient should be referred to Vascular Surgery, who will conduct a detailed investigation of the symptoms and clinical history and perform the necessary additional assessment. Some tests that may be recommended in the diagnosis of carotid stenosis are: Non-invasive duplex ultrasound of the carotid arteries: this imaging test is the most common for diagnosing carotid stenosis and allows you to check whether there is any narrowing of the arteries (uni or bilateral).;/ Computed tomography (CT scan or CT scan): When it is suspected that the person may have had a stroke or TIA, a CT scan may be prescribed. This exam allows you to obtain 3D images and check for damage to the brain. It may be necessary to inject intravenous contrast.;/ Magnetic resonance angiography: is a type of magnetic resonance imaging that allows you to visualize the carotid arteries and assess the degree of stenosis.;/ Angiogram or angiography: is an invasive procedure that consists of introducing a catheter into the blood vessels through the leg or arm, guided with the help of X-ray equipment. It also includes the use of contrast, injected intravenously. This examination not only allows you to check whether there is narrowing of the arteries, but also to assess the risk of stroke and determine whether treatment is necessary.;/",
        "Treatment": "Treatment for carotid stenosis aims to reduce the risk of stroke and is tailored to the severity of each case. It may include: Medication: Several drugs are usually combined to slow the progression of atheromatosis. These may include, for example, acetylsalicylic acid (or aspirin, which thins the blood) or medications to control blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides and blood sugar.;/ Smoking cessation: stopping smoking is essential in controlling carotid stenosis and preventing stroke and TIA.;/ Surgery: when the degree of narrowing of the artery is severe, in addition to taking medications, surgical treatment may be necessary. Surgical procedures include carotid endarterectomy (removes the plaque that accumulates in the arteries) or carotid angioplasty with stent (through catheterization through the leg or arm, a balloon is inserted that inflates and allows the placement of a flexible metal stent that maintains the open/unobstructed artery).;/  The basis of treatment should also be a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, regular physical exercise and limiting alcohol consumption. Regular monitoring of the patient is very important, allowing, for example, medication adjustments and assessment of disease progression, even after surgical treatment.",
        "Prevention": "There are several strategies that can be put into practice not only to prevent, but also to slow the progression of carotid stenosis, thus reducing the risk of stroke: No smoking.;/ Maintain a healthy weight. Being overweight contributes to other risk factors for carotid stenosis, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, sleep apnea, and cardiovascular disease.;/ Regularly exercising: increases HDL cholesterol levels (the \"good\" cholesterol), lowers blood pressure levels and improves cardiovascular health in general.;/ Eat fruits and vegetables: they are rich in nutrients such as potassium, antioxidants and folic acid, which reduce the risk of stroke and TIA.;/ Moderate your intake of saturated fat, thus helping to reduce the build-up of plaque in the arteries.;/ Limit salt to control blood pressure levels.;/ Limit alcohol consumption.;/ Keep chronic illnesses, such as diabetes and high blood pressure, under control.;/ American Association of Neurological Surgeons, janeiro de 2022 Cleveland Clinic, January 2022 Mayo Clinic, January 2022 Society for Vascular Surgery, janeiro de 2022 About us;/ Events;/ Clients and Companions;/ News;/ CUF Academic Center;/ Partnerships;/ Contacts;/ Frequently Asked Questions;/ Join us;/ Virtual Visit;/ English version;/ My CUF;/ Access Solutions and Health Plans;/ Facebook;/ Facebook Instagram;/ Instagram LinkedInCreated with Sketch.;/ LinkedIn Youtube;/ Youtube award4;/ award4 certification1;/ certification1 certification2;/ certification2 certification3;/ certification3 Complaints and compliments;/ Complaints and compliments Privacy and Cookies Policy;/ Terms and Conditions;/ Whistleblower Channel;/ \u00a9 CUF 2024 All rights reserved Start;/ Health A-Z: Diseases, Symptoms and Treatments;/"

    "Lumbar stenosis": {
        "What is it?": "Lumbar stenosis consists of a narrowing of the spinal canal, compromising the spinal cord and/or nerve roots. In most cases, it occurs as a result of a natural aging process of the spine that leads to bulging of the intervertebral discs, hypertrophy of the intervertebral joints and thickening of the ligaments, resulting in a decrease in the diameter of the spinal canal.",
        "Symptoms": "Lumbar stenosis is manifested by pain or decreased strength in the lower limbs that worsens when standing or walking and is relieved by sitting, leaning forward or lying down. Symptoms are typically more evident when descending than when ascending inclines. Unlike herniated discs, which can appear acutely, lumbar stenosis begins insidiously, worsening as the degenerative process progresses, and may only manifest itself when the narrowing is already particularly significant.",
        "Diagnosis": "X-ray allows an initial assessment of the spine and the definitive diagnosis is given by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and alternatively or complementary to Computerized Axial Tomography (CT).",
        "Treatment": "Conservative, non-surgical treatment is successful in some patients and may be attempted initially. Treatment options include anti-inflammatory and analgesic medications, oral corticosteroids, orthoses and physiotherapy. In selected cases, epidural injections (interlaminar or transforaminal) may provide lasting symptomatic relief. Due to the nature of the disease and the degree of spinal canal involvement, conservative treatment tends to be less successful than for disc herniation. Surgical treatment (laminectomy, laminotomy and/or foraminectomy) involves removing the bone, ligaments and intervertebral disc that contribute to the stenosis, decompressing the nerve structures. In cases of instability, it may be necessary to promote intervertebral fusion using bone grafts, screws and metal bars. These procedures can be performed using conventional or minimally invasive techniques. Back pain and injuries are complex and debilitating conditions. Less invasive surgical techniques allow for better treatment of the patient and facilitate recovery. When we use our cell phones, we tend to adopt a posture where we are looking down. It's called \"SMS neck\". Find out what it is and how to prevent it.

    "Urethral strictures": {
        "What is it?": "Urethral strictures or squeezing are a narrowing of the caliber of the urethra. This problem can greatly affect men's quality of life. Patients complain of difficulty urinating, sometimes requiring straining, with a weak urinary stream. In the most serious cases, the patient is unable to completely empty the bladder or is even experiencing urinary retention requiring the placement of a probe or catheter (through the urethra or in the suprapubic region, below the navel). There is a small difference in nomenclature regarding this pathology. When the scar involves the bladder neck it is called neck contracture, in the prostatic and membranous urethra (sphincter) it is called urethral stricture. When it involves the remaining urethra, it is called urethral tightness.",
        "Symptoms": "These tightness are formed by a scar that replaces the normal tissue (urethra and corpus spongiosum, that is, a very vascularized tissue that surrounds most of the urethra). These scars result from attacks such as inflammation, infections (e.g. urethritis) or a disease called Lichen Sclerosus (formerly known as Xerotic Balanitis) or trauma such as severe pelvis fractures or local interventions or procedures (e.g. catheterizations, surgeries through the urethra or urethra surgeries). ).",
        "Diagnosis": "Your doctor/urologist will take a detailed history to try to determine what may have caused the urethra to tighten. During the physical exam, he or she will try to look for the urethra scar, if there are signs of urinary retention (full and palpable bladder) or if there are signs of tightness of the meatus (urine exit hole) or Lichen Sclerosus disease. The tests that can be performed are: Uroflowmetry (the patient urinates into a specific device, with a type of funnel, which evaluates the strength of the urinary stream and the time it takes the patient to urinate, allowing conclusions to be drawn about the existence of obstructions caused by the prostate/cervix bladder or tightness of the urethra);/ Urethrocystoscopy (endoscopic examination with a lens that enters the urethra and allows visualization of the site of the stricture and assessment of whether the stricture is partial or complete, but often does not allow correct assessment of the length or extent of this stricture);/ Retrograde and pervoiding urethrography (this is the most important examination, it consists of taking several x-rays of the urethra, with injection of a product through the urethra, and allows the length and degree of tightness of the urethra to be assessed).;/",
        "Treatment": "There are no pills that can solve this problem. Traditionally, treatments involved dilating or cutting the urethra (internal urethrotomies). Although these treatments are still used today, in some cases the long-term success rate is low, ranging from 0-9% after 3 years. Currently, the recommended treatment for most of these problems is urethroplasty. Urethroplasty may consist of excision of the diseased urethral segment and primary anastomosis (i.e., joining the ends of the urethra with sutures) or urethroplasty using grafts or flaps. Urethroplasty techniques offer the greatest probability of long-term treatment effectiveness (85-90% for simple cases and 80% for complex cases). Urethroplasty with excision and primary anastomosis This technique is only used in the bulbar urethra and for tightness less than 2 cm in length. It is 86% effective at 15 years. This surgery has been practiced for many years but, more recently, some disadvantages that may arise with this technique have been highlighted, such as: ejaculation problems;/ decreased sensitivity of the glans or \"cold glans\";/ shortening of the penis or downward bending of the penis (cord\u00e9);/ impotence (1%);/ Therefore, many urologists argue that even in these cases, a urethroplasty with graft should be performed. Urethroplasty with grafts or flaps In these techniques, the diseased segment is not excised. Instead, local tissue or tissue taken from another part of the body is used to increase the caliber of the urethra. Flap urethroplasties involve the use of local skin (usually from the penis or foreskin) and are only used for urethral strictures. They are less commonly used today, mainly due to the disadvantage of frequently causing urethral bulges or pouches (urethral diverticula) in the urethra, which can be uncomfortable and cause other problems such as infections. The skin may also contain hairs that remain inside the \"new urethra\", causing discomfort or facilitating infections. Buccal mucosa urethroplasties have become the most widely used technique because they can be applied to almost all types of urethral strictures and locations without causing the problems that other techniques present. Buccal mucosa (tissue taken from the inner side of the cheek) is the body tissue that is best suited for plastic reconstructive surgeries for urethral strictures. Finally, most surgeries to repair tightness of the urethra can be performed in a single surgery (1 stage), however there are more complex situations in which it is necessary to perform the surgery in 2 stages. In the first surgery, the diseased urethra is left open (with or without replacement of the diseased tissue) and in a second surgery, a few months later, it is closed, that is, the urethra is transformed back into a normal-caliber tube. Many patients repeatedly undergo dilations or internal urethrotomies (internal cuts of the urethra). We currently know that this practice only temporarily alleviates the symptoms of urinary obstruction, because tightness often forms again with a greater degree of scarring and stenosis, thus worsening the results of urethral reconstructive surgery.

    "Electroacoustic stimulation": {
        "What is it?": "Current hearing aids are very effective in rehabilitating individuals with mild to moderate deafness. By amplifying the sound and sending it through the ear canal, you obtain a good perception of sounds, especially sounds with low frequencies (frequencies essential in musical perception). In more severe deafness, the effectiveness of these devices is lower, especially at high frequencies, which are essential for discriminating the human voice. Cochlear implants through electrical stimulation of the cochlea obtain excellent results in patients with severe to profound deafness, providing auditory sensation even at high frequencies. We speak of electroacoustic stimulation when a hearing aid and a cochlear implant are used simultaneously in the same ear.",
        "How do they work?": "Like cochlear implants, these devices consist of two components. The internal, implantable component is practically identical to that of a \"traditional\" cochlear implant, however the electrodes are softer and shorter so as not to traumatize the sensory cells of the cochlea, especially those at the apex, responsible for the perception of lower sounds.;/ The external component has an external microphone that captures ambient sound and provides it to two separate processors;/ One of the processors will process the lowest frequencies of sounds and amplify them, stimulating the auditory pathway, in a similar way to a conventional prosthesis. The second processor will process the higher frequency sounds and send this information to the internal component, just like in a cochlear implant.",
        "Indications": "Individuals with severe to profound deafness in high frequencies, who do not benefit from the use of conventional hearing aids in discriminating human speech, but with mild to moderate deafness in lower frequencies, in which hearing aids are still quite effective.",
        "Contraindications": "In addition to situations that contraindicate cochlear implant surgery (for example, significant malformation or calcification of the cochlea) and the use of hearing aids (for example, pathology of the outer ear), these devices are not indicated in situations of progressive deafness in which it is anticipated that there will be a loss in low frequencies that cannot be rehabilitated by sound amplification.",
        "Surgery": "The steps and duration of the surgery are identical to those described in cochlear implant surgery. The execution of a minimally traumatic surgical technique is essential in preserving hearing of low frequencies after the introduction of electrodes into the cochlea.  Listening to music too loudly can damage your ears, but the type of headphones and time spent using them can also affect your hearing. Find out how. The answer is no.

    "Muscle strains and tears": {
        "What is it?": "Muscle injuries are among the most common in sports, affecting amateur and professional athletes. They often result from a process of muscle fatigue, especially in long-distance runners. Muscle injuries resulting from sports activities may depend on intrinsic factors, related to individual and biological characteristics, and extrinsic factors, related to the environment (running surface, sports equipment, weather conditions, etc.). Long-distance running tends to cause intrinsic injuries, such as tendinopathies, bursitis, fasciitis, stress fractures and muscle injuries. Muscle injuries affect runners mainly during sprint training. Competitive athletes may be more prone to this type of injury due to the high intensity of their training. Muscle strain is a common indirect injury among runners. It results from excessive stretching of muscle fibers beyond their normal working capacity, resulting from intense cycles of contraction and relaxation of the muscle involved. The hamstrings, calf muscles, inner thigh muscles and anterior thigh muscles are most susceptible to this injury, also known as a muscle strain. Strains tend to occur at the junction between the muscle and tendon, which is the area of \u200b\u200bleast resistance in the muscle, or at the insertion of the tendon into the bone. However, they can occur in other locations. The classification of muscle injuries has varied over time and is generally based on the severity of the injury, the amount of tissue affected and the functional loss. Thus, 3 categories are considered: grade 1, where there is no appreciable muscle injury; grade 2 with muscle injury and reduction in muscle strength; grade 3, with complete rupture and total loss of function of the affected muscle. As such, it makes sense to jointly address these different injuries that correspond to different degrees of the same traumatic process.",
        "Symptoms": "The most characteristic symptom is intense muscle pain, followed by impairment of muscle function to the point of requiring interruption of activity. As mentioned, strains can be classified according to the size of the injury, with symptoms being different in each case: Grade I \u2013 stretching of a small number of muscle fibers (<5% of the muscle). Pain occurs at a specific point, occurs during muscle contraction against resistance, and may be absent during rest. Swelling may be present but is generally not evident. There is minimal structural damage, bleeding is minor, resolution is rapid, and functional limitation is mild. The prognosis is good, and fiber restoration is relatively rapid.;/ Grade II \u2013 the number of injured fibers and the severity of the injury are greater (> 5 and < 50% of the muscle), with the same characteristics as the first-degree injury, but with greater intensity. It is accompanied by pain, moderate hemorrhage, a more pronounced local inflammatory process and reduced muscle function. Resolution is slower.;/ Grade III - complete rupture of the muscle or a large part of it (> 50% of the muscle) occurs, resulting in significant loss of function with the presence of a palpable defect. Pain can range from moderate to very intense, caused by passive muscle contraction. Swelling and bleeding are significant.;/ A complete rupture is very rare, with subtotal ruptures being more common.",
        "Causes": "Factors such as muscle fatigue and the presence of previous injuries must be considered in preventing muscle strains and tears. There are several risk factors for these injuries: flexibility deficiencies, strength imbalances between muscles with opposing actions (agonists and antagonists), old muscle injuries, nutritional and hormonal disorders, infections, factors related to training, poor coordination of movements, incorrect technique, muscle overload and fatigue, poor posture during training, discrepancy in the length of the lower limbs, decreased range of motion and insufficient initial warm-up before exercising. A proper warm-up is essential because it stimulates the production of synovial fluid by the synovial membranes (joint lining). This fluid lubricates and nourishes the joint cartilage. A 10-minute warm-up increases the production of this fluid by 13%.",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis is essentially clinical, and is complemented by ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography. As a rule, it is recommended to begin the diagnosis with a detailed history of the occurrence, followed by a thorough medical observation. When muscle structure injury is suspected, magnetic resonance imaging is very important, as it allows us to observe the pattern and extent of the injury, as well as the degree of tendon involvement.",
        "Treatment": "Applying ice to the affected area for 10 to 15 minute cycles, using a bag wrapped in thin fabric to protect the skin, and applying compression to the affected area are important treatment measures. The limb should remain elevated and at rest, and the period of immobilization should be as short as possible to avoid loss of muscle strength and movement sensitivity. Analgesics are useful and anti-inflammatories should be used with caution because they can compromise the tissue repair mechanism. All of these gestures, which aim to reduce pain and control swelling, can be applied in the first 24-48 hours. After this period, physiotherapy is used, which may include the use of ultrasound to help tissue regeneration. Around the third week, exercises should be started to recover muscle strength and range of motion of the joints involved. Surgical intervention is necessary in patients with large intramuscular hematomas, injuries or complete ruptures (grade III) and partial injuries in which more than half of the muscle is ruptured. Surgical intervention may also be considered if the patient complains of persistent pain for more than four to six months, particularly if there is an extension deficit. After surgical repair, the muscle should be protected by an elastic band around the limb in order to promote relative immobility and compression. The duration of immobilization naturally depends on the severity of the trauma. If the muscle failure is very extensive, the denervated portion can generate permanent neurological deficit with consequent muscle atrophy. In these circumstances, surgery increases the chances of reinnervation and the development of thick scar tissue can be avoided.",
        "Prevention": "Prevention measures are important for both children and adults who engage in sports. In fact, children are at greater risk of injury but these injuries tend to be more serious in adults. As a general rule of thumb, warming up is crucial at any age, as is the use of appropriate equipment. The activity level should be increased gradually and the whole body should be exercised, which helps to avoid muscle injuries and improve endurance, strength and flexibility. Individual endurance limits must be respected, and it is dangerous to try to exceed them. It is important not to practice sports when you are ill or weak. Learning and correctly applying specific techniques for each sport helps to minimize the occurrence of injuries. Adopting healthy eating habits and maintaining a healthy weight are essential in this area as in all others.

    "Stomatitis": {
        "What is it?": "Stomatitis is a general term used for situations in which inflammation occurs in the mouth - namely in the mucous membranes (the skin that lines the inside of the mouth) -, possibly associated with pain, which can impair the normal ability to eat, speak and sleep. Stomatitis can occur anywhere in the mouth, including: Inside of the cheeks;/ Gums;/ Language;/ Lips;/ Palate (roof of the mouth);/  The lesions (or ulcers) that appear in stomatitis can be single or multiple.  There are several types of stomatitis, the two most common being: Aphthous stomatitis: A cold sore, also known as an aphthous ulcer, is a single pale or yellow lesion with a red border. It is possible to develop just one cold sore or a set of them. The most common places for its appearance are the inside of the lips or cheek and the tongue. These lesions usually disappear after 4-14 days. In more serious situations (corresponding to approximately one in ten cases of stomatitis), the lesions can last up to six weeks.;/ Herpetic stomatitis: cold sores correspond to small blisters filled with liquid, associated with pain and burning, that appear on the lips or in the surrounding region. Situations in which herpes forms on the gums or roof of the mouth are rare. Before the herpes goes from blisters to sores, with the formation of a scab, symptoms such as tingling, sensitivity or even burning appear. Cold sores are very contagious.;/  In addition to these two, there are other types of stomatitis, such as prosthetic stomatitis, a common problem in those who use removable dental prostheses.",
        "Symptoms of stomatitis": "Symptoms of stomatitis may include: Dor;/ Stings;/ Mouth ulcers, with a white or yellow coating and a red rim, which may appear on the inside of the lips, cheeks or tongue;/ Bubbles;/ Swelling;/ Red spots;/ Oral dysesthesia (burning sensation in the mouth);/ Lesions that heal after 4-14 days and tend to recur;/  In the specific case of aphthous stomatitis, the lesions may be associated with pain, but rarely with fever, manifesting for 5-10 days. In herpetic stomatitis, the lesions usually cause pain and last an average of 7-10 days. They are sometimes associated with cold or flu-like symptoms.",
        "Causes": "There are several factors that can cause stomatitis, and they can even overlap. Identifying the cause is important, as it will allow the disease to be treated more appropriately and effectively. The most common causes are: Infection;/ Injuries;/ Trauma resulting from the use of orthodontic prostheses or dental braces, from biting the inside of the cheek, tongue or lip, or from surgery;/ Allergies;/ Skin diseases;/ Fungal infection;/ Viral infection, such as herpes;/ Chemotherapy and radiotherapy;/ Any health problem associated with xerostomia or dry mouth;/ Smoking or chewing tobacco;/  There are, however, many other possible causes, such as: Stress;/ Burns caused by ingesting very hot food or drinks;/ Nutritional deficiencies;/ Bacterial infections;/ Immune system problems, such as immunosuppression or autoimmune diseases;/ Sexually transmitted infections;/ Irritation from harsh chemicals;/ Allergic reactions;/ Some diseases, such as lupus, Crohn's disease, and Beh\u00e7et's disease;/ Some medications, such as certain types of antibiotics and antiepileptics;/ Eating certain foods - i.e. potatoes, citrus fruits, cheese, nuts, coffee and chocolate - can also promote the development of canker sores.",
        "Diagnosis": "Clinical observation is the basis for diagnosing stomatitis. By examining the appearance and distribution of the lesions, the doctor can gather a lot of information about the stomatitis and the specific case he is dealing with. Collecting the patient's clinical history is another important step in diagnosing stomatitis and may include some questions about, for example, when the symptoms appeared, the severity of the pain, medications they have taken previously, sexual activity, whether they are a smoker, among others. Additionally, some tests that may be included in the diagnosis of stomatitis are: Collection of bacterial or viral exudate;/ Tissue samples or fungal infections;/ Biopsies;/ Blood tests;/ Allergy testing;/ There are other health problems that can cause stomatitis, hence the importance of making a correct diagnosis and consequently receiving appropriate treatment.",
        "Treatment of stomatitis": "Normally, lesions caused by stomatitis disappear after about two weeks, even without treatment. The cause of stomatitis - whether an allergic reaction, infection, disease or even nutritional deficiency - will dictate the therapeutic strategy. If the attending physician is unable to identify the cause of stomatitis, treatment may be symptomatic, with the aim of relieving symptoms. Stomatitis can be treated topically, with direct application to the skin to relieve symptoms such as pain and to speed up recovery. Topical treatments may include, for example, corticosteroids (these aim to eliminate symptoms so that the person can eat and talk without feeling pain or discomfort); antibiotics (which combat the infection with anti-inflammatory and antibiotic properties); and anaesthetics (for temporary pain relief). Protective films may also be applied to the lesion. Other strategies that can help relieve pain and inflammation caused by injuries to the mouth involve: Avoid hot foods and drinks;/ Avoid salty, spicy and citrus-based foods;/ Taking painkillers, such as ibuprofen (it is an anti-inflammatory);/ Gargle with cold water if there is a burn in your mouth.;/  In the case of aphthous stomatitis, some gestures that can contribute to relieving symptoms are: Practice good dental care;/ Drink more water;/ Gargle with salt water;/  If canker sores appear frequently, their origin may be due to nutritional deficiencies, for example, of folic acid or vitamin B12. To rule out this cause, the attending physician may prescribe specific tests. In the case of herpetic stomatitis, applying ice to the lesion can help.  Attention! Not all injuries are harmless, so the patient should make an appointment with their doctor if the mouth sores do not heal after two weeks.",
        "Prevention": "There are some measures that can be put into practice in order to prevent the reappearance of stomatitis, such as using a soft toothbrush, rinsing the mouth with an antiseptic and alcohol-free mouthwash, treating chronic dry mouth, adopting a healthy diet, maintaining Stay well hydrated and visit the dentist regularly.

    "Strabismus": {
        "What is it?": "Strabismus is a condition in which the eyes do not align properly. One eye can be rotated in, up, down, or out, while the other focuses on another point. It can occur continuously or intermittently. Under normal conditions, the six muscles that control eye movement work together to point both eyes in the same direction. Patients with strabismus have problems controlling eye movements and cannot maintain normal eye alignment. As a result, both eyes cannot look at the same place at the same time. It may also be related to a disorder in the brain that means the eyes cannot coordinate properly. This condition makes binocular vision impossible, so it is difficult for the patient to have depth perception. Strabismus can be classified by the direction of the misaligned eye: Inward (esotropia);/ Outward (exotropia);/ For summit (hypertropia);/ Downward (hypotropia);/",
        "Symptoms": "The eyes are misaligned, directed towards opposite directions, and this pathology is related to the contraction and relaxation of the muscles. Strabismus can be divergent or convergent.",
        "Causes": "Its origin may be: Congenital;/ Hereditary;/ Result of a disease;/ Due to cranial nerve injury;/ Other problems that can also lead to strabismus include: Myopia;/ Hyperopia;/ Astigmatism;/ Refractive error;/ Hydrocephalus;/ Some viral infections, such as measles;/ Noonan syndrome;/ Genetic conditions;/",
        "Diagnosis": "All babies over four months of age who appear to have strabismus should have a complete exam with a pediatric ophthalmologist. This includes: Patient's medical history;/ Family history;/ General health problems;/ Medications in use;/ Visual acuity examination;/ Refraction exam;/ Alignment and focus tests;;/ Examination after dilation of the pupils to determine the health of the internal ocular structures;/",
        "Treatment": "To correct the strabismus, a surgical technique is required, which is performed under general anesthesia and the patient must remain hospitalized for 24 hours. The surgery consists of changing the position of the muscles or shortening them depending on the type of strabismus. The average time for the procedure is 30 minutes for small deviations and 40 to 50 minutes for larger deviations. In general, there is no need to wear an occlusive dressing.",

    "Strabismus in children": {
        "What is it?": "Strabismus is a visual defect that consists of the loss of ocular alignment or parallelism, so that each eye points in a different direction. In some cases, one eye is dominant and only the other deviates, but there may also be alternation, that is, when the right eye is fixed, the left eye is deviated, and when the left eye is fixed, the right eye is deviated. Strabismus can be horizontal, convergent if the deviation is inward and divergent if the deviation is outward, or vertical if the deviated eye is pointing up or down. There are more complex situations, with associated disorders, each with its own clinical characteristics, age of onset, treatment and prognosis. It is a situation that affects around 3 to 4% of children, and its exact incidence in Portugal is not known. Congenital or infantile strabismus appears before 6 months of age. There are other forms that appear later, including in adulthood.",
        "Symptoms": "In children, there are often no symptoms and the deviation itself is the only sign present. One of the consequences of strabismus is diplopia or double image. To avoid seeing double, the child's brain eliminates the image of one of the eyes (suppression). When there is a deviated eye this is the least used which, over time, leads to lazy or amblyopic eye (see amblyopathy). We should suspect strabismus when the child closes one eye to the light or has a bad head posture, signs that indicate an adaptation of the brain to avoid the double image. Another characteristic is the loss of binocular vision, that is, the ability to see in 3 dimensions, notion of depth and distances between objects. It is also important to take into account the psychological and social impact that strabismus has, not only for the child but also for their parents.",
        "Causes": "\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bWhy does it arise? It is our brain that controls eye alignment. Its poor control can lead to the appearance of strabismus, which is often precipitated by several factors, in particular states of weakness, such as illness, tiredness or stress. Its onset is generally intermittent and in some cases becomes constant. Association with refractive errors, the most common being hyperopia.;/ Severe decrease in vision in one eye that leads to its deviation (cataract, retinal disease or other eye diseases).;/ Unknown causes as in the case of congenital or infantile endotropia.;/",
        "Treatment": "A complete ophthalmological evaluation should be carried out for a child with strabismus. Once the diagnosis has been confirmed, the causes should first be treated. The primary objective is to restore visual function. Optical correction of associated refractive errors. Correct use of glasses;/ This alone can lead to ocular alignment and deviation control. Treatment of amblyopia when present, usually with occlusion of the good eye;/ or other method of penalty (see amblyopia). Treatment of other causes such as congenital cataract surgery.;/ These treatments may need to be combined, as in the case of congenital cataracts, which require surgery, optical correction and treatment of amblyopia. If the ocular deviation persists, surgical correction will be indicated. Surgery Strabismus surgery is based on intervention of the oculomotor muscles responsible for eyeball movements. It may be necessary to operate on 2 or more muscles, in one or both eyes. The techniques used consist of strengthening or weakening the muscles responsible for the deviation. It is performed under general anesthesia and may be performed on an outpatient basis or require an overnight hospital stay.",
        "Prevention": "Strabismus cannot be prevented, but some of its causes can. It is important to correct significant refractive errors, treat amblyopia and treat other causes that can lead to strabismus. All children should be evaluated at an initial ophthalmology consultation before from 3 years of age, or earlier if there are risk factors. If strabismus is suspected, its diagnosis must be confirmed as early as possible and treated as appropriate for each case. For many children, spending more time at home has meant spending more time in front of screens. Learn how to protect your child's eyes.

        "What is it?": "The sleep trace, obtained during the polygraphic sleep study, consists of the simultaneous recording of several parameters during sleep using an appropriate device.  This study can be performed in the Sleep Laboratory where the patient sleeps or it can be performed at home to study sleep apnea and snoring. In this case, the examination is less uncomfortable and less expensive.  During this study, brain waves, blood oxygen levels, heart and breathing rates, eye and limb movements during sleep, and snoring are recorded.",
        "Advantages and benefits": "Sleep studies help diagnose sleep disorders and also allow the treatment plan to be adjusted in order to obtain the best results.",
        "Methodology": "In the afternoon and evening before obtaining the tracing, it is important not to consume alcohol or caffeinated drinks that can affect your sleep pattern.  On the day of the study, it is important not to sleep after 6:00 am. You should have dinner and take your medications as usual and bring comfortable clothes.  Various types of sensors will be placed on the scalp, in the lower chest, a cannula between the nose and mouth, a sensor on a finger to measure oxygen levels and sensors on the legs. These sensors are connected to a computer.  The data obtained will be processed electronically and interpreted by the doctor who will prepare the examination report.  The room where the study is performed is similar to a hotel room, quiet and private. It has a video and sound system so that technicians can monitor what is happening during the examination.  In general, it is important that the test is performed overnight to obtain reliable results. Although it is normal for the patient to take longer to fall asleep and not sleep as well, this will not affect the results.",
        "Indications": "Sleep tracing is indicated in cases of frequent daytime sleepiness, difficulty staying awake during important tasks such as driving, loud snoring, suspected respiratory arrest (apnea) or obesity associated with sleep difficulties.  It is also indicated for disorders with periodic movement of the lower limbs, narcolepsy (violent sleep attacks during the day), chronic insomnia or any anomalous behavior during sleep.",

The sports medical examination should not be seen as a mere response to a bureaucratic-legal requirement, but rather as a medical act full of value and interest. In fact, the main objective of the sports medical examination is the detection of conditions that may pose a risk of sudden death and diseases that may worsen with exertion. Within this framework, the sports medical examination becomes mandatory, in all situations and for all sports practitioners, referees, judges and timekeepers affiliated or wishing to join federations with public sporting utility.",

Stones are solid formations of mineral salts and other substances such as calcium oxalate and uric acid, commonly called \u201cstones\u201d. There are stones that pass spontaneously, without causing damage or infection, and therefore do not pose any threat to health. On the other hand, those that obstruct the urinary system, cause pain, compromise kidney function and predispose to infections, pose a threat to health and should therefore be treated immediately. Many people eliminate urinary stones without even knowing they exist.",
        "Symptoms": "Stones can lodge in any part of the urinary tract, causing obstruction, infection and pain. Regardless of the type of stone, the consequences are essentially the same: pain, obstruction and tissue trauma with secondary bleeding and infection.  The most characteristic symptom of kidney and ureteral stones is intense or localized pain with sudden onset. Depending on the location of the stone, the pain may be called renal colic or ureteral colic. Renal colic originates deep in the lumbar region, radiating laterally and inferiorly towards the testicle in men and the bladder in women. Ureteral colic radiates to the thigh. When the pain is intense, nausea, vomiting, paleness, sweating, anxiety and urinary urgency generally occur.  The pain varies from minutes to days and can be quite resistant to analgesics. It may be intermittent, which means calculation migration. As the stone migrates and starts to occupy a new place of obstruction, the pain returns, disappearing when the stone reaches the bladder.  The pain caused by kidney stones is not always intense and cramp-like. It can also be an uncomfortable sensation like burning or heaviness.",

        "What is it?": "Fatigue can be described as a lack of energy and motivation, both physical and mental. It can affect virtually anyone in a temporary way. In these cases, it is simple to identify the cause and treat or resolve it. Chronic fatigue tends to be long-lasting and deeper, in addition to affecting all aspects of people's lives, with an important impact on the emotional and psychological areas. It is important not to confuse fatigue with drowsiness, although the former may be accompanied by a desire to sleep. In the chronic case, in addition to sleep, there is a lack of motivation to do anything. This disorder is often a symptom of a medical problem that must be diagnosed and treated. In most cases, its origin lies in one or more habits or routines that can be identified and modified. Although it is difficult to assess how many people suffer from chronic fatigue or fibromyalgia, it is known to affect approximately 2% to 8% of the adult population. Among them, 80% to 90% are women aged between 30 and 50 years.",
        "Symptoms": "From a feeling of weakness to constant tiredness or lack of energy. If the cause is an organic disease (lung, heart, anemia), the characteristic symptoms of these diseases also appear, making the diagnosis easier. In fact, fatigue should always be considered and evaluated in the context of the patient as a whole.",
        "Causes": "It would be impossible to list all the potential causes of fatigue. However, identifying its origin is an essential step in addressing and treating it. It can be caused by lifestyle factors such as excessive alcohol or caffeine consumption, excessive physical activity or, conversely, inactivity, lack of sleep, certain medications (antihistamines, cough suppressants, blood pressure medications, antidepressants) and poor eating habits. It is also believed to result from a psychological condition such as anxiety, depression, grief or stress. With regard to organic diseases, some of those most associated with fatigue are liver failure, anemia, cancer, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary emphysema, thyroid disease, obesity, sleep apnea and diabetes.",
        "Diagnosis": "There is no standard diagnosis for fatigue. It is necessary to take a detailed clinical history of the patient and, whenever necessary, perform additional diagnostic tests depending on each case.",
        "Treatment": "As it is almost always a symptom of an underlying medical condition, its treatment involves diagnosing and addressing that underlying condition, whether physical, psychological or mixed. The time it takes to recover from fatigue after treatment of the underlying condition varies significantly. In some cases, it can be almost immediate, as is the case with anemia, while in others it can take weeks, as is the case with some viral infections.",

It is one of the main reasons for consultation in General Medicine. Although most of the time its origin is an infection, only around 20% of cases justify treatment with antibiotics, as is the case with streptococcal pharyngitis.",

The mucous membrane lining the throat may become infected and covered with a white membrane or pus. Fever and swollen lymph nodes in the neck may also occur. Pharyngitis can become complicated, causing ear infections, sinusitis or abscesses around the tonsils.",
        "Causes": "It results from inflammation and swelling of the back of the throat (pharynx), located between the tonsils and the larynx. Most are caused by viral infections, such as respiratory viruses or the mononucleosis virus. Bacteria such as Streptococcus or those responsible for sexually transmitted diseases such as gonorrhea can also cause pharyngitis. It is more common in the cold months, being contagious within the family and those closest to us. The most common routes of transmission are hand contact with infected nasal secretions. Its symptoms tend to develop after a short incubation period of one to three days.",
        "Diagnosis": "Medical examination, in many cases, allows the diagnosis of pharyngitis to be made. In others, it is recommended that throat exudate be collected and sent to the laboratory in order to identify its origin. Blood tests may also be requested, which may detect, for example, a high white blood cell count, suggestive of an inflammatory and/or infectious process.",
        "Treatment": "Symptoms can be relieved by using painkillers, throat lozenges, or gargling warm salt water. Children or adolescents under 18 should not be given aspirin because it can cause Reye's syndrome, which is a rapidly progressing and often fatal disease that affects the brain and liver. Antibiotics are of no interest if the infection is viral and are therefore not administered until laboratory tests have confirmed a diagnosis of bacterial pharyngitis. If tests indicate that it is caused by a streptococcal infection, the most recommended antibiotic is penicillin. If you are allergic to it, there are alternatives such as erythromycin.",
        "Prevention": "The viral and bacterial microorganisms that cause pharyngitis are contagious.

It is not very elastic and plays an important role in maintaining the arch of the foot during walking and stance. Plantar fasciitis is defined by painful retraction of the plantar fascia with increased curvature.",
        "Symptoms": "The typical symptom is plantar pain in the heel, especially with the first steps in the morning or after sitting for some time. The pain progressively improves with walking, intensifying again at the end of the day.",
        "Causes": "Plantar fasciitis doesn\u2019t necessarily have just one cause. Several risk factors can increase a person\u2019s likelihood of developing this condition. These include: Age - most common between 40 and 60 years old;/ exercises such as running, with repeated impact on the plantar fascia;/ Flat feet (commonly called flat feet), high curvature of the feet, or tightness of the calf (also called calf) muscles;/ Overweight, obesity or pregnancy;/ Arthritis;/ Standing for long periods of time, often in high-heeled shoes;/ Women are more likely than men to suffer from this condition either through pregnancy or through wearing inappropriate footwear.",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis is essentially clinical, however simple radiography under load, ultrasound and Magnetic Resonance Imaging are important means to aid the diagnosis, providing information about the state of the plantar fascia and surrounding structures.",
        "Treatment": "The most effective treatment is rest and relief from the weight on the feet. Most cases are treated with non-surgical medical treatments, with surgery reserved for situations in which, despite treatment, satisfactory results are not obtained after one year of the onset of symptoms. These include: Use of orthotic devices such as adapted shoes, padded insoles and heel supports.;/ Night splint: People usually sleep with their feet relaxed and pointing down. In this position, the heel relaxes, contracting the plantar fascia and calf muscles, which increases pain in the curvature of the foot. Wearing a night splint keeps the foot in flexion, reducing muscle and fascia tension.;/ Physical therapy can help stretch muscles to improve range of motion, reduce pain and inflammation, and aid healing.;/ Anti-inflammatory treatment with corticosteroids on the fascia can reduce pain and inflammation.;/ The vast majority (about 80-90%) of patients will improve with this medical treatment over a period of months. If none of these treatments are effective, your doctor may recommend surgery. Although this is a low-risk surgery, complications such as pain or nerve damage can occur in some cases. There are two main options: Gastrocnemius muscle recession allows the calf muscles to be lengthened, increasing the range of motion in the ankle and reducing stress on the plantar fascia. This is a minimally invasive surgery that can reduce recovery time.;/ Fasciectomy involves cutting the fascia to reduce its tension.

    "Yellow fever": {
        "What is it?": "It is a viral hemorrhagic disease with high mortality, transmitted, like dengue, by the bite of disinfected Aedes mosquitoes. The name yellow fever results from the color that the skin and eyes acquire in the most serious situations, due to jaundice. It is estimated that this disease currently affects around 200,000 people and causes 30,000 deaths per year, of which around 90% occur in Africa. The areas at risk are the tropical regions of this continent and South America. Epidemics occur frequently and can infect more than 20% of the unvaccinated population. Some cases of yellow fever have been recorded in countries in North America and Europe. These are generally small in number and result from importation from the territories where it is most prevalent.",
        "Symptoms": "The manifestations are very varied, which makes early identification difficult. There are cases where there are no symptoms and, in others, it can present as a generalized organic dysfunction. The initial phase is characterised by flu-like symptoms, with high fever, headaches, muscle pain, loss of appetite and nausea/vomiting. Flu-like symptoms predominate for four or five days, disappearing spontaneously in most people. In around 15% of cases, there is progression to a toxic phase, with high mortality, characterised by multi-organ dysfunction (mainly liver and kidneys), widespread haemorrhage and absence of urination. In general, symptoms appear three to six days after being bitten by an infected mosquito. In a small number of individuals, the infection progresses to multi-organ failure, with jaundice and liver failure, haemorrhages, kidney failure, changes in consciousness, convulsions, coma and death. In the most severe cases, mortality can be over 50%.",
        "Causes": "Yellow fever is transmitted by certain species of mosquitoes. Infection occurs when an unprotected person is bitten. Once infected with the virus, it can be a source of infection for other mosquitoes before symptoms appear. This insect becomes capable of transmitting the virus nine to 12 days after biting an infected individual.",
        "Diagnosis": "Clinical diagnosis is difficult because its symptoms can be similar to those of other diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever, dengue fever or other forms of hemorrhagic fever. Medical history provides clues, especially if travel to higher risk areas has occurred. Blood tests allow you to accurately confirm the diagnosis.",
        "Treatment": "There is no specific treatment for this disease - however, there is an effective vaccine to prevent infection. General measures to reduce exposure to mosquitoes (repellent, mosquito nets) are also recommended. As a rule, these patients must be hospitalized in order to receive supportive treatment. This involves rest, fluid replacement, fever and pain control. It is important that they are also protected from additional bites in order to stop the transmission cycle and reduce the risk of infecting other people. Medications such as aspirin that increase the risk of bleeding should be avoided.",
        "Prevention": "There is a very effective vaccine for preventing yellow fever. It consists of a live, attenuated virus and is safe and effective over the next 10 years in more than 95% of cases. The WHO recommends vaccination for all travelers to high-risk areas. There are even a number of countries where proof of vaccination is mandatory (such as Angola or S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe). However, there are specific contraindications for this vaccine (such as for pregnant women), so it is important to seek prior advice at the traveler's consultation.

    "Fever in children": {
        "What is it?": "It is a common symptom of acute childhood illnesses, due to the body's defense reaction against infection. It can appear suddenly and be accompanied by cold extremities and tremors. Fever is one of the most common manifestations in children, causes great anxiety in the family and is the cause of many pediatric consultations and parental absenteeism. It is not a disease, but a symptom, common to several diseases. It consists of an increase in body temperature above the normal daily variation. Body temperature is controlled by a regulatory center, which balances heat gains and losses, according to a normal daily rhythm (circadian rhythm). Temperatures are lowest in the morning and highest (around 1\u00baC) in the late afternoon. Thus, body temperature varies throughout the day, ranging between 36.5 \u2013 37.5\u00baC. Fever is the body's defense response to an infection. The increase in body temperature contributes to the inactivation of microorganisms and control of their multiplication. For these reasons, fever should only be treated to alleviate existing discomfort. The use of excessive antipyretics can be harmful, not only because of their toxicity, but also because it could be prolonging the disease and its complications.",
        "Symptoms": "If fever is the only symptom of illness, immediate medical consultation is not justified, with the exception of infants under 3 months of age. The doctor advises parents to wait for other signs of illness that allow diagnosis, which generally occurs within 3 days. But, in addition to fever, there may be warning signs, such as the child being \u201cwilted\u201d, not playing when the fever goes down, shortness of breath, spots on the skin, changes in behavior or consciousness, convulsions, persistent vomiting or headaches. intense headaches. In these cases, parents should contact their doctor as soon as they detect these signs.",
        "Causes": "Fever is not a disease, but a symptom, common to several diseases, the vast majority of which are due to a virus infection.",
        "Diagnosis": "A child is feverish if the axillary temperature is greater than 37.5\u00baC, or the rectal temperature is above 38\u00baC. If you are under two years old, it must be measured in the rectum, and in other cases in the armpit or in the ear with digital devices. Babies and younger children typically have higher temperatures than older children and teenagers: From 0 - 3 months, fever is considered to be equal to/greater than 38\u00b0C rectally and you should always consult a doctor immediately;/ From 3 - 6 months, fever is considered if it is equal to/greater than 38\u00b0C rectally. Fever equal to or greater than 39\u00baC is always a reason to consult a doctor;/ In older children, fever is considered if it is equal to/greater than 37.8\u00b0C under the armpit. A fever equal to or greater than 39.5\u00b0C, accompanied by signs of illness (prostration, vomiting, intense headaches, spots on the skin...) is always a reason to consult a doctor;/",
        "Treatment": "Although it is important to look for the cause, as it is a reaction of the body, its presence does not imply the immediate use of antipyretics. This medication does not alter the normal course of the disease and should be reserved only to improve the child's comfort.",
        "What you SHOULD DO when children have a fever:": "Monitor for signs of severity;/ Take off or reduce the amount of clothing;/ Offer liquids, in small amounts at a time, several times and do not insist on eating.;/ With an axillary temperature above 38\u00baC and associated discomfort, administer an antipyretic, preferably using dipyrone. Only if the fever reappears at intervals of less than 6 hours, another drug, such as ibuprofen, should be alternated.;/ If the child is less than 3 months old, seek immediate medical attention;/ In older children, if no other complaints appear, you can wait 3 to 5 days before medical evaluation;/ As a complement to the antipyretic, especially if your child is under 5 years old, you can give him a bath in lukewarm water (about 2 degrees below body temperature), as the fever will go down more quickly.;/",
        "What you SHOULD NOT DO when children have a fever:": "Warm the child by putting more clothing on him/her;/ Use antipyretics even without fever, to prevent, at a fixed time (use in SOS and only if necessary);/ Wanting to treat fever with antibiotics;/ Insist on a normal and abundant diet;/ Attributing fever to a tooth eruption;/",

    "Cleft lip and palate": {
        "What is it?": "Cleft palate is an embryopathy that affects the soft and hard palate to varying degrees. It may be associated with cleft lip. Its annual incidence varies between 1/3,300 and 1/10,000 births, being more frequent in females. In Portugal, it is estimated that around 1 in every 600 children born has a cleft lip, palate or lip-palate. In other words, around 150 children are born in Portugal each year with this malformation.  The cleft palate is located in the middle, joining the oral cavity to the two nasal cavities and the nasopharynx. Its clinical forms vary from a cleft with a notch in the posterior part of the hard palate to a complete cleft of the palate extending to the posterior region. There are other types, such as submucous cleft palate, which are covered by oral and nasal mucosa, making diagnosis more difficult.",
        "Causes": "This embryopathy appears between the 7th and 12th week of pregnancy and results from an error in the fusion of the palatine process. Nonsyndromic clefts are thought to result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Exposure to alcohol, tobacco or drugs during pregnancy can influence genetic susceptibility. Diabetes diagnosed before pregnancy also increases the risk of developing cleft palate. Medications such as some anti-epileptics are also associated with a higher risk.",
        "Symptoms": "Cleft palate can disturb sucking-swallowing in newborns to varying degrees. In non-syndromic forms, normal feeding is possible. In syndromic forms, there is a risk of food aspiration. There may be interference with the normal functioning of the Eustachian tube, causing recurrent ear infections and hearing loss. Dental alignment problems are caused by an error in the growth of the jaw. Speech difficulties may also occur. A fundamental aspect to be mentioned is the impact of the cleft palate on the child's physiognomy and, therefore, on their image and self-esteem. It is essential to manage this aspect well, in order to minimize the psychological consequences of this condition.",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis is fundamentally clinical. The presence of associated malformations allows differentiation between isolated forms or those associated with syndromes. Prenatal diagnosis by ultrasound is possible from the 2nd trimester. When this diagnosis is established, the mother must be referred to a prenatal diagnosis center in order to establish whether it is an isolated anomaly or associated with other disorders.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment requires multidisciplinary medical and surgical intervention from birth until the end of development. As a rule, it involves primary surgery, sometimes followed by secondary surgery (maxillofacial and plastic). After surgery, monitoring must be adapted to the child in order to resolve morphological and functional problems that may arise during growth and development. This monitoring involves speech therapy, orthodontic treatment for dental alignment problems, jaw surgery if necessary, and regular monitoring by an ENT doctor to control ear infections or other disorders. The prognosis is variable and depends on the quality of initial management and regular monitoring. Syndromic forms have a worse prognosis, with more severe speech problems that require additional surgical treatment.",
        "Prevention": "Being a congenital anomaly, it cannot be prevented. In any case, pregnant women can minimize their risk by avoiding tobacco, alcohol and potentially harmful drugs and by properly monitoring their pregnancy.

    "Fibrilhacao auricular": {
        "What is it?": "Atrial fibrillation is the most common chronic arrhythmia, affecting around 10% of the population over 70 years of age. It is estimated that in Portugal around 200,000 to 250,000 individuals have atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is a type of cardiac arrhythmia in which there are very irregular and usually rapid heartbeats, with 80 to 160 beats per minute. In this situation, the heart is unable to pump blood efficiently, which leads to the formation of small clots within the heart itself. These clots can be carried through the bloodstream and lodge in any part of the body. When they reach the arteries that supply the brain, they can cause a stroke. Atrial fibrillation is one of the main causes of stroke, which is why it is recommended that these patients undergo chronic therapy with anticoagulant medications, which are medications that thin the blood, preventing the formation of clots.",
        "Treatment": "The treatment of arrhythmias depends on the type of arrhythmia and the presence of other heart diseases. There are drugs that can be useful in the treatment of arrhythmias and in some situations there are minimally invasive treatments that can involve the implantation of devices, such as a pacemaker. This electronic device is implanted in the patient's chest, from which two or more probes are inserted and remain inside the heart. If the heart rate becomes too slow or with prolonged pauses, the pacemaker itself detects this anomaly and sends electrical stimuli that correct this disturbance, causing the heartbeat to return to normal. Some special pacemakers can also improve the contraction of the heart itself, treating symptoms in patients with severe heart failure. There is also another device, the cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), which, when implanted in the same way, can detect cardiac arrest due to malignant ventricular arrhythmia (usually an arrhythmia originating in the ventricles called ventricular fibrillation, in which the heartbeat is too fast and disorganized, leading to death within a few seconds) and deliver a small shock that treats this arrhythmia, reverting the heart rhythm to normal. The ICD may be the only effective therapy for preventing sudden death in patients at high risk of developing this type of arrhythmia, such as people who have had a myocardial infarction and who have severely compromised ventricular function (when the heart muscle has been severely affected). Load more;/ 1 in 6 Portuguese people may have heart failure without knowing it. The prevalence increases with age, but lifestyle helps reduce risk factors.

    "Fibromyalgia": {
        "What is it?": "It is a chronic disease characterized by painful and diffuse neuromuscular complaints but also by the presence of pain points in specific regions. Although there have been several descriptions of this pathology for a long time, it was only recognized by the World Health Organization as a disease in the late 1970s. Fibromyalgia is a chronic illness but its symptoms vary in intensity and may even disappear or decrease temporarily only to reappear later. These changes may be related to changes in the weather, hormonal issues, stress, depression, anxiety or greater effort than usual. The severity of the symptoms makes fibromyalgia very disabling, with a significant impact on the quality of life of those affected. This disease affects approximately 2% to 8% of the adult population. Of these, between 80% and 90% of cases are women aged between 30 and 50 years. Although there are no rigorous national statistics, it is estimated that 5% to 6% of the population suffers from this pathology, with a predominance of women over 40 years of age. Other studies report that in Portugal there is a prevalence of around 3.6%, and there may be undiagnosed cases. In fact, many people remain in diagnostic uncertainty for several months or years.",
        "Symptoms": "The most important symptom is pain, which can affect a large part of the body. Sometimes it starts in a generalized manner, although it can affect specific areas such as the neck, shoulders or lower back. Fibromyalgia pain can be described as a burning sensation or discomfort, in which muscle spasms sometimes occur. Manifestations may vary depending on the time and day, and may be more frequent in the morning, worsening with physical activity, climate change, lack of sleep and stress. In addition to pain, it can cause tingling and swelling in the hands and feet, especially when getting out of bed, as well as causing muscle stiffness. Another change in fibromyalgia associated with pain is fatigue, which persists throughout most of the day with little tolerance to physical exertion. People with this pathology also frequently complain of anxiety, attention, concentration and memory disorders. Some have gastric problems and irritable bowels. And about 70% report sleep disturbances, with pain increasing on days when they sleep worse.",
        "Causes": "Its causes are not exactly known. Numerous factors probably contribute to this disease. However, it appears to be related to a deregulation of certain substances in the central nervous system. Stress, some immunological and endocrine diseases, physical trauma (surgery, car accident) or psychological trauma (death, divorce) seem to contribute to the development or maintenance of this clinical condition. Some cases of fibromyalgia that begin after a bacterial or viral infection have also been described.",
        "Diagnosis": "Since there is no exam or analysis that allows confirmation of your diagnosis, it is based on clinical history and medical observation that highlights a set of painful points associated with fatigue, sleep disorders and emotional changes. The current diagnostic criteria are the presence of diffuse pain throughout the body lasting more than three months, pain when palpating 12 out of 18 tender points and at least two of the following four symptoms: fatigue, sleep disturbances, emotional disturbances and headaches. It is essential to exclude other diseases that can cause these complaints, such as muscle injuries, changes in the immune system, hormonal problems and rheumatic diseases. As such, any necessary examinations must be carried out. In the case of fibromyalgia, the results are normal.",
        "Treatment": "There is no cure for fibromyalgia. As the years go by, the patient tends to get worse if there are no conditions for adequate treatment, adaptation or in the absence of help from others in various daily tasks. There are no specific medications and treatment must be multidisciplinary and adapted to each patient and their stage. Analgesics, muscle relaxants, antidepressants and, in some cases, anti-inflammatories can be useful in some stages of the pathology. More recently, new drugs have been approved that help control your symptoms and that act on certain brain chemicals. Your prescription must always be carried out by your doctor. To improve their physical and mental state, patients should exercise, preferably with a program adapted to their physical condition, whether in a gym or in a swimming pool. Massages, heat applications, physiotherapy and/or acupuncture and relaxation techniques are also useful. Getting restful sleep and a balanced diet should also be part of daily habits. It is also important to control stress and try to adapt your lifestyle to changes in energy levels and the symptoms of fibromyalgia. It is also essential that the patient feels supported in their family, social and professional environment.",

    "Liver fibrosis": {
        "What is it?": "It is the result of a scarring response of the liver to repeated insults. After an acute injury, such as viral hepatitis, liver cells regenerate and replace those that have died. During this process, an inflammatory response occurs. If the injury persists, regeneration is no longer possible and the dead cells are replaced by fibrous tissue. This progression leads to the formation of extensive areas of fibrosis and progression to liver cirrhosis. This can progress to liver failure and often requires a liver transplant. On the other hand, liver cirrhosis significantly increases the risk of liver cancer.",
        "Symptoms": "In itself, it does not cause symptoms. Its manifestations result from liver dysfunction, progression to cirrhosis and all associated complications, such as varicose veins that can bleed, ascites (accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity), encephalopathy and kidney failure. In more advanced stages, liver failure may occur, which, in the most severe cases, can be fatal. In the early stages, fibrosis is insidious. Progression to cirrhosis occurs over a period of 15 to 20 years. Loss of liver function can be manifested by the presence of yellowish skin and mucous membranes (jaundice), abdominal pain, intense itching, dark urine, discolored stools, chronic tiredness, nausea or loss of appetite.",
        "Causes": "As a rule, all chronic liver diseases can cause liver fibrosis. It results from repeated damage to the liver. The most common are hepatitis C and alcohol abuse. With the increasing rate of obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver has become an important cause.",
        "Diagnosis": "It involves clinical evaluation, laboratory tests and imaging studies, such as ultrasound, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Liver biopsy is the best means of diagnosis as it assesses the extent and severity of fibrosis. However, it is an invasive examination that can be associated with some complications such as pain or bleeding.",
        "Treatment": "Since liver fibrosis is a response to an attack, treatment should focus on identifying and treating it. It is therefore important to cure viral hepatitis, avoid alcohol consumption, remove heavy metals (such as iron or copper) when they are the cause of the pathology, or decompress the bile ducts in cases of obstruction. These procedures can stop the fibrosis process and, in some cases, reverse it. Since inflammation is one of the factors in its progression, the use of anti-inflammatory drugs may be indicated. Corticosteroids are useful in autoimmune hepatitis and acute alcoholic hepatitis. Antioxidants and other substances with immunomodulatory action that can protect liver cells may also be used. Adequate nutrition is a good complement to treatment, with zinc and vitamin D supplementation. In addition, physical exercise helps maintain muscle mass. There are also specific therapies for ascites and hypertension, should these pathologies develop. However, when cirrhosis occurs with clinical complications, liver transplantation is the only possible approach.",
        "Prevention": "Unlike cirrhosis, liver fibrosis is reversible, as long as the aggression that is stimulating it can be stopped. This regression, however, can take years. The risk of developing liver cancer in cirrhosis of the liver is around 1% to 4% per year. This has a high mortality rate if diagnosed late, which is why all patients with cirrhosis should have an abdominal ultrasound every six months, so that the tumour can be identified while still small. In this case, there are some effective treatments, such as liver transplantation, surgical removal, radiofrequency or chemoembolisation. Protecting the liver is important to avoid diseases that can attack it and trigger the process of liver fibrosis. In this sense, it is important not to consume alcoholic beverages in excess (more than two to three for men and one to two for women, per day), not to consume alcohol before the age of 18, to be vaccinated against hepatitis B, not to share syringes or any material used in the consumption of injected drugs, do not share the material used to inhale drugs (prevents hepatitis C), use condoms in the case of multiple partners or risky sexual relations (prevents hepatitis B and C) and combat excess weight.

    "Pulmonary fibrosis": {
        "What is it?": "It is the abnormal presence of fibrous or scar tissue in the lungs. It can appear as a result of lung diseases (there are more than 200 that can cause pulmonary fibrosis) and that interfere with its function, affecting breathing, gas exchange and, consequently, the entire metabolism. It is not a disease in itself but a consequence of a previous pathology. It is an irreversible disease that can develop very gradually or more quickly.",
        "Symptoms": "Since pulmonary fibrosis interferes with the elasticity of lung tissue and gas exchange, the most common symptoms are coughing and difficulty breathing, with shorter and faster inhalations and exhalations. These symptoms may be very mild and almost imperceptible at first, but they become more severe as the fibrosis develops. Thus, difficulty breathing is only evident after physical exertion, but it can start to appear even after very simple activities such as taking a shower, getting dressed or eating. The cough is usually dry and chronic, causing chest discomfort. Poor blood and tissue oxygenation is associated with cold, purplish extremities, which may lead to changes in the nails. There is also a decrease in appetite and weight loss. In other cases, patients report muscle and joint pain.",
        "Causes": "In many cases, it is not possible to identify its cause, and it is classified as idiopathic. In others, the most common causes are autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, polymyositis); occupational diseases, in which there is exposure to substances such as asbestos, beryllium silica, heavy metals, tar, environmental exposure to bacteria, fungi or radiation; some medications, such as nitrofurantoin, sulfasalazine, amiodarone, propranolol, phenytoin, methotrexate, bleomycin or oxaliplatin. There are also cases that arise after a viral infection. Contact with birds may also be at its origin. And since in around 10% to 15% of cases there is more than one family member affected, it may still be associated with a genetic cause.",
        "Diagnosis": "Diagnosing the causes of pulmonary fibrosis is difficult. However, it should always be tried because the evolution of the disease and its treatment vary greatly depending on its origin. In general, it should involve a multidisciplinary team that includes pulmonologists, rheumatologists and internists. An accurate diagnosis involves medical observation and clinical history, where relevant data can be obtained to identify the cause of pulmonary fibrosis. Depending on the elements obtained, additional tests are requested, such as a thoracic tomography, laboratory studies, respiratory function and exercise tests, arterial blood gas measurement or, if necessary, a bronchoscopy or surgical lung biopsy. Studying the heart and cardiac function can also be useful in some situations.",
        "Treatment": "Pulmonary fibrosis is irreversible and as such cannot be cured. The current therapeutic strategy aims to prevent the formation of additional fibrosis and alleviate the symptoms already present. Corticosteroids may be important when there is a significant inflammatory component. Azathioprine and cyclophosphamide may also be prescribed whenever the physician considers it appropriate. When oxygen levels are reduced, oxygen therapy is necessary. There are also specific lung physiotherapy techniques that seek to increase the function and elasticity of the lungs and, in this way, improve the quality of life of patients. Lung transplants are reserved for the most severe cases, which have not responded to treatments. Patients must be carefully selected and meet a set of criteria to be eligible for this transplant.",
        "Prevention": "Avoid toxic or other substances associated with the development of pulmonary fibrosis. In professional cases, all measures must be taken to reduce this exposure and ensure the safety and health of workers.

    "Fatty liver": {
        "What is it?": "Also known as hepatic steatosis, it means accumulation of fat in the liver cells. The liver is the second largest organ in the body and performs numerous functions, both in the digestion and utilization of nutrients, as well as in the removal of harmful substances, in addition to good regulation of coagulation. Fatty liver is a common disease that, in Portugal, affects around 15% of adults, which indicates the occurrence of approximately one million and 200 thousand cases, of which 200 to 300 thousand are the most serious forms of the disease, which may progress to liver cirrhosis. Globally, it affects around 20% to 30% of the population regardless of age, gender or ethnicity. There is a higher incidence in men, especially at older ages, and also in postmenopausal women. It can affect around 3% of children (aged around four years) and 20% to 50% of obese children. This accumulation of fat in the liver results from eating too much of it, to the point where the body is unable to process it. We speak of a fatty liver when the fat corresponds to 5% to 10% of the liver mass. It may be a simple situation that does not cause liver damage, or it may progress to inflammation of the liver tissue, as occurs with cirrhosis.",
        "Symptoms": "Most patients have no symptoms. Sometimes, tiredness and pain or discomfort may appear in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen. Other possible manifestations are: loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, jaundice, fever, ascites (distension of the abdomen due to accumulation of fluid). The last three already correspond to advanced forms of the disease, with damage and inflammation of the liver.",
        "Causes": "One of the important causes of fatty liver is alcohol consumption. However, this condition also appears in people who do not drink, and is called non-alcoholic fatty liver. This condition is prevalent in patients with overweight/obesity, diabetes and increased cholesterol and/or triglycerides. Other, rarer causes of fatty liver include: medications (amiodarone, estrogens, corticosteroids, tamoxifen, antiretrovirals, tetracyclines), certain genetic metabolic diseases, rapid weight loss, artificial forms of nutrition, and the ingestion of toxins (chemicals and mushrooms). There may also be some hereditary predisposition to the occurrence of this pathology. The fat that is ingested is metabolized in the liver and other tissues. If it is excessive, it is stored in adipose tissue. From there it can be transferred to other places and also to the liver. In other cases, fat accumulates in this organ, which is unable to transform it to be eliminated. Around 80% of alcohol consumers develop this condition because alcohol causes a rapid accumulation of fatty acids in the liver.",
        "Diagnosis": "The most common techniques are abdominal ultrasound, which reveals a larger liver. This disease can also be suspected due to changes in blood tests, which detect an increase in liver enzymes (transaminases) in obese, diabetic and/or dyslipidemic patients. A biopsy is the test that allows you to confirm your diagnosis and also assess the degree of inflammation.",
        "Treatment": "There is no specific treatment or effective medication in this situation. Lifestyle changes and weight loss are fundamental aspects. Therefore, diet and exercise are very important. It is also necessary to avoid the consumption of alcoholic beverages and properly control associated diseases, such as diabetes and changes in cholesterol and triglycerides. It is worth highlighting that, in its early stages, fatty liver is reversible.",
        "What are the complications associated with fatty liver?": "Although the majority of cases have a benign evolution, it is currently known that progression to cirrhosis is possible. This risk is greater in older patients, diabetics and those who already have liver inflammation (called non-alcoholic steatohepatitis).",
        "Prevention": "Opting for a healthy lifestyle, preventing obesity, and practicing physical exercise are important aspects of this prevention. As well as a diet low in saturated fats, rich in fiber and moderate alcohol consumption. You should also prefer fish and lean meats to red meat and pork. It is also useful to supplement the diet with substances capable of preventing this disease and improving liver function, such as: vitamin E and C, selenium, omega-3 and ginseng, among others. Canadian Liver Foundation, 2012 American Liver Foundation, Outubro 2011 FattyLivers.org, 2013 Brazilian Society of Gastroenterology, 2007 Brazilian Society of Hepatology, 2009 Surgery can give people with obesity back the quality (and years) of life that they would otherwise be unable to achieve. Learn about the different techniques. Surgical treatment for obesity and diabetes can be performed using different techniques, depending on the objective and characteristics of each person. Obesity is associated with several problems during pregnancy. Weight loss before pregnancy is beneficial and can be achieved through bariatric surgery.

    "Phimosis": {
        "What is it?": "Phimosis does not correspond to the normal fact that the foreskin is glued to the glans, a common situation in the first years of life (at six months only 20% of boys are able to fully expose it, but almost 90% are already able to do so at three years of age), but rather the difficulty, or even impossibility, of exposing the glans of the penis due to the fact that the foreskin (\u201cskin\u201d that covers the glans) has a very narrow ring. Around 90% of newborns have physiological phimosis or the inability to completely retract the foreskin. During the first three to four years of life, factors such as the growth of the penis shaft, the accumulation of epithelial secretions, intermittent erections and masturbation during puberty lead to the separation of the foreskin from the glans. As a rule, about 90% of foreskins are completely retractable by age three and less than 1% of men have phimosis by age 17. The foreskin, in addition to its protective effect on the urethral meatus, has other functions such as contributing to sexual pleasure, which can lead to dissatisfaction in circumcised men. Therefore, many of the circumcisions usually performed can be avoided. Phimosis only becomes problematic if it causes obstruction to the flow of urine, pain, blood loss in the urine, or infection.",
        "Symptoms": "In many cases, its only manifestation is difficulty in retracting the foreskin. However, infections of the glans or urinary tract, painful erections and difficulties in urination, with a reduction in the intensity of the urinary stream, may occur. Phimosis is a risk factor for penile cancer.",
        "Causes": "The most common reason is diaper rash, which can cause scarring and fibrosis. As they retract the skin, the foreskin ring becomes narrower. In other cases, parents concerned about normal adhesion between the glans and the foreskin perform massages, forcing the skin and causing small traumas that, when healing, make the ring narrow, causing phimosis. It can also result from a chronic infection associated with poor hygiene. It can occur even in uncircumcised people or even after circumcision. In older men, diabetes is a risk factor for chronic infection and consequent phimosis. Although very rare, phimosis occurs in women, involving the clitoris and causing pain during sexual intercourse.",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis is clinical, made during a medical examination.",
        "Treatment": "Surgery is indicated to allow adequate hygiene of the penis, to enable satisfactory sexual relationships in the future, to reduce the risk of urinary infections, of the foreskin, of the glans, and of venereal diseases, penile cancer, in addition to also reducing the risk of breast cancer. cervix in future sexual partners. It is important to note that phimosis does not prevent or harm penis growth and, therefore, surgery is not intended for this purpose. In uncomplicated cases, it can be performed around the age of seven to ten. By then, the foreskin can detach normally, thus avoiding surgery. At this age, the child can already understand the need for the operation, making it less traumatic on a psychological level. On the other hand, it is important that it occurs before adolescence, when more frequent erections make the post-operative period more painful and increase the risk of complications. The surgery is performed on an outpatient basis and, in childhood and even adolescence, general anesthesia is preferred, usually preceded by the use of a sedative and an analgesic, to prevent the patient from watching, participating and being frightened during the surgical procedure, to avoid the pain of the needle \u201cpricks\u201d and the introduction of the local anesthetic, to keep the patient still and to allow them to not remember the procedure, thus avoiding future psychological trauma. As for the technique, the amount of skin to be removed depends on the age and degree of phimosis. In younger children, it is recommended to be vigilant, maintain adequate hygiene and avoid excessively forcing the retraction of the foreskin, so as not to cause scars that worsen the clinical condition. Local application of corticosteroids may be useful in some cases.",
        "Prevention": "The best prevention is to teach parents good hygiene for children, without massage or exercise, and by recognizing and properly treating dermatitis, diaper rash and infections that may occur.

    "Anal fissure": {
        "What is it?": "Anal fissures are tears in the lining of the anal canal that cause pain and sometimes bleeding during defecation. They are caused by injuries to the anal canal when passing large or hard stools, repeated diarrhea, or as a result of childbirth. In some cases, they are associated with Crohn's disease, an inflammatory bowel disease, and fistulas near the anus. Fissures may be accompanied by light bleeding or yellow discharge and itching. They are usually treated at home.",
        "Symptoms": "The main symptoms of anal fissure include: Pain, especially during bowel movements. The pain is sharp and intense, and a burning sensation may persist after defecation. In some patients, fear of pain causes them to avoid defecating, leading to an increase in the consistency and volume of the stool and worsening of the pain and fissure.;/ Sharp pain when cleaning;/ Bright red blood in the stool or on toilet paper, also common in fissures in children;/ Itching in the anal area, intermittent or persistent;/",
        "Causes": "The most common causes of anal fissure are associated with constipation, which causes very hard stools, diarrhea or inflammation of the anal canal.",
        "Diagnosis": "In most cases, the clinical history and circumstances surrounding the onset of symptoms will guide the diagnosis of anal fissure. The healthcare professional may ask about diet, habits, or intestinal problems, as well as other medical conditions. In most cases, inspection of the anal area can confirm the presence of a fissure. Often, the number and location of fissures can point to other conditions, such as Crohn's disease. The presence of marginal thickenings suggests that the fissure is chronic and repeated. In these cases, your doctor may suggest a sigmoidoscopy to look at the lower part of the colon (called the sigmoid colon), or a colonoscopy to look at the entire large intestine. Both tests involve the insertion through the anus of a long, thin, flexible tube connected to a light source and which allows the presence of abnormal lesions or inflammatory conditions to be detected.",
        "Treatment": "In most cases, anal fissures heal spontaneously with the topical application of creams, associated with taking laxatives and local hygiene using warm water. In cases where complaints persist for several days without reacting to treatment, it should be reevaluated. the patient's situation, exclude diseases that may be at its origin, such as Crohn's Disease, and consider the need for surgical correction. If the fissures persist, causing a decrease in quality of life, they can be treated with an injection of a substance that reduces the tone or strength of the internal anal sphincter (botulinum toxin) or with surgery.",

    "Fistula": {
        "What is it?": "A fistula\u00a0designates an anomalous communication between two or more body structures that, under normal conditions, do not communicate with each other. It can occur in the most varied locations, the most common being the digestive, urinary, reproductive and circulatory systems. They are very common, and almost always treatable, with a favorable prognosis. Its origin may be congenital or result from disease, infection, trauma or surgery. The formation of a fistula is associated with very uncomfortable symptoms and, if left untreated, can progress to conditions of significant severity. Depending on its location, it can allow urine, feces or secretions to pass outside and cause symptoms such as pain, irritation, nausea or diarrhea.",
        "Symptoms": "Its manifestations are as variable as its location. Due to their frequency, the symptoms of anal and vaginal fistulas are referred to. In the anal fistula, a communication forms between the anus region and the surrounding skin, usually as a result of an infectious process. For this reason, the most common signs are fever, malaise, constipation, pain during bowel movements, loss of blood or pus through the fistula and swelling of the skin around it. In the vaginal area, communication develops between the vagina and an organ in the pelvic region. The most common causes of this type are childbirth, Crohn's disease, previous surgery or cancer. Depending on the organs involved, these fistulas can be colovaginal, enterovaginal, rectovaginal, ureterovaginal, urethrovaginal or vesicovaginal, in the latter case they connect the vagina with the bladder. The symptoms vary depending on their location but are very uncomfortable because they can involve the passage of faeces or urine into the vaginal canal. Discomfort, unpleasant odours and a feeling of vaginal discomfort also occur. In other types of fistulas, fever, pain, itching and malaise tend to be the predominant symptoms. If the fistula closes and the infection remains, an abscess may form. In the case of an arteriovenous fistula, blood communicates between an artery and a vein. As a consequence, the oxygen that is transported does not reach the target tissues, being diverted to the venous circulation. These fistulas are most common in the lower limbs but can occur anywhere on the body. The most common signs are the presence of bulging veins, swelling of the hands or feet, tiredness and, depending on its location, low blood pressure or heart failure. A clot may form within these fistulas and its release into the bloodstream may cause distant embolisms.",
        "Causes": "Fistulas can be congenital in nature or result from disease, infection, injury or surgery. Inflammatory bowel diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, are frequently associated with the formation of fistulas. Intestinal diverticulitis is another risk factor. When an infection occurs in a gland with an accumulation of pus, if left untreated, the material under tension \"seeks\" an exit to the outside, forming a fistula.",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis depends on the clinical history and medical examination. It is from there that the most appropriate complementary tests are defined for each case. In the case of fistulas involving the digestive system, it is important to carry out an endoscopic and/or radiological study. In others it is useful to introduce a contrast substance followed by a radiographic study. This technique allows you to see its extent and which organs are involved. For arteriovenous lesions, Doppler, tomography or magnetic resonance imaging studies are relevant.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment also depends on its location and the severity of the symptoms. In some cases, antibiotics or immunosuppressants are used. For fistulas located in the digestive system, a special liquid diet can allow good healing and closure. Arteriovenous fistulas can be embolized by introducing a catheter. Vaginal infections do not always require treatment, as they can close spontaneously. In the case of anals, surgery is almost always necessary. When there is no response to therapy, surgical intervention is also the option. This may consist of just removing the fistula if the organs involved are healthy, or partially removing them if there are signs of significant disease.",
        "Prevention": "There is no defined strategy for its prevention. The important thing is an early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Cleveland Clinic, 2014 The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons, 2014 Teresa H. deBeche-Adams e col.,Rectovaginal Fistulas,Clin Colon Rectal Surg. 2010 Jun; 23(2): 99-103 Load more;/ RSV infection can progress to bronchiolitis or pneumonia.

    "Flatulence": {
        "What is it?": "Flatulence corresponds to a sensation of the presence of gas in the digestive tract. Air is a gas that can be swallowed with food. Swallowing small amounts is normal, but some people do it in large volumes, unconsciously, especially in states of anxiety. This situation causes a feeling of satiety, generating excessive belching or expelling air through the anus. Most of the swallowed air is subsequently expelled (only a small portion passes from the stomach to the rest of the digestive tract). The body eliminates gases through eructation, absorbs them through the walls of the gastrointestinal tract into the blood (being eliminated through the lungs) or expels them through the anus.",
        "Symptoms": "It is thought to cause abdominal pain, bloating, belching and excessive expulsion of gas through the anus. However, the exact relationship between flatulence and any of these symptoms is not known. Some people seem to be particularly sensitive to the effects of gases while others can tolerate large amounts without symptoms. Flatulence can lead to repeated belching. As a rule, air leaves the anus more than ten times a day. Infants with abdominal cramps sometimes also expel large amounts of gas.",
        "Causes": "In addition to the air that is swallowed, other gases are formed in the gastrointestinal tract. Hydrogen, methane and carbon dioxide are produced by the bacterial metabolism of food in the intestine, especially after eating beans or cabbage. Grains, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, asparagus, peas, onions, fruits, juices and sugar-free diet products, wheat, corn, barley, milk and dairy products can also be their origin. People with a deficiency in the enzymes that break down certain sugars also tend to produce large amounts of gas when they eat foods containing these sugars. This is also the case for people with lactase deficiency, tropical diarrhea or pancreatic insufficiency. Other common causes include the use of antibiotics, irritable bowel syndrome, malabsorption and the ingestion of foods that are difficult to digest, such as fiber.",
        "Diagnosis": "Tests may be necessary to determine its cause and, mainly, to exclude possible diseases of the digestive tract. Thus, the doctor may order an abdominal CT or ultrasound, an x-ray with contrast, blood tests, or an upper or lower endoscopy.",
        "Treatment": "Distension and eructation are difficult to treat. If the main problem is burping, reducing the amount of air swallowed may help. However, this goal is difficult to achieve because swallowing is often an unconscious act. You have to avoid chewing gum, drinking carbonated drinks or antacids (such as baking soda), you should eat more slowly and in a calm environment. Flatulence can be controlled by adjusting your diet and avoiding foods that are difficult to digest. To find out which ones are causing the problem, you may need to eliminate one or a group of products at a time. You can start by eliminating milk and dairy products, then fruits and certain vegetables, and then other foods. Taking some medications can help reduce gas production, although they are not usually very effective.",
        "Prevention": "Prevention involves simple measures such as eating relaxedly, without rushing, chewing slowly, not eating too much cabbage or beans, not chewing gum, not drinking carbonated drinks and walking for 10 to 15 minutes after meals. Manual Merck U.S. National Library of Medicine, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, Fevereiro de 2014 Brazilian Society of Gastroenterology, 2008 Among fruits, vegetables and legumes, get to know eight types of foods that are most likely to cause flatulence.

    "Folliculitis": {
        "What is it?": "Folliculitis occurs when there is an infection of the hair follicles caused by bacteria, such as staphylococcus, or other factors. This infection manifests itself in the form of small, white-tipped pimples around one or more hair follicles. When severe, it can cause permanent hair loss and/or scarring and should be treated by a dermatologist. In most cases, it is superficial and regresses spontaneously.",
        "Symptoms": "Folliculitis can be: Superficial: Affects only the upper part of the hair follicle and manifests itself in the form of small red pimples, with or without pus; the skin may become red and inflamed, with itching and sensitivity in the area;;/ Deep: When the inflammation reaches deeper areas, boils may form, with large red, sensitive and painful areas, as well as raised lesions with yellowish pus in the center. Itching and intense pain may also occur. In these cases, the likelihood of scarring is greater with destruction of the hair follicle.;/",
        "Causes": "The bacterial invasion that causes folliculitis can occur spontaneously or be favored by other factors, the most common being: Excessive moisture or sweat, shaving or waxing;/ The use of jacuzzis and swimming pools;/ Wearing tight clothing;/ Taking antibiotics or corticosteroids for long periods of time;;/ Contact with substances that irritate or block follicles (makeup, cocoa butter, motor oil, among others);/ Skin injuries or diseases such as diabetes or HIV/AIDS that reduce the body's defenses are also risk factors;/ One of the most common agents of folliculitis is a bacteria, staphylococcus, which exists under normal conditions on the skin and only becomes aggressive when introduced into the deeper layers of the skin. Bacteria of the genus Pseudomonas can also cause this type of infection, as can some fungi.",
        "Diagnosis": "A doctor can diagnose folliculitis simply by looking at the skin. In some cases, they will take samples of the secretion from the lesion to be examined in a laboratory. These samples can identify the microorganism responsible for the folliculitis.",
        "Treatment": "Mild cases of folliculitis are likely to heal on their own. Persistent, recurrent or more serious infections may require treatment depending on the type of infection. Antibiotics applied locally, orally or both are often used. When it progresses to the formation of boils, surgical drainage may be necessary as a way of relieving pain and eliminating inflammation more quickly. If itching is intense, it is useful to use warm water, as well as the use of specific medications. In some cases, local or oral corticosteroids may be used.",
        "Prevention": "There are several ways to prevent folliculitis, taking into account the most common causes: Keep your skin clean, dry and free from abrasions or irritations. Diabetics are more prone to infections.;/ Use gentle skin cleansing products (soap, gel);/ Avoid routine antiseptic washes that tend to dry out the skin and destroy protective bacteria.

Almost 70% of the femoral head is involved in load transfer, so changes in the articular surface can lead to the development of post-traumatic osteoarthritis.  Femoral head fractures are almost always associated with a hip dislocation.",
        "Causes": "Most femoral head fractures result from road accidents with trauma to the lower limb and transmission of force through the femur to the femoral head which, depending on the position of the hip, can result in dislocation and/or fracture.",

    "Spinal fracture": {
        "What is it?": "The spine is made up of vertebrae that create the natural curves of the back. Between the vertebrae are intervertebral discs that act as shock absorbers and allow the spine to move. Muscles and ligaments connect the vertebrae and allow movement, providing support and stability. Each vertebra has an opening (foramen) in the center, which align to form the spinal canal. Protected by the vertebrae, the spinal cord and other nerve roots travel through the spinal canal. Nerves branch off from the spine, carrying messages between the brain and muscles. Other vertebral joints such as the facet bones ensure vertebral movements and rotation. The spinal column is divided into 3 segments: cervical, thoracic and lumbar. The most common vertebral fractures occur in the thoracic and lumbar spine. A spinal fracture is a serious injury, usually caused by a car accident, fall, or other high-impact accident. The energy required to severely fracture the spine can also cause spinal cord injuries or other damage that requires additional treatment. Men experience thoracic or lumbar spine fractures four times more often than women, and older adults with osteoporosis are also at higher risk.",
        "Symptoms": "Pain and changes in mobility, whether or not associated with neurological changes, are the main manifestations of the disease. If the spinal cord is involved, numbness, tingling, weakness, or bowel/urinary dysfunction may also occur.",
        "Causes": "They are typically caused by high-impact trauma, such as a car accident, fall from a great height, or sports accident. Osteoporosis, tumors, or other underlying conditions that weaken bones can also lead to fractures, even during normal daily activities. There are several types and their classification is based on the pattern of the injury and whether the spinal cord was also affected or not.",
        "Diagnosis": "The doctor performs a complete examination of the skull, chest, abdomen, pelvic region, limbs and spine. A neurological examination assesses the patient's mobility and sensation, as well as the ability to identify the position of all limbs. Testing the patient's reflexes helps determine if there is any damage to the spinal cord or peripheral nerves. After the physical examination, a radiological evaluation is necessary. Depending on the extent of the injuries, this may include X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs of various areas, including the thoracic and lumbar spine. The doctor will identify the fracture pattern, the best treatment, and whether surgery is necessary.",

    "Fracture of the wrist and hand": {
        "What is it?": "Fractures of the wrist and hand can involve several bones, some small, such as the phalanges, and others larger, such as the metacarpals. A fracture occurs when enough force is applied to a bone to break it, causing pain, swelling, and functional disability, often associated with deformation. Fractures can be simple and aligned and stable, they can be unstable with a tendency to angle or rotate, and they can also be comminuted (with multiple bone fragments that are usually very unstable). An open fracture occurs when one of the bone fragments pierces the skin and requires special attention due to the risk of infection. In terms of grip, the possibilities are also diverse and it is important to analyze them individually. In fact, the wrist is made up of 8 small bones and also the radius and the ulna. These bones form several joints between themselves and are covered by cartilage. Osteoporosis increases the risk of wrist fractures. One of the most susceptible bones is the radius. Wrist fractures can be simple, when the bones are aligned and stabilized, or they can be unstable when the bone fragments move or change position. Proper alignment is essential to avoid future deformities and limited movement, with arthritis and pain.  Radius fractures are common in sports such as skateboarding and football. The severity varies with the degree of joint involvement being greater in high-contact sports (e.g. equestrian or motorized sports). The most common mechanism is falling onto the hand with the wrist in hyperextension. Pain, functional impotence and swelling occur. Initial imaging evaluation is done by radiography, but computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging may be necessary in joint fractures or when a ligament injury is suspected. The presence of numbness or tingling in the fingers suggests nerve damage. The goal of treatment is to maintain bone length, radial inclination, and congruence of the various radial joints. Nondisplaced fractures should be treated conservatively. Displaced fractures should undergo reduction and fixation.   The bones in the hand are very precisely aligned. If a finger fracture is not properly repaired, significant problems can occur. Even a single finger fracture can cause the entire hand to become misaligned, and without treatment, the finger will become stiff and painful. Generally speaking, finger fractures occur as a result of trauma to the hand, a direct impact or a fall. Even a ball can cause a broken finger. Symptoms include swelling and deformation in the fracture area, pain, hematoma formation, inability to move the finger. The bones in the fingers can fracture in different ways, including complete fractures, spiral fractures, fractures with fragments, etc. Alignment of the fractured finger can be done without surgery followed by immobilization for about 3 weeks. This immobilization may include the neighboring fingers to provide additional support and will be followed by an appropriate period of physical therapy.  This fracture deserves special treatment given the importance of the thumb. It is thanks to the thumb that it is possible to hold an object and a fracture of this finger increases the risk of arthritis later in life. The thumb is made up of two bones, the distal phalanx and the proximal phalanx, and the most serious fractures are those that affect the finger close to its joints, mainly in its connection with the wrist. These fractures are more difficult to treat and have a worse prognosis. The most common causes are direct impacts, such as falls, or those caused by a ball that you try to catch by pushing your thumb back. Fractures can occur through indirect mechanisms, such as muscle contraction or sprain, which can happen in sports such as wrestling, hockey, football and skiing. Calcium deficiencies increase the risk of this type of fracture. The use of appropriate protective material reduces the risk of thumb fracture, and good prior preparation and adequate nutrition are equally important. A thumb fracture is characterized by intense pain at the fracture site, swelling, limited movement, deformation, and a feeling of numbness or coldness in the thumb. A delay in treatment, with continued swelling, makes it more difficult for the bones to align correctly. Immobilization is important to prevent movement or dislocation of the fractured bones. This immobilization should be maintained for 6 weeks and, during this period, control X-rays will be taken. Surgery may be necessary depending on the location and amount of movement of the bone fragments. Surgery involves fixing the fragments internally or externally. Immobilization is maintained for 2 to 6 weeks and physiotherapy is started after this period. It may take about 3 months to regain full use of the hand. If the hand is kept in a stable position, these fractures heal well, although there is a risk of developing arthritis that can limit movement and strength in the thumb. Performing movements with the thumb in hot water and using objects designed to stimulate the movement of opening and closing the hand could help, although these strategies must always be defined by the orthopedic doctor.  The scaphoid is the most commonly fractured bone in the wrist (60% of cases). This fracture tends to be underdiagnosed and can be a threat to an athlete's competitive life, with possible progression to osteoarthritis. If left untreated, it can affect the entire mobility of the wrist. As such, early diagnosis and appropriate treatment are extremely important. Fractures of the scaphoid bone almost always result from a fall on the wrist in hyperextension and displaced towards the thumb, although there may be other mechanisms. The greater the extension of the wrist in the fall, the greater the risk of fracture of this bone. When the extension is less, the fracture of the radius is more likely. This type of fracture causes pain in the wrist, especially in the region of the anatomical snuffbox (small triangular cavity formed by the tendons of the thumb when it is extended). This pain should raise suspicion of a scaphoid fracture. Deformation or swelling is rare in this type of fracture, which can delay diagnosis. If this fracture is not visible on the initial radiological examination, the wrist should be immobilized and a new examination should be performed after two weeks. In addition to X-rays, scintigraphy, magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography are important tests for an early and accurate diagnosis.  The hand contains 27 bones. Fractures of the metacarpals and phalanges are common in several sports. The most common fracture is the \u201cboxer's fracture\u201d which occurs when you hit your hand against a surface with a clenched fist. In this fracture, the fifth metacarpal (in the little finger) becomes depressed and the tissues become tender and swollen. These fractures can occur in a fall, twisting motion, car accident, or in direct contact sports. They manifest themselves in the form of swelling, pain, deformation, inability to move one or more fingers, reduction in finger length, depressed knuckles and crossing of one finger over another when trying to clench the fist. Treatment involves realigning the bones, which is often possible without surgery. Immobilization is essential for 3 to 6 weeks. After this period, gentle hand movements should be started. Surgery may be needed to stabilize and align the bones. This is important because if the bones heal in the wrong position, loss of finger function can occur.",
        "Symptoms": "Fractures of the wrist and hand manifest as: severe pain that worsens with movement of the joint;/ edema (swelling);/ wrist deformity;/ pain when touching the affected area;/",

        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of a wrist and hand fracture is made through medical evaluation and X-ray.\u00a0Clinically, the presence of pain on palpation of the radius area, deformity and edema suggest the presence of a fracture, which is confirmed with the X-ray study. Computed tomography (CT) is rarely performed to diagnose a fracture of the wrist or hand, but it can be useful in studying the characteristics of complex fractures in order to plan surgical treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging is useful in studying non-osseous lesions that may be associated with fractures of the radius, but is generally not performed immediately after the fracture, but in situations where complaints persist that cannot be explained by the fracture.",
        "Treatment": "Clinical evaluation and x-ray are mandatory to evaluate the fracture and its treatment. Immobilization with a splint or cast may be indicated for stable and aligned fractures. Some fractures can be reduced and fixed percutaneously with steel wires or screws. Others may require open reduction and fixation with screws or plates. In some cases it may be necessary to use a bone graft to complement the stabilization of the fracture. External fixators may be an alternative in multifragmented fractures. Treatment depends on factors such as the patient's age, activity level, occupation, dominant hand, previous injuries, presence of arthritis or other diseases. Immobilization is important in well-aligned fractures or those that have already been reduced. This immobilization is necessary for several weeks. The mechanisms for fixing a fracture involve the use of different types of materials (plates, screws, implants) and the fixation can be internal or external. In cases of loss of bone material, it may be necessary to place a graft. Anatomical alignment is not required for a good functional outcome. Fractures with good bone alignment can be expected to have a good functional recovery. Problems with fracture healing include stiffness, malalignment with rotation or angulation of the finger, infection, delayed healing or nonunion. Fractures in children can affect bone growth. A physical therapy program with exercises and splinting may be indicated. During the healing process, it is important to maintain flexibility in your fingers and shoulder. Once your wrist is stable, you should begin an exercise program to restore strength, flexibility, and function. Recovery time varies and can last several months. Sometimes, some stiffness and pain may persist. Complications of fractures are directly related to their characteristics, the treatment carried out and the rehabilitation performed. Limitation of wrist mobility: Pain and restriction of wrist movement usually decrease markedly about 2 months after cast removal or surgery and by 2 years improvements have occurred.\u00a0 If the fracture is very complex or the patient does not comply with the proposed rehabilitation exercises, limited movement and pain may persist.;/ Osteoarthritis: Fractures that extend into the joint cause premature aging of the joint and can develop into osteoarthritis after a few years.;/ Osteoarthritis: Fractures that extend into the joint cause premature aging of the joint and can develop into osteoarthritis after a few years.

        "What is it?": "Pertrochanteric, extracapsular fractures occur in the region between the greater and lesser trochanter of the proximal femur. They occur in an area of \u200b\u200btrabecular bone, with an abundant blood supply, so, unlike fractures of the femoral neck, osteonecrosis and non-consolidation are uncommon.  Pertrochanteric fractures occur, on average, at age 70. They correspond to around 50% of all fractures of the proximal femur and are more common in women, in a ratio that can reach up to 8:1.  More than 90% of pertrochanteric fractures in the elderly result from a simple fall with direct impact on the greater trochanter.",
        "Symptoms": "Patients with pertrochanteric fractures are generally unable to walk and have a shortened limb with external rotation.",
        "Diagnosis": "Normally, simple radiographs are sufficient to make the diagnosis and outline the fracture line.",

Surgical: the objective is stable internal fixation to allow early mobilization with load on the operated limb. The stability of the operated fracture depends on the bone quality, the fracture pattern, the quality of the reduction and the position of the implant. Surgery must be performed early, as soon as the patient is medically stabilized. Usually, fracture reduction and internal stabilization with osteosynthesis material are performed; on rare occasions, prosthetic replacement may be necessary in patients in whom the initial osteosynthesis surgery has failed and a new osteosynthesis is not feasible.  Recovery depends on early mobilization of patients with walking training and weight bearing on the operated limb according to the surgeon's instructions.

    "Fractures": {
        "What is it?": "Whenever a bone is subjected to a force that exceeds its adaptive capacity, the bone breaks, that is, we suffer a fracture. Depending on the mechanism and intensity of the injury, the fracture may be complete or incomplete, oriented in different directions, or result in multiple fragments (comminuted fracture). In some cases, there is a concomitant injury to the skin, leaving the bone in direct contact with the outside (open fracture), with an increased risk of complications, namely infection. Most of the time, a fracture results from considerable trauma, but in cases of osteoporosis or tumors (pathological fracture) it can occur with low-intensity trauma. Repetitive minor trauma can also lead to the development of a particular type of fracture, the stress fracture.",
        "Symptoms": "Most patients complain of marked pain in the affected area and functional disability. Other common symptoms are edema (swelling) and deformity.",
        "Diagnosis": "The history and clinical examination, including a description of the accident, usually lead to suspicion of a fracture. An X-ray confirms the diagnosis and helps define a treatment plan. In some cases, a computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be necessary.",
        "Treatment": "The goal of any treatment of a fracture, whether conservative or surgical, is to replace and maintain the fractured fragments in their correct position until the bone consolidates (i.e. until the bone fuses), which occurs in a variable amount of time depending on the bone affected. The replacement of the fragments in their position is called reduction, which can be done by manipulation or surgically. Once the fracture has been reduced, it is necessary to maintain it in that position, for which reason plaster immobilization, orthoses (splints, braces, etc.), or external fixators (devices that are placed on the bone at a distance from the fracture and joined by bars outside the skin, commonly used in cases of open fractures). When surgery is chosen, the reduction can be maintained using screws, plates and rods or pins, which, as long as they do not cause symptoms, can be maintained indefinitely. Several factors will interfere with the consolidation time, some dependent on the fracture (affected bone, location, type of fracture, etc.), others on the patient (age, nutritional status, associated diseases, etc.). In a study carried out in Sweden, it was concluded that the probability of a child (up to 16 years old) suffering a fracture was 42% for boys and 27% for girls. From these numbers it is clear that fractures are relatively common in children, but why does this happen? Children's bones have accelerated metabolic activity due to the growth process. They grow in length due to the growth cartilages at the ends of the long bones, and they grow in width due to the periosteum that covers the bones along their length. Long bones are tubular to be able to absorb deforming forces during a fall without fracturing. Children's bones are immature and therefore more flexible and can absorb impacts more easily. However, in the first years of life, they are not very resistant to twisting movements and therefore it is not uncommon for a child who has just started to walk to suffer a small fracture of the lower limb just because the foot gets stuck on the floor or because the thigh gets stuck in the railing. from the bed. Children also suffer similar fractures to adults, such as joint fractures or diaphyseal fractures (end of the bone), all depending on the fracture mechanism. But they are subject to another type of fractures related to the child's anatomical differences (plastic, compression, green branch, epiphyseal or growth cartilage deformity). The doctor has to assess not only the type of fracture but also the body's ability to respond to each fracture. On the other hand, given that the child is growing, it is necessary to consider the influence that the fracture may have on bone growth, which is sometimes not easy to predict at the initial stage. For this reason, complex fractures should be evaluated by orthopedists familiar with the treatment of children. Fractures involving the elbow in children are those that cause the most medical problems, not only due to the risk of vascular changes but also due to the difficulty of treating them, due to anatomical conditions. The most relevant complication of fractures in children is a growth disorder, however, these are rare. Children often \u201cbreak\u201d because they are very active and fall very easily, using their hands as bumpers. Hence the high frequency of fractures involving the hands and the distal end of the forearm (more than 50%). These are generally simple fractures (plastic, compression or green branch deformity) and without any functional repercussions in the future. Adolescent fractures, normally associated with sports, can be more complex, especially when located in the lower limbs and can be responsible for late sequelae. In conclusion, we can say that fractures in children and adolescents are relatively common, but in most cases they are simple situations, easy to treat and with no repercussions in adulthood. Elbow fractures in children, or lower limb fractures in teenagers may be the exception with an increased risk of complications.

    "Stress fractures": {
        "What is it?": "This type of fracture corresponds to a small break in the continuity of the bone. They can result from overuse, such as in high-impact sports (long-distance running or basketball). Tennis, gymnastics and dancing are also associated with a higher risk of stress fractures, given the repeated impact of the foot on the ground.  Most of these fractures occur in the weight-bearing bones of the foot and lower leg.  When muscles are fatigued, they are no longer able to absorb the shock resulting from repeated impacts and transfer this stress to the bones, which can cause small fractures.  The most common sites are the second and third metatarsals of the foot, the calcaneus, the fibula, and a bone in the midfoot.",
        "Symptoms": "One of the most common symptoms is pain that develops gradually, increases with activities that involve weight bearing and decreases with rest.  Swelling of the foot or outer ankle and tenderness at the fracture site may occur.  Sometimes a hematoma forms.",
        "Causes": "As noted, stress fractures occur in high-impact activities and depend on the frequency, duration, and intensity of exercise.  People who don't exercise can also develop stress fractures. In the presence of osteoporosis or other diseases that weaken the bone, even daily activities can cause stress fractures. This condition is referred to as bone insufficiency.  Poor conditioning, i.e. doing too much exercise too soon, is a major risk factor for stress fractures.  Using worn or inadequate equipment is another factor to consider, as well as a change in the surface on which the exercise is performed.  An inadequate technique that alters the mechanics of absorbing impacts on the ground.  Sometimes, the presence of a blister, callus or tendonitis affects the way the foot absorbs impact from the ground and can increase the risk by forcing a smaller area of \u200b\u200bbone to support more weight than usual.  In females, the absence or irregularity of the menstrual period is associated with a decrease in bone density, increasing the risk of fractures.",
        "Diagnosis": "Medical observation and clinical history are the starting point for diagnosis.  Stress fractures are difficult to visualize on an x-ray unless they are healing.  Magnetic resonance imaging is the most effective diagnostic tool for detecting this type of fracture.",
        "Treatment": "Whenever a stress fracture is suspected, it is very important to immediately stop activity and rest. Ignoring the pain can lead to a complete fracture.  Ice should be applied and the foot elevated above the level of the heart. Anti-inflammatories help control pain and swelling but can slow bone healing.  Treatment depends on the location of the fracture and its severity and aims to return to the previous level of activity.  As mentioned, rest is very important. Generally speaking, it takes 6 to 8 weeks for a stress fracture to heal.  During this period, activities that do not involve putting pressure on the leg and foot, such as cycling or swimming, can be carried out. However, it is essential not to start any type of activity without medical approval.  The use of protective shoes, which reduce pressure on the foot and leg, or a splint that secures the foot and allows for more favorable healing may be recommended. The use of crutches also aids recovery.  In some cases, surgery is important, using internal fixation of the bone with screws or plates, which allows for faster recovery.  Once healing is complete, activities can be gradually resumed. One option is to alternate days of rest with days of activity, gradually increasing the frequency, duration and intensity of exercise.  Another strategy is to alternate the types of exercises performed in order to avoid repeated strain on the foot and ankle. If this is not done, more extensive fractures that are more difficult to heal may occur, causing chronic problems.",
        "Prevention": "A healthy diet is very important and should contain calcium and vitamin D to stimulate bone formation and strengthen its structure.  Using appropriate equipment in good condition helps reduce strain on the foot and leg.  Performing different exercises in an alternating manner avoids repetitive stress, the main cause of stress fractures.  Any new activity should be started gradually, increasing duration, speed and distance at a rate of approximately 10% per week.  Strength training helps prevent muscle fatigue and prevents the reduction in bone density that tends to occur with age.

Hence the high frequency of fractures involving the hands and the distal end of the forearm (more than 50%). These are generally simple fractures (plastic deformity, compression or green branch) and without any functional repercussions in the future. Fractures in adolescents, normally associated with sports, can be more complex, especially when located in the lower limbs, and can be responsible for late sequelae.

    "Furunculo": {
        "What is it?": "A boil is a skin infection that originates in a hair follicle or sebaceous gland. It initially appears as a small reddish pimple, which turns white or yellowish as pus begins to form. Boils can appear on the skin of any area of \u200b\u200bthe body, but the most common locations are: Face;/ Neck;/ Armpits;/ Shoulders;/ Costas;/ Buttocks;/  Areas where there is greater sweat production (for example, armpits and thighs) are equally prone to the appearance of these infections. Boils can also develop on the skin of the ears, nose and eyelids (in this case they are called stye). When several boils appear in a group, the infection becomes more serious and is called anthrax.",
        "Symptoms": "The boil begins as a hard, red, painful bump just over a centimeter in size. After a few days, it may evolve into a softer, more painful lesion and form a blister filled with pus. The main symptoms include: Swelling;/ Redness;/ Dor;/  In the presence of large or multiple boils, general malaise, fatigue, swollen lymph nodes and fever may develop.",
        "Causes": "Most boils are caused by the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, which exists on the skin and in the hair follicles of the nostrils and does not usually cause lesions - the so-called \"saprophytic flora\". However, when there is a small cut, bacteria can enter the hair follicle and cause infection. There are certain conditions and health problems that can make a person more susceptible to this infection: Diabetes;/ Obesity;/ Weakened immune system;/ Malnutrition;/ Acne;/ Eczema;/",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of a boil is clinical and is made by the doctor by observing the lesion. However, if the patient has recurrent infections or has had an infection that has not responded to treatment, a sample of the pus may be sent to the laboratory for analysis.",
        "Treatment": "Most boils can be treated at home. Applying warm, moist compresses several times a day can lessen pain and help the boil open and drain pus. If the boil does not drain spontaneously, it may have to be drained and antibiotics may be needed for local or oral application. Situations that may require medical intervention due to the potential for severity and complications are boils located, for example, on the face or near the eyes. Likewise, in the case of patients with associated pathology such as diabetes or changes in the immune system, boils, especially if painful, associated with fever or large in volume, must be monitored by the attending physician.",
        "Prevention": "Boils are not contagious, but the bacteria that cause them can be easily transmitted from person to person through contact with contaminated skin or objects. Preventing boils includes good hand hygiene, carefully cleaning cuts in the skin, and not sharing objects such as razors, tweezers, or nail clippers. In situations where boils are frequent, it may be necessary to use antiseptic soap, antibiotic ointment or possibly oral antibiotic treatment.

It is a common condition, and it is estimated that more than 68 million people in the world have it, that is, 1% of the world's population. In Portugal, the incidence of stuttering affects around 100 thousand people. It is about four times more common in males. Approximately 5% of all children go through a period in which their speech may contain repetitions, pauses, blocks and prolongations. It occurs for about three months and in 75% of cases they recover spontaneously. If this does not happen or if other associated behaviors appear, it is necessary to consult a pediatrician. Stuttering is important because of its frequency and because it can be associated with reduced self-esteem, social isolation, anxiety and, in the case of children, be a factor in ridicule or segregation by peers.",

        "Causes": "Genetic factors are important, since there is a family history in around 60% of cases. Neurological and psychosocial causes are also possible, related, for example, to the demands of the environment and linguistic development in childhood. A head injury or stroke can also cause stuttering. Emotional trauma can also be the cause, although it is now known that this association is very rare. Stuttering is not caused by: Nervousness;/ Stress;/ Scare;/ Traumas and/or emotional states;/ Tongue size;/ Parental Negligence;/",
        "Diagnosis": "It is usually carried out by a speech therapist and involves a set of questions and tests that confirm the presence of this disorder. Diagnosis is not always easy because there are similar conditions in other diseases, in addition to stuttering being transient. Whenever there are doubts, it is important to investigate other clinical conditions that may be associated with speech disorders.",

    "Gastritis": {
        "What is it?": "Under normal conditions, the stomach wall is protected from the effects of the acid produced in it. When it is damaged, this acid can penetrate the mucosa, damaging it even further. Some gastritis cases develop with erosion of the mucosa, causing bleeding and ulcers. There are several types of gastritis: acute and chronic. In the first case, it appears suddenly and intensely. In the second, the bacterium Helicobacter pylori is one of its responsible agents. It is one of the most common infections in the world, affecting more than 50% of humanity and more than 90% of adults in some continents and countries, including Portugal. Here it is estimated that around 50% of eight-year-old children already have gastritis caused by Helicobacter pylori, and the number of infected people increases with age, such that this percentage rises to more than 90% in individuals aged 50. . In Portugal, the prevalence of patients without complaints is around 80%. And if left untreated, it can last for years or even a lifetime.",
        "Symptoms": "Many patients report pain or discomfort in the upper abdomen but in many cases there are no symptoms. In addition to pain, nausea and vomiting may occur;;/ In many cases, there is a feeling of fullness after meals;;/ In the case of erosive gastritis, vomiting or bloody stools may occur;;/ It can become complicated, progressing to ulcers, the formation of polyps and benign or malignant tumors;;/ In chronic forms caused by Helicobacter pylori, mucosal atrophy may occur, with destruction of the cells that produce acid and enzymes essential for digestion, which may be the cause of some types of cancer.",
        "Causes": "Most cases of chronic gastritis are a consequence of Helicobacter pylori infection. This bacteria is transmitted between people through contaminated food or water. In the case of erosive gastritis, whether acute or chronic, the most common cause is prolonged use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, such as aspirin or ibuprofen. Alcohol, cocaine and radiation can also cause erosive gastritis. It can occur after an accident, major surgery, serious illness or extensive burns. In these cases, we talk about stress gastritis. They also arise in the context of autoimmune diseases, Crohn's disease and infections caused by viruses, parasites and bacteria other than Helicobacter pylori. The risk of gastritis increases with age because the mucosa lining the stomach tends to become thinner and therefore more fragile. The presence of bile reflux into the stomach is also the cause of gastritis.",
        "Diagnosis": "The most important test is endoscopy with biopsy of the stomach. Biopsy means the collection of small samples of mucosal tissue that are later analyzed. It is also useful to carry out radiological examinations, laboratory analyses, stool studies and tests to identify Helicobacter pylori. This can be detected through a simple breath test.",
        "Treatment": "It is important to use medications that reduce stomach acid levels in order to reduce abdominal pain or discomfort. These medications include antacids, histamine receptor blockers and proton pump inhibitors, and it is always up to the doctor to select the most appropriate treatment for each case. If the cause is the use of anti-inflammatories, it is important that this medication is reviewed and changed accordingly. Treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection is very important, even if there are no symptoms, as it can lead to the formation of ulcers or stomach cancer. Treatment usually consists of a combination of proton pump inhibitors and antibiotics.",
        "Prevention": "There are some simple measures that can help alleviate your symptoms and prevent their appearance: Eat several times a day, in small quantities, in order to facilitate the digestion process that occurs in the stomach, without overloading it;;/ Avoid irritating foods such as spicy, acidic, fried or fatty foods.

    "Gastroenteritis": {
        "What is it?": "Gastroenteritis refers to an irritation and inflammation of the digestive tract, including the stomach and intestine. The most common causes are viral agents, bacteria, parasites and food poisoning. It is a very common problem in childhood and young children. Children up to three years of age have, on average, one to two episodes of gastroenteritis per year, with a peak incidence between six and 23 months. Diarrhea usually lasts an average of five to seven days. The cause varies between countries, depending on factors such as geographic location, socioeconomic factors and climate. Acute gastroenteritis is one of the most common causes of mortality in children in developing countries. Most deaths occur in areas where access to clean water and health care is limited. Around 40% of cases of diarrhea in the first five years of life are due to Rotavirus and 30% to other viruses. In 20% to 30%, bacterial agents are identified (Salmonella, Campylobacter jejuni, enterocolitic Yersinia, pathogenic E. colienteropathogenic or Clostridium difficile). In southern European countries, such as Portugal, Salmonella is the bacteria most frequently involved.",
        "Symptoms": "The usual complaints are diarrhea, abdominal pain, cramps, nausea and vomiting, but fever and headaches can also occur. They usually only last a few days, but can last up to a week. When diarrhea or vomiting is severe and persistent, dehydration may occur, which is manifested by sunken eyes, dry mouth, a thick tongue sensation and a reduction in the volume of urine, which takes on a dark color. It is important to emphasize that gastroenteritis can be extremely infectious. Infected individuals should wash their hands after using the bathroom and before preparing food for others. Ideally, the patient should remain at home until symptoms (diarrhea and/or vomiting) have been absent for at least 48 hours.",
        "Causes": "Most are caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated by bacteria (Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, E. coli, among others) or viruses (Rotavirus, Norvovirus, Adenovirus, among others). Salmonella infections can be contracted by touching reptiles, such as turtles or iguanas, and then putting your fingers in your mouth. It can also be transmitted between people, especially if someone with diarrhea doesn't wash their hands well after having a bowel movement.",
        "Diagnosis": "Generally, symptoms of diarrhea and vomiting suggest the diagnosis and no specific tests are necessary. A well-prepared clinical history and careful physical examination are essential, as they provide crucial information for diagnostic and therapeutic guidance. In severe diarrhea, when complications occur or there are doubts about the diagnosis, other investigations may be carried out according to the clinical picture. Microbiological examination of stool should not be performed routinely.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment involves drinking plenty of fluids, especially water, to avoid dehydration. It is important not to go without eating if possible. As symptoms improve, the patient can gradually include soft foods such as cooked cereal, bananas, rice, applesauce, or toasted bread into the diet. Most do not need anti-diarrheal medications, but these can be purchased at the pharmacy. This type of drug is not recommended for children. If vomiting is persistent, antiemetics can be used. Antibiotics are only prescribed for some forms of bacterial gastroenteritis. In severe cases, especially in children, hospitalization may be necessary for proper treatment and hydration.",
        "Prevention": "The best way to avoid it is by following hygiene measures. It is essential to always wash your hands after going to the bathroom, before handling food and after gardening or handling pets. Towels should not be shared with a person who has gastroenteritis and the bathrooms they use should be washed regularly. Patients with gastroenteritis should not go to school or work until at least 48 hours after the last diarrhea or vomiting to avoid infecting others.

    "Endoscopic gastroplasty": {
        "What is it?": "The EndoSleeve or APOLLO method, also known as Endoscopic Gastroplasty, is a new scarless treatment for gastric reduction and consists of sutures inserted into the internal cavity of the stomach to limit the volume of the stomach. Endosleeve is not an operation, but an endoscopic procedure: sutures in the internal cavity of the stomach are inserted through an endoscope through the patient's mouth. The procedure is performed under general anesthesia in a surgical center with all safety measures and by specialists.",
        "Who is it suitable for?": "Patients with mild to moderate obesity, as well as patients at high cardiopulmonary risk and the elderly may be indicated for this Endoscopic Gastroplasty. The endoscopic procedure will not be indicated when the patient has more severe obesity; in these cases, surgical therapies must be performed, as they are more effective. In general, Endoscopic Gastroplasty has the same application for patients who would previously need a gastric balloon, but more definitively (the balloon always has to be removed).",
        "How is it done?": "The Apollo Overstich technology is inserted endoscopically during an oral endoscopy under general anaesthesia. Endoscopic Gastroplasty typically takes about an hour. The patient is then initially allowed to consume a liquid diet immediately after the procedure. Thereafter, food intake is slowly advanced through nutritional counselling.",
        "The results": "The resulting reduction in stomach capacity allows for rapid satiety when small amounts of food are consumed. This system allows for a reduction in stomach volume without post-operative incisions, thus avoiding the disadvantages of traditional surgery. With EndoSleeve therapy, there is a reduction in appetite and a lasting feeling of satiety, leading to weight loss.",
        "After bariatric surgery": "Patients who have undergone bariatric surgeries such as Gastric Bypass or Gastric Sleeve, and who suffer from problems such as Dumping, Reflux, diarrhea or who progressively gain weight, can benefit from this technology. The Endoscopic Gastroplasty procedure can reduce the diameter and volumes of previous surgeries, returning weight loss, being effective for many of the aforementioned complications of surgery. Surgical treatment for obesity and diabetes can be performed using different techniques, depending on the objective and characteristics of each person. Diabetics are at risk for COVID-19 infection, not because they have a greater chance of contracting it, but rather because of the severity of the complications. Diabetes in children is increasingly common and is a chronic disease that can have several complications. Keeping it under control is essential.

    "Giardiase": {
        "What is it?": "It is an intestinal infection caused by the parasite Giardia lamblia (also known as G. intestinalis or G. duodenalis). Transmission usually occurs through ingestion of contaminated water, with outbreaks sometimes occurring in daycare centers and day care centers. As it originates in water, contagion can occur in rivers, lakes, water from municipal fountains, swimming pools and jacuzzis. Or it can also happen through food and direct contact with infected people. It is more common in children and patients with HIV/AIDS, cystic fibrosis and other forms of immunodeficiency. In work carried out in the North of Portugal, in children aged between one and five years, an infection rate of 3.4% was detected by Giardia lamblia. This type can occur in any region of the world, with a special focus on areas with poor hygiene and basic sanitation conditions. The main risk groups are children, people who care for them and populations without access to drinking water.",
        "Symptoms": "The disease can be asymptomatic or manifest itself in acute forms through diarrhea (very liquid and fetid), abdominal pain, nausea and flatulence and, in chronic forms, through abdominal distension, anorexia, fatigue, weight loss and malabsorption which, for In turn, it is a frequent cause of iron deficiency anemia, together with inadequate iron intake and blood loss. It is important to emphasize that, even in the absence of symptoms, a person can harbor the parasite and transmit it through feces. Symptoms, when they occur, appear one to two weeks after exposure to the parasite. They persist for two to four weeks but may last longer or there may be relapses. The most common complications are dehydration, developmental delay (in the case of children) and lactose intolerance that may persist after healing.",
        "Causes": "This parasite lives in the intestines of animals and humans. It can remain there for months in the form of cysts. When they are released, they are eliminated in the feces. Ingestion of water or food contaminated by these parasites can trigger infection. In the case of food, as a rule, infection occurs during handling without proper care and hand washing. However, since heat destroys the parasite, cooked food is a rare source of giardiasis in industrialized countries. Direct contagion can occur, for example, when parents change their children's diapers and they are infected. For the same reason, professionals who work in daycare centers are more exposed to this parasite.",
        "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis is made by detecting the parasite or Giardia cysts in the feces by direct microscopy or by testing the serum. To be effective, this must be repeated over several days. It is also possible to analyze the liquid aspirate or perform a duodenal biopsy.",
        "Treatment": "In children and adults who are infected but have no symptoms, treatment is not necessary unless there is a risk of transmission. Therapy should be prescribed for symptomatic individuals, for asymptomatic carriers in whom there is a risk of contagion, for pregnant women or people with immunodeficiency. The most commonly used medications are tinidazole, metronidazole or nitazoxanide. The latter exists in a liquid formulation, useful for children.",
        "Prevention": "No medicine can prevent it. Thus, it involves measures such as washing hands after using toilet facilities, after changing a diaper and before eating or preparing food. If soap and water are not available, an alcohol-based sanitizer is a good alternative. You should avoid drinking unfiltered or unboiled water from wells, lakes or rivers (for at least ten minutes). You should not swallow potentially contaminated water in swimming pools. When traveling to places where the water supply is unsafe, the alternative is to always consume bottled water, which is also used to brush your teeth. In these places, you should avoid ice and eat fruit or vegetables, even if you peel them yourself. Using a condom is a fundamental way of preventing various sexually transmitted diseases and, in the case of anal sex, it prevents infection by Giardia.

    "Glaucoma": {
        "What is it?": "Depending on the type, the mechanisms are different. In general, what happens in glaucoma is a disturbance in the dynamics of intraocular fluids that causes them to accumulate, with a consequent increase in pressure on the delicate nerve cells that are the basis of vision, causing their death and eventual blindness. In addition to this effect, there are other mechanisms of a vascular nature also associated with glaucoma, sometimes even with normal intraocular pressures. This is why regular assessment is important, even in the absence of complaints. It is one of the main causes of blindness in adults in the Western world. It is estimated that one in seven blind individuals is a victim of this disease. Almost everyone has normal vision for part of their lives, as glaucoma rarely presents before the age of 35. Vision loss usually occurs at age 40, 50 or 60 and cannot be recovered. For this reason, early diagnosis is the key to preventing this pathology. According to the Directorate-General for Health, in Portugal, around 200,000 people have intraocular hypertension and of these, a third suffer from glaucoma. Around six thousand may progress to irreversible blindness and/or marked degradation of the visual field.",
        "Symptoms": "There are two main forms of glaucoma, acute and chronic. The acute form appears suddenly, causing blurred vision, redness and intense pain in and around the eyes. Chronic, more common, progresses more slowly and is not painful. Those affected are only vaguely bothered by the symptoms, which are transient, and therefore postpone seeing an ophthalmologist. Higher than normal intraocular pressure causes destruction of the thin and delicate nerve fibers that form the optic nerve. Since it is this nerve that transmits visual messages from the eyes to the brain, its health is essential for good vision. Under prolonged high intraocular pressure, the optic nerve deteriorates and the patient's visual field gradually becomes smaller. Surprisingly, most people do not notice these changes until extensive loss of peripheral vision occurs. If the damage to the optic nerve is not stopped, glaucoma causes tunnel vision and permanent blindness that cannot be restored by treatment. This process can occur within a few years.",
        "Causes": "Some of the risk factors already identified are a family history of glaucoma, myopia, high blood pressure and diabetes. In general, age is important in its onset, since it is a disease with a significant vascular degenerative component. Although there are also rare forms of congenital and infantile glaucoma.",
        "Diagnosis": "In an Ophthalmology consultation, where vision is assessed, intraocular pressure measured and the eyes properly observed. Whenever the doctor suspects glaucoma, additional, simple and non-invasive tests are requested, which allow for an accurate and quick diagnosis. This ophthalmological evaluation should be carried out regularly, at least once a year.",
        "Treatment": "For treatment to be fully effective, it must be started before serious damage to the optic nerve occurs. This is why early diagnosis is essential. The doctor can detect things that a glaucoma patient cannot: optic nerve abnormalities and subtle changes in the visual field. It is these signs, more than elevated intraocular pressure, that indicate the presence of glaucoma. There are currently several treatments for glaucoma. In most cases, one or more eye drops are applied to control intraocular pressure. It is a simple and very effective therapy as long as it is maintained regularly. As alternatives, laser or surgery can be used. The option for the most appropriate treatment must always be decided individually, based on the assessment carried out by the doctor.",
        "Prevention": "There is no way to prevent glaucoma. What can be done is to prevent its progression to severe forms with vision impairment.

    "Glomerulonephritis": {
        "What is it?": "It is a form of kidney disease in which the glomeruli, which filter metabolic wastes and fluids from the blood, are damaged. It can be defined as an inflammatory, non-purulent, bilateral and symmetrical process that fundamentally or initially affects the renal glomeruli. If this disease is not stopped, the kidneys may stop functioning, leading to renal failure. Glomerulonephritis can be acute, when it develops suddenly, or chronic. Acute forms can occur after a throat or skin infection and sometimes improve spontaneously. Damage to the glomeruli allows loss of blood and protein through urine and is an important cause of kidney dysfunction. In children it corresponds to around 27% of cases and, in adults, around 8%. In Portugal, some studies point to this pathology as the cause of kidney disease in children in around 20%. Men tend to be more affected than women.",
        "Symptoms": "The most common symptoms are bloody urine (dark, rust-colored or brown) or foamy urine (due to the presence of excess proteins), swelling of the face, eyes, ankles, feet or abdomen, abdominal pain, blood in vomit or in the stools, cough and difficulty breathing, diarrhea, increased number of urinations, fever, feeling tired, loss of appetite, muscle and joint pain, and nosebleeds. Glomerulonephritis can progress to other complications such as acute nephrotic syndrome, blood disorders, chronic kidney disease, recurrent urinary infections, terminal renal failure, fluid accumulation with heart failure or pulmonary edema, increased potassium levels, high blood pressure, and greater susceptibility to other infections.",
        "Causes": "It can result from changes in the immune system, but the cause is often not known. In about 25% of cases there is no history of kidney disease. Glomerulonephritis can develop rapidly, with loss of kidney function within weeks or months. Risk factors include diseases of the blood or lymphatic system, exposure to chemical solvents, a history of cancer, streptococcal and viral infections (Heptatitis B, cytomegalovirus) or abscesses. Other conditions that increase the risk of glomerulonephritis include amyloidosis, some vasculitis and polyarteritis, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, use of anti-inflammatory drugs, Henoch-Schonlein purpura, lupus and various kidney diseases.",
        "Diagnosis": "As symptoms sometimes develop slowly, diagnosis depends on identifying changes in urine tests, requested during a routine consultation or for another reason. Blood tests are also useful, as well as the presence of signs of high blood pressure. These can detect signs of anemia, changes in albumin levels and can identify various markers of kidney or other disease. An abdominal CT scan or a renal ultrasound may also be requested. The diagnosis is confirmed by performing a kidney biopsy.",
        "Treatment": "It depends on the cause, type and severity (temporary and reversible or likely to worsen). Blood pressure must be controlled and this is one of the key points for successful treatment. In addition to medication for hypertension, corticosteroids and drugs that control the immune system may be useful. Plasmapheresis, a technique that allows the removal of circulating antibodies, may be useful in some types of glomerulonephritis. It is also important to limit the intake of salt, fluids and proteins. When kidney failure occurs, hemodialysis or a kidney transplant may be necessary.",
        "Prevention": "There is no way to prevent most forms of glomerulonephritis. Some types can be prevented by reducing or avoiding exposure to organic solvents, mercury, and anti-inflammatory drugs. Blood pressure control is also essential.

    "Gonalgia or knee pain": {
        "What is it?": "Gonalgia (or knee pain) is a common problem that can affect people of all ages, but is more common in older people. Although it can have several causes, it is usually associated with wear and tear caused by everyday activities, such as standing, lifting, bending and walking. It can also be caused by traumatic injuries, such as sports injuries, or diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. Especially when it is more severe, gonalgia can impair quality of life.",
        "gonadal symptoms": "The characteristics of knee pain, that is, the location and severity of the pain, depend on the cause. There are some symptoms that may accompany the pain, such as: Inability to fully straighten the knee;/ Swelling and stiffness;/ Weakness or instability;/ Redness and heat to the touch;/ Snaps;/  Some symptoms that should prompt a doctor's consultation are: Very swollen knee;/ Inability to bear weight on the knee or feeling that the knee is unstable;/ Noticeable deformity in the leg or knee;/ Inability to fully flex or extend the knee;/ Severe pain associated with an injury;/ Fever associated with redness, pain and swelling in the knee;/",
        "Causes": "Gonalgia can have numerous causes, of different natures, and may be associated with aging, wear and tear (due to performing repetitive activities), injuries, sudden movements, among others. Some examples of problems that can cause knee pain are: Injuries such as fracture of the bones that make up the knee (such as the patella), meniscus tear, knee bursitis, knee tendonitis, sprain or strain of the knee ligaments, and anterior cruciate ligament injury.;/ Mechanical problems, such as a dislocated kneecap, hip or foot pain (which can lead to changes in locomotion to relieve this pain, which in turn can put more pressure on the knee), and iliotibial band syndrome.;/ Arthritis: there are more than 100 types of arthritis and those that are most likely to affect the knee are osteoarthritis (the most common type to affect this joint), rheumatoid arthritis, gout, chondrocalcinosis (or pseudogout) and septic arthritis.;/ Patellofemoral pain syndrome: a general term referring to pain that arises between the kneecap and the femur. Also known as \u201crunner\u2019s knee.\u201d;/  There are several risk factors that can increase the risk of knee pain: Practicing certain types of sports and other activities that put more pressure on your knees. This is the case, for example, of basketball, as it involves a lot of jumping and turning, and running due to the repetitive impact. Some jobs can also put more pressure on your knees, such as working in construction or agriculture.;/ Excess weight or obesity: increases the pressure exerted on the knees and increases the risk of osteoarthritis by accelerating the wear of the cartilage in this joint.;/ Having a lack of flexibility or muscle strength, as this increases the risk of knee injuries. Strong muscles help keep joints stabilized and protected.;/ Previous injuries, which increase the risk of being injured again.;/",
        "Diagnosis": "Diagnosing gonalgia involves a physical examination in which the doctor assesses the presence of symptoms such as swelling, pain or tenderness, heat and bruising. In addition, the doctor may also manipulate the knee to see if the person can move the leg in different directions and push and pull the joint. In some situations, the doctor may prescribe some auxiliary diagnostic tests, such as: X-ray;/ Computerized tomography (CT);/ Ultrasound;/ Magnetic resonance imaging;/ Blood tests or arthrocentesis (taking a sample of fluid from the knee) when infection or inflammation is suspected;/ Arthroscopy (minimally invasive endoscopic procedure that allows you to visualize the inside of the joint);/ Bone scintigraphy;/",
        "Knee pain treatment": "Treatment for gonalgia depends on its cause. In general, it may include: Medication for pain relief and to treat the problem that is causing your knee pain, such as rheumatoid arthritis and gout.;/ Physiotherapy, to help strengthen the muscles surrounding the knee, giving it greater support and stability and relieving discomfort. In athletes or physically active people, it may be necessary to do some exercises to correct movement patterns and adopt more appropriate techniques. Furthermore, it is important to work on flexibility and balance. Wedges can also be used on one of the feet to support the arch, relieving pressure on one side of the knee most affected by osteoarthritis. Orthoses can also be used to support the joint.;/ Injections with medications or other substances directly into the joint, such as corticosteroids, hyaluronic acid, and platelet-rich plasma.;/ Surgery: in cases where it is necessary, it generally does not need to be done immediately and the pros and cons must be considered. Some of the surgeries that can be performed to treat gonalgia are: Knee arthroscopy: endoscopic and minimally invasive surgical procedure, in which the doctor introduces a small camera and instruments that allow him to visualize and repair some types of damage to the joint. Partial knee prosthesis: the area of \u200b\u200bthe knee that is most damaged is replaced, using metal or plastic prostheses. Total knee prosthesis knee: the joint is replaced with a prosthesis. Osteotomy: bone from the femur or tibia is removed to create better alignment of the knee and relieve arthritis pain. This surgery can help postpone or even avoid total knee replacement surgery.;/ Knee arthroscopy: endoscopic and minimally invasive surgical procedure, in which the doctor introduces a small camera and instruments that allow viewing and repairing some types of joint damage.;/ Partial knee prosthesis: the area of \u200b\u200bthe knee that is most damaged is replaced using metal or plastic prostheses.;/ Total knee replacement: the joint is replaced with a prosthesis.;/ Osteotomy: Femur or tibia bone is removed to create better knee alignment and relieve arthritis pain. This surgery can help postpone or even avoid total knee replacement surgery.;/  Less serious situations tend to respond well to some self-care measures that can be prescribed by the doctor who is monitoring you, such as: Taking over-the-counter medications, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, can help relieve knee pain.;/ Application of topical anti-inflammatory/analgesic drugs (ointments).;/ Rest in order to reduce the repetitive impact on the knee, giving the injury time to recover and preventing the damage from worsening.;/ Apply ice to the area (always wrapped in a towel or cloth to protect the skin) to reduce pain and inflammation. Do not use for more than 20 minutes at a time.;/ Applying heat, which may offer some temporary pain relief.;/ Compression, which helps prevent fluid buildup in damaged tissues and maintains knee alignment and stability. It must be tight enough to support the knee, but without interfering with circulation.;/ Do some stretching or lighter/gentler exercises.;/ Keep your leg elevated to reduce swelling, using a pillow or a reclining chair.;/",
        "Prevention": "It is not always possible to prevent gonalgia, but there are some measures that can help prevent not only injuries, but also deterioration of the joint: Don't be overweight. Extra weight puts extra pressure on your knees, which increases your risk of injury and osteoarthritis.;/ Have good physical shape, appropriate to the sport you practice. It is important that the muscles are prepared for the effort they will be subjected to.;/ Train your strength and flexibility. Muscle weakness is one of the main causes of knee injuries. On the other hand, very tight muscles also increase the risk of injury, so it is important to stretch.;/ When practicing sports, adopt correct techniques. If necessary, take classes with professionals.;/ Adapt sports practice to any health conditions. For example, people who suffer from osteoarthritis, chronic knee pain or recurring injuries should review their sports practice. Limiting high-impact activities may provide some relief from symptoms, and you may choose to do swimming, water aerobics, or other low-impact activities a few times a week.;/ Load more;/ About us;/ Events;/ Clients and Companions;/ News;/ CUF Academic Center;/ Partnerships;/ Contacts;/ Frequently Asked Questions;/ Join us;/ Virtual Visit;/ English version;/ My CUF;/ Access Solutions and Health Plans;/ Facebook;/ Facebook Instagram;/ Instagram LinkedInCreated with Sketch.;/ LinkedIn Youtube;/ Youtube award4;/ award4 certification1;/ certification1 certification2;/ certification2 certification3;/ certification3 Complaints and compliments;/ Complaints and compliments Privacy and Cookies Policy;/ Terms and Conditions;/ Whistleblower Channel;/ \u00a9 CUF 2024 All rights reserved Start;/ Health A-Z: Diseases, Symptoms and Treatments;/"

    "Gonarthrosis osteoarthritis of the knee": {
        "What is it?": "Knee osteoarthritis corresponds to wear and tear on the knee joint, with progressive loss of cartilage, appearance of osteophytes (\"parrot's beaks\"), deformity and joint effusion. It can occur primarily or secondary to fractures, meniscus or ligament injuries, rheumatic diseases, etc.",
        "Symptoms": "Knee osteoarthritis is associated with pain and loss of function, typically with decreased mobility and limited walking ability, significantly interfering with quality of life in more advanced stages. The knee is deformed and often has joint effusion (fluid).",
        "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis is performed through X-ray, and can be complemented by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).",
        "Treatment": "In the initial phase, analgesics and anti-inflammatories may be prescribed which, together with an appropriate physiotherapy plan, provide pain relief and improve joint function, although they do not treat osteoarthritis. Intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid (viscosupplementation) can alleviate symptoms, especially in the early stages of the disease. In cases where conservative treatment fails, surgical treatment is indicated. Different options are available, such as osteotomy (bone section and realignment) or knee prosthesis (joint replacement or arthroplasty), depending on the joint status and alignment of the limb. Having a cast on your arm or leg helps you recover from fractures and reduces pain. Know what to do in this situation. A dislocation occurs when bones in a joint, such as the shoulder or knee, are displaced from their normal position. Learn about treatment options.

    "Gonorrhea": {
        "What is it?": "Gonorrhea, also known as gonorrhea (or, popularly, as \u201cgoing hot\u201d), is a sexually transmitted infectious disease (STD) caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Gonorrhea affects both women and men, causing more symptoms in men, and can be transmitted by asymptomatic carriers. Gonorrhea during pregnancy presents a risk of changes in the development of the fetus, and can also be transmitted to the baby during childbirth. Like other sexually transmitted infections, gonorrhoea is defined as being subject to mandatory clinical and laboratory reporting. According to the rules of the Directorate-General for Health and because it represents an increased risk of contamination of donor blood, a waiting period of three months and subsequent diagnostic analysis are required before donations from people suspected of having the infection.",
        "Causes of gonorrhea": "Gonorrhea is caused by the transmission of bacteria through sexual contact (vaginal, anal or oral) between heterosexuals or same-sex partners. Sexual accessories are also a means of transmitting the disease, if they are not disinfected or protected with a condom (which must be replaced between uses). The possibility of contracting the disease is greater in women under 25 years of age, in men who have sex with other men and in people with risky sexual behavior.",
        "Symptoms of gonorrhea": "About half of infected women do not suffer from gonorrhea symptoms, compared to just a tenth of infected men. Asymptomatic carriers can, however, transmit the bacteria, which causes the disease, to other people. The bacteria mainly affects the genital tract and rectum, where the first symptoms normally appear, also affecting the eyes, mouth and joints. Genital symptoms in men are mainly urinary pain, yellowish or greenish discharge and swelling and pain of the testicles. In women, in addition to pain and discharge, there may be blood loss outside of menstruation and pain during sexual intercourse. In the rectal region, symptoms are common to both sexes: pruritus (itching), bleeding, pus-like discharge and pain when passing stool. False urges to urinate or evacuate (tenesmus) are also common. Isolated, this symptom often leads women to confuse gonorrhea with a urinary infection. Also inflammation in the eyes, sensitivity to light, sore throat, cough, and swelling and pain in the joints - as well as abdominal pain in women - are symptoms that occur occasionally.",
        "Diagnosis of gonorrhea": "The incubation period for infection varies from two to five days and, as sometimes there are no symptoms, it is important to carry out testing in order to interrupt transmission. Faced with undiagnosed and untreated gonorrhea, a pregnant woman can transmit the bacteria to her baby during birth, causing eye disease, which, in severe cases, can lead to blindness. Diagnosis involves examining the genitals and discharge; if there are symptoms, urine analysis or samples of exudates from the urethra, anus, cervix or mouth are necessary. The diagnosis will confirm the presence of the bacteria and rule out other infections such as syphilis, chlamydia or HIV, enabling simultaneous transmission of different infectious agents. It is important to seek a doctor as soon as any symptoms appear that may indicate the disease, especially if you suspect a risk situation, namely sexual activity performed without a condom, or if you are informed of the diagnosis of another person with whom you have had sexual contact. After a positive diagnosis, it is essential to inform others with whom you have had sex.",
        "Gonorrhea treatment": "Gonorrhea is treated with antibiotics and treatment may be recommended to the partner. After starting treatment, a follow-up visit is recommended after one to two weeks to confirm the absence of the bacteria. The infected person should abstain from sex during this period. Curing the disease does not mean immunity to the bacteria, which can be transmitted again.",
        "Prevention": "Diagnosis and treatment are essential to combat the transmission of the disease, which, despite often being asymptomatic, can have severe consequences. In the most serious cases, gonorrhea causes infertility in men and women, and pelvic inflammatory disease in women. Prevention of the disease is essentially achieved through care during sexual relations: Use a condom whenever sexual contact occurs, including vaginal, oral and anal;;/ Test yourself regularly for STIs (sexually transmitted infections) - both yourself and your sexual partners;;/ Do not share sexual accessories, disinfect them well and protect them with a condom before being used by someone else;;/ Do not have sexual intercourse if you (or your partner) suspect an STD.;/ Association for Family Planning, March 2024 Directorate-General for Health, March 2024 Mayo Clinic, September 2023 NHS, September 2023 Pedipedia, March 2024 SNS24, September 2023 WebMD, September 2023 Load more;/ About us;/ Events;/ Clients and Companions;/ News;/ CUF Academic Center;/ Partnerships;/ Contacts;/ Frequently Asked Questions;/ Join us;/ Virtual Visit;/ English version;/ My CUF;/ Access Solutions and Health Plans;/ Facebook;/ Facebook Instagram;/ Instagram LinkedInCreated with Sketch.;/ LinkedIn Youtube;/ Youtube award4;/ award4 certification1;/ certification1 certification2;/ certification2 certification3;/ certification3 Complaints and compliments;/ Complaints and compliments Privacy and Cookies Policy;/ Terms and Conditions;/ Whistleblower Channel;/ \u00a9 CUF 2024 All rights reserved Start;/ Health A-Z: Diseases, Symptoms and Treatments;/"

    "Drop": {
        "What is it?": "It is a disease caused by an inflammatory response to sodium monourate crystals, which occurs in people with high levels of uric acid. There are acute and chronic forms. Acute forms appear as sudden, self-limited attacks of arthritis (swelling, redness, pain and heat in a joint). While chronic forms result in the deposition of crystal aggregates in and around the joints, with progressive joint destruction. In addition to these manifestations, gout presents renal symptoms (stones and kidney failure) and metabolic symptoms (high blood pressure, high triglycerides). Patients are often obese, with high alcohol consumption and insulin resistance. It is a very painful and disabling illness. It is more common in males and generally begins between the ages of 40 and 60, and may be associated with a family history. In females, the incidence of gout is higher in middle age, especially in women taking diuretics and/or drinking excessively. In both sexes, obesity, high blood pressure, hypertriglyceremia and renal failure increase the risk of this pathology. It rarely affects children. The appearance of this disease in young people is often associated with genetic changes. The current prevalence of gout is about 14 cases per thousand in men and six per thousand in women. In Portugal, a prevalence of 1.6% is estimated.",
        "Symptoms": "Gout has three phases: Acute gouty arthritis usually occurs with inflammation of just one joint. The patient reports very intense joint pain with exuberant inflammatory signs (heat, redness and swelling), often starting at night, waking him up. The joints of the lower limbs are the most affected, particularly the first toe. This is followed by ankles, knees, wrists, fingers and elbows. The shoulders are rarely involved. When the foot is not affected in the first episode, it is very likely that it will be in the following episodes. The crisis resolves spontaneously after five to seven days.;/ The period between attacks, during which the patient is symptom-free.;/ Chronic tophaceous gout, which occurs in patients with untreated high uric acid levels for years. It is characterized by the presence of gouty tophi, which correspond to an accumulation of sodium monourate deposits in the joints and which, in the long term, contribute to the formation of bone lesions due to erosion. Tophus are found in the ear pinna, serous sacs, forearm, Achilles tendon, and fingers or toes. Sometimes there may be ulceration of these tophi, with the crystals coming out in the form of a milky liquid content.;/",
        "Causes": "It occurs when excess uric acid accumulates in the body, forming crystals that are deposited in the joints. It can result from either an excess production of this acid or the kidneys' inability to remove it. Some foods and medications tend to increase levels of these hormones, which can cause attacks: seafood, red meat, excessive alcohol, sugary drinks, aspirin, some diuretics, and immunosuppressants. There also appears to be a family predisposition to this condition.",
        "Diagnosis": "There are several diseases with symptoms identical to gout. For this reason, a correct diagnosis is essential. The clinical history is an important element, as is the medical examination. Identification of urate crystals allows the doctor to know if he is dealing with gout. Crystals can be obtained by sucking fluid that is analyzed in the laboratory. Determining blood uric acid levels is equally important, although they may be normal during a seizure and may be elevated in people who have never had gout. Radiography allows us to assess the presence of joint damage and, if necessary, even ultrasound or computed tomography can be used.",
        "Treatment": "One of the medications used in acute attacks is colchicine, which is very effective but is associated with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and other side effects. Anti-inflammatories reduce inflammation and relieve pain. Corticosteroids may also be helpful. Allopurinol is a medicine that helps block the formation of uric acid. As this medication does not relieve acute attacks, it should be started after the attacks are controlled and, in general, should be used chronically. Probenecid helps the kidneys in the process of removing uric acid. There are other therapies that, depending on the clinical condition, can be used in your treatment, such as the use of warm or cold compresses that tend to alleviate the painful component of acute attacks. Diet is a relevant complement to treatment. Drinks rich in fructose and alcohol, especially beer, should be avoided. Meat and seafood can also raise uric acid levels.",
        "Prevention": "During symptom-free periods, it is important to drink two to four liters of fluids per day, of which at least half should be water. Sugary drinks and alcohol should be avoided. The diet should be balanced, containing fruit, vegetables, cereals and fat-free or low-fat dairy products. These types of products appear to have a protective effect against gout. Meat and fish should be limited and properly controlled. Losing weight also helps to reduce uric acid levels. However, prolonged fasting or rapid weight loss should be avoided, as these can cause a temporary increase in uric acid.

    "Halitosis": {
        "What is it?": "Halitosis is the medical term used to designate the presence of unpleasant breath. Human breath is a gas with a complex composition, which includes multiple volatile compounds. There are several causes that determine the occurrence of these compounds, including general health status, physical condition, various diseases, food and medication intake, environmental factors and lifestyle. Around 75% of halitosis cases are oral in origin. Despite everything, this percentage has decreased in recent years, probably given the population's growing awareness of proper oral hygiene. Extraoral causes (respiratory system, digestive tract and systemic) are responsible for around 25% of occurrences. These are more complex to diagnose. In others, there is a gustatory or olfactory sensation generated by a decrease in salivary secretion, digestive problems, stress or anxiety, which can lead the person to believe that they are suffering from this pathology. It is estimated that up to around 30% of the world's population may have this problem frequently, regardless of gender, age and social class. Halitosis prevalence values \u200b\u200bin international studies vary greatly, between 2% and 44%. In Portugal, the prevalence is 49.5%. It is a condition with an important social impact and on the self-esteem of those affected. In fact, while there may be some concerns about physical health, most are more concerned about the social implications of halitosis.",
        "Symptoms": "The odors associated with this problem are varied, depending on the cause. Some people worry a lot, even though they have mild halitosis and others, with severe bad breath, on the contrary, don't worry.",
        "Causes": "The presence of food particles on teeth increases the number of bacteria in the mouth;;/ Foods: such as onions, garlic and seasonings. These, after being digested, pass into the circulation, reach the lungs and affect breath;;/ Tobacco: either directly or by inducing gum disease;;/ Poor oral, tongue and denture hygiene;;/ Lack of regular use of dental floss;;/ Gingivitis and Peridontitis;;/ Saliva: is important for cleaning the mouth and removing particles from the mouth. Some medications can contribute to reduced production of saliva, such as proton pump inhibitors, anxiolytics and antihistamines;;/ Mouth infections and inflammation of the nose, sinuses or throat;;/ Medications and illnesses: such as antidepressants, some types of cancer, metabolic diseases and gastroesophageal reflux;;/ Male gender;;/ Advanced age.;/",
        "Diagnosis": "There are several ways to diagnose it, such as the patient's self-perception, olfactory tests and sulphur compound monitors. Gas chromatography is the most reliable and objective method, but it is a technique that is not always available. It allows the identification of the chemical agents responsible for halitosis.",
        "Treatment": "Oral and dental hygiene is an essential step. The treatment of gum disease, periodontitis and cavities is very important and must be complemented by correct oral hygiene, which should include good toothpaste, mouthwash and dental floss. When the cause is not oral, it is important to investigate other origins, and treatment varies depending on what is diagnosed.",
        "Prevention": "Oral hygiene can not only treat halitosis but is also very important in preventing it. Brushing your teeth and tongue after meals, flossing at least once a day, and properly cleaning your dentures are some of the possible forms of prevention. It should be noted that toothbrushes should be changed regularly, on average every two to three months. It is recommended to have a Stomatology or Dentistry consultation once or twice a year. It is equally important to avoid dry mouth by drinking plenty of water and avoiding tobacco, coffee, sugary drinks and alcohol. Using sugar-free chewing gum helps stimulate saliva production. As far as diet is concerned, very sweet foods and drinks should be excluded.

    "Hemorrhoids": {
        "What is it?": "Everyone has hemorrhoids. These are normal veins that exist in the anal canal and that help contain feces. They are classified as internal hemorrhoids (located in the anal canal, above the anus) and external hemorrhoids (located under the skin, around the anus and outside the anal canal). When we say we have hemorrhoids, it usually means that they are the source of symptoms, which is why in these circumstances we speak of hemorrhoidal disease.  Sometimes, soft, painless folds of skin develop around the anus: these are called hemorrhoidal lumps and are different from hemorrhoids. The situation that most often leads to hemorrhoidal disease is constipation, causing the hemorrhoidal veins to dilate, become inflamed and can form proccidences around the anus. Situations such as prolonged diarrhea and others that increase pressure inside the abdomen (pregnancy, chronic cough, professional factors) can also lead to hemorrhoidal disease. It is an extremely common disease in the adult population, being rare in childhood. Its prevalence, although high, is difficult to assess, with very different estimates emerging, with incidence values \u200b\u200branging from 4.4% to 86%. It is thought that more than half of the population may develop hemorrhoids after the age of 30. There is no difference between the sexes, with it usually appearing in the third decade of life and reaching a peak between the ages of 45 and 65. In Portugal, it is believed that around 20% of the population over 50 years of age suffer from this pathology, and the number of surgeries exceeds 40 thousand per year. It is important to emphasize that there is no relationship between hemorrhoids and rectal cancer. Although the symptoms, in particular blood loss, can simulate it, it is essential that it is ruled out by carrying out a complete medical investigation, especially after the age of 50.",
        "Symptoms": "The most common symptoms are blood loss and protrusion during bowel movements, itching in the anal region and pain. Hemorrhoids begin to show symptoms when they increase in size. This can happen due to an increase in pressure in the anal canal caused, for example, by constipation or, in the case of pregnant women, by the weight of the fetus on the rectal and anal area. The main symptom is bleeding of bright red blood, which can be light and only visible on toilet paper or be abundant, covering the feces or even dripping into the toilet. Sometimes hemorrhoids are so large that they come out or prolapse through the anus, causing pain. These symptoms always appear after straining to evacuate or when passing hard stools. External hemorrhoids can accumulate blood and form a clot due to difficulty draining them, also caused by increased pressure in the anal canal. In this case, a hemorrhoidal thrombosis forms, which is very painful and is characterized by a hard \"lump\" around the anus. Hemorrhoidal shellfish may occasionally itch, especially when they are very bulky.",
        "Causes": "There is no exact cause. The vertical posture itself creates greater pressure on the rectal veins, which tends to cause them to prolapse. The most frequently associated factors are age, chronic constipation, excessive straining during bowel movements, pregnancy, intestinal malfunction caused by excessive use of laxatives or enemas, anal infections, cirrhosis of the liver and heredity. When the tissues supporting the veins stretch, they dilate, causing their walls to become thinner and more likely to bleed. If the pressure continues, the vessels will eventually prolapse. Sitting for long periods of time is another factor to consider.",
        "Diagnosis": "By proctological examination, which includes anal and perianal inspection, rectal examination and anoscopy. Anoscopy allows visualization of the anal canal through a short tube (anoscope) that is connected to a light source. When the main symptom is bleeding, it is necessary to complete the investigation with the study of the rectum and colon by performing a fibrosigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment depends on the severity of the condition. Milder symptoms can be relieved by dietary measures, such as increasing the intake of fiber (fruit, vegetables, bread, cereals) and fluids. It is important to reduce straining during bowel movements in order to reduce pressure on the hemorrhoids and prevent them from prolapse. There are some medications, such as corticosteroid ointments, that can relieve the symptoms. A warm bath for a few minutes offers some relief. This type of measure allows the pain and swelling to decrease and the hemorrhoid nodules to disappear. There are other therapeutic options, such as sclerosis or the use of an elastic ligature. In sclerosis, a substance is injected to cause fibrosis of the tissues and their irrigation, thus reducing prolapse and bleeding. Elastic ligation consists of inserting an elastic ring into the base of the hemorrhoid in order to produce a strangulation with the formation of an ulcer whose healing allows the mucosa to be fixed to the deep planes. In more serious cases: Instrumental therapy: is performed through the anoscope and consists of Sclerosis (injection of a substance that occludes and reduces the hemorrhoid) or Elastic ligation (placement of an elastic band that causes reduction and elimination of the hemorrhoid). Sometimes these two methods are used simultaneously. These are painless treatments, performed on an outpatient basis, and do not require hospitalization. 3 to 4 sessions may be necessary to complete the treatment.;/ Surgical therapy: surgery is indicated in the most serious situations and is necessary in approximately 10% to 15% of cases. In general, it does not require hospitalization and should be the preferred option when non-surgical treatments have proven ineffective, when there are lesions in the anus, in the presence of significant bleeding or prolapse and in cases of repeated thrombosis.;/ Treatment of hemorrhoidal thrombosis: when the thrombus is under tension and is very painful, it must be removed with a small incision under local anesthesia.;/",
        "Prevention": "Some important aspects are the regular intake of liquids and fiber, using laxatives in case of constipation to avoid straining during bowel movements and avoiding a sedentary lifestyle.

        "What is it?": "Hemovitreous corresponds to the presence of blood inside the eye at the level of the vitreous humor. The vitreous is a gelatinous and transparent substance, located in the posterior 2/3 of the eye between the lens and the retina. The presence of blood leads to loss of its transparency and consequent loss of vision.",
        "Symptoms": "Hemovitreous is the main cause of sudden, painless vision loss. The main symptoms are: Dark moving spots (floaters);/ Blurred vision;/ Loss of vision (varies depending on the intensity of the hemorrhage);/",
        "Causes": "Hemovitreous lesions can be divided into traumatic and non-traumatic. In non-traumatic cases, the most common causes are: Diabetic retinopathy;/ Retinal tears;/ Retinal detachment;/ Posterior vitreous detachment;/ Retinal vein occlusions;/ Age-related macular degeneration;/",
        "Treatment": "As the causes are varied, treatment must be individualized according to the origin of the bleeding. Treatment may involve clinical surveillance until blood reabsorption occurs. Full recovery of vision can occur over months. In other situations, due to the cause of the hemorrhage or failure to resolve the clinical situation, surgery (vitrectomy) and/or laser photocoagulation may be necessary.

    "Hepatitis": {
        "What is it?": "Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver that can have several causes, the most common being viruses. The liver performs several functions in the body, such as those related to digestion, energy storage or removal of toxins. When hepatitis occurs, the liver is unable to perform its functions and the damage caused to it can develop into cirrhosis or cancer. Since there are several types, their severity varies greatly. Some forms are resolved only with rest, while in other cases there may be a need to resort to a more complex treatment that allows the progression of the disease to be controlled without curing it. Within hepatitis caused by bacteria or viruses, there are six different types of viruses: A, B, C, D, E and G.",
        "Hepatitis A": "Hepatitis A and E result from ingesting contaminated water or food. B, C and D require the virus to come into contact with the patient's blood from other fluids, as can occur in sexual intercourse, blood transfusion, sharing syringes or transmission from mother to child during pregnancy. Recently discovered, G is transmitted, above all, through blood contact. The most common viral forms are responsible for thousands of cases around the world. Hepatitis B and C often develop into a chronic disease. Hepatitis A is common in Portugal. In general, it appears in childhood or young adulthood. It heals after three to five weeks and does not evolve into a chronic disease. It rarely requires hospital admission. Initially it resembles the flu with fever, muscle pain and general malaise, then jaundice, lack of appetite and vomiting appear. There is no specific medication and treatment involves rest and a diet high in protein and low in fat. Although it is a mild form, it can be fatal in areas with poor sanitation. Prevention involves hygiene measures such as washing your hands whenever you come into contact with potentially contaminated materials and, if you go to Asia, Africa or Central and South America, choosing to drink bottled water and eating packaged foods. There is a vaccine that is recommended for people who travel frequently or stay for long periods in countries where the disease is common.",
        "Hepatitis B": "Hepatitis B is perhaps the most dangerous and serious, affecting millions of people around the world. It can become chronic and can be fatal, progressing to liver cancer. The main forms of contagion are sexual contact and the sharing of syringes among those who inject drugs. According to the World Health Organization, throughout the world this type has infected two billion people and causes the death of 600,000 per day. In Portugal, hepatitis B affects around 1% to 1.5% of the population. In acute forms, treatment involves rest. In chronic forms, medications such as interferons and others are also used to control Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection. Although it is a serious form, it can be prevented by vaccination, which is around 95% effective. This is administered in three doses and is included in the National Immunization Program.",
        "": "",
        "Hepatitis C": "Hepatitis C very frequently evolves into chronic forms. It is estimated that there are 150 thousand patients with this condition in Portugal. Those most affected are injecting drug users and people who received a blood transfusion before 1992. Sexual contact is a\u00a0possible form of infection, although less common. It can progress to serious liver disease and is, in Portugal, the main origin of liver cancer (60% of cases) and one of the most important causes of cirrhosis (25% of occurrences). Chronic hepatitis C is treated with peginterferon, whether or not associated with other medications. In situations of advanced liver disease, a liver transplant may be necessary. Data from the World Health Organization inform that there are around 150 million people infected with this virus and that more than 350,000 die each year from liver disease related to hepatitis C. There is no vaccine.",
        "Hepatitis D": "Hepatitis D only occurs in patients with type B virus, increasing the severity of this infection. Contagion is caused by contact with contaminated blood or sexual fluids. Although there is no vaccine for this type, as it can only infect patients with type B, immunization against hepatitis B also prevents infection by this virus.",
        "Hepatitis E": "Hepatitis E is transmitted by consumption of contaminated water or food and, in general, does not progress to chronicity. The risk of complications is greater in pregnant women. This hepatitis affects around 4.2% of the Brazilian population and there is already a tested vaccine, although not yet commercialized.",
        "Hepatitis G": "Hepatitis G was discovered more recently. All possible forms of contagion are still unknown, but it is known that it is transmitted, above all, through blood contact.",
        "Symptoms": "Most of the time it is not associated with any symptoms. When they occur, the most common are fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, dark urine and light stools, abdominal pain, and yellow coloration of the skin and eyes (jaundice).\u00a0 Hepatitis can become chronic and can progress to more serious damage to the\u00a0liver, such as cirrhosis or even liver cancer, when the clinical picture persists for more than six months. All types of hepatitis require a medical consultation and appropriate monitoring.",
        "Causes": "They can be caused by infectious agents, such as bacteria or viruses, or by the consumption of alcohol, medicines and some plants. There are also autoimmune hepatitis, in which the immune system attacks liver cells. This type mainly affects women, between 20 and 30 years old and between 40 and 60 years old.",
        "Diagnosis": "Through medical observation and the patient's clinical history, combined with laboratory tests that are considered appropriate.",
        "Treatment": "In general, in an acute phase, treatment essentially involves allowing the liver to recover, with physical rest and diet being important. The use of specific medications is important in the most serious and chronic forms, and should always be assessed on a case-by-case basis. These drugs seek to limit the multiplication of the virus and, therefore, reduce damage caused to the liver.",
        "Prevention": "Hepatitis can be a serious and difficult disease to treat. Effective prevention starts with each person's behavior. Hepatitis A is caused by the hepatitis A virus (HAV) and is mainly transmitted through contaminated food and untreated water. Preventing hepatitis A:Wash your hands with soap and water after going to the bathroomConsume only foods that have just been cookedDrink commercially bottled or boiled water if you are unsure of local sanitationEat peelable fruits if you are in a place with sanitation inappropriate You should only eat raw vegetables if you are sure they have been cleaned or disinfected completely Get vaccinated against hepatitis A before traveling to places where hepatitis A is endemic;/ Wash your hands with soap and water after using the bathroom;/ Only consume food that has just been cooked;/ Drink commercially bottled or boiled water if you are unsure of local sanitation;/ Eat peelable fruit if you are in a place with inadequate sanitation;/ You should only eat raw vegetables if you are sure that they have been thoroughly cleaned or disinfected.;/ Getting the hepatitis A vaccine before traveling to places where it is endemic;/ Hepatitis B is caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and is transmitted through contact with blood, semen and other body fluids.

    "Hernia abdominal": {
        "What is it?": "It corresponds to an area of \u200b\u200bweakness in the abdominal wall that allows part of the intestine or another organ in this cavity to protrude to the outside. Umbilical hernias are one of the common forms in the abdomen, as well as inguinal hernias that occur in the groin area. Another form is the incisional one that appears in the area where a surgical incision was made. It is estimated that around 10% of the population may develop a type of hernia during their lifetime. In the United States of America, around half a million surgeries are performed every year. Even in Portugal, it is one of the most frequent. Inguinal hernias are more common in men and umbilical hernias predominate in women. As a rule, its incidence increases with age.",
        "Symptoms": "Detection of a bulge under the skin, usually painless, but which can cause discomfort and become more evident during activities that involve effort, such as coughing. The hernia tends to diminish or disappear when lying down. The symptoms depend on the organ that has been introduced into the abdominal wall. In addition to the intestine, a hernia can contain the bladder, colon or nerves, with different manifestations occurring in the urinary or sexual sphere. In the initial stages, it is possible to reduce it, that is, to push its contents into the abdominal cavity. When it becomes larger, it can become incarcerated and it is no longer possible to reduce it. If the blood flow is interrupted, strangulation occurs, which is manifested by pain, nausea, vomiting and cessation of bowel movements with constipation. In this case, the skin over the hernia becomes red, with marked signs of inflammation. Fever may occur. In the strangulated form, it is a surgical emergency because the intestine or another organ may enter a phase of necrosis, causing a potentially fatal inflammation of the abdominal cavity, called peritonitis.",
        "Causes": "The most common are obesity, pregnancy, activities such as lifting weights, chronic cough (which occurs in diseases such as cystic fibrosis or chronic lung infections), constipation, male gender, existence of a family history and abdominal surgery. All of these factors, either due to increased pressure or weakness of the abdominal wall, increase the risk of developing an abdominal hernia.",
        "Diagnosis": "In addition to the medical examination, a simple abdominal X-ray can be very useful. Ultrasound and computed axial tomography are also important for diagnosis.",
        "Treatment": "For small hernias, treatment involves avoiding activities that involve effort, such as lifting weights or other types of strenuous exercise. Wearing a belt helps to reinforce the weakened area of \u200b\u200bthe abdominal wall. In general, surgery is indicated when the hernia causes significant pain or discomfort. The surgery performed is called herniorrhaphy and involves closing the weakest area of \u200b\u200bthe muscle wall. When this area is extensive, synthetic materials are used to reinforce the weakened structures.",
        "Prevention": "Maintaining proper posture whenever lifting heavy objects, maintaining a healthy weight and normal intestinal transit (avoiding constipation by consuming plenty of fluids and fiber and avoiding holding back the urge to evacuate for too long). Regular physical exercise is also important, helping to strengthen abdominal muscles and control weight.

    "discal hernia": {
        "What is it?": "In intervertebral disc disease, there may or may not be a rupture of the ligament with the disc contents escaping into the canal (foramen) with consequent compression on the nerve structures, spinal cord and/or nerve root. This compression may exist even if there is no rupture of the ligament surrounding the disc, which may be enlarged and thus compress the nerve structures. A herniated disc occurs when the nucleus pulposus, which forms the central part of the intervertebral disc, prolapses through a rupture in the surrounding annulus fibrosus and compresses neighboring structures. When a herniated disc compresses a nerve, it can cause pain, numbness, and loss of strength in the area of \u200b\u200bthe body that corresponds to that nerve.",
        "Symptoms": "A herniated disc can compress a spinal nerve, causing pain in the arm and hand (brachialgia) and/or in the neck (cervical herniation), numbness, tingling, changes in sensation and muscle weakness. In some cases, the herniation compresses the spinal cord, causing severe neurological dysfunction, with loss of balance, motor coordination, or generalized muscle weakness. A herniated disc can also compress a spinal nerve, causing pain in the leg and foot (sciatica) and/or in the back (lumbar herniation), numbness, tingling, changes in sensation and muscle weakness. A herniated disc can be caused by exertion, but it is common for the patient to not remember any particular activity or event that triggered the symptoms.",
        "Causes": "The natural wear and tear of the vertebrae as a result of repeated movements over time, as well as the bearing of excessive loads, are the main causes of degeneration of the intervertebral discs and herniated discs. The discs in the spine lose part of their nucleus pulposus as a person ages. This reduction in fluid makes them less flexible and more prone to herniating. It is not always possible to know exactly when the problem began, but it often occurs when lifting heavy objects.",
        "Diagnosis": "Although X-rays are part of the study of back or leg pain (in the case of lumbar disc herniation) or neck or arm pain (in the case of cervical disc herniation), in general, disc herniation cannot be seen in this examination since it is formed by non-bony material. The ideal examination for its diagnosis is Magnetic Resonance Imaging, or alternatively Computerized Axial Tomography. In some cases, a study of nerve conduction and Electromyography may be useful.",
        "Treatment": "Conservative, non-surgical treatment is effective in most patients and should be attempted initially. Treatment options include short-term rest, anti-inflammatory and analgesic medications, oral corticosteroids and physiotherapy. In selected cases, epidural injections (interlaminar or transforaminal) may provide lasting symptomatic relief. Surgery is only indicated in cases of persistent, recurrent or worsening symptoms after at least 6 weeks of conservative treatment, or in patients who initially present with significant motor deficits or urinary or bowel dysfunction. In the case of lumbar disc herniation, microdiscectomy is the most commonly used surgical procedure. It consists of removing the herniated fragment, thus decompressing the nerve, and can be performed using conventional or minimally invasive techniques. When it comes to a cervical disc herniation, microdiscectomy and anterior arthrodesis are the most commonly used surgical procedures and consist of removing the disc and herniated fragment via the anterior route and promoting intervertebral fusion by placing a bone graft taken from the iliac or a device containing a bone substitute. In selected cases, a cervical disc prosthesis may alternatively be placed in order to maintain movement of the affected segment.",
        "Prevention": "It is not always possible to prevent a herniated disc, but there are ways to reduce your risk: Use proper techniques when lifting weights. Do not bend at the waist, but rather at the knees, keeping your back straight.;/ Maintain a healthy weight.

    "Sportsman's hernia": {
        "What is it?": "Also known as \u201cpubalgia\u201d or \u201cathlete\u2019s hernia\u201d, it is a situation described several decades ago, being one of the differential diagnoses to be considered in the study of pubalgic syndromes, present in some athletes. The sportsman's inguinal hernia results from a weakness of the posterior wall of the inguinal canal but, unlike the previous scenario, here there is no detectable hernia on physical examination. It is a musculotendinous injury in the inguinal region. It is a painful injury to the soft tissues in the groin area that almost always occurs during sports that involve sudden changes in direction or twisting movements. Although a sportsman's hernia can develop into a traditional hernia, it is a different type of injury resulting from a tear in a soft tissue (muscle, tendon, or ligament) in the lower abdominal or groin area. The muscles most affected in this injury are the obliques of the lower abdominal wall as well as their tendons. One of the most affected areas is the insertion site of the thigh adductor muscle tendons into the pubic bone while the traditional hernia occurs in the inguinal canal. In 12% of cases it is bilateral. Men are affected more often than women. This situation affects 0.5 to 6.2% of athletes, of which 58% are professional football players. Ice hockey players tend to have at least one episode per season.",
        "Symptoms": "A sportsman's hernia is manifested by intense pain in the groin area at the time of the injury. This pain tends to improve with rest and resumes with sporting activity, especially with twisting movements. The pain becomes more intense during sporting activity and worsens with coughing or sneezing and with the act of kicking, in the case of football. This pain can radiate to the testicles. In this hernia, a protrusion in the groin is not visible, unlike inguinal hernia. However, a sportsman's hernia can develop into an inguinal hernia. This condition does not lend itself to physiotherapy treatment or rest measures, often forcing the athlete to stop playing sports for weeks or even months. If this injury is not treated, it can become chronic, with permanent pain that prevents sports.",
        "Causes": "Sports activities that involve placing the foot on the ground and twisting movements are those most frequently involved in soft tissue injuries to the lower abdomen or groin. Sudden changes in direction and foot movements are also associated with this type of hernia. Some of the sports most often associated with this injury are ice hockey, wrestling, tennis and football. It is not just professional athletes who are affected by this injury. It can occur at any level of physical activity. Another risk factor is the existence of an imbalance between the strength of the lower limbs and the lower abdominals. The existence of training plans that neglect the abdominal obliques can contribute to this problem.",
        "Diagnosis": "As there is no visible or palpable protrusion, the diagnosis is more difficult and is based on a medical examination, with some physical tests. X-rays, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging allow you to obtain additional information and exclude other injuries. Ultrasonography is also very effective in this diagnosis.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment focuses on rest and ice for seven to ten days. After two weeks, physical therapy should be started to increase the strength and flexibility of the abdominal and thigh muscles. Ice should be applied for 20-minute periods, three to four times a day. Anti-inflammatories help reduce pain and inflammation. If symptoms persist, it may be important to inject corticosteroids into the lesion site. In most cases, treatment for four to six weeks allows for a complete recovery. If pain returns when sports activities are resumed, the surgical option should be considered. Surgery allows the repair of damaged tissue and can be performed using the traditional method or laparoscopy, which is less invasive and allows for a faster recovery. In some cases, the inguinal nerve is severed during surgery to reduce pain. In other cases of persistent pain, the tendon that connects the thigh adductor muscles to the pubic bone is severed to relieve tension and increase range of motion. After surgery, a rehabilitation plan is defined which, in general, allows the resumption of sports practice 6 to 12 weeks later. In some cases, a sportsman's hernia may recur requiring another surgery.",
        "Prevention": "Prevention involves training appropriate to each type of sport, with strength and flexibility exercises.

    "A hiatus hernia": {
        "What is it?": "A hiatal hernia is the protrusion of part of the stomach through the diaphragm, passing from its normal position in the abdomen into the thoracic cavity. The abdomen is separated from the chest by a muscle called the diaphragm. The esophagus passes through it in an area called the diaphragmatic hiatus, before it joins the stomach. Therefore, the stomach is located entirely in the abdomen, below the diaphragm, and the esophagus is in the chest. This position of the digestive tract in relation to the diaphragm is not static and varies slightly with body position, abdominal pressure and breathing. There are four types of hernia, with type I, caused by the connection between the esophagus and stomach sliding upwards towards the diaphragm, responsible for around 95% of cases. The larger the hernia, the more common are complaints of \u201cgastroesophageal reflux\u201d, that is, a feeling of heartburn in the chest and the presence of substances in the throat, behind the sternum, due to stomach acid in the esophagus that causes damage to the hernia. wall. Hiatal hernia is relatively common, being reported in more than a third of elderly people.",
        "Symptoms": "The main complaints of hiatal hernia are heartburn and regurgitation, that is, a sensation of stomach contents rising up towards the throat. A large hernia can also cause difficulty in passing food, with difficulty in swallowing (dysphagia). However, not all hernias cause these symptoms, as there must also be a malfunction of the muscle at the end of the esophagus, the lower esophageal sphincter. This function prevents stomach contents, often acidic, from passing into the esophagus (gastroesophageal reflux). More than 40% of people have a sliding hiatal hernia, but the majority are asymptomatic and when they are not, the signs are usually of little importance. However, if it becomes trapped or compressed by the diaphragm and there is not enough blood, it is a serious and painful problem, called strangulation, that requires immediate surgery. In exceptional cases, microscopic or massive hemorrhage of its lining may occur.",
        "Causes": "A hiatal hernia can be a congenital deficiency or a consequence of thoracic or abdominal trauma, among others. This deficiency translates into weakness of the diaphragm or the presence of a gap that is too wide to allow the stomach to pass through. Although congenital hernias can occur, most appear in adulthood. The causes may be shortening of the esophagus or increased abdominal pressure that pushes the stomach towards the chest. The effort of vomiting can temporarily create this type of hernia in anyone. Likewise, excessive and sustained pressure on adjacent muscles, caused for example by coughing, sneezing, straining to defecate or lifting weights, may also be at its origin. Hiatal hernia is more common in people over 60 years of age and in obese people.",
        "Diagnosis": "X-rays usually clearly reveal their presence, although sometimes the doctor may have to press hard on the abdomen to reveal a sliding hiatal hernia.

        "Treatment": "Most patients with hiatal hernia improve with general care alone: \u200b\u200bdiet, posture and medication. Definitive treatment involves surgery. It is indicated due to the presence of gastroesophageal reflux and the changes caused by it.",
        "Prevention": "Prevention involves avoiding wearing very tight clothing, avoiding bending over or lying down after meals, not eating too much at each meal so as not to overfill the stomach, controlling constipation, sleeping with the head of the bed elevated, not smoking and maintaining a healthy weight.

    "Hernia epigastrica": {
        "What is it?": "It is similar to an umbilical hernia, but forms above the belly button. In general, they are small hernias and, therefore, only the lining of the abdominal cavity (peritoneum) can pass through. In the most serious cases, it allows the passage of an organ or part of the abdominal cavity. It occurs when weakness in the abdominal muscles allows tissue to protrude through the muscle. This type of hernia is usually present at birth and may heal without treatment as the child grows and the abdominal muscles strengthen. This type of hernia is more common in males by a ratio of three to one and its incidence is low, affecting less than 1% of the adult population.",
        "Symptoms": "Sometimes it is only visible when the child cries or does an activity that requires contracting the abdominal muscles. When it is visible, it is easily diagnosable and no other types of tests are necessary. If it becomes painful to the touch or the skin turns red and if these signs are accompanied by nausea, vomiting and pain, the hernia may have strangulated, a situation that requires urgent medical evaluation. It is important to remember that any strangulated hernia can be associated with the death of the tissues that were retained, with a consequent risk of infection, perforation and even death.",
        "Causes": "Although it usually occurs at birth, it can also develop in adulthood, in which case it is the result of a weakness of the abdominal wall, lifting heavy objects, coughing, constipation or being overweight.",
        "Diagnosis": "Observation of an epigastric hernia is sufficient to obtain a diagnosis. If necessary, an ultrasound or radiographic study may be requested to identify intestinal occlusion or other types of hernia.",
        "Treatment": "It does not heal spontaneously and, as such, always requires surgery. However, this can be postponed until the child is older, as long as strangulation does not occur. This way, it is more easily tolerated. There are two types of surgery, depending on the size of the hernia. For smaller hernias, laparoscopic surgery is preferred. For larger hernias, a classic abdominal technique is used. This is generally performed under general anesthesia and does not always require hospitalization. In the case of small hernias, the defect in the muscle wall is repaired using a suture. When the hernia is larger, a permanent mesh is placed to cover the defect in the wall. In most cases, patients can resume normal activities after two to four weeks. In the initial phase, it is advisable to avoid exertions that cause increased abdominal pressure, such as coughing, sneezing, crying, vomiting, sudden movements, or straining during bowel movements.",
        "Prevention": "When an epigastric hernia results from a congenital disorder, it cannot be prevented. In other cases, prevention involves avoiding excess effort and pressure on the abdominal wall. Don't smoke (to avoid bronchitis and coughing), maintain a healthy weight, avoid sudden weight gain, avoid lifting very heavy objects, prevent constipation and treat illnesses and allergies that often cause coughing, sneezing and vomiting.

    "Hernia inguinal": {
        "What is it?": "An abdominal hernia is a weak spot in the abdominal wall that allows part of the intestine or another organ to protrude. Umbilical hernias are a common form of abdominal hernia, as are inguinal hernias, which occur in the groin area. An inguinal hernia occurs when part of the lining of the abdominal cavity or a portion of the intestine pushes through a weak spot in the abdominal muscles. This is usually painful. The occurrence of an inguinal hernia makes it more likely that a second hernia will occur on the opposite side. The prevalence of hernias in the general population is estimated to be 3 to 8%. Inguinal hernias are twice as common on the right side as on the left in men up to the age of 40; in men over the age of 40, 40% of inguinal hernias are bilateral. In the case of inguinal hernia, as the male fetus develops during pregnancy, the testicles descend from the abdomen into the scrotum through an area called the inguinal canal. When a hernia forms because the hole is wider and the ligaments are weaker than normal, it is called congenital or indirect. When the passage of the intestine is due to a defect at the base of the inguinal canal, it is called acquired or direct. Soon after the baby is born, this canal closes, preventing the testicles from returning to the abdominal cavity. If this canal does not close completely, part of the intestine can enter there, causing a hernia. This canal is also present in female babies and, therefore, inguinal hernias can also occur in girls. These occur in about 1% to 3% of all children and are more common in premature babies. Males are more affected than females. They are more common on the right although they can affect both sides.",
        "Symptoms": "An inguinal hernia may be asymptomatic. However, it is possible to see or feel the bulge created by the hernia in the groin or scrotum, especially when standing, coughing or straining. In babies, crying tends to accentuate this protrusion and, on the contrary, it reduces when the baby is more relaxed. Many hernias do not cause any symptoms and are discovered by chance. In other cases, the protrusion is visible, especially when standing and when coughing or making other efforts. A hernia can cause a burning or painful sensation, especially when bending forward, coughing or lifting weights. There may also be a feeling of heaviness, weakness or pressure in the groin area. Occasionally, there is pain and swelling around the testicles, which indicates the descent of the intestine into the scrotum. Complications result from the incarceration of the hernia contents, making it impossible for them to be reinserted into the abdominal cavity. This reduces blood flow to the affected segment of the intestine and causes pain and tissue damage. When this flow is completely interrupted, we are faced with a strangulated hernia which, if left untreated, causes tissue death, with infection that spreads throughout the abdomen and can be fatal. Symptoms include pain, nausea, vomiting and cessation of bowel movements with constipation. In this case, the skin over the hernia becomes red, with marked signs of inflammation. Signs of strangulation include the presence of nausea and/or vomiting, fever, increased heart rate, sudden pain that increases very quickly and a change in the appearance of the hernia protrusion, becoming redder or darker. Strangulation may occur in 1.3 to 3% of hernias. A strangulated hernia is a surgical emergency because the intestine or other organ may enter a necrotic phase, causing a potentially fatal inflammation of the abdominal cavity, called peritonitis.",
        "Causes": "There is not always an apparent cause for an inguinal hernia. Often, the weakness of the abdominal wall is present from birth. In other cases, this weakness appears later in life due to age, intense physical activity, coughing associated with smoking, trauma or abdominal surgery. In men, the point of weakness is the inguinal canal, where the spermatic cord passes from the testicle. In women, a ligament that holds the uterus in position passes through this canal and the hernia can occur at the point where the uterus attaches to the pubic bone. In any case, inguinal hernias are about ten times more common in men. Inguinal hernias are more common in children who have a family history of hernias, cystic fibrosis, hip dysplasia, undescended testicles, and urethral anomalies. In adults, the most common causes are those that cause increased abdominal pressure: obesity, pregnancy, especially multiple pregnancy, activities such as lifting weights, chronic cough that occurs in diseases such as cystic fibrosis or chronic lung infections, constipation and performing abdominal surgery. Smoking, malnutrition and old age are other risk factors.",
        "Diagnosis": "In addition to the medical examination, a simple abdominal X-ray can be very useful. Ultrasound and computed axial tomography are also important diagnostic techniques.",
        "Treatment": "In the case of small, symptom-free hernias, regular surveillance may be sufficient. However, most inguinal hernias, if not treated surgically, tend to enlarge as a result of pressure exerted by the surrounding tissues, so early surgery is important to avoid the risk of entrapment of the intestine in the inguinal canal. For large hernias with complaints, surgery is essential and can be performed via laparoscopy or the classic route. In the classic approach, an incision is made in the groin area, the herniated contents are placed back into the abdominal cavity and the muscle wall is closed and reinforced with synthetic material. After surgery, activities are gradually resumed, and it usually takes about six weeks to return to a normal level of activity. In laparoscopy, small incisions are made in the abdomen and through them the hernia is repaired and reinforced. This type of intervention allows for a faster and less uncomfortable recovery.",
        "Prevention": "Prevention involves reducing the strain on the muscles and abdominal cavity, although it is not possible to prevent an inguinal hernia that occurs after birth. In adults, it involves adopting a good posture whenever lifting weights, maintaining a healthy weight and normal intestinal transit, avoiding constipation by consuming enough fluids and fiber and avoiding holding back the urge to evacuate the intestines for too long. Regular physical exercise is also important, helping to strengthen the abdominal muscles and controlling weight. The use of containment beads can keep the hernia in place but does not correct the problem.

    "Hernia umbilical": {
        "What is it?": "An abdominal hernia is a weak area in the abdominal wall that allows part of the intestine or another organ in the abdominal cavity to protrude outwards. The umbilical hernia is one of the most common forms. Generally speaking, it is harmless. It is more common in children, but can also affect adults. Some estimates suggest that around 10% of children have it. In childhood, the umbilical hernia becomes more visible when crying. Most of these hernias close during the first year of life, although they may take longer. When they do not close by the age of three, or when they appear in adulthood, surgery is important to avoid complications. Umbilical hernias tend to be more common in premature or low birth weight babies and affect both sexes in equal percentages, although some studies indicate a higher prevalence in females. In the case of adults, it is more common in women aged between 50 and 70 years.",
        "Symptoms": "It is manifested by the presence of a soft protrusion near the navel. Crying, coughing or other efforts make it more evident and, conversely, it reduces when the child is lying down or is calmer. In childhood, it tends to be painless. In adults, it can cause abdominal discomfort. Complications are rare in minors and result from the incarceration of the hernia contents, making it impossible to reinsert them into the abdominal cavity. This incarceration reduces blood flow to the affected segment of intestine, causing umbilical pain and tissue damage. When this flow is completely interrupted, we are dealing with a strangulated hernia which, if left untreated, causes tissue death, with infection that spreads throughout the abdomen and can be fatal. Strangulation manifests itself through pain, nausea, vomiting and cessation of bowel movements with constipation. In this case, the skin over the hernia becomes red, with marked signs of inflammation. Fever may occur. A strangulated hernia is a surgical emergency because the intestine or another organ may enter a phase of necrosis, causing a potentially fatal inflammation of the abdominal cavity, called peritonitis. In adults, the risk of incarceration is higher.",
        "Causes": "During pregnancy, the umbilical cord passes through a small opening in the abdominal muscles and this, in general, closes shortly after birth. If the muscles do not come together completely in the midline of the abdomen, a zone of weakness is created that allows the umbilical hernia to form at birth or later. In adults, the most common causes are those that cause increased abdominal pressure: obesity, pregnancy, especially multiple pregnancy, activities such as lifting weights, chronic cough (which occurs in diseases such as cystic fibrosis or chronic lung infections), constipation and abdominal surgery.",
        "Diagnosis": "In addition to the medical examination, a simple abdominal X-ray may be useful. Ultrasound and computed axial tomography are important techniques for diagnosis.",
        "Treatment": "Most umbilical hernias in children close before the age of 18 months. Surgery is only indicated if it is painful, if its diameter is greater than 1.5 centimeters, if it does not decrease in size after six to 12 months, if it does not disappear by the age of three or if incarceration occurs. In adults, surgery allows you to avoid complications, especially if the hernia becomes larger or is painful. The surgery performed is called herniorrhaphy and corresponds to the closure of the area of \u200b\u200bweakness in the muscular wall. When this area is extensive, synthetic materials are used to reinforce the weakened structures. Relapses are rare.",
        "Prevention": "It is not possible to prevent the condition that occurs after birth.

    "Herpes genital": {
        "What is genital herpes?": "Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted disease that affects the genital region and is caused by the Herpes simplex virus. There are two types of herpes simplex virus (HSV-1 and HSV-2). HSV-2 is usually transmitted sexually, while HSV-1 usually infects the mouth, nose, or, more rarely, the eyes. Both types can affect the genitals and the skin around the rectum or hands (especially the nail beds) and can be transmitted to other parts of the body. The prevalence of HSV-1 infection is 60% to 80% in the world population, which may mean that there is a large reservoir of this virus. This incidence depends on age, being over 40% at 15 years of age and 60% to 90% in adults. In developed countries, it is 20% at five years of age and 40% to 60% between the ages of 20 and 40. The current trend is for the incidence of HSV-1 to exceed that of HSV-2. Genital herpes is more common in women than in men because the virus is easier to transmit from man to woman than in the opposite direction.",
        "Sintomas do herpes genital": "Symptoms of the first bout of infection usually begin four to seven days after infection and include itching, tingling, and pain. In a second phase, a small reddish plaque appears, followed by a group of small, painful blisters or vesicles that rupture and merge to form circular ulcers, which are generally painful and covered with crusts within a few days. Depending on the location of the infection, difficulty urinating and, in certain cases, pain when walking may occur. Ulcers heal after 10 days and may leave scars. Lymph nodes in the groin often enlarge slightly and become painful to the touch. As a rule, the first outbreak is more painful, prolonged and widespread than subsequent ones, and can cause fever and malaise. In men, vesicles and ulcers can appear anywhere on the penis, including the foreskin. In women, they appear on the vulva, inside and outside the vagina, and on the cervix. Those who have anal sex may have lesions around the anus and rectum. In immunocompromised individuals, such as those infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), herpes sores can be severe, spread to other areas of the body, persist for weeks and, on rare occasions, become resistant to treatment. The lesions tend to reappear in the same and adjacent areas, because the virus persists in nearby nerves and reactivates to reinfect the skin. VHS-2 reactivates better on pelvic nerves. VHS-1 reactivates best in facial nerves, causing cold sores or nasal herpes. Either way, either virus can cause disease in both areas. About three to 12 days after the first appearance of blisters in the genital area, the herpes virus can spread to other parts of the body. However, serious complications are rare. The membrane covering the brain (meninges) can become infected, causing vomiting, headache, and stiff neck. The spinal cord can become infected, causing weakness in the legs or other symptoms. The nerves in the pelvic area can also be affected, causing temporary pain, constipation, inability to urinate and, in men, impotence. Although rare, the virus can spread through the bloodstream to the joints, liver or lungs, especially in newborns or people with poor immune systems. The most common complication of genital herpes is the reappearance of the vesicles, which, as a rule, are confined to one side of the body and are less intense than in the initial outbreak. The patient may feel discomfort, itching, tingling or pain in the affected area before each access. The risk of recurrence in the genital area is greater with HSV-2 than with HSV-1. In some people, outbreaks recur frequently for many years. The blisters can recur and extend beyond the genital area until reaching the buttocks, groin or thighs. In pregnant women, herpes infection can cause miscarriage or premature birth. On the other hand, the virus can enter the bloodstream and cause a serious and potentially fatal infection in the baby. As such, prevention, diagnosis and early treatment measures are even more important at this stage.",
        "Causes": "It is a viral infection that results from transmission that occurs as a result of vaginal, oral or anal sex with someone who is infected. The fluids present in herpetic vesicles contain the virus and contact with these fluids can cause infection. Infection can occur even when there are no visible blisters or vesicles because the virus can be shed from the skin in the infected area. Since the virus does not survive outside the cells it infects, it is impossible for contagion to occur through contact with sanitary facilities, towels or objects used by people infected with genital herpes.",
        "Diagnosis of genital herpes": "The clinical appearance of the lesions and their location are highly suggestive of Herpes simplex infection. For confirmation, samples of the lesions are sent for culture in the laboratory. Results are available within 48 hours. Blood tests may show evidence of past infections or suggest a recent one.",
        "Genital herpes treatment": "It is important to note that no treatment cures genital herpes, but only reduces the duration of each outbreak. On the other hand, the number and frequency of occurrences can be reduced by adopting continuous prophylaxis with low doses of antiviral medication. Treatment is most effective if started quickly, usually two days after the onset of symptoms. Acyclovir or related antiviral drugs can be administered orally or in cream form directly to the lesions. These medications reduce the spread of live virus from lesions, thereby reducing the risk of infection. They can also reduce the severity of symptoms during the initial outbreak. However, even early treatment of the first attack does not prevent recurrences.",
        "Prevention": "The best form of prevention is not to have sex with people infected with Herpes simplex. In the case of sexually active people, it is important, even in monogamous and stable relationships, to carry out regular laboratory tests to screen for this and other sexually transmitted diseases. Using a condom reduces the risk of infection by the virus. However, since herpes lesions can occur in areas adjacent to the genitals, infection can occur even when a condom is used.

Once infected, the individual never stops having this virus. Generally, the first outbreak is the worst, but not all are severe; some are so discreet that the person does not realize they have been infected with herpes. Over time, outbreaks tend to become less frequent and serious because our body begins to produce antibodies (defenses) to the virus.",
        "Symptoms": "Small blisters filled with liquid, called vesicles, appear on the skin affected by herpes, which are accompanied by tingling or pain. The vesicles then rupture and become covered with crusts that fall off after a few days. This process tends to repeat itself with varying frequency, from a week to long months or years. On average, each outbreak lasts two to three weeks. Although most lesions appear on or around the lips, cold sores are not limited to that area: they can appear inside the nose, on the cheek or on the chin.",
        "Causes": "The herpes virus is transmitted through contact with the skin of someone who has the virus and it is possible for contagion to occur even when the infected person does not show symptoms. Some ways this can occur are by: Kiss;/ Touching someone's skin, especially the face area;/ Sharing objects, such as cutlery or lipstick;/ Once a person is infected with the herpes virus, it never leaves the body again - it goes through some phases in which it is \u201cdormant\u201d and therefore does not cause symptoms.

        "Diagnosis": "When lesions are active, a dermatologist can make a diagnosis simply by observing them. To confirm the diagnosis, the specialist may take a sample with a cotton swab and send it for laboratory analysis. If, on the other hand, there are no lesions, other tests, such as blood tests, may be done to check for the existence of the herpes simplex virus.",
        "Treatment": "There is no cure for cold sores. However, the lesions often disappear without the need for any type of treatment. Many people still choose to do so to alleviate symptoms and shorten the duration of the outbreak. Typically, an antiviral ointment is used to relieve burning, itching, and tingling. Taking an antiviral medication orally or intravenously may also help a cold sore outbreak go away faster. These medications, when taken daily, can decrease the severity and frequency of outbreaks and help prevent contagion. However, they should not be taken without a medical prescription.

In women, it predominates in the groin, armpits and inframammary folds and in men in the buttocks and perianal region. It causes small, inflamed and painful nodules that can become very large, often causing abscesses that end up draining pus and causing large scars that interfere with the patient's movement and quality of life. The typical location and recurrence of the disease makes it possible to distinguish it from other skin diseases, such as: Epidermoid cysts;/ Acne;/ Folliculitis;/ Boils;/",

        "Causes": "Hidradenitis suppurativa is caused by inflammation of the apocrine sweat glands. Lesions begin with the occlusion of their excretory ducts, with a consequent inflammatory reaction. Obliteration of the pilosebaceous follicles and the release of keratin and cellular debris into the deeper layers of the skin also appear to be involved. Finally, various germs have been isolated, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Bacterioides spp. Anaerobic streptococci appear to be responsible for the intense inflammation and release of pus that characterize hidradenitis suppurativa.",
        "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of Hidradenitis Suppurativa is clinical and is based on the evaluation of signs and symptoms and examination of the affected area of \u200b\u200bskin. In the presence of lesions containing pus, material may eventually be collected for laboratory testing.",
        "Treatment": "A general study of the patient should be carried out to identify any associated diseases, such as diabetes and obesity. Local care should include hygiene measures with adequate washing, elimination of local friction, application of moist compresses, placement of padded dressings, and avoidance of tight or waterproof clothing. Several medical treatments have been tested with variable and transient effectiveness. We highlight oral corticosteroids or those injected into the lesions, oral isotretinoin, oral antibiotic therapy with clindamycin and rifampicin, oral finasteride and, more recently, biological agents (infliximab or adalimumab).

    "Hydrocel": {
        "What is it?": "The testicles are the organs responsible for the formation of sperm and are located inside a sac (scrotum). There they are surrounded by a liquid that facilitates their movement and reduces the risk of external aggression. Hydrocele refers to an increase in the amount of this liquid, as a result of an inflammatory process that affects one or both testicles. This is a very common situation in newborns because, during their normal development, the testicles descend from the abdomen to the scrotum through a canal. When this channel does not close, fluid may pass from the abdominal cavity and accumulate in the scrotum. Approximately 1% to 2% of newborns have a hydrocele, with this rate being higher in premature babies, and may persist in approximately 80% to 95% of newborns and 20% of adults.",
        "Symptoms": "Its main symptom is swelling of the testicles, which can affect just one or both. The dimensions of the hydrocele typically vary with exertion and may be accompanied by an inguinal hernia. During medical examination, it is difficult to palpate the testicle due to the liquid that surrounds it. If the patient experiences sharp pain in the scrotum or testicles, this could mean testicular torsion or another serious event and, therefore, this symptom requires an urgent hospital visit. A hydrocele, in itself, does not interfere with male fertility, but it can be a symptom of other factors that have an impact on fertility.",
        "Causes": "They may have a congenital cause and, in these cases, tend to disappear around 18 months of age. Acquired forms are based on inflammation of the testicles, related to tumours, testicular torsion or trauma. These are more common in young people and adults. Other possible causes are epididymitis (inflammation of the epididymis) or a previous operation for a varicocele.",
        "Diagnosis": "Through clinical history and physical examination. Illuminating the scrotum with a flashlight allows the hydrocele to be seen, since the fluid is transparent. Ultrasound is useful when there is doubt about the presence of masses in the scrotum. Laboratory tests may also be recommended to rule out an infection.",
        "Treatment": "As it usually does not represent a danger, its treatment is only indicated if it causes discomfort or when its size may compromise the transport of blood to the testicle. As a rule, surgery is not indicated in the first 12 to 24 months, as spontaneous resolution may occur during this period. It is only advanced if a concomitant inguinal hernia or other underlying testicular disease is present. The treatment is surgical, does not require hospitalization and is performed under general anesthesia. A small incision is made in the scrotum or lower abdomen to remove excess fluid. Needle aspiration is an alternative to surgery, but it is a less commonly used method as it is associated with a greater risk of infection and increases the likelihood of new hydrocele formation.",

    "Hyperbilirubinemia": {
        "What is it?": "Jaundice is the yellowish discoloration of the sclerae (i.e. the white surface of the eye) and skin. It is usually due to physiological immaturity of the newborn, but it can also mean illness, which is why parents should always inform the baby's pediatrician. Jaundice originates from the degradation of red blood cells.\u00a0 These blood cells are renewed periodically, that is, when some end their lifespan they are replaced by others. This renewal involves the intervention of the liver, whose function is to clean part of the degradation products from red blood cells. When the liver is immature, jaundice may appear in this physiological cycle, which is assessed by the quantification of a substance called bilirubin in the blood. In general terms, it can be stated that jaundice is more evident the higher the bilirubin value, hence the term hyperbilirubinemia. It should be noted that in black children, observing jaundice on the skin is more difficult due to the babies' natural color, which is why you should always pay attention to the color of the sclera.",
        "Symptoms": "The main symptom is jaundice itself, but in cases of blood incompatibility, associated with major destruction of red blood cells, there may be paleness of the skin and mucous membranes due to associated anemia.",
        "Causes": "In newborns, jaundice is in most cases physiological, or developmental, usually appearing on the 3rd day of life, as a result of the newborn's hepatic immaturity. Premature babies have a higher incidence of this type of jaundice, precisely because they are more immature. This jaundice, although not considered a disease, may require phototherapy. What determines the need for therapy is the level of bilirubin in the blood. Developmental jaundice usually resolves within 15 days of life. Another frequent cause of jaundice in the neonatal period is blood incompatibility between the mother and the newborn. Parents are familiar with the different blood types, as well as the RH factor. Incompatibilities can also arise between the blood of mother and child, leading to greater and earlier destruction of red blood cells, causing jaundice. Not all human blood is compatible with each other, which can give rise to defensive immunological reactions with the consequent production of antibodies. Other rare causes of jaundice in the neonatal period exist, generally associated with important diseases.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment for jaundice depends on its cause. Therefore, only after diagnosing the disease that is causing the jaundice can the patient be\u00a0treated. Carotenemia is the name given to this condition which, despite being visually strange, is not dangerous.

    "Hypercalcemia": {
        "What is it?": "Hypercalcemia corresponds to an above-average concentration of calcium in the blood (above 10.5 mg per deciliter). This situation can weaken bones, lead to the formation of kidney stones and interfere with the functioning of the heart and brain. Hypercalcemia may be caused by increased gastrointestinal absorption or an increase in calcium intake.",
        "Symptoms": "Sometimes it is not associated with any signs. In other cases, the symptoms are very serious and result from the effects of calcium on various organs. As the kidneys have to work harder to eliminate their excess, a feeling of thirst and an increase in the number of urinations may occur. Kidney stones that contain calcium can form. And if hypercalcemia is prolonged, calcium crystals form in the kidneys, which are associated with permanent damage and kidney failure. At the digestive level, hypercalcemia causes gastric discomfort, nausea, vomiting and constipation. Bones tend to be weaker, which causes pain. Muscle weakness may also occur. Osteoporosis associated with hypercalcemia can lead to fractures, deformation of the spinal curvature and reduced height. At the brain level, confusion, lethargy and fatigue may occur. In the most severe cases, coma and death may occur. At the cardiac level, arrhythmias or even death may occur.",
        "Causes": "People who consume large amounts of calcium, such as those with peptic ulcers and those who take milk and antacids that contain calcium, may develop hypercalcemia. An overdose of vitamin D can also affect the concentration of calcium in the blood by exaggerating its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Its most frequent cause is hyperparathyroidism, in which there is an excessive secretion of parathyroid hormones by these glands. The most common origin for this disorder is the presence of a benign tumor in one of these glands. Hyperparathyroidism is more common in women than men and develops more frequently in adults and in those who have received radiation therapy to the neck area. There are several forms of cancer that also cause hypercalcemia, such as kidney, lung or ovarian cancer. Others (prostate, breast, lung) can spread to the bones, destroying these cells and releasing calcium into the blood. Multiple myeloma (cancer that affects the bone marrow) and Paget's disease can also lead to bone destruction and hypercalcemia. Other situations include immobilized patients. Some medications, such as lithium, are another possible cause, in addition to the genetic component. Finally, dehydration can cause transient hypercalcemia.",
        "Diagnosis": "The condition is usually detected in routine blood tests. Other tests, including imaging studies, may be necessary to identify the cause.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment depends on its severity and causes. If the calcium concentration is not too high, base origin correction is sufficient. It is important to recommend that people with normal kidney function and who are prone to developing hypercalcemia drink plenty of fluids, which stimulates the kidneys to eliminate calcium, as well as helping to prevent dehydration. When the calcium concentration is very high or when symptoms appear at the brain level, treatment involves the administration of intravenous fluids and diuretics that stimulate its elimination. In more serious cases, dialysis may be necessary. If the cause is hyperparathyroidism, treatment usually involves surgical removal of one or more parathyroid glands. When hypercalcemia is caused by cancer, treatment is more difficult and involves controlling the underlying disease. There are drugs that help treat this pathology.",
        "Prevention": "Prevention involves drinking adequate amounts of fluids, controlling salt intake and maintaining physical activity. Whenever possible, it is important to avoid taking medications that cause hypercalcemia. Since vomiting and diarrhea involve fluid loss, it is important to treat these conditions whenever they occur.

    "Hyperglycemia": {
        "What is it?": "This term designates the presence of high concentrations of glucose in the blood. In general, it occurs when insulin levels are reduced or the body is unable to use it correctly. It is present in diabetic patients, both type 1 and type 2. However, it can occur in other contexts, even in the absence of diabetes. It can occur during periods when nothing is eaten, which occurs when sugar levels are higher than 130 mg/dL, after a complete 8-hour fast, or after a meal - in this case, blood glucose values \u200b\u200bmust be greater than 180 mg/dL two hours after eating. It is worth mentioning that, in the absence of diabetes, blood glucose rarely exceeds 140 mg/dL after a person eats. It is important to recognize and treat it because, in the long term, it can cause damage to nerves, blood vessels and various organs. Hyperglycemia in the context of diabetes has a very important impact, given the prevalence of this disease. In 2014 it was estimated that around one million Portuguese people suffered from this disease. In the age group between 60 and 79 years old, around 25% of the population is diabetic. Still in Portugal, around 2.1 million individuals with hyperglycemia were detected without evidence of the disease.",
        "Symptoms": "Its most common manifestations are frequent urination, thirst, constant hunger, headaches, difficulty concentrating, blurred vision, fatigue, itching and weight loss. If hyperglycemia is not corrected, skin and vaginal infections, difficulty in wound healing, loss of sensitivity in the extremities due to nerve damage, erectile dysfunction, digestive and renal changes tend to occur. In more severe cases, a diabetic coma (ketoacidosis) may occur. In this situation, since the body does not have enough insulin to convert glucose into energy, it will turn to fat as an alternative source. During this process, excess ketones are formed, causing a clinical picture of nausea, vomiting, difficulty breathing, sweet breath and dry mouth. This situation can be fatal and requires urgent treatment.",
        "Causes": "In patients with type 1 diabetes, the body is unable to produce insulin in sufficient quantities to metabolize glucose, causing hyperglycemia. In type 2 diabetes, insulin is produced but does not exert its effect effectively, with the same consequences. In a diabetic patient, incorrect treatment can be associated with episodes of hyperglycemia. In addition to this disease, there may be other causes such as eating a large meal, exercising less intensively than normal, an episode of stress or a hormonal spike.",
        "Diagnosis": "Hyperglycemia is diagnosed by laboratory measurement of blood glucose levels. Normal values \u200b\u200brange from 80 to 120 mg/dL for people under 59 years of age and without other medical problems, and from 100 to 140 mg/dL for individuals over 60 years of age and with associated disease. This measurement can be done as part of a more complete laboratory analysis or can be performed at home using devices specifically designed for this purpose. The measurement of glycated hemoglobin (A1C) allows the assessment of the average blood glucose level over the last two to three months, and is important for planning treatment. Ideally, its value should be less than 7%.",
        "Treatment": "Physical exercise is a healthy way to reduce hyperglycemia. A balanced diet is equally important. In the presence of symptoms suggestive of this pathology, it is useful to drink plenty of water. In the case of diabetes, adequate and regularly reviewed treatment is the best way to treat it. It may consist of a simple adjustment of the diet in mild cases or the use of oral antidiabetics and/or insulin, whenever justified.",
        "Prevention": "Prevention involves maintaining healthy lifestyle habits, a balanced diet and regular physical exercise. In diabetic patients, blood glucose control is essential to prevent episodes of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. This control involves regular medical evaluation, compliance with prescribed medication and blood glucose measurement. The patient must also always bring identification of their clinical condition with them so that, in the event of any complications, they can be treated conveniently.

    "Hyperhidrosis": {
        "What is it?": "It is a benign disease characterized by excessive sweating (perspiration) or hypersweating. Sweat is an essential mechanism for regulating the body's temperature and is controlled by the autonomic nervous system. When sweat production exceeds the normal requirements for this regulation, which occurs in around 1% of the general population, it causes great discomfort. Hyperhidrosis usually appears in childhood, more frequently in girls, and symptoms tend to worsen during puberty.",
        "Symptoms": "It usually appears on the palms of the hands, armpits, soles of the feet and face (sometimes associated with intense flushing), together or with a marked predominance of a particular region. When the incidence is seen in the palms of the hands and armpits, it changes the way these patients relate to the \u201coutside world\u201d. In fact, these people have difficulty in social contact, they avoid writing because the paper gets wet, they avoid greetings, picking up objects, working on the computer, driving because they are afraid that the steering wheel will become slippery. They frequently stain their clothes (appearance of a halo at the armpit level), wet socks that remain damp throughout the day, and they do not like to wear sandals or open shoes because sweat stains are visible. This whole situation, which worsens with heat and stress and stops during sleep, can cause serious psychological disorders, as there is a tendency to social isolation and hide the problem.",
        "Causes": "The causes of primary hyperhidrosis are not well known. Initially, it was thought that hyperhidrosis was associated with anxiety disorders and that it only occurred in anxious individuals or those with emotional changes. However, recent research has shown that individuals with hyperhidrosis are not more prone to anxiety, nervousness or emotional stress than the rest of the population when exposed to the same factors. In fact, the relationship is the opposite and it is hyperhidrosis that causes emotional and psychological changes caused by excessive sweating. Studies have also shown that certain genes play a role in hyperhidrosis. Secondary hyperhidrosis has a long list of known causes: Spinal cord injury;/ Alcohol abuse;/ Anxiety;/ Diabetes;/ Drop;/ Heart disease;/ Hyperthyroidism;/ Obesity;/ Parkinson's disease;/ Pregnancy;/ Respiratory failure;/ Shingles (caused by the herpes zoster virus);/ Some types of cancer, such as Hodgkin's disease;/ Some infections (HIV, malaria, tuberculosis);/ Medicines, including some antidepressants, anticholinesterases (for Alzheimer's disease), pilocarpine (for glaucoma), propranolol (for high blood pressure);/ Substance abuse;/",
        "Diagnosis": "Several laboratory tests of blood and urine are important to rule out the presence of underlying conditions, such as hyperthyroidism or hypoglycemia. Patients are also asked about their sweating patterns: which parts of the body are affected, how often the episodes occur, and whether they also occur during sleep. Carrying out the thermoregulatory sweat test. This involves applying a moisture-sensitive powder to the skin. When excessive sweating occurs at room temperature, the dust changes color. The patient is exposed to high temperatures and humidity, which triggers sweating. When exposed to heat, people who do not have hyperhidrosis tend not to sweat excessively on their palms, unlike patients with this condition. This test also helps the doctor determine the severity of the condition.",
        "Treatment": "In the first phase of the treatment approach, dermatology has a say, with various types of therapies. When medical treatment is not effective, surgical treatment should be considered. This is performed by videothoracoscopy, under general anesthesia and consists of removing fibers from the autonomic nervous system responsible for these areas, located within the thoracic cavity. The result is immediate and the patient is discharged on the same day or the next day, with completely dry hands and prepared to return to their normal life, without limitations.",
        "Prevention": "Preferably use light and breathable fabrics, such as cotton and silk.;/ Wear socks made from moisture-repellent fibers (merino wool);/ Shower every day with antibacterial soap to control bacteria that can live on sweaty skin and cause odor;/ Dry your skin completely after bathing.;/ Use antiperspirant;/ Avoid spicy foods, alcohol and hot drinks which are stimulants of hyperhidrosis;/ Medical News Today WebDM For those who suffer from hyperhidrosis, a condition that leads to excessive sweating of the hands, feet and armpits, the solution may be a 20-minute surgery.

    "Hyperopia": {
        "What is it?": "It is a type of visual difficulty that mainly affects near vision, although in higher degrees it also affects distance vision. It occurs when the eyeball is shorter or the cornea has reduced curvature, so that the light that enters the eyes is not focused correctly. Although it can occur in isolation, in many cases it appears associated with astigmatism, another disorder that causes visual difficulties. It is more common in children and, when values \u200b\u200bare reduced, it is not associated with visual difficulties. When it is higher, there is a risk of amblyopia (lazy eye) or strabismus. Unlike myopia, many cases of hyperopia improve with age and the child's growth. It affects around 55% of the population. In most cases, these are hyperopia of less than 0.5 diopters, which are not associated with any type of complaint.",
        "Symptoms": "It manifests itself in the form of visual fatigue resulting from the effort required to try to focus the images. This fatigue is greater at close range and worsens over time. In addition to visual difficulties, there may be loss of concentration, increased drowsiness and, in the case of children, lower academic performance. Congestion of the eye muscles caused by effort may be associated with a higher frequency of episodes of conjunctivitis and/or inflammation of the eyelids.",
        "Causes": "It occurs when the axial axis of the eye is short, when the radius of curvature of the cornea (transparent layer of the eye) is increased, when changes occur in the curvature of the crystalline lens (lens located inside the eye) or when it is surgically removed. In general, hyperopia is inherited, and there has been no evidence of environmental influence on its appearance.",
        "Diagnosis": "Its diagnosis is simple and is made during a medical consultation. In the case of children, it may be necessary to use drops that dilate the eyes and paralyze some of the eye muscles, so that hyperopia can be better quantified.",
        "Treatment": "It is corrected through the use of glasses, temporary or permanent depending on their degree. Contact lenses are also an alternative. In well-selected cases and after the age of 18, refractive surgery using a laser or the placement of intraocular lenses is a solution for those who do not wish to wear glasses or contact lenses.",
        "Prevention": "Although it cannot be prevented, there are measures to protect the eyes. It is important, among other aspects, to have a regular medical consultation, control chronic diseases such as diabetes and high blood pressure, consult an ophthalmologist whenever there are changes in vision or eye complaints, protect the eyes from ultraviolet radiation with certified sunglasses, maintain a healthy diet that provides the eyes with all the nutrients essential for vision, not smoking, using the correct prescription and always having adequate lighting.

    "Primary hyperparathyroidism": {
        "What is it?": "Hyperparathyroidism is a common condition in which one or more parathyroid glands become overactive and secrete excess parathyroid hormone, with increased production of parathyroid hormone and leading to symptoms resulting from excess calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia), in the urine (hypercalciuria), removal of calcium from the bones (osteopenia and osteoporosis) and kidney stones.",

    "Benign prostatic hyperplasia hbp": {
        "What is it?": "It is one of the most common benign diseases in men that is characterized by an increase in the volume of the prostate. The prostate is a gland that plays important roles in sexuality and, mainly, in male fertility and is located below the bladder, surrounding the urethra. When it increases in volume, it can gradually narrow the urethra, making it difficult for urine to flow. As a result, the bladder muscles become thicker and stronger in order to be able to empty it. However, it leads to complaints of urinary frequency, difficulty in urinating and, if left untreated, can lead to urinary retention and the need for placement. a civet for its emptying. It affects around 40% of men at age 50 and around 90% at age 90. It is, therefore, a progressive disease, with a significant impact on quality of life.",
        "Symptoms": "Its symptoms result from an obstacle to urinary flow as a result of an enlarged prostate. In the initial phase, there is difficulty in starting urination or a sensation of incomplete urination. As the bladder does not empty completely, the number of trips to the bathroom tends to increase, especially at night (nocturia) and the need to urinate becomes increasingly imperative. The volume and strength of urinary flow tend to be reduced and a drop may remain at the end of urination. In a more advanced stage, the bladder may overfill, causing urinary incontinence. In some cases, the effort of urination can cause blood to appear in the urine. If the obstruction is complete, urination becomes impossible, causing acute, very intense pain in the lower part of the abdomen. Bladder infections may also occur, with a burning sensation during urination and fever. Urine that remains in the bladder can be a source of urinary stones, the elimination of which causes pain. Rarely, if diagnosis and treatment are not carried out, urine residue tends to increase pressure on the kidneys, with the potential for kidney damage.",
        "Causes": "The causes are not well understood, although this pathology appears to result from changes in sexual hormones that occur during the aging process, including testosterone, formed in the testicles, and dihydrotestosterone, originating in the prostate from testosterone. Estrogens (female sex hormones) may also play a role in this disease. In fact, men produce small amounts of these hormones. In any case, the best-identified risk factor for this condition is age: more than half of men aged 60 have prostate hyperplasia. A family history also appears to be important. Obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, low levels of HDL (the \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol) and peripheral arterial disease are factors that appear to increase the risk of developing prostate hyperplasia, as do a sedentary lifestyle, smoking and an inadequate diet.",
        "Diagnosis": "It begins with the clinical history and medical examination, which may include a digital rectal examination, which allows the size and texture of the prostate to be assessed. Laboratory tests are important and allow the concentrations of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) to be measured, which is useful for diagnosing prostate hyperplasia and prostate cancer. Uroflowmetry allows the characteristics of urination to be assessed and the degree of obstruction to be quantified, and ultrasound of the prostate provides very precise images of this organ. In other cases, an endoscopic examination through the urethra may be useful.",
        "Treatment": "Current medicine offers different types of treatment for Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia. The aim is to eliminate or reduce the symptoms associated with this disease, prevent complications and, if possible, reduce the volume of the gland if it is enlarged.  Drug therapy Symptoms can be alleviated by using medications that relax the tone of the prostate (contraction of its muscle fibers) and thus increase the size of the urethra that passes through it, thus alleviating the obstacle to the flow of urine. If the prostate volume is increased, other medications that act on the volume of the prostate can be combined, allowing significant relief of symptoms and postponing the need for surgery, but generally with side effects on sexual life, namely erectile dysfunction and retrograde ejaculation (into the bladder).  Reduction of prostate volume through surgery In specific cases of large prostates, surgery is the best option whenever symptoms significantly interfere with quality of life. The most common procedure is transurethral resection of the prostate, in which an instrument (resectoscope) is introduced through the urethra into the prostate and a substantial portion of the prostate is eliminated. However, in some cases it may be necessary to resort to open, conventional abdominal surgery. In both cases, retrograde ejaculation (into the bladder) could be a complication after these surgeries.  Prostate volume reduction by water vapor (REZUM) Another treatment that has proven to be effective in treating benign prostate enlargement, as it has the same benefits as transurethral resection, is less aggressive than conventional surgeries and offers more advantages for the patient, is water vapor prostate therapy (REZUM). In this procedure, water vapor is injected into the prostate, produced in a special generator with controlled temperature and pressure and applied endoscopically to the prostate. It promotes the death of prostate cells around the urethra with subsequent reabsorption of the hyperplasia tissue by the body itself. This reabsorption can take up to 3 months, but patients generally feel relief from symptoms 2 weeks after the technique is applied. This technique is performed on an outpatient basis, with the patient discharged a few hours later. It can also be applied to some patients who do not have the clinical conditions for classical surgery.

    "High blood pressure": {
        "What is it?": "This is an increase in blood pressure above values \u200b\u200bconsidered normal. It occurs when there is excessive pressure of blood on the walls of the arteries during circulation. It can increase at certain times, due to physical or emotional exertion, and it is natural that, after these situations, its values \u200b\u200breturn to normal levels. This condition is only serious and causes health problems when it remains high for months, or when it increases suddenly. It is important to know that tension tends to increase with age. However, hypertension should not be considered normal in the elderly. As a rule, arterial hypertension is considered to be present when the maximum pressure is greater than or equal to 160 mmHge/or the minimum pressure is greater than or equal to 95 mmHge. High blood pressure is associated with coronary heart disease, stroke and heart failure and is the most common modifiable cardiovascular risk factor, which is why its treatment is essential in preventing these pathologies. Cardiovascular diseases are the cause of death for at least 34.1% of the Brazilian population, mainly as a consequence of stroke and coronary disease. It is estimated that the prevalence of high blood pressure in the Portuguese adult population is 42.1%, with only 39.0% of these patients taking antihypertensive drugs and only 11.2% being under control.",
        "Symptoms": "In the first few years, it does not cause any symptoms. Over time, blood pressure ends up damaging the blood vessels and the main organs of the body, such as the brain, heart and kidneys, causing headaches, dizziness, tinnitus and increased heart rate. The main diseases associated with high blood pressure are stroke, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, heart and kidney failure.",
        "Causes": "Around 90% of cases are related to lifestyle habits. Obesity is one of the important factors. Each pound of fat requires the formation of an additional 1.5 kilometers of small blood vessels to supply the excess adipose tissue. Increased blood pressure is required to pump blood through them. Therefore, being overweight by 20% or more increases the risk of hypertension by five times;;/ Excess salt consumption. It is known that high blood pressure is less frequent in populations where its consumption is low. Our body only needs 1/8 of a teaspoon of salt per day;;/ Tobacco is another cause to consider. Even just one cigarette can increase it for about 30 minutes. A pack-a-day smoker can, through smoking alone, cause an increase in blood pressure for 24 hours;;/ Around 5% to 15% of cases may be related to moderate alcohol consumption. On the other hand, one cup of coffee a day can cause an increase in blood pressure;;/ Physical inactivity and stress are also at its origin;;/ The remaining 10% of high blood pressure cases have organic causes, such as some hormonal changes, kidney or blood vessel diseases.",
        "Diagnosis": "It is important to remember that high blood pressure cannot be felt, it must be measured. In order to obtain correct values, it is important to rest in a sitting position for at least five minutes before measuring. You should use the same device and always measure on the same arm. The diagnosis of high blood pressure requires measuring an elevated blood pressure on three separate occasions over a period of a week or more. Once its existence has been confirmed, other tests must also be carried out to help understand its origin and/or the complications associated with it.",
        "Treatment": "Treatment depends on the severity of the condition. For example, people with moderate hypertension can control it by simply changing some lifestyle habits, such as reducing salt and alcohol intake, controlling their weight, exercising regularly and stopping smoking. There are several medications available for the treatment of high blood pressure that can be used alone or in combination. It is up to the doctor to decide which is the best treatment for each situation.",

    "Secondary arterial hypertension due to endocrine causes": {
        "What is it?": "Secondary hypertension is defined as high blood pressure associated with a direct cause that can be identified and treated. Most cases of high blood pressure do not have an easily identifiable apparent cause, and are known as essential hypertension. A small proportion of cases of high blood pressure are due to very well-established causes. Secondary hypertension of endocrine causes is related to the endocrine system, formed by the set of glands that secrete hormones that are made available in the blood circulation by the pituitary, hypothalamus, thyroid, adrenal glands, pancreas, ovaries, testicles and adipose tissue. It can be triggered by tumors or other abnormalities that cause some glands in the endocrine system to secrete excessive amounts of hormones that raise blood pressure.",
        "Symptoms": "Like primary hypertension, secondary hypertension usually does not present specific symptoms. However, if high blood pressure is present and the patient has some of these signs, it may mean that their condition is secondary hypertension: High blood pressure that does not respond to medication;/ Very high blood pressure - systolic blood pressure above 180 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) or diastolic blood pressure above 120 mm Hg;/ Sudden high blood pressure before age 30 or after age 55;/ Absence of family history of high blood pressure;/ Absence of obesity;/",
        "Causes": "In recent years, some hypertensive syndromes have been linked to the high production of certain hormones, such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), pheochromocytoma, primary hyperaldosteronism, Cushing's syndrome and renin-producing tumors (primary reninism). Renovascular hypertension itself is considered a form of endocrine hypertension, since the renin-angiotensin system is involved in its pathogenesis. Hypertension may also be present in thyroid diseases. Diagnosis and management in such situations are always very complex.",
        "Diagnosis": "In this situation, the cause of high blood pressure, unlike the more common form of hypertension, is associated with diseases of the endocrine system or some medications. The diagnosis is based on laboratory studies of blood and urine and specific tests that allow us to conclude the cause of the disease.",
        "Treatment": "The treatment of this type of hypertension, caused by changes or diseases of the endocrine system, fundamentally involves treating the underlying diseases and simultaneously controlling blood pressure using medication.",

    "Hyperthyroidism": {
        "What is it?": "Hyperthyroidism is caused by the overproduction of thyroid hormones that are released into the bloodstream. This condition affects several organs and functions of the body. Hyperthyroidism is a relatively common disease that affects females more. The incidence increases with age, being more common around 60 years of age. Without treatment, it can affect different functions of the body, including the heart. Appropriate medication allows the disease to be controlled by reducing the production of thyroid hormones.",
        "Symptoms": "Clinical manifestations include anxiety, irritability, insomnia, tremor, increased intestinal transit, palpitations and increased heart rate, hyperactivity, heat intolerance, excessive sweating, weight loss despite increased appetite, menstrual irregularities, goiter, a lively and fixed gaze and/or prominent eyes, and visual changes (Graves' disease). In the elderly, the presentation of a clinical picture of hyperthyroidism may be less exuberant, characterized by apathy, with mental confusion, anorexia, and cardiac arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation).",
        "Causes": "The most common cause is Graves' disease, which is an autoimmune disease characterized by the circulation of altered antibodies that act on normal cells in the thyroid, stimulating its hyperactivity.",
        "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will ask about your symptoms, do a physical exam, and order blood tests. Advanced hyperthyroidism is usually easy to diagnose because the signs are clear, but it's less obvious in the early stages. A blood test known as a thyroid function test checks the levels of the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) and can reveal how the gland is functioning. Radioactive iodine can still be used to measure its function (radioactive iodine uptake test).",
        "Treatment": "Treatment must be individualized and discussed with the patient, including three options: Synthetic antithyroid (methibasol is the first-line drug);/ radioactive iodine;/ Surgery;/ Monitoring must be regular and follow-up maintained over the long term.",
        "Prevention": "Hyperthyroidism associated with thyroid disease is not preventable.

    "Hypochondria": {
        "What is it?": "Hypochondria is a disorder in which a person reports physical symptoms and is especially concerned because they firmly believe that they correspond to a serious illness. This is a morbid fear regarding the functions of the body or the state of health in general, whether from a mental or physical point of view, giving rise to complaints that are communicated to other people. It is, therefore, a phobia of diseases, with several possible causes being identified. Although some scientists consider it to be an independent clinical condition, others prefer to designate it as a by-product of other disorders, such as depression and schizophrenia. From a therapeutic point of view, it has given rise to the most varied types of intervention. As the success obtained with such methods does not always correspond to expectations, it has been stated that the prognosis of hypochondria is reserved. Sociocultural factors are very relevant in this pathology. The role that in each era is attributed to certain diseases, such as tuberculosis, cancer or sexually transmitted diseases, can contribute to generating specific fears in many people in relation to the most commented and talked about disease. The internet and social networks, in recent times, can accelerate the dissemination of information about illnesses, which, in susceptible people, is an additional source of concern. On the other hand, an individual's previous health history is important, as it may make them more sensitive to a particular organ system or organ. In other cases, there may be an identification with a family member who has had a serious illness, or an upbringing in an environment where illnesses received too much attention. Although the existence of a real pathology can give rise to a phobia of diseases, generally speaking, there is no well-defined physical disorder at the basis of hypochondria. It is estimated that hypochondria affects around 1% to 5% of the general population, being equally common in women and men. Some data indicate a prevalence of between 4% and 9% in general clinic consultations in Portugal.",
        "Symptoms": "The person's concerns about the severity of the disease are often based on an incorrect interpretation of the body's normal functions, as happens, for example, with normal bowel sounds. People with hypochondria use these symptoms to substantiate their concern. Being examined and reassured by the doctor does not alleviate their concerns, maintaining the belief that the healthcare professional was unable to find the underlying illness. Complaints can be more general in nature, such as pain or tiredness, or be more specific. In hypochondriasis, the patient does not pretend or lie. He or she believes completely in the disease and therefore seeks out many doctors, in search of one who can confirm the presence of the pathology. In some cases, the organ or system that is the source of concern may vary over time. Hypochondria thus significantly interferes with the quality of life of these individuals and affects their family, social and professional life, generating anxiety or depression and significant losses of time and money in exams and consultations. On the other hand, they are exposed to additional risks, resulting from invasive tests carried out in the search for a diagnosis, or from dependence on analgesics or sedatives.",
        "Causes": "Its causes are unknown. There are factors that may be involved in its development, such as a history of physical or sexual abuse, serious childhood illness, reduced ability to express emotions, the presence of the pathology in question in a close family member and genetic elements.",
        "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis can be very difficult because the patient is convinced that their symptoms correspond to a real illness. Hypochondriasis is suspected when a healthy person with minor signs is concerned about the meaning of these signs and does not respond to reassuring explanations after careful assessment. The diagnosis is confirmed when the situation persists for years and its manifestation cannot be attributed to depression or another psychiatric disorder. It is important to rule out other illnesses through a medical examination. If it is confirmed that there is no reason for the symptoms, it is important to refer the patient to a psychiatrist or psychologist.",
        "Treatment": "Treating hypochondriasis is difficult because the patient is convinced that something serious is wrong with him or her. Reassurance does not alleviate these concerns. However, a good relationship with a doctor is beneficial. One of the main objectives is to help the patient live and function as normally as possible, even if the manifestations persist, and to change the way they think and react that are at the origin of the symptoms. To this end, monitoring and support measures are used, maintaining regular contact and establishing a good doctor-patient relationship; taking antidepressants or anxiolytics; and psychotherapy. This can help modify thinking and behavior patterns, deal with stress and improve social relationships. It is often difficult to implement given the patient's resistance and their conviction in the existence of a real disease. It is important to avoid resorting to complex and expensive examinations, but it may be necessary to treat some symptoms, such as pain.",
        "Prevention": "It is not possible to prevent hypochondria. However, adequate monitoring helps to reduce the severity of the symptoms and improve the quality of life of those affected. In a society so exposed to information about diseases, health care, exams, and new diagnostic technologies, it is to be expected that hypochondria can set in more easily. In fact, the availability of health information, although fundamental and very beneficial, may be associated, in the most susceptible people, with increased fears about various pathologies. What is really important is to detect these cases and try to offer as much support and reassurance as possible so that the symptoms can disappear or, at least, that they do not interfere so much with your daily life.

    "Hypoglycemia": {
        "What is it?": "Hypoglycemia occurs when blood glucose levels fall below 70 mg/dl. Under normal conditions, the body maintains blood sugar levels within a fairly narrow range (around 70 to 110 mg/dl). In diabetes, these levels become too high; in hypoglycemia, they are too low. This leads to the malfunctioning of many of the body's systems. The brain is particularly sensitive because glucose is its only source of energy. The way it responds to low blood sugar levels is by stimulating the adrenal glands to release adrenaline through the nervous system. This in turn triggers the liver to release sugar to adjust its concentration in the blood. If levels remain too low, brain function may be impaired.",
        "Symptoms": "When blood sugar levels drop, the body reacts by releasing adrenaline from the adrenal glands. This hormone stimulates the sugar contained in the body's reserves and, at the same time, causes symptoms similar to those of an anxiety attack: sweating, nervousness, tremors, fainting, palpitations and, sometimes, hunger. If hypoglycemia is severe, the supply of glucose to the brain is reduced and symptoms such as dizziness, confusion, exhaustion, weakness, headaches, inappropriate behavior that can be mistaken for drunkenness, inability to concentrate, visual disturbances, convulsions and coma appear. Prolonged hypoglycemia can irreversibly damage the brain. Both anxiety symptoms and brain physiological changes can have a slow or sudden onset that progresses within minutes, from mild discomfort to severe confusion or even panic. In a patient with an insulin-secreting pancreatic tumor, signs are more likely to appear in the early morning hours when fasting.",
        "Causes": "It can be related to dietary errors, such as going several hours without eating or ingesting insufficient amounts of carbohydrates. It may result from administration of oral medication or excess insulin. If there is excessive secretion by the pancreas (usually associated with a pancreatic tumor), hypoglycemia may also occur. Excessive physical exercise without nutritional support and the consumption of large quantities of alcohol outside of meals are other causes. Some disorders of the pituitary gland, adrenal glands or an anomaly in the storage of carbohydrates or in the production of glucose by the liver are other possibilities. However, most cases occur in diabetic patients and are related to medications. If the dose is excessive for the amount of food ingested, the drug decreases sugar levels more than intended. This pathology is sometimes observed in people with psychological disorders who self-medicate with insulin or hypoglycemic drugs. Some forms of stomach surgery also cause dietary hypoglycemia between meals. A rare cause is an autoimmune disease in which the body produces antibodies against insulin. Finally, it can also be the result of heart or kidney failure, liver disease, cancer, malnutrition, shock, and serious infection.",
        "Diagnosis": "A clinical picture suggestive of anxiety, with behavior similar to drunkenness or the presence of other symptoms of altered brain functions, implies the determination of blood sugar and insulin values. Signs of hypoglycemia rarely develop at blood sugar values \u200b\u200bgreater than 50 mg/dl. Its low concentrations, together with the symptoms of the disease, confirm the diagnosis. If the manifestations improve when the values \u200b\u200bincrease a few minutes after ingesting sugar, the diagnosis receives definitive confirmation. The next step is to determine the origin of the hypoglycemia, based on the patient's clinical history, physical examination and some laboratory tests. In some cases, other complementary tests and, sometimes, hospital admission are necessary. Although some insulin-secreting pancreatic tumors may be visible on computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or ultrasound, they are usually so small that they go unnoticed. In these situations, exploratory surgery is necessary to detect these tumors.",
        "Treatment": "The initial measures, after the diagnosis is confirmed, consist of taking 10 to 15 grams of sugar diluted in a small amount of water or juice, repeating the blood glucose measurement three to five minutes after ingestion. If the values \u200b\u200bare still not within the normal range, the process should be repeated until the blood glucose levels stabilize. After stabilization, within 10 to 15 minutes a meal rich in slow-absorption carbohydrates, such as bread, pasta, crackers or toast, should be eaten. In the case of severe hypoglycemia, with agitation, altered state of consciousness or unconsciousness, help must come from third parties and involves laying the patient on their side, placing a piece of sugar on the inside of the cheek, and, if available, administering glucagon (hormone produced by the pancreas) intramuscularly or subcutaneously and contact the emergency room. It is important to emphasize that the intake should actually be sugar and not another food. While sugar is absorbed extremely quickly, other sweets contain fats that slow down its absorption. It is recommended that a diabetic patient always have three to four packets of sugar in their wallet. Insulin-secreting tumors must be surgically removed. In the case of diabetic patients with frequent episodes of hypoglycemia, it is important to review their treatment in order to achieve better blood glucose control throughout the day.",
        "Prevention": "In the case of diabetics, it is necessary to monitor blood glucose throughout the day, eat carbohydrates with every meal, adjust insulin doses to dietary needs and physical exercise and vary the insulin administration sites. Patients who are predisposed to hypoglycemia can avoid these episodes by eating smaller meals than the usual three a day. They should also carry identification to inform emergency department staff of their condition.
