Arthritis arthrosis of the hand and wrist,"//What is it?// It is an inflammation that affects the different elements that make up a joint (the area where two or more bones meet and which allows movements to be carried out).  It manifests with pain localized to the affected joint, accompanied by decreased movement of the same joint and typically worsens with age.  The most common arthritis are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. In osteoarthritis, the cartilage, which is the covering of the bones in the joint areas and which allows them to slide to carry out movement, suffers wear and tear and even disappears. Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease in which the body attacks the inner lining of the joints. //Symptoms// Affected joints present: Dor;/ Rigidity with decreased total movement of the same;/ Edema (swelling);/ Redness;/ Heat;/ Joint deformity (in advanced cases);/ //Causes// The two most common causes of arthritis damage the joint differently.  Osteoarthritis: in this situation, there is wear and tear of the cartilage, the covering present at the ends of the bones in the joint areas. This covering allows the bones not only to slide harmoniously, producing movement, but also the distribution and dissipation of energy generated in movements of greater intensity, such as jumping, thus preventing injuries. If this covering deteriorates, which occurs over the years or following fractures involving the bones in the joint areas, severe sprains or joint infections, the bone begins to rub against the bone, causing pain and reduced movement of the joint involved.  Rheumatoid arthritis: In this disease, the organism attacks the tissue that lines the inside of the joints (it is called the synovial membrane and is equivalent to paint on the wall of a room).  This membrane then becomes inflamed, red and swollen. As membrane inflammation increases, which happens as the disease progresses, cartilage and bone are gradually destroyed.  Risk factors for arthritis are:  Family history: Some types of arthritis have a familial component, which means that if parents or siblings suffer from the disease there is a greater risk than the general population of developing it.  Age: The risk of developing most arthritis types increases with age.  Sex: Rheumatoid arthritis affects women more frequently, gout in turn affects men more.  Previous joint injuries: Any joint that has suffered a fracture or a severe sprain suffers early wear and tear, sooner or later developing into osteoarthritis.  Obesity: Increased weight on a joint causes premature wear, especially on the joints that support it such as knees, hips, ankles and spine, which is why obesity is directly related to arthritis. //Diagnosis// Diagnosis is made by observing the joints, looking for swelling, redness, heat and evaluating movement.  The medical evaluation can be completed with tests (of the blood or even the fluid present in the joint) and X-ray (where it is possible to identify the loss of cartilage, bone destruction and the formation of osteophytes, commonly called “parrot beaks”).  It may be necessary, not for diagnosis but for defining the treatment plan, to perform computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasound. //Treatment// Treatment depends on the type of arthritis and the goal is to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life.  Medication: There are several medications available for controlling pain and inflammation. They can be used as definitive treatment if they meet the treatment objectives by allowing the patient to carry out day-to-day activities without complaints or with only residual complaints.  Physiotherapy: This can provide relief in some types of arthritis, especially by reducing the inflammatory process and promoting muscle strengthening. During the course of treatment, splints may be used to rest the joint.  Surgery: If conservative treatment (medication and physiotherapy) does not work, surgery is recommended. Surgical options are adapted to the pathology present and the patient and are: Joint lavage: Usually performed with 2 to 4 small incisions that allow the placement of instruments inside the joint through which it is possible to proceed to wash the joint, remove loose bodies (fragments of cartilage that have come loose) and inflammatory tissue. Valid option in the initial stages of arthritis or as a way of postponing a more aggressive surgical procedure.;/ Joint replacement (arthroplasty): In this method, damaged surfaces are removed and replaced with a prosthesis or spacer (artificial or constructed from the patient's own tendon) in order to eliminate pain and preserve the movement.;/ Joint fusion (arthrodesis): This technique eliminates the joint by removing the ends of the two bones and establishing the union of the two bones by placing plates and/or screws. By eliminating the movement of the joint, the pain caused by the movement disappears. Inevitably, this technique eliminates the movement of the blocked joint, but allows the use of the hand and arm.;/ Load more;/ Winter is synonymous with low temperatures, which can be accompanied by health problems.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis,"//What is it?// Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) constitutes a heterogeneous group of diseases that began before the age of 16, characterized by the presence of arthritis of one or more joints, persisting for at least six weeks. They are one of the most common chronic diseases in children and adolescents, being an important cause of disability, eye disease and academic failure, due to the absenteeism they can cause. //Symptoms// Symptoms vary depending on the type of JIA and may include: Pain, swelling, heat and tenderness in the joints;/ Morning joint stiffness;/ Coxear;/ Fever;/ Rash;/ Weight loss;/ Swollen lymph nodes;/ Fatigue or irritability;/ Red eye, eye pain, blurred vision;/ //Causes// The causes of JIA are not known. Factors that may be involved, alone or in combination, include genetic (hereditary) factors and factors that influence the immune system. //Diagnosis// Diagnosis involves ruling out other causes of arthritis and other diseases that cause symptoms; You may also need: Imaging techniques, such as X-ray or MRI of the involved joints;/ Laboratory tests of blood, urine and/or joint fluid to determine the type of arthritis (especially ANA- antinuclear antibody and rheumatoid factor).;/ //Treatment// The goals of treatment are to relieve pain, reduce swelling, increase joint mobility and strength, and prevent complications. Treatment usually includes rehabilitation exercises and medications, including: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that provide pain relief and reduce swelling;/ Corticosteroids;/ Rheumatoid arthritis disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs): modify the progression of the disease, acting on the immune system to prevent the destruction of bones and joints.;/ Biotechnological therapeutics: act directly on the molecules or proteins of the immune system responsible for causing inflammation; they are used in adults and children with severe arthritis, through subcutaneous or intravenous injection;/ Adapted exercise and targeted physiotherapy reduce pain and contribute to maintaining muscle tone, improving mobility and preventing permanent disabilities.;/ //Prevention// Currently, as its cause is unknown, there is no way to prevent juvenile idiopathic arthritis.

Inflammatory arthritis,"//What is it?// Inflammatory arthritis is part of a group of diseases that affect the immune system and, therefore, the body's defense systems attack the body's own tissues instead of attacking microorganisms or external substances. These pathologies are known as autoimmune diseases. It corresponds to an inflammatory joint process characterized by the presence of joint effusion and/or pain on movement, heat, redness and functional limitation. In general, its signs and symptoms last up to six weeks. It can affect only one joint (monoarthritis), less than five (oligoarthritis) or more than five (polyarthritis). The most common inflammatory arthritis are rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and arthritis associated with psoriasis. These diseases can affect men, women and children at any age and affect other parts of the body. However, in the case of rheumatoid arthritis, 75% of patients are female and it occurs most frequently between the ages of 25 and 50. Systemic lupus erythematosus is also more common in women. On the other hand, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis are more common in younger populations. Inflammatory arthritis is not curable but its prognosis has improved in the last 20/30 years. There are new treatments that are started earlier, thus reducing joint damage, the need for surgery and the number of complications. It is important not to confuse inflammatory arthritis with osteoarthritis, which is a degenerative process that occurs when cartilage and/or ligaments wear out. When these structures are damaged, the muscles surrounding them contract to protect the joint. When this mechanism is not effective, the bone around the joint grows, forming spurs that attempt to stabilize the joint. In the case of inflammatory arthritis, the challenges faced by patients are physical (pain, disability, fatigue, damage to joints and organs) and emotional (depression, frustration, anxiety). //Symptoms// Many people with inflammatory arthritis do not have any signs of disease. Increased blood flow and the release of chemicals attract white blood cells to the site of inflammation. These events cause irritation, joint wear and swelling. The most common symptoms are redness, swelling of the joints that become painful and tender to the touch, joint pain and stiffness, and loss of function of the joints involved. As a general illness, fever, chills, fatigue and loss of energy, headaches and loss of appetite may occur. If the inflammation affects other organs, the symptoms may vary. If it occurs in the myocardium, there will be chest pain or fluid retention; if it involves the bronchial tree, there will be difficulty breathing; if it affects the kidneys, there may be hypertension or renal failure; in the case of the visual system, the patient may feel pain and decreased vision; if it affects the muscles, it will cause pain and muscle weakness; if it involves the blood vessels, there may be vasculitis, with manifestations in the skin or damage to other deeper organs. Pain is not always present because many organs do not have pain-sensitive nerves. //Causes// In general, the cause is unknown, and it is thought that its origins are inflammatory or autoimmune factors. The role of genetics is still unclear. When the inflammatory process occurs, chemicals are released that reach various tissues. This release tends to increase blood flow to the affected area, which can cause heat and redness. The associated swelling can stimulate some nerves, causing pain. //Diagnosis// Diagnosis involves a medical examination, with emphasis on the location of the affected joints, the presence of morning stiffness and complaints in other organs, and these elements should be complemented by radiological and laboratory tests. //Treatment// There are several options, including rest and surgery. The type of treatment will depend on several factors, such as the type of disease, the patient's age, current medications, general health and the severity of symptoms. The main objectives are to avoid or modify activities that aggravate the suffering, to use anti-inflammatory or analgesic medications to control pain and inflammation and to reduce the pressure exerted on the affected joints by using immobilization or support systems, whenever necessary. The most common therapy is that which reduces inflammation and swelling and which prevents or minimizes the progression of the disease itself. The most commonly used are aspirin, ibuprofen, corticosteroids and medications such as those used in chemotherapy, biological therapies or narcotic drugs for pain relief. The role of early rehabilitation is essential and may include physical therapy, joint protection, and exercises to restore strength and flexibility. //Prevention// If there is no specific cause, prevention is more difficult. However, regular physical exercise adapted to the age and conditions of each person, a balanced diet, adequate weight control, are good examples of measures that can help prevent the various forms of arthritis.

Rheumatoid arthritis,"//What is it?// Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory rheumatic disease that manifests itself in the form of polyarthritis (defined by the involvement of three or more joints), bilateral (affecting joints on both sides of the body), symmetrical (affecting the same joints on both sides of the body). progressive, destructive and deforming. This evolution culminates, after 10 to 20 years of evolution of the pathology, particularly in patients with a partial response to treatments, in some degree of motor disability. In Portugal, rheumatoid arthritis is the most prevalent inflammatory rheumatic disease, affecting around 0.3% to 0.4% of the Portuguese population. //Symptoms// The clinical presentation of rheumatoid arthritis is variable, with the disease beginning acutely or slowly, or between these two extremes, subacutely. A slow or gradual onset is more common (about 2/3 of cases), while an acute onset is less common. It begins predominantly as a joint disease, with one or more joints affected, most frequently the small joints of the hands and feet, bilaterally and symmetrically, although it may initially manifest as an extra-articular disease or with a non-articular presentation, or even predominantly general, with diffuse inflammatory joint or muscular pain. In the articular picture, there is often, from the beginning of the disease, fatigue, anorexia, weight loss and low fever. In other cases, months before the onset of polyarthritis, isolated fatigue or non-specific diffuse pain may occur, accompanied by lung disease. //Causes// The cause of rheumatoid arthritis is unknown, however several risk factors have been identified, such as infections, genetics and hormonal changes. It is an autoimmune disease, which means that the body's defenses attack its own tissues. Rheumatoid arthritis can occur at any time of life but is more common in middle age. The individual's gender affects susceptibility to the disease, so it is approximately two to three times more common in women. //Diagnosis// The diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis is made by the rheumatologist and other clinicians with experience in observing these patients, immediately and “at the entrance to the office”, based on a quick observation of the hands, which present typical joint deformities. In fact, the hands of a rheumatic patient offer so much information regarding their illness that they can be considered their calling card. However, diagnosing its early and initial symptoms, as well as its atypical forms, are a challenge. As there is no single clinical, radiological or serological test that allows a conclusive diagnosis, it is carried out based on the clinical combination (characteristic signs and symptoms), as well as laboratory and radiological data. Although in some patients all tests may be normal. //Treatment// It is a pathology that requires lifelong treatment, including the use of medication, physiotherapy, exercise and surgery. It is equally important to assess the presence of food allergies and aim for a balanced diet, rich in omega-3 acids. Within drugs, there are several classes that can be used depending on the clinical condition of each patient. The earlier the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, the more it will be possible to delay joint destruction. //Prevention// There is no information on how to prevent rheumatoid arthritis, as this disease results from a combination of genetic, immunological and environmental factors. However, early diagnosis and treatment, as well as the adoption of non-pharmacological measures, are essential in preventing RA complications. The factor whose association with the disease is confirmed is smoking - numerous studies link tobacco consumption with an increased risk and increased severity of rheumatoid arthritis.

Total knee arthroplasty,"//What is it?// Total knee replacement/arthroplasty is a surgical procedure in which the worn joint surfaces of the femur, tibia and often the kneecap are replaced because they are a source of debilitating pain. Metal and high-density polyethylene components are placed in place of the damaged and painful joint surfaces. The main objective of placing a total knee prosthesis is to treat the pain caused by osteoarthritis and, at the same time, improve joint mobility, increase functional capacity and restore quality of life. In some cases, osteoarthritis results from varus or valgus misalignment of the knee (bow knees or knees together, respectively), and there is then a second objective for surgery, which is to correct this anatomical deformity.;/ The joint mobility that is intended to be achieved after surgery will be between 100 and 130 degrees of flexion and full extension. However, the main factor that determines the postoperative range of motion is the range before surgery, so a knee with reduced mobility will have greater difficulty in achieving the desired range of motion.;/ All patients indicated for total arthroplasty are frankly limited in their activities of daily living, suffering from intense and disabling pain, resistant to medical and physiatric therapy and without any other surgical option. The age factor must be evaluated based on currently existing statistical data, which reveal that the survival rate of total knee arthroplasties is 90% at 10 and 80% at 20 years (defined by the prostheses still functioning) respectively. However, the placement of knee prostheses can be proposed at younger ages, in particular clinical situations that have no other medical or surgical alternative that would restore the patient's quality of life. The majority of patients are in the age group over 60 years old, with the upper limit, nowadays, depending on the general clinical condition, with many cases operated after the age of 80 years. Surgical risk will always be assessed in a pre-operative Anesthesiology Consultation. Another important factor, regardless of age, is the motivation of the patient and his family, given the disability and suffering caused by osteoarthritis, after an open discussion of the risks and benefits, especially if there are no serious pathologies that could affect the longevity of the patient. patient.;/ The patient indicated for this surgery most often has advanced arthrosis of idiopathic etiology (no cause is identified), mechanical due to axis deviation or post-traumatic, as a result of joint fractures.;/ Rheumatic diseases, especially rheumatoid arthritis, represent the second most important group of pathologies, due to their joint involvement.;/ Excess body weight does not represent a contraindication, as long as the patient's general condition is compatible with surgery. Long-term results are slightly lower when compared to surgery, however, it must be considered that obesity associated with limited mobility is in itself a vicious cycle, both due to the medical pathologies it causes and the greater gain in body weight.;/ The longevity of the prosthesis that we mentioned above motivates us to try whenever possible a more conservative surgical approach in younger patients, defined by age groups below 60 years of age. This approach consists of arthroscopic gestures, osteotomies to correct the axis (“straightening crooked legs”) or even physiotherapy associated with medications and infiltrations in the context of regenerative medicine.;/ Carrying out an arthroplasty involves risks that the patient must be aware of. Possible postoperative complications include thromboembolism, which requires mandatory pharmacological prevention, cutaneous complications and neurovascular injuries. Infection, often referred to as rejection, has an incidence of less than 1%, but may require further lavage surgery and replacement of the prosthesis.;/ Arthroplasty failure may be due to aseptic detachment (loose components in the absence of infection, due to sensitivity to polyethylene wear) and premature wear of the material. In these cases, it also requires further surgery to review/replace the material.;/ The surgical technique we currently use is called minimally invasive. It involves the use of smaller skin incisions, but above all, less aggression to the surrounding soft tissues (muscles, synovial membrane, ligaments, vessels and nerves).;/ This approach allows for a less painful post-operative period, less blood loss, lower risk of infection and a faster and less painful recovery. Most patients are able, after an initial period of support and weight-bearing of the operated lower limb, with two crutches, to resume walking without aids within 1 to 2 months, depending on the condition of the contralateral knee.;/ When performing this surgery, general or locoregional anesthesia can be used, depending on the decision of the patient and the anesthetist, during the Anesthesiology Consultation.;/ The rehabilitation program begins during hospitalization, approximately 48 hours after surgery, when the patient leaves the hospital walking with the help of two crutches and able to go up and down stairs.;/ Having a knee replacement surgery involves limitations on sports, and high-impact activities should be avoided. However, walking, golf, gym, swimming, dancing and cycling are permitted. Patients should ensure the longevity of their prosthesis by avoiding excess weight, intense physical exertion with impact (running), carrying heavy loads and hyperflexed postures.;/ Any infection that occurs, anywhere on the body, must be treated early and effectively, due to the risk of bacteremia (bacteria circulating in the bloodstream) that can contaminate the knee prosthesis from a distance. For the same reason, antibiotic prevention should also be systematically carried out in all dental or endoscopic manipulations, whenever necessary referring to your attending physician.;/ The confinement and changes in sports practice had consequences.

Knee and ankle arthroscopy,"//What is it?// Minimally invasive surgical technique, which allows exploration and treatment of lesions found and previously diagnosed inside the joints, through 2 or 3 small incisions of 1 to 1.5 cm, using an imaging camera and specific instruments. This treatment method, due to its lower aggressiveness, allows for a post-operative period with less pain, fewer risks and complications, therefore with easier and shorter rehabilitation and a reduced hospital stay. This surgery is usually performed with locoregional anesthesia, depending on the patient's wishes and the evaluation in an Anesthesiology consultation.  //Indications// Diagnosis: Currently rarely performed solely for this purpose, except in cases of inconclusive diagnosis by the clinic and complementary exams due to persistent complaints. In this context, surgical treatment will be performed at the same time as the operation, depending on the pathology detected intraoperatively.  //Knee Surgery// The menisci are structures that are interposed between the femur and the tibia and function as “shock absorbers and load distributors”. In their absence, wear and tear of the articular cartilage occurs, which in the long term progresses to osteoarthritis. These are structures with vascular and nerve endings on their periphery, which cause pain when they tear and are “stuck” inside the joint, during rotation and squatting movements. The greater the mobility or instability of the torn fragments, the more frequent and intense the pain. The most common knee injuries are meniscal tears, and meniscectomies/partial resections or meniscal sutures/repairs may be performed. Meniscal transplantation is the placement of a cadaver meniscus to reconstruct an absent or insufficient meniscus after a total meniscectomy. It is indicated only in age groups under 50 years and in the presence of painful complaints and evaluation by magnetic resonance imaging (pre-arthrosis degenerative process). Cartilage is a tissue that allows joint movement without friction. Its wear, fracture or structural change (chondromalacia) causes pain and joint effusion. Arthroscopy allows these injuries to be treated, but this tissue does not heal like existing cartilage. Instead, the body produces fibrocartilage, which fills the area of ​​injury. In cartilage injuries, techniques are used to regularize unstable fragments, stimulate regeneration from mesenchymal cells (microfractures) and mosaicplasty (cartilage transplant). The latter technique often requires open surgery (with a widened incision) to obtain a good clinical result. Through arthroscopy, synovectomies can also be performed (excision of the lining membrane from the inside of the knee, in cases of chronic inflammation), external alectomy (section of the external wing of the patella in cases of cartilage wear, due to poor alignment of the patella), removal of free bodies and knee arthrolysis (release of intra-articular adhesions to gain joint mobility, in cases of stiffness). //Ankle Surgery// In this joint, this technique also allows for the performance of synovectomies, treatment of cartilage lesions, removal of intra-articular free bodies, arthrodesis (fixation of the joint supplemented with screws), arthrolysis (release of adhesions and intra-articular fibrosis to gain reduced joint range of motion) and excision of osteophytes/""parrot's beaks"" (in cases of bone conflict).  The confinement and changes in sports practice had consequences. Nuno Oliveira and Pedro Pessoa, CUF Orthopedists, share the most common complaints.

Shoulder and elbow arthroscopy,"//What is it?// Arthroscopy is a minimally invasive technique developed since the beginning of the 20th century with a progressive increase in the diagnostic and therapeutic capacity of a large number of pathologies in the field of Orthopedics. It consists of introducing an optical amplifier inside a joint, connected to a light source, and transmitting the signal to an external monitor, allowing us to see what is happening inside the cavity where it is located.  As this diagnostic part was the one that initially encouraged its development, it was soon realized that with its help it could also be used to treat many pathologies using direct visualization of anatomical structures.  As added value it brought us the use of small incisions and less tissue destruction necessary to reach the joint to be studied/treated, as each entry point (portal) for each joint is no more than 0.5 to 1 cm, and can create several portals as needed. Indirectly, this added value allows for less post-operative pain; minor damage to the structures that surround the joint and which only occurs so that we can access the joint; greater speed in the rehabilitation process.  It was also thanks to the introduction of arthroscopy in the shoulder joint that many pathologies/diseases were discovered/better understood, as direct observation of the joint is always more complete than indirect observation provided by other complementary diagnostic methods (x-ray, ultrasound, CT, MRI, arthrography, etc.).  Patients who were condemned to live their lives with a diagnosis of “tendinitis” now have their injuries diagnosed and treated.  Arthroscopy therefore had the merit of allowing us to understand that many pathologies do not have a structural basis but rather a functional basis. The disease is not a consequence of damage that occurs in a specific structure but results from changes in the way that structure functions or in its interaction with adjacent structures.  To keep up with all this development, both the surgical instruments and the materials used needed to adapt to the area of ​​arthroscopy as they presented specificities that had not been introduced until then.  Arthroscopy allowed hospitalization times to decrease and increased the possibility of outpatient surgeries, with less consumption of direct and indirect economic resources  Arthroscopy, as a technique increasingly used in a greater number of pathologies and by a greater number of surgeons, should not be seen as a minor surgery, because as with any surgery, it has risks common to all of them and specific to arthroscopy. And, it is not a panacea, because it leaves many areas where “classical” surgery has an advantage. Learn what it is, the causes and how to prevent it. But know now: the symptoms of shoulder tendonitis can be disabling and it is best to consult a doctor. Vaccines stimulate immunity and are the most effective way to prevent infectious diseases.

Osteoarthritis,"//What is it?// Osteoarthritis is one of many rheumatic diseases and is by far the most common. It is a degenerative pathology that involves the entire joint. The word osteoarthrosis means degeneration of the joint. Osteoarthritis, commonly called osteoarthritis, is a disease that fundamentally affects articular cartilage, which is an elastic connective tissue found at the ends of bones that articulate with each other. Articular cartilage is nourished by joint fluid or synovial fluid, so called because it is produced by the synovium, a membrane rich in vessels that lines the interior of the joints. This liquid helps to lubricate the joint, facilitating its movements, and allowing the cartilages in healthy joints to slide over each other without friction, that is, without wear. In osteoarthritis, cells (chondrocytes) die and produce fewer proteoglycans and collagen. As a result of this, the articular cartilage ulcerates and the bone underneath the cartilage reacts, thickening and giving rise to bone excrescences called osteophytes. These are known as “parrot beaks”, because some of them, on x-rays, give images that resemble the beak of this animal. In this degenerative process, joint inflammation phenomena often occur, which causes pain and increased joint volume. Hence the term “arthritis” is also used for these clinical conditions. Osteoarthritis is not synonymous with joint aging (there are elderly people without osteoarthritis and young adults with this disease), although it is more common in older individuals who, naturally, have had more years to wear out their joints. Osteoarthritis is the most common pathology and will continue to increase, given its association with aging. In Portugal there are around half a million patients with osteoarthritis and pain, although, in fact, this number is close to one million, as many have osteoarthritis and have no complaints. In fact, over the age of 60, 90% of people have osteoarthritis. The disease is rare before the age of 40 but, from then on, it becomes increasingly common. The association with age is very evident, largely because the risks that cause the problem accumulate and because older joints have more difficulty adapting and regenerating compared to younger ones. Osteoarthritis is a very important cause of disability in the elderly and one of the most common causes of permanent disability and early retirement. The disease affects both genders equally, although after the age of 50 there is a slight predominance in women. It is a pathology that appears in all climates and in all races. The environment is not a cause of osteoarthritis, although cold and humidity worsen these patients' complaints, and hot weather relieves pain. There are joints in which osteoarthritis is more common: the knees, hands, hips, spine and feet. In the hands, the joints of the fingers and, in the wrist, at the base of the thumb are the most common. In the spine is the cervical and lumbar region. On the feet it is the base of the first toe, which when deformed is often called a “bunion”. In Portugal, the joints most frequently involved are the spine, in particular the cervical and lumbar segments, the knees, the joints of the hands and the base of the big toe. On the contrary, those on the wrists and ankles are rarely affected by osteoarthritis. //Symptoms// There is no correlation between the degree of joint damage and the intensity of pain. Many patients have advanced osteoarthritis and little pain, while others complain a lot even though their osteoarthritis is not very advanced. The main symptoms are pain, stiffness, limitation of movement and, in more advanced stages, deformities. The pain has a rhythm characterized by the fact that it worsens throughout the day, with movement and effort, and improves when the patient rests, especially when lying down. As a rule, patients with osteoarthritis do not have pain at night and sleep well, although in very advanced cases of osteoarthritis of the hips and knees, pain may also appear during the night. Complaints relating to osteoarthritis generally evolve very slowly and sometimes in spurts. This means that patients can go for months or years without symptoms. The most common signs are joint pain during use of the joint, particularly when there is overload. Short-term pain or stiffness may also occur when starting to move after a period of inactivity. The limitation of mobility progressively worsens as the disease progresses. Periods of swelling of the joint may occur due to inflammation. This situation takes the form of nodules on the fingers of the hands and fluid can accumulate on the knees, which coincides with a worsening of the complaints. During the course of the disease, the joint increases in size, which is common to notice in the knees or fingers. Pain is not always located at the level of the diseased joint. In hip osteoarthritis (coxarthrosis), the pain, which is almost always located at the level of the groin and radiates down the anterior surface of the thigh to the knee, can appear exclusively at the level of this last joint. In other words, the patient has pain in the knee and the osteoarthritis is located in the hip. This pain is called referred pain. The pain is often radiated, as happens, for example, with pain in the lumbar spine and cervical spine. In fact, in low back pain the pain can spread to the lower limbs and in neck pain it can be felt in the head, chest and upper limbs. Stiffness appears, above all, when starting movements, for example, in patients who are sitting and getting up, and also in the morning when waking up. The stiffness of osteoarthritis is short-lived, lasting no more than 30 minutes. Limitation of movement can appear early, unlike what happens with deformations, which, as a rule, occur late. Limited movement can cause great disability in these patients. For example, patients with osteoarthritis in the upper limbs, particularly in the shoulders, may have great difficulty getting dressed and eating. On the other hand, osteoarthritis in the lower limbs can make walking difficult and make certain tasks such as putting on shoes difficult or even impossible. Joint deformities sometimes take the form of nodules of bone consistency, as occurs in the hands, more specifically in the joints of the fingers. Unlike inflammatory rheumatic diseases, arthrosis is a condition that affects only the joints, does not affect the internal organs and is not accompanied by other symptoms such as fever, lack of appetite, fatigue and weight loss. During the process, the cartilage becomes worn down, becoming thinner and gradually more destroyed. As it is essential for the movement of the joint, the pain becomes more intense and movements become increasingly compromised. The pain prevents mobility, resulting in muscle atrophy. The joint becomes unstable, unable to perform its function, without cartilage, and with the bone developed around its periphery. Patients become increasingly limited, to the point where they are unable to move the joint without great effort and with severe pain. //Causes// All those who expose their locomotor system to overloads or excessive work – such as athletes and obese people, and those who have malformations of the joints or limbs, such as deformities of the knees, hips or feet – will tend to develop the problem more early. Some professions can cause osteoarthritis more frequently in certain joints. For example, footballers have more osteoarthritis in their knees (gonarthrosis), ballet dancers in their ankles, construction workers (who use pneumatic hammers) in their elbows, and dockworkers in their spine (spondyloarthritis). Osteoarthritis can be primary and secondary. The primary ones do not have a known cause, unlike the secondary ones which may be due to trauma, in particular repeated microtrauma, the incongruity of the articular surfaces, old fractures, infectious, inflammatory and metabolic diseases that have previously affected the cartilage. Primary osteoarthritis is more common in women, affects small joints more often and is more common in certain families than others. Secondary osteoarthritis tends to involve large joints. The causes of osteoarthritis are multiple. In general, overloading a normal joint or normal use of a diseased joint are the causes of osteoarthritis. Thus, it is common to encounter traumas in the past (large or small, these are usually very repeated), such as those resulting from sporting or professional activities, being overweight, as well as other rheumatic diseases or malformations that have previously deteriorated the joints. However, there are many cases in which no cause is apparent or in which only heredity is identified. //Diagnosis// Contrary to what occurs in inflammatory rheumatic diseases, osteoarthritis does not lead to changes in blood and urine tests. Radiographs in these patients are very typical, showing a reduction in the joint space, that is, the space between the two articulating bones, sclerosis of the subchondral bone, that is, reinforcement of the bone located underneath the articular cartilage, and osteophytes also called “parrot beaks”. //Treatment// Osteoarthritis has no cure, and the patient should know this, but its treatment can allow the maintenance of a completely normal life in most cases. The objectives of therapy are to alleviate and, if possible, suppress pain, improve functional capacity, that is, increase the mobility of affected joints, prevent atrophy of the muscles related to said joints and, finally, prevent the worsening of existing injuries. . Osteoarthritis cannot be treated with medication and physiotherapy alone. The patient's commitment is essential and without it the treatment plan will not be successful. The basic treatment measures include patient education, relative rest and an exercise plan. Education should include teaching the general rules for protecting the locomotor system and correcting posture. In fact, incorrect postures trigger and/or aggravate pain and lead to excessive support on areas of the articular cartilage, which will therefore wear out more in these areas. Here are some examples of general principles that may be useful in controlling or preventing osteoarthritis: sleeping on a hard bed, preferably on your back; do not sleep with a pillow; do not remain in the same position for a long time, especially in standing or sitting positions, in order to reduce the burden on the spine, in particular the lumbar spine, hips and knees; do not use sofas or armchairs that deform the spine, preferably a hard chair, with the back well supported and the feet firmly placed on the floor; keep your neck extended and never flexed; avoid picking up heavy objects, to avoid overloading the spinal joints; avoid flexing the vertebrae, and whenever it is necessary to pick up an object from the floor, it is important to bend your knees; wear simple, practical clothes and shoes with sturdy heel counters and low heels. In some cases, the doctor may need to temporarily prescribe devices that limit joint mobility, such as a cervical collar or an orthopedic belt. Patients with osteoarthritis, who are almost always elderly, often suffer from other health problems (obesity, diabetes, hypertension, etc.) and these conditions must be well controlled. In addition to pain, it is important to monitor inflammation. In more advanced forms of the condition, joint prostheses may be fitted. Symptomatic treatment is based on general joint protection measures, such as rest, rules for lifting and carrying loads and the use of physical agents (ice, heat through hot water or infrared and drugs).  Medications for these cases are analgesics such as paracetamol and, in more serious situations, in combination with weak opioids. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories are also used which, although they must be administered with precautions, can be very useful in controlling signs of inflammation. In addition to oral forms, topical forms can also be effective, especially if applied repeatedly and to superficial problems where penetration of the medicine can be ensured. Sometimes, intra-articular injections of hyalorunans (derivatives of hyaluronic acid present in cartilage and synovial fluid) can be used, which can provide relief to the patient for several months, and injections with corticosteroids into peri-articular structures (tendons, ligaments, synovial bags) which often become inflamed causing severe symptoms. In addition to symptomatic treatment, it is of utmost importance to try to prevent the progression of the disease. There are drugs taken orally that, in addition to alleviating the symptoms of the problem, have a proven effect on delaying the progression of knee osteoarthritis, such as glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate. Muscle relaxants are used when muscle contracture is the cause of pain or contributes to its worsening, as happens, for example, in acute attacks of lumbago, sciatica, or torticollis. Orthopedic surgery, by correcting deviations and deformations but above all by performing arthroplasties, that is, placing joint prostheses to replace those that are already very deteriorated, constitutes an important therapeutic advance, almost always with very satisfactory results. //Prevention// To be able to delay the progression of osteoarthritis, all measures that avoid overload or misuse of the joint are essential, such as maintaining a healthy weight or inhibiting certain professional or recreational activities. It is likely that controlled physical exercise, in addition to improving symptoms, will also facilitate mobility or delay the worsening of the disease.

Shoulder osteoarthritis,"//What is it?// Shoulder osteoarthritis corresponds to wear and tear of the shoulder joint, with progressive loss of cartilage and bone deformity, with the appearance of osteophytes (""parrot's beak"") or elevation of the head of the humerus from its position in the joint. It can occur primarily or secondary to trauma, ruptures of the rotator cuff tendons, rheumatic diseases, etc. //Symptoms// Shoulder osteoarthritis is associated with pain and loss of function, manifested by decreased mobility, especially in lifting and rotating movements. //Diagnosis// The initial diagnosis is made through X-ray, and should be complemented by CT or MRI. //Treatment// In the initial phase, analgesics and anti-inflammatories may be prescribed, which, together with an appropriate physiotherapy plan, provide pain relief and improve joint function, although they do not treat osteoarthritis. In cases where conservative treatment fails, shoulder prosthesis (joint replacement or arthroplasty) is indicated.

Osteoarthritis of the thumb,"//What is it?// Osteoarthritis is a disease that causes inflammation, stiffness and destruction of joints. In a normal joint, cartilage covers the bone ends, allowing them to move smoothly and without pain. The joint at the base of the thumb is formed by one of the carpal bones (trapezium) and the first of the three thumb bones (metacarpal). This joint (trapezium-metacarpal) allows the thumb to move and grip with the other fingers. In osteoarthritis, the cartilage layer deteriorates and the bones rub against each other. It often affects the joint at the base of the thumb, also called the trapezium-metacarpal joint. Trapeziometacarpal osteoarthritis (rhizarthrosis) slowly destroys the joint. Rhizarthrosis is more common in women over 40, but anyone can have it. It usually affects both thumbs.  //Symptoms// The most common symptom is pain at the base of the thumb. It can be felt when you pick up an object between your thumb and fingers, when you try to open a door, turn a lock or when you drop something. The pain can also worsen over time. The joint can become inflamed and become increasingly stiff or deformed. //Causes// The tops of the bones are covered with cartilage. This covering acts as a cushion, allowing the bones to move smoothly. Osteoarthritis destroys the cartilage and the bones start to move against each other when the thumb is moved, making the joint inflamed and painful. Over time, the bones can collapse or dislocate, causing deformation and stiffness that prevents the finger from being straightened. Trapeziometacarpal osteoarthritis results from wear and tear of the joint. It is more common in younger people if there has been trauma with ligament damage or a fracture of the thumb. Repetitive pinching, twisting or rolling movements between the thumb and fingers can aggravate osteoarthritis. //Diagnosis// The doctor can diagnose it by the deformation and mobility of the thumb. He or she may also order an X-ray to see the degree of destruction of the joint. Treatment will depend on the pain and the degree of joint involvement. //Treatment// Non-surgical treatment If arthritis is diagnosed at an early stage of the disease, it may respond favorably to non-surgical treatment. Your doctor may place a splint to immobilize your thumb for a period of three to six weeks. This limits movement and reduces inflammation. It may be associated with the oral intake of an anti-inflammatory drug, such as Aspirin or Voltaren. If symptoms do not improve, your healthcare provider will consider a joint injection of an anti-inflammatory drug, such as cortisone. If non-surgical treatment does not relieve pain and stiffness, or if the arthritis is already at a more advanced stage with joint destruction, the doctor may recommend consultation with a hand surgery specialist to assess the situation and which technique is best. correct for each case.  Surgical treatment If the hand surgeon recommends surgery, the diseased joint will be removed, usually by removing the base of the first metacarpal and trapezium. Reconstruction is performed using a prosthesis or a tendon graft taken from the forearm and wrist. This type of surgery can be performed under general anesthesia (which requires a 24-hour hospital stay) or under local regional anesthesia of the branchial plexus, in which only the arm is anesthetized (which does not require hospitalization).  The recovery Initially the hand has a relatively bulky bandage and a splint. After removing the stitches, you will only have a splint to immobilize your thumb for a total of six weeks, from the date of surgery. This will keep the thumb stable while healing occurs. Once it is removed, the surgeon guides the movements to be made and will send the patient to a physiotherapist to help with mobility, making the new joint more flexible and the muscles stronger and more elastic. It will take some time before you regain full use of your thumb. Once regenerated, the patient will have little or no pain – as long as they do not exaggerate activities with the thumb. You have to ensure that you continue doing the exercises prescribed by your surgeon or hand therapist to improve the new joint. The thumb may never fully recover like a new finger, but you will be able to resume most of your daily tasks with virtually no complaints. //Prevention// In order to delay the progression of osteoarthritis, all measures that avoid overloading or misuse of the joint are essential. Osteoarthritis is one of the most disabling diseases of the bones and joints, but there are several reasons to exercise. Regaining mobility is one of them. Having a cast on your arm or leg helps you recover from fractures and reduces pain. Know what to do in this situation.

Asma,"//What is it?// Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the bronchi that usually begins in childhood, but can appear at any age. Patients with asthma, if controlled, can carry out their professional and sporting activities without any limitations. Adequate treatment is essential for improving quality of life. It is a very common disease in children and is characterized by a chronic inflammatory process in the airways, which makes them more reactive. When faced with certain stimuli, the bronchi become obstructed and symptoms of the disease appear, generally episodes of persistent dry cough, difficulty breathing or a feeling of tightness in the chest. It affects around one million Portuguese people (National Asthma Prevalence Survey), being a pathology that, in most cases, cannot be prevented. However, it is possible to control it in more than 90% of cases. To this end, there are pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures that enable asthmatics to have a good quality of life and well-being. It is known, from the National Survey on Asthma Control in Portugal, that only 57% of individuals have their disease controlled, that is, around 300 thousand still require intervention. //Symptoms// Cough;/ Wheezing or wheezing in the chest;/ Shortness of breathe;/ Chest tightness with physical exertion;/ Tiredness and difficulty in carrying out daily activities;/ Symptoms can be occasional or persist throughout the year, and can range from mild to severe. Most patients present other manifestations linked to allergies in other organs such as the nose, eyes or skin. Allergic arhinitis is a risk factor for developing asthma. //Causes// Normally in children it has an allergic basis, but asthma can occur without allergies. And even in the face of an allergic condition, other factors can trigger symptoms, namely viral infections, uncontrolled rhinitis or exacerbation of sinusitis, tobacco smoke, chalk and chlorine, psychological elements and physical exercise. //Diagnosis// To confirm the diagnosis, clinical data is very important, namely the existence of typical symptoms, other allergic diseases and the existence of family members with allergies, mainly parents and siblings. //Treatment// The treatment aims to control the inflammation that exists in the bronchi. Therefore, the medications used have anti-inflammatory action and the most frequently prescribed are inhaled corticosteroids. Leukotriene antagonists can also be used, which have the same effect. To either of these two types of drugs it is useful to add a bronchodilator. Considering that asthma is a chronic disease, therapy must be carried out daily. It is also important to monitor other pathologies that may eventually coexist, such as allergic rhinitis. In a situation of respiratory distress crisis, the child must immediately begin the emergency treatment regimen prescribed by the doctor. If therapy is completed and asthma is controlled, children with this pathology can and should exercise - even so, it may be necessary to take a bronchodilator before physical education class. The exercise must be adapted, and the class must start with quick, short runs and not with a prolonged run. Whenever complaints arise during exercise, it should be interrupted and only resumed when symptoms resolve. //Prevention// Asthma prevention consists mainly of avoiding allergens that usually cause attacks and keeping asthma under control. The measures to be taken include: Strict identification and elimination of triggering factors: house dust, pollen, animal hair, etc.;/ Avoid environments with pollution and smoke;/ Prevent and treat colds, flu and sinusitis;/ Do not smoke and avoid contact with tobacco smoke;/ Avoid intense perfumes;/ WebMD Load more;/ Early identification of allergic diseases - such as rhinitis, atopic eczema and drug allergies - is crucial to controlling pediatric asthma. Asthma is an allergic disease that has no cure, but can be controlled. An adequate prevention program allows you to maintain your child's quality of life. Corticosteroids, including cortisone, are medications with potent anti-inflammatory action, used in a wide variety of pathologies.

Asthma in children,"//What is it?// Bronchial asthma is a very common disease in children and is characterized by a chronic inflammatory process in the airways, which makes them more reactive. When faced with certain stimuli, the bronchi become obstructed and asthma symptoms appear, generally episodes of persistent dry cough, whistling, difficulty breathing or a feeling of tightness in the chest. Asthma in children usually has an allergic basis, but asthma can occur without allergies. And even in the case of allergic asthma, other factors can trigger symptoms, namely viral infections, uncontrolled rhinitis or exacerbation of sinusitis, irritants such as tobacco smoke, chalk and chlorine, psychological factors and physical exercise. //Causes// Physical exercise can be one of the triggers for asthma symptoms, during physical education classes, while playing or simply laughing. But it is also possible for these symptoms to appear in patients who have not been diagnosed with asthma, that is, they have asthma only with exercise. It is important to correctly diagnose this situation, to implement the appropriate measures, so that the asthmatic can practice sports.   //Diagnosis// To confirm the diagnosis of this disease, the important thing is clinical data, namely the existence of typical symptoms, in a child who has other allergic diseases, the existence of family members with allergies, mainly parents and siblings, and also the improvement of symptoms with medication.  //Treatment// Physical exercise can be one of the triggers for asthma symptoms, during physical education classes, while playing or simply laughing.

Astigmatism,"//What is it?// Astigmatism is a refractive error, that is, a change in the configuration of the eyes that affects the way images are formed and transmitted to the brain. It is a common refractive error, accounting for around 13% of all refractive errors. The other most obvious refractive errors are myopia and hyperopia. It results from an irregularity in the curvature of the cornea, the most anterior layer of the eyes, which, instead of being perfectly convex, has an abnormal surface with higher areas and flatter areas. This anomaly determines that, when images are projected onto the retina, they undergo distortion as they pass through the cornea and, as such, appear blurred. Its incidence varies with age, being very common in the first months of life (around 20%), reducing at school age to a frequency close to 5% and in young adults reaching around 60% of people, being, In general, very mild astigmatism, less than 0.5 diopters. In practice, almost everyone has a small degree of astigmatism, but this does not affect the quality of vision. In Portugal it is estimated that around 20% of children and half of the adult population suffer from significant refractive errors, including astigmatism. //Symptoms// The presence of astigmatism translates into reduced quality of vision. In a child, this decrease may go unnoticed, especially if it affects only one eye. Younger children may complain of headaches, tiredness, their school performance may be lower, they tend to get too close to the television or objects but, in many cases, none of this happens. For this reason, it is important to carry out an ophthalmological screening at around three years of age. This consultation will allow you to detect the presence of astigmatism, myopia or hyperopia and, if necessary, correct it. In adults, complaints are more obvious because it is easier to perceive and verbalize visual difficulties. In this pathology, both near and far vision are compromised. //Causes// Its exact cause is not known. As a rule, it is present from birth and is almost always associated with myopia or hyperopia. Its basis is essentially genetic but can appear after trauma or eye surgery. Some eye diseases, such as keratoconus, in which the cornea becomes progressively thinner, are associated with high degrees of astigmatism. //Diagnosis// The diagnosis is made during the Ophthalmology consultation, and there is a range of equipment that allows for rapid detection and quantification of this anomaly, both in adults and children. Even in children who are not yet able to participate in normal vision tests, there are alternatives that allow for an accurate diagnosis. During this consultation, the entire eyeball is assessed in order to study its characteristics and rule out possible causes of astigmatism as well as other eye diseases. //Treatment// Mild forms of astigmatism, which do not significantly interfere with vision, do not require treatment. When astigmatism is high and/or when it affects the quality of vision, it is important to correct it using glasses, contact lenses or refractive surgery. Glasses: these are the ideal solution for children up to 15 years of age. In the case of people over 40 years of age, a type of lens may be necessary in the glasses that corrects both astigmatism and so-called “close-up tired eyes”. These lenses are progressive, as they contain different graduations across their surface.;/ Contact lenses: can be used from 15 years onwards as long as there are no contraindications, such as the presence of allergies, lack of tears, intense exposure to smoke or very dry environments. The use of contact lenses requires rigor, hygiene and discipline, and regular medical monitoring is important to ensure the prompt detection and correction of any anomalies resulting from their use. There are several types of contact lenses and selecting the most appropriate one will always depend on a prior medical evaluation. Both glasses and contact lenses compensate for the refractive error caused by astigmatism but do not cure it.;/ Refractive surgery: is indicated for people with astigmatism, over 18 years of age and with a stabilized degree for at least 12 months. This intervention, when performed by laser, allows the surface of the cornea to be shaped and surface errors corresponding to astigmatism to be corrected. It is a very simple procedure, carried out under local anesthesia, lasting 15 to 20 minutes and allowing normal vision in less than 24 hours. Even in the presence of a combined condition of astigmatism and myopia or astigmatism and hyperopia, this surgery allows reliable, safe and very quick results.;/ Lens inside the eyeball: an alternative to laser is the placement of a lens inside the eyeball that makes it possible to compensate for astigmatism, similar to what is achieved with contact lenses but permanently.;/  //What is the prognosis for astigmatism?// Although it can change over time, making it necessary to update your glasses or contact lens prescription, it is a benign process with no permanent implications for vision. The exception to this statement corresponds to children under the age of 5/6. If there is significant astigmatism present from the first years of life and not corrected by that age, a condition called amblyopia, the common “lazy eye”, may occur, which implies interruption of the normal development of vision. This, after 5/6 years, tends to become permanent and irreversible. Hence the interest in carrying out a first ophthalmological consultation for all children around the age of three, in order to ensure that any type of refractive error is promptly diagnosed and corrected before the onset of amblyopia. //Prevention// It is not possible to prevent astigmatism. Astigmatism is present from birth and runs in families. Ophthalmology consultations should be regular from childhood to allow for early correction.

Panic attack,"//What is it?// It is a sudden and intense episode of fear that triggers a set of physical reactions that can simulate a heart attack or generate a feeling of imminent death. Although they can be very frightening, they occur in the absence of real danger and without any apparent cause. In most cases, they manifest themselves in just one or two episodes throughout life, particularly during periods of greater stress. If they are repeated, causing a constant fear of a new attack, we are facing a pathological panic. Panic attacks are common, affecting more than a third of adults each year. However, women experience these episodes two to three times more frequently than men. Pathological panic attacks are rarer and are diagnosed in less than 1% of the population, usually in late adolescence or early adulthood. Although they significantly affect quality of life, they can be effectively treated. //Symptoms// Panic attacks start suddenly, without warning, and can occur at any time, such as while walking, driving, sleeping, or during a meeting. Although they vary greatly in their presentation, symptoms usually peak after 10 minutes and are eventually accompanied by a feeling of extreme fatigue. The most common signs are: Sense of imminent danger;/ Fear of losing control or dying;/ Increased heart rate;/ Perspiration;/ Tremors;/ Rapid and difficult breathing;/ Chills;/ Confrontations;/ Nausea;/ Abdominal or chest pain;/ Headaches;/ Dizziness;/ Feeling faint;/ Difficulty swallowing;/ One of the most difficult aspects of panic attacks is the intense fear that they will happen again, leading the patient to avoid situations in which they may occur or even avoid leaving the house (agoraphobia) because, for the patient, no place seems safe. Without treatment, panic attacks end up affecting all aspects of life, whether personal or professional, and can lead to the development of various forms of phobia, withdrawal from social life, problems at work or school, depression, suicidal tendencies, alcohol or drug abuse and financial problems. //Causes// Its causes are not well known but it is thought that genetics, the presence of intense stress, individual temperament and changes in the functioning of some areas of the brain may be relevant. There are increased risk factors for panic attacks, such as the death or serious illness of someone close to you, major life changes, a history of physical or sexual abuse in childhood, or a history of a traumatic event, such as an accident or assault. //Diagnosis// To diagnose them, it is important to rule out organic diseases that can cause similar symptoms, such as cardiovascular or thyroid diseases. It is always important to carry out a complete medical examination, in which psychological evaluation is an essential element, as there are well-defined diagnostic criteria for pathological panic. //Treatment// Treatment essentially involves psychotherapy and medication to reduce the symptoms and depression generally associated with this clinical condition. The aim is to eliminate the symptoms, allowing the patient to resume all their daily activities. //Prevention// There is no surefire way to prevent panic attacks. Therefore, the best recommendations are to seek treatment as soon as possible, maintain the treatment plan to prevent relapses, and maintain regular physical activity, which can have a protective effect against anxiety.

Atherosclerosis,"//What is it?// Atherosclerosis is a particular type of arteriosclerosis, very common, which mainly affects the large vessels and which is the basis of the most common arterial diseases, such as arterial hypertension, coronary disease, aortic aneurysm or arterial disease of the lower limbs. This aspect is very important because it is known that pathologies of the circulatory system are responsible for the main causes of death in Portugal. Atherosclerosis is a disease of the large and medium-sized elastic arteries and muscular arteries, and is characterized by the presence of lesions that resemble plaques (atheromas). This pathology mainly affects the outer margins of arterial bifurcations and branches, where blood flow is most turbulent. It is a general disease that can affect different organs. When the artery wall is subjected to different forms of aggression, local accumulation of lipoproteins and migration of inflammatory cells occurs, with abnormal proliferation of some cellular elements in the inner layers of the arteries. This process leads to a progressive narrowing of the arterial caliber and tends to affect the elastic characteristics of the vessels. It begins at a young age and has a long silent gestation period, which is why it is necessary to adopt preventive measures to control risk elements during childhood and adolescence. //Symptoms// Atherosclerosis usually does not cause any symptoms until the blood supply to an organ is reduced. When this happens, the manifestations vary, depending on the specific organ involved. In fact, the signs of atherosclerosis are very variable. Some patients with a mild type may present with a serious illness, such as an acute myocardial infarction or sudden death. In contrast, other patients with more advanced disease may show few signs. Its different manifestations result from a generalized clinical process that can involve different vascular territories: cerebral, coronary and peripheral arteries. For this reason, the symptoms vary according to the arterial vascular territory involved. Cerebrovascular disease may appear as a transient ischemic attack, if there is complete regression of neurological symptoms and signs in less than 24 hours, or a stroke. Coronary vascular disease can become known in several ways, such as an acute coronary syndrome, stable or unstable angina pectoris, and acute myocardial infarction. Peripheral arterial disease produces several signs that range from intermittent claudication to pain at rest. Narrowing of the leg arteries causes cramp-like pain in the leg muscles, especially during exercise. If the narrowing is severe, there may be pain at rest, fingers and feet may become cold, pale or bluish, and hair loss may occur on the lower limbs. As noted, the progressive narrowing of the artery lumen caused by the expansion of the atheromatous plaque leads to a gradual obstruction of blood flow. When it reaches 50% to 70% of the vessel diameter and/or when there are increased metabolic or oxygen needs, symptoms of low output, angina pectoris or intermittent claudication appear. Rupture of an unstable atherosclerotic plaque, exposing its contents, can lead to thrombosis with total obstruction of the artery involved. This can result in unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack or stroke. Other clinical manifestations include erectile dysfunction, development of aneurysms and chronic renal failure. When atherosclerosis affects circulation in the abdominal region, a dull or cramp-like pain may occur in the middle of the abdomen, usually starting 15 to 30 minutes after a meal. Complete blockage of an intestinal artery causes severe abdominal pain, sometimes accompanied by vomiting, diarrhea or an increase in abdominal volume. //Causes// Factors that increase the risk of atherosclerosis include: High levels of cholesterol in the blood;/ Low levels of HDL cholesterol (the “good cholesterol”);/ Elevated levels of C-reactive protein (a marker of inflammation);/ High blood pressure;/ Diabetes;/ Family history of coronary heart disease at an early age;/ Smoking;/ Obesity;/ Physical inactivity;/ Advanced age;/ //Diagnosis// Medical examination may be useful in detecting its signs, such as the presence of lipid deposits in the eyelids or tendons, carotid bruits, decreased peripheral arterial pulses, palpable and pulsatile abdominal masses, neurological signs, peripheral cyanosis, gangrene, hypotension, tachycardia. Diagnosis is based on clinical history, including current symptoms and current medications, and medical examination. Laboratory tests are important, as is an electrocardiogram or echocardiogram. Other studies may be necessary to assess blood circulation in the heart, brain, and legs. Ultrasound measurement of the thickness of the intima and media layers of the carotid arteries has been considered a test with great potential for noninvasive assessment of the disease. //Treatment// There is no cure, but treatment can slow the progression or even stop it from getting worse. The main goal of treatment is to prevent significant narrowing of the arteries so that symptoms never develop and vital organs are never damaged. To achieve this, you must start by having a healthy lifestyle. It is also important to diagnose and treat all risk factors for its development, such as cholesterol and high blood pressure. Once organ damage related to atherosclerosis has developed, treatment depends on the organ involved. There are currently effective medications available to control coronary heart disease, transient ischemic attacks and peripheral arterial disease. These treatments may be purely drug-based or involve surgery. //Prevention// It is possible to help prevent atherosclerosis by changing the risk factors for the disease. You should practice a lifestyle that promotes good circulation, avoiding smoking, maintaining a healthy weight and diet rich in vegetables and fruit, practicing regular exercise, controlling high blood pressure, diabetes and cholesterol. Regular physical exercise can bring many benefits to the health of cardiovascular patients. But you should consult your doctor. Hypertension, stroke, dementia, osteoporosis, excess weight. Excess salt can increase the risk of several diseases. The key is moderation. It is important in diagnosing heart problems and should be done regularly from a certain age.

Global developmental delay,"//What is it?// Global developmental delay (AGD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that occurs at an early age in a child's development and can become chronic throughout life. From birth, children develop according to stages of psychomotor development that are characteristic of all children. Therefore, there are developmental milestones that must be achieved at specific target ages. When these stages are not achieved, we are possibly facing a developmental delay. Developmental delay is different from maturational delay, in that the deviation in the acquisition of the developmental milestone is more significant in temporal terms. //Symptoms// Global developmental delay refers to a delay in at least two of the areas of child development: verbal cognition, non-verbal cognition, language, gross motor skills, fine motor skills or autonomy. This delay can be noticed early, for example when the child fails to start walking within the ideal time for acquiring walking skills (after 18 months) or when he/she does not acquire his/her first words until 18 months. The baby/child's behaviour is also often different when compared to babies/children of the same age, and may be excessively active, sullen, inattentive, or on the contrary, very passive, uncommunicative and with little reaction to stimuli from the environment and interaction with people. //Causes// The global delay in psychomotor development results from atypical intellectual and adaptive development with an early origin, and can be a consequence of multiple causes (prenatal, perinatal or postnatal). The etiological diagnosis remains unknown in 50-80% of all situations. As a disorder with a genetic cause, it is heterogeneous.  In addition to its clinical variability, it can occur sporadically or be hereditary. Numerous factors are involved in the genesis of AGD: genetic, educational, cultural, traumatic, emotional and socioeconomic. Genetic research may help identify the cause, especially in cases of moderate to severe AGD. //Diagnosis// The diagnosis of AGD is based on the existing delay in psychomotor development in more than one domain (cognition, motor, autonomy, language, fine motor skills, verbal cognition, attention, behavior). This delay should ideally be quantified in Psychology consultations through the application of psychometric tests, information from the child's and family's and school history data. In addition to AGD, it will be important to check whether there are other comorbid neurodevelopmental disorders, such as a language disorder or attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. This diagnosis can be made during the first two years of life and up to 5 years of age. From this age onwards, the most appropriate nomenclature for a situation of this type may be intellectual development disorder. For this diagnosis, a Neurodevelopmental Pediatrics consultation should also be carried out so that other clinical causes can be excluded, comorbidity identified and to guide the etiological investigation of the situation. Genetic consultation is normally recommended, especially in more severe cases, or in the presence of phenotypic changes, to attempt to identify the etiological cause. //Treatment// AGD has a major impact on the life of the affected person as well as their family and society, which is why its timely diagnosis is essential so that timely intervention/treatment can be initiated. Intervention in AGD must be multidisciplinary, since this delay affects more than one area of ​​development. Therefore, an intervention program must be created that includes specialties such as Psychology, Psychomotricity, Speech Therapy, Occupational Therapy or Music Therapy. The number of hours allocated to the program depends on the child's age, the severity of the delay and the individual profile, but in general, the ideal would be a more intensive intervention in the first phase (1h/day) so that deficits can be overcome as soon as possible. as quickly as possible. In addition to specialized technicians, educators must also be included, so that school integration must be early, as well as parents. Parents must be an active element, and must be guided with parental strategies on the best way to encourage their child towards the objectives defined in the intervention programs. This work must be coordinated between everyone involved. //Prevention// Many causes of intellectual disability are not preventable. However, numerous strategies must be implemented to detect and diagnose treatable causes early (such as hypothyroidism and phenylketonuria), reduce the risks of intellectual development disorder, minimize sequelae, and improve children's function and prognosis.Primary prevention aims to prevent conditions that could cause intellectual disability. Examples of interventions are: Avoid prenatal exposure to alcohol, drugs and other teratogenic agents;/ Use of prenatal vitamin and mineral supplements, including folic acid;/ Adequate prenatal surveillance;/ Differentiated perinatal care;/ Extended prenatal screening test (heel prick test);/ National vaccination program;/ Use of restraint system and appropriate automobile transport;/ Prevention of road, domestic and leisure accidents and other traumas;/ Prevention of traumatic brain injuries.;/ Early, adequate and timely genetic study and counseling must be carried out in all suspected cases. There are also two other levels of prevention: secondary and tertiary. Secondary prevention, encompasses the specific treatment of conditions with the aim of reducing the risk of AGD and improving the prognosis, and tertiary prevention, brings together interventions that aim to optimize children's function and quality of life.

Stroke stroke,"//What is it?// Cerebrovascular accident (CVA) is the main cause of death in Portugal. Worldwide, it is estimated that: one in six people will have a stroke; every second someone suffers this illness; and every six seconds this disease is responsible for someone's death. Each year, 15 million suffer a stroke and, of these, six million do not survive. According to the Portuguese Stroke Society, Portugal is, in Western Europe, the country with the highest mortality rate, especially in the population under 65 years of age. Stroke results from damage to brain cells, which die or stop functioning normally, due to the lack of oxygen and nutrients following a blockage of blood flow (ischemic stroke) or because they are flooded with blood from an artery that connects. ruptures (hemorrhagic stroke). Ischemic patients account for around 4/5 of the total. Brain cells die soon after this injury occurs. However, it can last a few hours if the blood flow is not completely stopped. For this reason, it is essential to act quickly to minimize brain damage. There is also another form of shorter duration, less than 24 hours, which is called a transient ischemic attack (TIA). In these cases, the blockage of the cerebral artery is momentary and symptoms can last for a few minutes or hours. It is important to emphasize that, even in temporary cases, it is essential to go to the hospital, as a TIA can be the first sign of a stroke with devastating consequences. In fact, one in five people who experience a TIA will suffer an extensive stroke within the next three months. You should never ignore an AIT. It is still common to designate stroke as “thrombosis”. //Symptoms// Since the brain controls bodily functions, its signals will vary depending on the area affected. For example, if a stroke affects the area that controls body movement on the right side, that side will have reduced mobility. Since the brain also controls more complex mental processes, such as communication, emotions, reasoning and thinking, all of these functions are likely to be affected after a stroke. As it occurs suddenly, due to the occlusion or rupture of an artery, its effects on the body are immediate. //Causes// There are numerous risk factors, and the greater the number, the greater the risk of a stroke. Some of these factors cannot be controlled, such as age, gender (more common in men) and genetics. Regarding age, it is important to note that around 25% of strokes occur in young people. Diabetes, high blood pressure, cholesterol, obesity, a sedentary lifestyle, arrhythmias, fibromuscular dysplasia, tobacco and alcohol consumption also increase the risk. //Diagnosis// It's simple to recognize a stroke using the five F's rule. These symptoms can appear alone or in combination: Face: may suddenly become asymmetrical with one of the eyelids drooping. These signs can be better noticed if the affected person tries to smile.;/ Strength: It is common for an arm or leg to suddenly lose strength or for a sudden loss of balance to occur.;/ Speech: may sound strange or incomprehensible and speech may not make sense. Often, the patient does not seem to understand what is being said to him or her.;/ Sudden lack of vision: in one or both eyes, is a common symptom, as is double vision.;/ Severe headache: it is also important to assess a sudden and very intense headache, different from the usual pattern and with no apparent cause.;/ //Treatment// The most useful medications for the treatment and prevention of stroke are antihypertensives, antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants. Altogether, these three classes of medications improve circulation and ensure better flow of blood, oxygen and nutrients to brain cells. The choice of drug combination should always be made by the doctor. In some cases, surgery may be essential to unblock a clogged artery.  //What is the recovery after a stroke?// About a third of patients recover significantly within the first month, but many patients will experience lifelong after-effects. Recovery will depend on the location and extent of the stroke, but also on the time that has passed, which is why it is crucial to go to hospital immediately if there is a suspicion that it has developed. Physiotherapy and lifestyle changes are important aspects of rehabilitation. Maintaining a positive attitude and professional and family support are also essential to ensuring that everything goes as smoothly as possible.  //What are the consequences of a stroke?// They will depend on the type of stroke, the location of the artery affected, the area of ​​the brain affected, and the state of health and activity prior to the episode. All strokes are different and each person affected will have different problems and needs. //Prevention// It is important to monitor all aspects of your health, by regularly checking your blood pressure and cholesterol, not smoking or consuming excessive amounts of alcohol or salt, maintaining a healthy diet and exercising.  //What to do if you suspect a stroke?// In these cases, it is essential to call 911 immediately, explaining everything that is happening. The patient will be treated as a priority in an Emergency Room where treatment will be promptly instituted and the diagnosis made.

Asia,"//What is it?// Heartburn is a symptom of a digestive disorder and not a disease in itself. It occurs, for example, in gastroesophageal reflux, a condition in which the acidic contents of the stomach flow back into the esophagus, damaging its walls. Heartburn is part of a broader picture of symptoms that are called dyspepsia, a term that means poor digestion. This is characterized by a set of signs that are related to the digestion of food, such as abdominal pain or discomfort, a feeling of fullness, belching, vomiting, heartburn or loss of appetite. This is a common problem and it is estimated that around 30% of the adult population suffers or has suffered from this pathology. In Portugal, around 3% to 4% of general practitioner consultations are due to this symptomatology. //Symptoms// Its sensation usually starts in the sternum and can travel up to the throat. It is more common after meals or when the patient is lying down, and can last minutes or hours. In general, it manifests itself in the form of a stinging or burning sensation that can worsen when swallowed. This burning sensation results from the irritation caused by the reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus. In other cases, it appears as a bitter taste in the mouth. This symptom should not be confused with difficulty swallowing, which is called dysphagia, and which can occur in various diseases such as esophagitis or esophageal cancer. In some cases, it is associated with a chronic cough, also resulting from irritation of the esophagus by stomach contents. If this condition is not treated and if it occurs frequently, repeated damage to the walls of the esophagus can cause blood loss and a progressive narrowing of the channel, making swallowing difficult. Ulcers can also occur in the esophagus and, if the aggression is prolonged, there is a risk of developing esophageal cancer. The pain of heartburn can simulate that which occurs during a heart attack and it is important, if in doubt, to consult a doctor urgently. //Causes// During a meal, food passes from the mouth to the stomach through a tube called the esophagus. Under normal conditions, the connection between the esophagus and the stomach does not allow food or stomach secretions to flow back up. If this mechanism does not work properly, stomach acid can reach the walls of the esophagus, irritating them and causing heartburn. One of the causes of this reflux is a hiatal hernia, a condition in which part of the stomach passes above the diaphragm, entering the chest cavity. A very large meal, leaning forward and a horizontal position are factors that can contribute to reflux and, therefore, to the occurrence of heartburn. Pregnancy, stress, tobacco, coffee (even decaffeinated), alcohol, carbonated drinks, citrus fruits, tomatoes, chocolate, mint, onions and very fatty or spicy foods are other causes associated with this symptomatology. Among medications, aspirin, ibuprofen, some sedatives and antihypertensives can also cause this condition. //Diagnosis// When faced with a patient complaining of heartburn, the doctor should try to obtain, through clinical history and objective examination, a diagnostic hypothesis that is as precise as possible.  These elements are often enough to start treatment, with a reassessment being important a few weeks later. In fact, in many cases a significant improvement is achieved in this way without the need to carry out further examinations. In other cases, this investigation may be relevant and, within it, upper digestive endoscopy and respiratory testing to search for helicobacter pylori stand out. //Treatment// There are several medications that can be used to treat reflux. The most commonly used classes of drugs are antacids, H2 receptor blockers and proton pump inhibitors. These drugs aim to reduce or neutralize stomach acid secretion, so that damage to the esophagus is less significant in the presence of reflux. All of these substances must be prescribed by a doctor, who will be able to select the most appropriate one for each case. In more severe cases, surgery may be necessary to correct the cause of the reflux. //Prevention// There are several non-medical measures that can help combat heartburn, such as eating at least two to three hours before going to sleep, lying down with the head elevated, stopping smoking, losing weight, not overeating, avoiding too much clothing. tight spaces and foods that tend to cause the problem. These indications help prevent the reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus or reduce the formation of acid in the stomach.

Overactive bladder,"//What is it?//  Overactive bladder is a neuromuscular disorder in which the muscle in the bladder wall contracts inappropriately during filling, compromising the storage phase. When the bladder is not full, its muscles are relaxed. When it is fuller, signals are sent to the nervous system with this information, triggering the urge to urinate. Overactive bladder occurs when this signal is sent even when the bladder is not full, or when the bladder muscles are too active, forcing the bladder to contract even when it is not full, thus causing an urgent need to urinate. Overactive bladder does not correspond to a disease but to a set of symptoms, such as the urgent need to urinate (urination urgency), with or without incontinence, usually accompanied by frequency and an increase in the number of nocturnal urinations (nocturia), in the absence of infection or other illness that may explain these symptoms. This condition significantly affects quality of life, increases the risk of depression and reduces sleep quality. Psychological effects are common, with feelings of fear, shame and guilt. Concern regarding odor, the feeling of dirt, incontinence during sexual activity can compromise the emotional life of affected patients and urinary frequency and the need to interrupt tasks interfere with the ability to work and travel. In the United States of America, it is estimated that around 30% of men and 40% of women experience symptoms of overactive bladder. In Portugal, it is estimated that the prevalence of symptoms indicative of overactive bladder is slightly higher in men than in women. These numbers may be higher because many people with symptoms do not go to the doctor out of shame or because they are unaware that treatment exists. The prevalence of overactive bladder increases with age (20% at age 70 and 30% at age 75); however, it should not be seen as part of aging, but rather as a disorder that can be treated. //Symptoms// The main symptom is the feeling of urgency to urinate. This feeling is almost uncontrollable and is accompanied by the fear of not being able to reach a bathroom in time. There may or may not be loss of some urine. There is also an increase in the number of daily urinations and it is common to wake up during the night more than once with the urge to urinate. It is important to highlight that the symptoms of overactive bladder can result from a urinary tract infection, nerve damage or be a side effect of some medications. As such, it is essential to always consult a doctor when symptoms of overactive bladder appear. //Causes// The causes of overactive bladder are diverse: trauma with spinal cord injury, stroke, multiple sclerosis, dementia, Parkinson's disease, diabetes, heart failure, peripheral venous insufficiency, medications (diuretics, bethanechol), postural changes, coughing and walking. People with depression or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus have a higher risk of developing an overactive bladder. Age (over 75 years), arthritis, oral hormone replacement therapy, women with increased body mass index, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, constipation, immobility, bladder or vaginal surgery, hysterectomy, and some medications (beta blockers, antidepressants, antipsychotics, some antihypertensives, diuretics, sedatives) are also risk factors for this condition. Physiological changes associated with aging, such as decreased bladder capacity and changes in muscle tone, also favor the development of overactive bladder. Some foods are irritating to the bladder, such as caffeine, alcohol and spicy foods, and therefore accentuate the symptoms of overactive bladder. //Diagnosis// Diagnosis is based on clinical history, medical examination and some additional tests, such as urine analysis and assessment of post-void residue. A neurological examination is important in some cases. In other cases, an ultrasound of the bladder may be useful. //Treatment// Treatment depends on the severity of the symptoms and their impact on the patient's lifestyle. Treatment may be pharmacological, behavioral or surgical. A combination of the first two is effective in most patients. There are medications that relax the bladder muscle and prevent it from contracting at the wrong times. Behavioral interventions consist of limiting the consumption of bladder irritants (caffeine, alcohol), bladder training, urgency suppression techniques, and pelvic floor exercises. Other options are neuromodulatory treatments, in which electrical stimuli are used on the nerves to modify their functioning, and botulinum toxin, administered to the bladder to reduce its frequency of contraction. Surgery is indicated in cases where other modalities are not effective. If other conditions are identified as the cause of overactive bladder symptoms, they should be treated accordingly. //Prevention// There are some activities that can reduce the risk of developing overactive bladder: regular physical exercise, reducing caffeine and alcohol consumption, not smoking, treating and controlling chronic diseases, such as diabetes, which can contribute to overactive bladder, carrying out exercises to strengthen the pelvic muscles.

An ostomy is a surgery in which an alternative exit route for feces or urine is created. It can be temporary or permanent, depending on each case. It is common for those who suffer from urinary incontinence to feel reluctant to admit it, which means they will not receive the most appropriate treatment.

Neurogenic bladder,"//What is it?// Neurogenic bladder consists of the loss of normal bladder function caused by damage to part of the nervous system. Neurogenic bladder may originate from a disease, trauma, or birth defect that affects the brain, spinal cord, or nerves that go to the bladder, its sphincter, or both. There are different types of neurogenic bladder: low activity, when it is unable to contract and empty well, or hyperactive, when it empties due to uncontrolled reflexes. The normal function of the bladder is to store urine and eliminate it in a coordinated manner through the urethra. This coordination is regulated through a complex interaction between the central and peripheral nervous system and, if it is disturbed, a neurogenic bladder can develop. //Symptoms// The inability to control urine output (urinary incontinence) is associated with neurogenic bladder. The patient may experience intermittent urinary flow, discomfort during urination or even inability to urinate. This urinary retention may result from an inability to contract the bladder muscle or a loss of coordination between this muscle and the bladder sphincter. Symptoms of urinary infection or kidney dilation may occur as a result of neurogenic bladder. Symptoms associated with the formation of bladder stones may also occur. If urine refluxes from the bladder to the ureters and from there to the kidney, kidney damage or infection can occur, with even more serious consequences. Symptoms vary according to the stage in which the bladder is, low activity or overactive. As a bladder with low activity, in general, it cannot empty, it dilates until it becomes very large. This dilation is usually not painful because the bladder expands slowly and has very little or no local nerve activity. In some cases, the bladder remains enlarged but loses small amounts of urine constantly (overflow incontinence). Bladder infections are common in people who have an underactive bladder, as the stasis of residual urine provides the conditions to stimulate the growth of bacteria. Bladder stones may form. Symptoms of a bladder infection vary depending on the amount of nerve activity remaining in the bladder. An overactive bladder can fill and empty without control and with varying degrees of discomfort, as it contracts and empties reflexively, that is, involuntarily. When there is an underactive or overactive bladder, the pressure and backflow of urine from the bladder and through the ureters can damage the kidneys. In people who have a spinal cord injury, bladder contraction and sphincter relaxation may not be coordinated, so the pressure in the bladder remains high and does not allow urine to leave the kidneys. This can result in kidney damage. //Causes// A low-activity neurogenic bladder is usually the result of interruption of the local nerves that stimulate it. The most common cause in children is a birth defect of the spinal cord, such as spina bifida or myelomeningocele. An overactive bladder usually results from a disruption of normal bladder control by the spinal cord and brain. A common cause is trauma or a disease, such as multiple sclerosis, which affects the spinal cord and which can be associated with paralysis of the legs (paraplegia) or arms and legs (tetraplegia). Diabetes Mellitus and AIDS are diseases that also affect peripheral nerves and can cause urinary retention. In these diseases, the nerves that control the bladder are destroyed, causing progressive and painless distension. In fact, in Diabetes patients lose the sensation of filling their bladder. Around 25% of patients who suffer a stroke develop urinary retention. Other diseases that can cause neurogenic bladder are polio, Guillain-Barré syndrome, genitoanal area herpes, anemia, neurosyphilis, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. Some types of tumors can also cause neurogenic bladder. //Diagnosis// When neurogenic bladder is suspected, it is important to evaluate both the nervous system and the urinary system. A medical examination may allow you to detect an enlarged bladder by examining the lower part of the abdomen. Radiological studies in which a radiopaque substance is injected through a vein (intravenous urography), or through a probe that is inserted into the bladder (cystography) or urethra (urethrography), provide more information. X-rays can show the caliber of the ureters and the size of the bladder and, possibly, the presence of stones and kidney damage, which provides the doctor with valuable information about how the kidneys are functioning. Ultrasound provides similar information. Cystoscopy is a procedure that allows observation of the inside of the bladder through a flexible endoscope that is inserted into the urethra, generally without causing pain. The amount of urine left in the bladder after urinating can be measured by inserting a probe through the urethra to empty the bladder. Internal bladder and urethral pressure can be measured by connecting the probe to a meter (cystometrography). The study of the brain and spinal cord using imaging methods such as magnetic resonance imaging complements this information. //Treatment// The main goal of treating neurogenic bladder is to prevent kidney damage. On the other hand, it is important to minimize the limitations and social impact of this dysfunction. The earlier the treatment, the lower the risk of deterioration in kidney function and the less need for future surgery. When the cause of a low-activity (hypotonic) bladder is a neurological injury, a probe (or catheter) may be inserted through the urethra to empty the bladder constantly or intermittently. The probe is inserted as soon as possible after the injury, to prevent the bladder muscle from being damaged by excessive stretching and to prevent infections. Permanently placing a catheter causes fewer physical problems in women than in men. In a man, the probe can cause inflammation of the urethra and the tissues surrounding it. People who develop an overactive bladder may also need a tube to facilitate emptying if bladder outlet spasms prevent it from emptying completely. In quadriplegic men, who cannot use the tube themselves for this purpose, it is possible that the bladder outlet sphincter will have to be sectioned to allow it to empty and an external collection device must be used. Treatment with medications can improve urine storage in the bladder, can relieve symptoms associated with bladder irritation or incontinence, and can improve bladder control. In general, control of an overactive bladder can be modified with medications that relax the bladder, such as anticholinergics. However, they often cause side effects, such as dry mouth and constipation; Furthermore, it is difficult to improve bladder emptying with medication in patients with a neurogenic bladder. Sometimes surgery is recommended to make urine drain through an external opening made in the abdominal wall or to increase the size of the bladder. Urine leaving the kidneys can be diverted to the surface of the body by excising a short segment of the small intestine and connecting the ureters to it; in this case, the urine is collected in a bag. The bladder can be enlarged with a segment of intestine in a procedure called augmentation cystoplasty, and the individual can thus perform self-algalization. In infants, the connection is made between the bladder and an opening in the skin as a temporary measure, until the child is old enough for permanent surgery. In all cases, it is important to reduce the risk of stones forming in the urine as much as possible. . Kidney function must be strictly monitored. Any kidney infection must be treated immediately. It is recommended to drink at least eight glasses of liquid per day. Although complete recovery from any type of neurogenic bladder is not common, some people recover quite well with treatment. //Prevention// Although most forms of neurogenic bladder cannot be prevented, it is possible to delay its development in patients with Diabetes by strictly controlling blood glucose levels. From another perspective, using a seat belt when driving a car and not carrying out activities that increase the risk of spinal cord injuries is an important way to prevent this type of neurogenic bladder.

How prevalent is it? And how does it impact quality of life? Paulo Azinhais, urologist at CUF, answers 5 questions about the disease. An ostomy is a surgery in which an alternative exit route for feces or urine is created. It can be temporary or permanent, depending on each case. It is common for those who suffer from urinary incontinence to feel reluctant to admit it, which means they will not receive the most appropriate treatment.

Biopsies,"//Advantages and benefits// Obtaining these samples allows, for example, studying their microscopic structure, identifying abnormal growth patterns, changes in the normal architecture of the cells that make up this tissue, the presence of inflammatory reactions or microorganisms. In conjunction with other techniques, a biopsy allows us to obtain very rich information and, therefore, makes the diagnosis more accurate and the treatment more appropriate. In the case of surgery, the biopsy allows, during the intervention itself, to understand what type of lesion is present and, in the case of tumors, it allows to assess whether the entire tumor was removed with an adequate safety margin. Thus, the biopsy works as a complement to surgery, enhancing the benefits it aims to offer the patient.  //Methodology// The methodology depends on the type of biopsy. Most involve the use of a sharp instrument to remove a small amount of tissue. If the biopsy is performed on the skin, a local anesthetic is used beforehand. Biopsies can be performed using a needle, or guided by computed tomography or ultrasound, so that the tissue collection instrument is directed to the desired location. In the case of bone cancer, a bone biopsy is performed, which may involve minor surgery. In cases of leukemia or lymphoma, a bone marrow biopsy is done, usually on the iliac crest bone. Biopsies of organs such as the liver, kidney or prostate allow the diagnosis of diseases in these locations. In general, it is possible to perform a biopsy in any location and in any organ. In the specific case of the skin, a circular blade is used to obtain a cylindrical sample of skin. In the presence of cystic lesions, an aspiration biopsy is performed, which allows the contents to be aspirated and sent for analysis. This type of biopsy is also useful in Ophthalmology where it allows the collection of samples of the contents of the eyeball (aqueous or vitreous humor) which are important for the diagnosis of eye diseases. Depending on the site to be studied, biopsies can be more or less complex, more or less invasive. More superficial biopsies, such as skin biopsies, can be done in an office at the same time the lesion is identified. As mentioned, in these cases a local anesthetic is used to reduce discomfort during the procedure. More invasive biopsies must be performed in a hospital setting and may require sedation and pain medications. It is normal to experience some discomfort at the biopsy site for a few days. In many cases, the biopsy area is simply protected by a dressing; in other cases, a few stitches may be needed to close the site where the biopsy was performed and thus speed up healing. Once the sample has been collected, it is properly preserved and sent to a laboratory where it will be studied according to the objective to be clarified. In some cases, the result is very quick; in others, techniques are required whose results can take a week or more. For biopsies performed under local anesthesia, the patient does not need to remain in the Clinic or Hospital; if general anesthesia is necessary, an overnight stay in the Hospital may be recommended.  //Complications// Complications from a biopsy are rare. Bleeding or infection may occur at the site of collection. Pain is generally well tolerated and resolves with the use of painkillers. More rarely, fever, swelling at the biopsy site, pain that worsens despite medication, persistent bleeding or suppuration at the biopsy site may occur. In most cases, no preparation is necessary, but sometimes it may be recommended to stop taking medications that interfere with clotting to reduce the risk of bleeding. In each specific case, you will always be given full information about the preparation required before a biopsy.  //Indications// Biopsies are useful for identifying masses, tumors or cysts and for studying skin diseases. During surgery to remove a tumor, performing a biopsy during surgery allows you to assess whether the entire tumor has been removed and whether the safety margin has been respected. Thus, tissue removal may or may not be increased depending on the results obtained in real time. Other interesting applications are the characterization of lesions that arise after trauma and that may correspond to a reaction to a foreign body or nonspecific inflammatory processes that may result from a bacterial, viral or other type of microorganism infection.  //Care to be taken// Depending on the type and location of the biopsy, care may vary and will be duly explained before the procedure. Biopsies are an extremely useful diagnostic tool. Through them, many diseases can be properly identified and treated, with a very low degree of invasion, very high safety and increasing effectiveness.

Blepharitis,"//What is it?// Blepharitis is an inflammation of the eyelid margin that can affect up to 30% of the population. It is divided into: Anterior (more superficial, where the eyelashes grow) Posterior (deeper, associated with dysfunction of the Meibomian glands located inside the eyelids). Many cases are mixed, involving the eyelid globally. Blepharitis can be associated with skin problems such as rosacea, psoriasis or seborrheic dermatitis, but also with hormonal changes, chemotherapy, or develop gradually with aging. In many cases it is not possible to identify a direct cause. //Symptoms// Symptoms are variable and can be mild and occasional or severe and persistent. The sensation of eye irritation, stinging, burning and red eyes are common. Since the Meibomius glands are essential for the production of tears (lipid component), their dysfunction leads to greater instability of the tear film and consequently complaints of dry eye and possible injuries to the ocular surface. Sometimes small “dandruffs” are visible at the base of the eyelashes. //Treatment// Variable. The application of local moist heat, topical anti-inflammatories or topical or systemic antibiotics may be indicated. Local lubrication is often associated to relieve complaints. Prolonged exposure to television, cell phone and computer screens can have negative effects on your eyes. Find out what to do to take care of your eyes. Do you take a break every 20 minutes from the computer? And a regular eye check-up? These are some of the bad habits that harm your vision and that you should correct.

Blepharospasm,"//What is it?// Essential or primary blepharospasm corresponds to an involuntary repetitive contraction of the eyelid muscles (orbicularis muscle), of unknown cause. It is bilateral and develops gradually, initially as discrete contractions, which worsen over time. There are situations where contractions may be secondary to ocular changes (such as dry eye), which should always be excluded through a thorough ophthalmological examination. Another common condition is hemifacial spasm, where the muscles on one side of the face contract irregularly and uncontrollably. This condition may be secondary to compression of the facial nerve, which should be ruled out.  //Symptoms// Involuntary contraction of the eyelid muscles, which in more advanced cases can lead to significant vision disturbance. Essential blepharospasm disappears during sleep.  //Treatment// The first line of treatment is the periodic application of botulinum toxin to control muscle contractions. Only in specific cases may surgery to excise the affected muscles (myectomy) be indicated. Myopia, astigmatism and hyperopia often lead to the use of glasses or contact lenses. LASIK surgery can restore good vision. Do you wear contact lenses? There are hygiene precautions that you must adopt to keep your eyes healthy and free from infections. Discover best practices here.

Botulism,"//What is it?// Botulism is a rare but serious and potentially fatal disease caused by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. This microbe produces spores that release toxic substances - botulinum toxin - into our nervous system, causing muscle paralysis, respiratory failure and eventual death. This toxin is considered the most lethal produced by bacteria and perhaps the most deadly of all poisons. It is classified as a biological agent, with potential bioterrorism. //Transmission// The bacteria exists in soil and aquatic environments, resisting high temperatures (above 100ºC). The most common type of botulism is foodborne, caused by ingestion of food contaminated with the toxin, especially home-made preserves and smoked products (such as, for example, sausages, ham, sausages). Infant botulism, an even rarer type of botulism, occurs in the first two years of life in babies who eat contaminated food, germinating the spores in the intestine and releasing the toxin. The food most associated with this intoxication is honey. //Symptoms// Symptoms begin 18 to 36 hours after ingesting contaminated food and gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or abdominal pain are the first to appear. Subsequently, patients present neurological symptoms such as difficulty swallowing, speaking, double vision, hoarseness, with progression of paralysis to the respiratory muscles, arms and legs, leading to respiratory failure and eventual death. In infantile botulism, babies appear soft, with weak sucking and swallowing reflexes, weak crying and poor head control. //Treatment// Treatment with anti-botulinum toxin serum is the only effective treatment capable of reversing the condition. Given the severity of the disease, patients must be admitted to intensive care units, almost always requiring ventilatory support to breathe and other supportive treatments. //Prevention// Botulism prevention involves proper food preparation and storage. To prevent infant botulism, honey should not be offered to children before the age of 2, a practice that is wrong but widespread due to the supposed calming properties of honey.

Prostate Braquitherapy,"//What is it?// Prostate cancer is a major male scourge, causing enormous suffering for both the patient and his family. This tumor is the most prevalent in men and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in men. The heavy social, medical and personal burden that prostate cancer entails has driven all efforts towards early detection. Therefore, urologists have done their best to diagnose this tumor at an early stage of the disease, increasing the chances of success of the chosen treatment. Among the various existing alternatives for the treatment of localized malignant prostatic neoplasia, prostatic interstitial brachytherapy stands out due to some characteristics of this technique. The term Brachytherapy, also known as interstitial or internal radiotherapy, derived from the Greek word “brachios”, means short, and refers to the therapeutic effect of radioisotopes placed in contact with the lesion to be treated. Therefore, prostatic brachytherapy consists of placing radioisotope seeds in the prostate, via the perineal route, with prostate cancer curative purposes. In reality, prostate brachytherapy is a less invasive surgical technique, without the need for a classic surgical incision, simple and performed in a single session, allowing the patient to be discharged early after approximately 24 hours of the intervention. Taking into account the focus on the patient's quality of life and expectations, we can say that this is an excellent option, as it guarantees the early resumption of normal life, almost immediately (unlike what happens with radical surgery). or external radiotherapy). It is a form of treatment for prostate adenocarcinoma that is very popular in the USA, where it was developed in its modern form in the mid-1980s. In Portugal, it is relatively recent but has a representation comparable to other more established therapies (surgery and external radiotherapy). The development of ultrasound, computers and sophisticated three-dimensional prostate dosimetry programs, as well as perineal grid guidance systems, allowed the development of modern prostate brachytherapy, which finally managed to establish itself as an alternative to classic treatments, radical prostatectomy and external radiotherapy. //Target audience// The selection of patients for this treatment is based on a number of factors. Briefly, the main indication is considered to be localized disease and some locally advanced disease.  There are patients who are universally accepted as “ideal”. However, as the advantages of this technique are considerable, it is possible (and common) to treat patients who do not have all the characteristics. There are therefore more comprehensive, less restrictive criteria, which can be considered as a relative indication, but whose results are equally very good. Different authors recommend different criteria.  In patients at high risk of disease progression, combined treatment with external radiotherapy and androgen hormone blockade may be indicated. As one of the possible – and currently most widely used – therapies for the treatment of localized prostate cancer, it has the same indications as other therapies for the same stage of the disease. //Technique// Prostate brachytherapy involves the insertion of radioactive “implants” (“seeds”) into the prostate, under ultrasound control and real-time monitoring. It is performed in an operating room, under local or general anesthesia. It can be performed on an outpatient basis. The patient is in the lithotomy (“gynecological”) position.  It is a minimally invasive procedure, which lasts between 60 and 120 minutes and does not require a surgical incision or blood transfusion.  As these seeds are placed within the prostate, this allows a high dose of radiation to be released while remaining essentially confined to the prostate. This fact allows the surrounding tissues (healthy tissues) to be practically intact, such as the rectum, bladder and urethra. The application of seeds that can be separated or linked requires an appropriate device.  The control of the number and position of the seeds to be used is done through an extremely sophisticated computer system, with specific software. The implementation of this technique therefore requires a multidisciplinary team that includes, in addition to the Urologist, a Radiotherapist and a Physicist, whose joint, complementary and extremely differentiated action allows the good results described for this technique to be obtained.  The entire operation is meticulously planned in advance. Thirty days after the procedure, a pelvic CT scan is performed to map the prostate three-dimensionally and calculate dosimetry.  In the post-operative period, patients are reassured about the risk of radioactivity emission and instructed to follow certain recommendations regarding their sexual life and relationships with children in particular. //Advantages// Prostate Cancer treatment with Brachytherapy has a curative purpose. According to the results of the world literature, 95% of patients treated with I-125 are free of the disease after 12 years of treatment.  It is associated with very encouraging complication rates. Only about 5% of patients who have not had previous prostate surgery may experience some degree of urinary incontinence. About 10% of men may experience sexual impotence of varying degrees.  In some cases, there may be slight discomfort in the perineal area for 2 to 3 days, which can be effectively treated with mild painkillers. Some blood may be seen in the urine or semen for a few days after the procedure. This is normal and will stop spontaneously after 2 to 3 days.  It is a curative treatment performed in a single session. Patients can return to normal activity (including work) within a few days.  It has numerous advantages, such as high efficacy (greater than External Radiotherapy, as demonstrated by a recent study), lower rate of side effects (such as risk of urinary incontinence and erection problems, which are common after radical prostatectomy and rectal injuries after radiotherapy) shorter anesthesia and hospitalization time (the patient is generally discharged the day after the intervention). The catheterization time is only a few hours (generally less than 24 hours), unlike surgery, where it is necessary to maintain the catheterization for a few days and the return to normal day-to-day activity is also very difficult. faster.  However, it has limitations in relation to patients with large prostates, or those who have undergone previous prostate surgery or with significant symptoms of the lower urinary tract, especially emptying symptoms (“obstructive”). In these situations, special attention must be paid to the risk of post-treatment urinary retention or complaints of bladder instability.

Bronchiolitis,"//What is it?// Bronchiolitis is an acute inflammation of the lower airways, very common in the first two years of life and predominantly in late autumn and winter. Bronchioles are the smallest and narrowest airways that communicate between the larger bronchi and the alveoli. The alveoli are the portion of the lungs where oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange occurs. The respiratory syncytial virus is the agent responsible for more than 70% of cases. Sometimes, in the same episode of acute bronchiolitis, one or more infectious agents may be involved. It is extremely contagious and transmission occurs through contact with contaminated respiratory secretions. Although coughing produces aerosols (small infected droplets) that children inhale, the most common mode of transmission is through hands that have infected secretions. Typically, children acquire the condition after being exposed to family members with the infection or sick children in kindergarten. As such, washing your hands before handling babies is one of the most important measures to reduce contagion. Acute bronchiolitis is characterized by an obstruction of small airways (bronchioles), making it difficult for air to enter the lungs. It mainly affects children under two years of age (maximum incidence between the first and sixth months of life). Most are infected by this virus and develop mild bronchiolitis, not requiring hospital care. The most serious cases (1% to 2% of cases) will have to be admitted to pediatric services. //Symptoms// Bronchiolitis usually begins with a runny nose and blocked nose, cough, with or without fever. After a period of two to three days, breathing difficulties appear, which worsen and are accompanied by wheezing (wheezing), irritability and refusal to eat. In younger children, acute bronchiolitis may manifest itself, at an early stage, through periods of apnea (breathing pauses). Rapid breathing or difficulty breathing in and out may also occur. //Causes// It is a viral infection. Most cases are benign and only 1% to 3.5% of all children with acute bronchiolitis require hospital admission. This percentage is higher in risk groups such as ex-premature babies, minors with chronic respiratory diseases, congenital heart disease, immunodeficiencies and those under the age of three and six months. There are also other factors that increase the risk of disease: masculine gender;/ exposure to tobacco smoke;/ feeding with breast milk for less than one or two months;/ low socioeconomic status;/ //Diagnosis// The diagnosis of bronchiolitis is mainly clinical. An important data to be valued in the physical examination is the measurement of oxygen saturation to assess the need for oxygen administration. Hypoxemia (low oxygen) is an important complication that requires hospital admission. If the progression of acute bronchiolitis is different from usual, it may be necessary to perform blood tests, chest X-rays or collection of secretions to search for viruses. //Treatment// Most acute bronchiolitis is mild and does not require specific treatment. Some helpful measures at home include: create a calm environment;/ avoid irritating factors, such as tobacco;/ raise the head of the bed to 30º;/ use of antipyretics if there is a fever (paracetamol or ibuprofen in babies over six months);/ clear the airways through frequent nasal washing with saline solution and/or suctioning of secretions;/ eat smaller meals at shorter intervals;/ maintain good hydration, giving water between meals;/ The administration of any cough syrup is contraindicated. Respiratory kinesiotherapy is not indicated in acute bronchiolitis because it does not alter the course of the disease and may even worsen it. Bronchodilators, if prescribed, must be administered with a pressurized inhaler associated with an expansion chamber and not with the “aerosol device” which is only recommended for use in specific cases and in the hospital. If breathing difficulties worsen, food refusal or other worrying signs appear, it is essential to consult a doctor. //Prevention// For some children included in the risk group, there are clinical guidelines that recommend prophylaxis with palivizumab, a vaccine to prevent infection by the respiratory syncytial virus. In all cases, to avoid contagion, measures such as the following are recommended: hand washing;/ limit contact with people with respiratory infections, particularly with siblings who attend kindergarten;/ avoid places with large concentrations of people, polluted areas and/or areas with tobacco smoke;/ Portuguese Lung Foundation, 2013 Manual Merck, 2014 Spanish Society of Pediatric Pulmonology, 2006 U.S. National Library of Medicine, agosto de 2013 Patrícia Mação et al., Acute Bronchiolitis, Prospective Study, Acta Med Port 2011; 24(S2): 407-412 Load more;/ RSV infection can progress to bronchiolitis or pneumonia. Mônica Cró Braz, Pediatrician, points out the warning signs and prevention strategies. The pandemic has brought pediatricians an additional concern: Respiratory Syncytial Virus. Since then, cases have appeared earlier, in greater numbers and with greater severity. In most cases, bronchiolitis resolves on its own and your baby will feel better within a few days, but there are cases that require hospitalization.

Bronchitis,"//What is it?// Bronchitis is a process of inflammation of the main airways of the lungs (the bronchi), causing them to narrow, making breathing difficult and causing symptoms such as coughing. This process can be acute or chronic: acute bronchitis occurs for a short period of time; In chronic cases, symptoms occur during most days of the month, over at least three months and in two consecutive years. In bronchitis, there is hypertrophy of the glands that produce mucus along the airways, which explains the productive cough typical of this disease. As the pathology progresses, airflow limitation increases and complications such as pulmonary emphysema may arise. In Portugal, this is a very common condition. According to a study carried out in the country, bronchitis increases in prevalence with age, being around 12.5% ​​in men and 10.2% in women aged between 75 and 84 years. In global terms, bronchitis affects around 3.7% of the Portuguese population. //Symptoms// The main manifestation of bronchitis is cough, which evolves from seasonal to constant, becoming mucopurulent with increasing frequency. Shortness of breath is another important symptom. Chest pain can result from coughing. In acute bronchitis, other symptoms may appear, such as sore throat, runny nose, headache, muscle pain and fatigue. Fever is not common and should make you think of pneumonia or another infection. //Causes// Bronchitis can be caused by infectious agents, such as viruses or bacteria, by tobacco consumption or by inhalation of dust or polluting agents. Some diseases, such as asthma, can be confused with bronchitis. Sinusitis, pharyngitis, tonsillitis or apneumonia can also cause similar conditions. Respiratory viruses are the most common cause, with tobacco consumption being the main cause of chronic bronchitis. In fact, smoking is responsible for about 85% to 90% of cases of chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Smoking inhibits the movement of respiratory cilia, essential for the elimination of debris and microorganisms, interferes with the function of immune system cells, causes hypertrophy of the glands that produce mucus and contributes to the narrowing of the airways. //Diagnosis// The description of symptoms and medical examination, including pulmonary auscultation, are the starting point for diagnosis. The most commonly used tests are chest X-rays. In some situations, it may be important to perform laboratory tests on sputum or perform respiratory function tests. //Treatment// It is important to know that most cases do not require the use of antibiotics to treat acute bronchitis. They will only be important if a bacterial infection is confirmed. The most important measures for your treatment are: drinking plenty of fluids;/ use of inhalers (in the case of asthma);/ rest;/ use aspirin or acetaminophen if there is a fever;/ creation of a humid atmosphere;/ It may be useful to use medications that help dissolve the mucus in sputum, but it is important to only use them under medical advice. It is essential not to smoke, avoid secondhand smoke and pollution and wash your hands frequently to avoid transmitting viruses or other infectious agents. //Prevention// In addition to the measures already mentioned, it is important to remember the role of influenza and pneumococcal vaccines in preventing bronchitis.  The first must be administered between October and December for all people who belong to risk groups; the second must be carried out on chronically ill people and on all people aged 65 or over every five years. Its administration can be carried out at any time of the year.

Bruxism,"//What is it?// Bruxism is a disorder characterized by involuntary clenching and grinding of the teeth, applying excessive force to the chewing muscles, causing wear to the teeth that can affect their integrity and compromise oral health. Two distinct forms of bruxism can be considered: daytime and nighttime. The first is characterized by a semi-voluntary activity of the jaw, with the clenching of the teeth while the individual is awake and where grinding generally does not occur, being related to a tic, habit or a reaction to stress. The second is an unconscious activity of grinding or clenching teeth, producing sounds, while sleeping. Sleep bruxism creates tension in the temporomaxillary joints, which can wear them out and cause headaches. It also causes wear on teeth that can affect their integrity and compromise oral health. Sleep bruxism is a problem that mainly affects children but can also affect adults. It is estimated that the prevalence of bruxism is 20% in adults, and nocturnal bruxism, according to reports from family members, occurs in around 8% of the population. It is also believed that around 100,000 people in Portugal are affected by this condition. //Symptoms// The main symptoms are headaches, discomfort in the temporomandibular joint, pain in the muscles of the face and earlobes, stiff shoulders, limited mouth opening movements and sleep disturbances. There is also wear and tear of tooth enamel or even fracture of teeth, inflammation of the gums, excessive tooth mobility and premature tooth loss. Headaches are the most common symptom, occurring three times more in people with bruxism than in others. In children, it is common to be associated with nasal obstruction and respiratory complaints resulting from hypertrophy of the tonsils and adenoids. It is also normal for changes in behavior and attention to occur in this scenario. //Causes// As for daytime sleepiness, its causes are not known, although stress and anxiety are considered to be risk factors. Some studies show that during nocturnal crises, there is an increase in cardiac, respiratory and muscular activity, which suggests that there is a relationship between sleep mechanisms and bruxism. People with this condition often have other sleep disorders, such as snoring, episodes of apnea (pauses in breathing), talking or hallucinations in the phase between sleeping and waking. Other associated factors are young age, high level of education, tobacco use, and caffeine or alcohol intake. The use of substances to help with sleep, depression and anxiety can alter sleep patterns and increase the risk of bruxism occurring. Stress and anxiety appear to be related to around 70% of cases of bruxism. //Diagnosis// During a dental appointment, several signs of bruxism may be visible, such as uneven tooth wear, cracks or fractures, and tooth or facial muscle sensitivity. A sleep study could help confirm the diagnosis. //Treatment// The consequences of nocturnal bruxism can be controlled by using a relaxation splint placed in the mouth that protects the teeth and reduces muscle activity. Correct articulation of the upper and lower teeth reduces friction between them and improves the quality of chewing. Therefore, monitoring by the dentist is always important. Sometimes there are behavioral therapeutic proposals, such as psychoanalysis, hypnosis and relaxation techniques. However, these still lack sufficient scientific validation. //Prevention// Preventing most episodes of bruxism involves reducing the child's anxiety levels, which can be achieved by trying to relax before bed, for example, by taking a warm bath, listening to calm music, or reading a book. In cases where anxiety cannot be reduced, it may be necessary to consult a dentist or pediatrician in order to carry out a more detailed assessment. Bruxism in childhood is usually outgrown by adolescence. Most children stop grinding and clenching their teeth when their baby teeth are replaced by permanent teeth. However, some continue to do so during adolescence, and if the cause is stress, the grinding will continue until the tension is relieved. In this condition, bruxism can be prevented by trying to talk to children or adolescents to understand their fears and anxieties, and helping them to deal with their problems.

Bulimia,"//What is it?// Bulimia nervosa is a potentially serious eating disorder characterized by the secretive ingestion of large quantities of food, followed by induction of vomiting. In other cases, an attempt is made to compensate for excessive calorie intake with excessively intensive levels of exercise or by using diuretics and laxatives. The urge to expel food can become so intense that it is induced even after a light meal. After episodes of binge eating, patients tend to feel guilty and anxious for not having been able to control their impulsiveness. The sensation of hunger, as it is felt in an aversive way, leads to these compulsive behaviors being experienced with extreme shame, which may lead to their concealment. Bulimia nervosa can be of the purging type, when the patient regularly induces vomiting or uses laxatives, diuretics or enemas, or of the non-purging type, when the patient uses other compensatory behaviors such as fasting or excessive physical exercise. These patients are extremely rigid about their body image and weight management. It is quite common for these patients to have recurring thoughts about food and to have an extremely rigid ideal of thinness. It is estimated that bulimia nervosa affects around 13 out of every 100,000 people annually. Its incidence in women aged 15 to 24 – the highest risk group – has increased over the last 50 years. Some studies suggest that in endangered populations (generally female students) the frequency is around 10%. If we consider teenagers or young women in general, this value is lower and is around 1% to 3%. Bulimia, similar to anorexia nervosa, is related to the perception of body image. //Symptoms// Bulimia manifests itself through excessive concern about the body and weight, a constant fear of gaining weight, feeling unable to control eating behavior, eating until discomfort or pain occurs, inducing vomiting after eating or exercising excessively, inappropriate use of laxatives, diuretics and enemas or use of dietary supplements to lose weight. When bulimia is not properly controlled, complications can arise, such as dehydration, kidney failure, heart problems, menstrual irregularities, tooth and gum deterioration, digestive problems, anxiety, depression and alcohol and/or drug abuse. //Causes// Its exact cause is unknown. Multiple biological, emotional and social factors probably contribute to this condition. The main signs of risk are: Gender: female;/ Age: adolescence and young adults;/ Heredity: greater risk when there are first-degree relatives with eating disorders;/ Psychological and emotional aspects: reduced self-esteem, perfectionism, impulsive behavior, depression, anxiety or presence of an obsessive-compulsive disorder;/ Social Pressure: exerted by close people and the media, especially on young women. People with professions in contact with the public are at greater risk of developing disorders such as bulimia;/ Pressure resulting from sports practice: coaches and family members can, unintentionally, contribute to this situation by encouraging the athlete to lose weight and restrict their diet in favor of better sports performance;/ //Diagnosis// Early diagnosis is important but not always possible. Many patients are of normal weight, which makes it difficult to identify the problem. Generally, to identify bulimia, a medical examination, blood and urine tests, a psychological evaluation and other tests are necessary to rule out similar pathologies. It is considered to be bulimia when the following elements are present at least twice a week for at least three months: repeated episodes of eating large amounts of food with a feeling of inability to control this urge;/ elimination of excess calories through vomiting;/ too much physical exercise;/ fasting or use of diuretics or laxatives;/ excessive influence of weight and body shape on self-esteem;/ exclusion of the diagnosis of anorexia;/ //Treatment// Generally speaking, treatment requires a combination of medication and psychotherapy. In addition to these clinical elements, family support is a fundamental aspect in overcoming this disorder. At the pharmacological level, the most used medications are antidepressants, especially fluoxetine. Proper nutritional monitoring is important to ensure good eating habits, to achieve a healthy weight and to correct imbalances resulting from bulimia. Hospitalization may rarely be necessary. Although symptoms often improve, recovery is sometimes not complete and periods of excessive food intake and subsequent elimination may occur, triggered by everyday events or stress. In these patients, periodic medical or psychological monitoring may be recommended. Through psychological intervention in bulimia nervosa, the patient will be able to develop a regular and flexible eating plan that includes previously avoided foods. Over the course of the intervention, the aim is for the patient to be able to deal with risk situations for compulsive food intake and vomiting. In order for the patient to learn to reduce concerns about their body and weight, attempts will be made to modify maladaptive thoughts, attitudes and emotions related to eating behavior. After the patient improves, the intervention will have as its central objective the prevention of possible factors that could generate a relapse. //Prevention// Prevention involves maintaining healthy lifestyle habits and identifying any signs of this condition early. In younger people, regular pediatric evaluation allows for early identification of eating disorders. Creating an adequate perception of body image by children, through parents, also plays a very important role in preventing bulimia.

Macular hole,"//What is it?// The retina is a tissue located inside and the macula is located in the center of the retina and is responsible for vision in greater detail and allows us to see with great definition. A macular hole (MB) is a small hole in the retina and causes blurred or distorted vision. MBs usually occur as an age-related process and begin after the age of 60.  Is the other eye at risk? If you have a BM in one eye, there is a 10 to 15% risk of developing a BM in the other eye. //Symptoms// In the initial phase, symptoms include slightly distorted or blurred vision. //Causes// Most of the inside of the eye is filled with a gel called vitreous, which maintains the structure of the eyeball. With age, the gel goes through a degenerative process with changes in its structure and consistency and ends up detaching from the surface of the retina. When the vitreous is firmly attached to the retina, and this detachment occurs, it can cause tears and lead to the development of BM. Other causes of BM are: retinal detachments, epiretinal membranes, diabetic retinopathy or eye trauma. //Treatment// In most cases, surgery is necessary and the procedure is called vitrectomy. The surgeon will remove the vitreous from the eye and replace it with gas to allow the retina to heal. This gas will disappear within a few weeks. Until then, you will need to remain in a specific position (prone position). This positioning is extremely important for the success of the surgery. Anesthesia may be local plus sedation or general. Surgery is usually performed on an outpatient basis.  What are the benefits of surgery? The most common benefit is improved vision, although this varies from person to person and with the duration of BM. Recovery can take up to several months. Myopia, astigmatism and hyperopia often lead to the use of glasses or contact lenses. LASIK surgery can restore good vision. It's important to have sunglasses on hand all year round.

Bursitis,"//What is it?// Bursitis is an inflammation of a bursa (or sac), a type of cushion that sits between the bone and the skin, cushioning impacts on the elbow. This sac contains a fluid that reduces friction and facilitates the movement of the skin over the underlying bone. The olecranon bursa is located between the skin and a bony projection of the ulna bone, at the back of the elbow, called the olecranon. Normally, this bursa is flat. If it is irritated or inflamed, more fluid accumulates inside it and bursitis occurs. //Symptoms// As the olecranon bursa is the largest in the elbow, its injury is associated with a significant impairment of the function of this joint. When bursitis is caused by trauma, the elbow swells quickly. When this process is slower, it corresponds to a repeated injury, in which pressure is created by using the elbow to support the body's weight. The elbow may be painful, tender to the touch, or unable to move normally. If the skin is red and warm, it may be a sign of an infection. If the infection is left untreated, it can spread through the bloodstream to other parts of the body. Pus may also drain spontaneously from an infected pocket. Prolonged pain and swelling limit movement, causing motor weakness and muscle atrophy. Attacks of chronic bursitis can last from a few days to several weeks, and relapses often occur. Often the first symptom is swelling, but because the skin in this area of ​​the elbow is very loose, a small build-up of fluid and swelling may not be noticed immediately. //Causes// In the presence of trauma or prolonged support on the bursa, it can become inflamed, a fact that is quite common in professions that involve repeated support of the body on the elbow, such as painters or truck drivers resting the elbow against the window. Although there are other small bursae in the elbow area, the olecranon bursa is the most prominent and is therefore the most affected in sports. Its location, right at the tip of the elbow, also makes it more vulnerable. In the context of sport, this bursitis is most often caused by acute trauma, such as a fall. Although bursitis can result from chronic overuse of a joint or trauma, there are other causes, such as a wound, gout, pseudogout, rheumatoid arthritis or infections. In fact, an infection at the end of the elbow, such as an insect bite or a wound, allows bacteria to enter and reach the bursa, infecting it. Often the cause is not identified.  //Diagnosis// A medical examination is important. The presence of an area at the tip of the elbow that is painful to the touch and the occurrence of pain with some specific movements of the joint are highly suggestive signs of the presence of elbow bursitis. If the bursa is very swollen, the doctor may use a needle and syringe to extract a sample of fluid from the bursa to perform tests to help determine the cause of the inflammation (such as an infection or gout). X-rays are not usually helpful unless calcium deposits are present. Therefore, this type of examination will be important to rule out other associated problems. //Treatment// When the swelling develops gradually, is not very large and no trauma has occurred, some measures can be used, such as stopping activities that put pressure on the elbow, applying ice for 15 to 20 minutes, three or four times a day and elevating the elbow above the level of the heart. If symptoms persist, the elbow is red, the pain increases or trauma has occurred, it is important to see a doctor to rule out an associated fracture. Anti-inflammatories are equally useful and, in some cases, corticosteroid infiltration or aspiration of their contents may be used. The surgery involves removing the bursa and involves a short period of immobilization to protect the skin. Some time in physiotherapy may be recommended to improve elbow mobility. As a rule, the skin heals in 10 to 14 days and, after 3 to 4 weeks, it can be used without restrictions although it must be protected for a few months to prevent relapses or new lesions. In cases of acute bursitis, taking an oral corticosteroid, such as prednisone, for a few days helps to relieve the pain. When the pain subsides, specific exercises are useful to increase the degree of joint movement. Treatment for chronic bursitis is similar, although rest or immobilization is less likely to be effective. Bursitis that limits joint function can be relieved by several corticosteroid injections along with intensive physical therapy to restore joint function. Exercises help strengthen weakened muscles and restore full range of joint movement. Bursitis often recurs if the underlying cause, such as gout, rheumatoid arthritis, or chronic overuse of the joint, is not corrected. In the presence of infection, antibiotics are essential, either orally or injected directly into the bursa. //Prevention// Prevention involves avoiding subjecting the elbow to excessive pressure.

Kidney stones,"//What is it?// Kidney stones, usually called urinary lithiasis or urolithiasis, correspond to a disease in which stones are formed in the urinary tract. They are solid structures that result from the agglomeration of crystals that form due to a metabolic change in the organism. This change determines an increase in the urinary excretion of substances that favor the formation of stones, such as calcium, uric acid, oxalate and phosphate and/or a decrease in the elimination of substances that inhibit this formation (citrate and magnesium, among others). The chemical composition of the crystals determines the type of stone: calcium oxalate (60%), calcium oxalate associated with calcium phosphate (20%), uric acid (8%), struvite (8%), calcium phosphate (2%) and cystine and other components (2%). Approximately one person in every 100 develops urinary stones in their lifetime. Around 80% of these expel the stone spontaneously, along with urine. Its elimination can be very painful but, in general, it does not cause permanent damage. The remaining 20% ​​will need some type of treatment. //Symptoms// The presence of stones in the urinary tract may have no signs or trigger very intense symptoms, namely renal colic and serious clinical complications, which can end in chronic renal failure. When a kidney stone moves from the kidney and passes into the ureter, intense pain occurs in the lower back on the same side, below the insertion of the ribs. This pain tends to spread to the lower abdomen and groin and comes in waves that vary in intensity. There is also pain when urinating, and the urine may turn pink, red or brown, as a result of the trauma caused by the stone on the ureter wall. It is often associated with nausea and vomiting and a persistent urge to urinate. Fever and chills may also occur. As a rule, as the stone moves, the pain varies in location and intensity. //Causes// The most frequent metabolic changes that can create conditions for stone formation are increased urinary excretion of calcium, uric acid and oxalate, as well as decreased elimination of citrate and, less frequently, magnesium. Recurrent urinary infections cause a specific type of stones. In this case, treatment and prevention may include prolonged use of antibiotics to keep the urine bacteria-free. The risk is greater when there is a family history of this condition, over the age of 40, in males, in people who drink little liquid and/or who live in hot climates and with diets very rich in proteins, sodium and sugar. Obesity is another factor to be considered, as well as some digestive diseases or surgeries. Renal tubular acidosis, cystinuria, hyperparathyroidism and the use of certain medications are elements that can promote the formation of kidney stones. //Diagnosis// After the first diagnosis of urolithiasis, it is important to consult a urologist who will carry out the entire diagnostic process and try to determine the type of stone and the associated metabolic change. The examination involves clinical observation, supplemented by blood and urine tests. The chemical composition of the stone can only be determined by biochemical observation of the stone. Therefore, if it is removed, it should be sent for analysis. If it is not, the patient should be instructed on techniques for its recovery, such as urinating into a paper filter. Once recovered, the stone should be stored in a dry jar. Imaging studies are important. Depending on the case, X-rays, ultrasound or computed tomography may be used to determine the location. //Treatment// Treatment for urinary lithiasis involves several phases. In the initial stage, during renal colic, pain relief is essential. Here, analgesics and anti-inflammatories are very important. In a second stage, if necessary, the stones must be removed or fragmented. Fragmentation can be performed using ultrasound. Removal is performed through the urethra or by making a small incision in the dorsal region. The final phase involves preventing the formation of new stones. This involves diet and, whenever necessary, the use of appropriate medication. As the formation of urinary stones results from a chronic metabolic change, when there is the presence of a first stone, the patient will always be susceptible to the formation of more. It is estimated that about 50% of untreated patients will develop a new stone within five to 10 years. It is also important to consider when treating urinary lithiasis, addressing the metabolic changes responsible for its formation. //Prevention// Prevention involves general measures, such as increasing fluid intake and changes in diet. It is important that patients drink around two liters of fluids per day (three liters on hotter days) in order to make the urine less concentrated and prevent the formation of new stones. This preventive measure is very important as, in the absence of any other treatment, it can reduce the formation of lithiasis in around 60% of cases. It is recommended to drink water, orange, lemon or apple juice. Black tea, coffee and cola drinks should be avoided. Dietary changes can be made by a urologist and can be, if necessary, complemented by a nutritionist. In general, the intake of milk and dairy products is permitted, generally twice a day. Preference should be given to lean meats in moderate amounts to reduce protein intake. It is also important to reduce the amount of salt and avoid salty foods. Likewise, fat and sugar intake should be limited. For each patient, other specific dietary measures can be adopted. In fact, depending on the composition of the stones, it is important to select the most appropriate diet. These preventive measures make it possible to reduce, in more than 80% of cases, the growth of existing stones and the formation of new ones. J.

Bladder cancer,"//What is it?// Bladder cancer usually originates in the cells lining the bladder, that is, the urothelium. Approximately 75% of patients with bladder cancer present at diagnosis with disease confined to the mucosa and submucosa (non-musculoinvasive tumors). This type of cancer has a high prevalence due to the long-term survival rate compared to muscle-invasive tumors.  //Prevention// There are no prevention strategies for bladder cancer. //Risk Factors// Smoking habits;/ Smoking is the most common risk factor for bladder cancer, causing 50-65% of male cases and 20-30% of female cases. The incidence of bladder cancer is directly related to the duration of smoking and the number of cigarettes smoked per day. An immediate reduction in the risk of bladder cancer was observed in those who stopped smoking. The reduction was approximately 40% within 1-4 years and 60% after 25 years of stopping smoking.  Occupational exposure to chemicals;/ Occupational exposure is the second most important risk factor for bladder cancer. It has been reported to account for 20–25% of all bladder cancer cases in several work-related studies. Chemical exposures include benzene derivatives and amines, and are most likely to occur in workers in the dye, rubber, textile, leather, paint, and other chemical industries. The risk of bladder cancer due to occupational exposure to carcinogenic aromatic amines is significantly increased after 10 or more years of exposure. The average latency period usually exceeds 30 years.  Radiotherapy;/ Increased rates of secondary malignancy in the bladder have been reported after external beam radiotherapy for gynecologic cancers. In a population-based cohort study, the standardized incidence ratios for bladder cancer after various prostate cancer treatments such as radical prostatectomy, radiotherapy, brachytherapy, and radiotherapy-brachytherapy were 0.99, 1.42, 1.10, and 1.39, respectively, compared with the general population in the United States. Therefore, all patients who have received any radiotherapy treatment require long-term follow-up, given the high risk of developing bladder cancer.  Diet;/ Several dietary factors have been studied to see if they are related to bladder cancer. A large prospective multicentre European Study on Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) found no association between diet, lifestyle, or environmental factors and cancer. That is, no association was found between bladder cancer and fluid intake, red meat, or fruit and vegetable consumption.  Bladder schistosomiasis or bilharziasis and chronic urinary tract infection;/ Bladder schistosomiasis (bilharziasis) is the second most common parasitic infection after malaria, with approximately 600 million people exposed in Africa, Asia, South America and the Caribbean. There is a well-established link between bladder carcinoma and infection by this parasite, which can develop into squamous cell carcinoma. Improved control of the disease is reducing the incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder in endemic areas such as Egypt. Likewise, invasive squamous cell carcinoma has been associated with the presence of a chronic urinary tract infection distinct from schistosomiasis. A direct association between bladder cancer and urinary tract infections has been observed in several case-control studies.  Sex;/ Although men are more likely to develop bladder cancer than women, women present with more advanced disease and have worse survival rates. A meta-analysis of a total population of almost 28,000 patients showed that female gender was associated with a worse survival outcome than male gender after surgical treatment. A population-based study indicated that women experienced more delays in diagnosis than men, as there were more differential diagnoses that included diseases that are more prevalent than bladder cancer. Differences in the prevalence of bladder cancer between men and women may be due to factors other than tobacco and chemical exposure. In a prospective cohort study, postmenopausal status was associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer, even after adjustment for smoking status. This result suggests that differences in estrogen and androgen levels between men and women may be responsible for some difference in bladder cancer prevalence.  Genetic factors;/ There is growing evidence that genetic susceptibility factors and familial associations may influence the incidence of bladder cancer. In one study, a family history of cancer in first-degree relatives was found to be associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer, and the association was stronger in younger patients. Recent studies have found genetic susceptibility at a number of independent loci that have been associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer. //Symptoms// Bladder cancer symptoms are not exclusive, they can appear in other diseases, namely infections. Just because you have one or more of the symptoms described here does not mean you have bladder cancer. Bladder cancer symptoms are not exclusive and can appear in other diseases, including infections. The existence of one or more of the symptoms described here does not mean that there is bladder cancer. Symptoms to look out for are: -Blood in the urine (hematuria) – urinating blood is the most frequent sign in the presentation of bladder cancer. Hematuria is usually asymptomatic. -Frequent urge to urinate, often with urinary urgency. //Who should I contact?// If you suspect cancer, due to symptoms or a complementary diagnostic test that presents an alteration, you should consult a Urologist, or alternatively, less commonly, an Oncologist. Meet our team of experts The different subtypes have different prognoses and treatments. •Urothelial carcinoma – is the most common subtype, accounting for more than 90% of all cases. •Urothelial carcinoma with partial squamous and/or glandular differentiation – partial squamous or glandular differentiation worsens the prognosis. •Micropapillary or microcystic urothelial carcinoma – aggressive variant with a worse prognosis. •“nested variant” (including large nested variety); lymphoepithelioma, plasmacytoma, giant cell, undifferentiated. •Transitional cell carcinoma with trophoblastic differentiation. •Small cell carcinoma (very rare) – very aggressive tumor. •Sarcomatoid carcinoma – very aggressive variant with a serious prognosis. //Diagnosis and Staging// In a patient with a clinical history and physical examination suspicious of bladder cancer, general tests, as well as a urinary cytology, should be requested. Acytologyhas a high specificity. Urinary markers for diagnosis are not recommended. Performing a bladder ultrasound is often enough to diagnose bladder cancer. However, the best, most sensitive and specific means of diagnosing bladder cancer is cystoscopy. If imaging studies clearly demonstrate a bladder tumor, diagnostic cystoscopy may be omitted. Cystoscopy is a procedure performed on an outpatient basis by a urologist, in that a cystoscope (an endoscope) is passed through the urethra into the bladder. This device allows you to observe the mucosa and, in most cases, diagnose bladder cancer. Any suspicious image of bladder cancer, taken through vesicaloucystoscopy ultrasound, subsequently involves resection through the urethra, in the surgical center under anesthesia, of the suspicious lesions and sending them for anatomopathological study. This study allows confirmation of the diagnosis of bladder cancer, checking the histological subtype, checking its aggressiveness (papillomas, low and high grade tumors – WHO 2004) and checking if it is superficial, that is, it does not invade the muscular layer of the bladder, or if it is muscle-invasive. Staging is the process by which we make sure whether bladder cancer is superficial, that is, it does not invade the muscular layer of the bladder, whether it is muscle invasive or whether it locally invades neighboring organs or even has distant metastases. For correct staging, information on the anatomopathological results of transurethral resection of the bladder tumor is required, complemented by pelvic and abdominal imaging exams. The information obtained through the staging process determines the stage of the disease and the prognosis. In addition, staging determines the treatment. Thus, bladder cancers are divided into non-muscle invasive, that is, they do not invade the bladder muscle itself and therefore do not require bladder removal in most cases, and muscle invasive, which in most cases requires surgical removal of the bladder (radical cystectomy) supplemented with chemotherapy.  Tests required in most situations for staging bladder cancer: Pelvic, abdominal and thoracic CT scan – allows you to visualize the presence of cancer in the bladder, lymph nodes or other locations in the pelvis, abdomen or chest. Pelvic and abdominal magnetic resonance imaging – magnetic resonance imaging can be an alternative to CT in staging.  Based on the urethral resection of the bladder tumor and pathological analysis and staging diagnostic examinations performed, the staging of bladder cancer can be classified as follows: Primary tumor;/ TX Primary tumor not evaluable T0 No evidence of primary tumor Ta Non-invasive papillary carcinoma Tis Carcinoma (“tumor plano”) T1 Tumor that invades the subepithelial connective tissue T2 Tumor invading muscle T2a Tumor invading the superficial muscle layer (inner half) T2b Tumor invading the deep muscle layer (outer half) T3 Tumor invading perivesical tissue T3a Microscopicamente T3b Macroscopically (extravesical mass) T4 Tumor that invades any of the following structures: prostate, uterus, vagina, pelvic wall, abdominal wall T4a Tumor invading the prostate, uterus, or vagina T4b Tumor invading the pelvic wall or abdominal wall Lymph nodes;/ NX Regional lymph nodes not assessable N0 No metastases in regional lymph nodes N1 Metastases in a single lymph node less than or equal to 2 cm in maximum diameter N2 Metastases in a single lymph node greater than 2 cm but less than 5 cm in maximum diameter or in multiple lymph nodes, none larger than 5 cm in dimension N3 Lymph node metastases greater than 5 cm in maximum diameter Metastases;/ MX Distant metastases not assessable M0 No distant metastases M1 Distant metastases //Treatment// Optimal treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer requires the involvement of a highly specialized multidisciplinary team and an integrated model to avoid fragmentation of patient care. Bladder cancer treatment can be divided into two main groups depending on whether or not it invades the bladder muscle (detrusor). In non-muscle invasive bladder cancers, that is, superficial (stage Ta, T1), complete transurethral resection of the tumor may be sufficient treatment, sometimes complemented with intravesical application of chemotherapy or immunotherapy.;/  In the case of muscle-invasive bladder tumors, i.e. those invading the muscular layer of the bladder (stage T2 or higher), high-grade superficial T1 tumors associated with carcinoma in situ, multiple and/or recurrent and/or large high-grade T1 tumors, aggressive histological subtypes and tumors with lymphatic and vascular invasion, radical cystectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy (surgical removal of the bladder and pelvic lymph nodes) is indicated. Nowadays, in most situations where cystectomy is indicated, patients may benefit from chemotherapy before surgery, i.e. neoadjuvant chemotherapy.;/  Radiotherapy in general is not a first-line treatment for bladder cancer. However, it may be indicated in palliative situations or in attempts to preserve the bladder in selected cases.

This surgery involves the creation of a new bladder made from the small intestine (ileum) that allows urination through the urethra or the creation of a cutaneous urinary diversion (urostomy) requiring the placement of a urine collection bag on the abdominal wall.

The patient keeps the BCG in the bladder for two hours, then eliminates it. This treatment is generally performed once a week for a minimum of 6 weeks; Systemic chemotherapy - This is the most common way of administering chemotherapy, through a peripheral vein, in a day hospital run by a medical oncologist. Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors – it has recently been demonstrated that this type of immunotherapy may be more effective than systemic chemotherapy in the case of advanced bladder cancer. Clinical trials – Participation in clinical trials is often an opportunity and a hope for treatment at certain stages of bladder cancer.  Patients who have had bladder cancer must be monitored by a urologist. They must be observed regularly in consultation to perform cystoscopies and/or other complementary tests such as Tomography or Magnetic Resonance Imaging.
