Circuncisao,"//What is it?// Circumcision consists of the surgical removal of the foreskin (distal portion of retractable skin of the penis) that covers the glans (end of the penis). This procedure can be performed on both children and adult men. Circumcision does not affect men's fertility or sex life, and worldwide, about 33% are circumcised.  //Who is it for?// The foreskin is completely attached to the glans in almost all newborns, making it impossible to retract - physiological phimosis. This is a natural condition that, as a rule, disappears spontaneously with growth and, in around 90% of cases, the foreskin becomes completely retractable by the age of 3. Therefore, circumcision in children should be considered in the presence of certain medical conditions: Dysuria (pain, discomfort, or burning when urinating) associated with phimosis;/ Recurrent balanoposthitis (joint inflammation of the glans and foreskin);/ In paraffin;/  In adults, there are several medical indications for performing a circumcision: Phimosis: inability to retract the foreskin over the glans. It can cause pain when the penis is erect and, in some cases, make urination and sexual intercourse difficult.;/ Recurrent balanitis: inflammation of the glans.;/ Paraphimosis: this is a urological emergency that requires immediate surgical treatment to avoid complications such as restriction of blood flow to the penis.;/ Balanitis xerotic obliterans: chronic and progressive inflammation that causes phimosis and can affect the glans, foreskin, urinary meatus (external orifice of the urethra) and anterior urethra.;/ Recurrent balanoposthitis;/ Posthitis: inflammation of the foreskin.;/ Foreskin neoplasia;/ Correction of urination difficulties (difficulty in directing the urinary stream).;/ Penile cancer: This is a very rare type of cancer and circumcision is only recommended when less invasive treatments are unsuccessful.;/  //How is the procedure done?// The surgery is similar for newborns, children or adults and is usually performed on an outpatient basis, under sedation and/or local anesthesia. In the case of babies, circumcision is usually performed a few days after birth. Once anesthetized, the penis and the entire surrounding area are cleaned, a ring is applied to the penis and the foreskin is surgically separated from the glans, and dissolvable sutures are applied. After the procedure, analgesic ointment and topical antibiotics are usually applied. Circumcision is a relatively simple surgery, but it can carry some risks: Hemorrhage;/ Infection;/ Complications related to anesthesia/sedation;/ Dor;/ Irritation of the glans;/ Improper removal of the foreskin (it may be cut short or too much);/ Secondary phimosis (the remaining part of the foreskin may re-attach to the glans);/ Lymphatic edema;/ Glans necrosis;/ Stenosis of the meatus (narrowing of the urethra);/ Urethral fistula;/ Penile curvature;/  //Recovery and complications// Recovery usually takes seven to ten days. Initially, the penis may be painful, red or swollen and may even release a small amount of yellowish fluid. The penis can be washed during the recovery period. In the case of babies, it is recommended that the dressing be changed at each diaper change and that it not be too tight. Sometimes a plastic ring is placed instead of a bandage. In this case, it will eventually go away on its own, typically a week after surgery. For adults, it is recommended that they wear looser clothing to avoid irritation to the penis, and that they refrain from having sexual intercourse for the period advised by the surgeon. As with any surgery, post-operative complications after circumcision may occur. Your doctor should be contacted if: There is no normal urination 12 hours after the procedure.;/ There is bleeding.;/ Presence of foul-smelling fluid or pus in the dressing.;/ The plastic ring has not come off naturally after two weeks.;/ Portuguese Association of Urology, Acta Urológica, August 2022 Cleveland Clinic, August 2022 Mayo Clinic, August 2022 NHS, August 2022 WebMD, August 2022 Endoscopic vaporization - Rezum - is an innovative technique that uses thermal energy released by water vapor to treat Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.

Cirrose hepatica,"//What is it?// The liver performs multiple functions such as the synthesis of proteins (albumin and others), vitamins and coagulation factors that prevent bleeding, constitutes an energy reserve, contributes to the absorption of food, elimination of toxins from the digestive system, toxic substances (alcohol and medicines, for example) and defends the body against infections, among others. Liver cirrhosis leads to destruction of the liver. It is also called chronic liver disease and is characterized by the death of its cells, the appearance of scars (fibrosis) and changes in its structure. This organ has a very hard consistency and is full of nodules. This change compromises circulation and affects its function. In Portugal, around two thousand people die every year from liver cirrhosis and it is estimated that around 8% to 10% of Portuguese people have liver problems. It is the ninth cause of death, generally speaking, but it is the fourth leading cause of early death, that is, before the age of 70. Of these numbers, alcohol is the main culprit. //Symptoms// In the early stages, there are no symptoms associated with cirrhosis. The earliest symptoms are usually fatigue, loss of energy, appetite and weight, nausea, abdominal pain and small, spider-shaped lesions on the skin. Bleeding may occur more easily or bruising may form. In the decompensation phase, several signs occur such as: Jaundice (yellowing of the eyes and skin);/ Presence of ascites (water belly);/ Swelling of the legs;/ Digestive bleeding in the form of vomiting or bloody stools, most often caused by rupture of dilated veins in the esophagus (esophageal varices);/ Discolored stools;/ Mental changes that can lead to confusion, aggression and even coma (hepatic encephalopathy);/ Development of serious infections;/ Hormonal changes with erectile dysfunction and enlarged mammary glands in men;/ Liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatoma);/ The risk of developing liver cancer in cirrhosis of the liver is around 1% to 4% per year. This type of cancer has a high mortality rate if diagnosed at an advanced stage. For this reason, it is very important that all patients with cirrhosis undergo an abdominal ultrasound scan every six months, so that the tumour can be diagnosed while it is still small. In these cases, there are some effective treatments, such as liver transplantation, surgical removal, radiofrequency, alcoholisation, chemoembolisation or a drug (sorafenib) administered orally. //Causes// The most common cause in Portugal is alcoholic cirrhosis, followed by hepatitis C and hepatitis B. Other rarer diseases are liver diseases associated with obesity, primary biliary cirrhosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, hemochromatosis alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, bile duct anomalies and primary sclerosing cholangitis. //Diagnosis// Diagnosis is based on medical examination associated with laboratory tests, ultrasound and/or abdominal computed tomography. In some cases, a small fragment of the liver is removed using a needle to be viewed under a microscope. This test corresponds to liver biopsy. There is another more recent exam, similar to ultrasound, called liver elastography, which can be very useful in diagnosing it, eliminating, in some cases, a biopsy. //Treatment// Treatment will depend on the cause. For hepatitis C, there are medications that eliminate the virus in more than half of cases, preventing the worsening of cirrhosis and sometimes causing its regression (pegylated interferon and ribavirin). For hepatitis B, it is also possible to control the virus, in the vast majority of cases, using various types of antiviral therapies and immune system modulators. For autoimmune hepatitis, corticosteroids are used. In the decompensation phase, treatment will depend on the symptoms and complications present. It is often carried out in a hospital setting. In the most serious cases, in which the liver is unable to perform its functions, liver transplantation, if there are no contraindications, is an alternative. //Prevention// Prevention involves avoiding all associated factors. Therefore, it is important to: Do not consume excessive alcoholic drinks (more than two to three for men and one to two for women, per day);/ Do not consume alcoholic beverages before the age of 18;/ Get vaccinated against hepatitis B;/ Do not share syringes or any material used in injecting drugs;/ Use a condom in case of multiple partners or risky sexual relations;/ Avoid being overweight by always maintaining a balanced and healthy diet;/ Ramón Bataller et col., Liver fibrosis J Clin Invest.

Cirurgia assistida por robo em urologia,"//What is it?// For some patients, robot-assisted surgery may be an effective treatment option for certain types of cancer. CUF Oncology offers the combination of robotic technology with surgeons with experience and knowledge to help patients fight cancer.  Robot-assisted surgery allows the surgeon to have greater ability and precision to perform surgical gestures in an easier and more comfortable way. Thanks to this precision, robot-assisted surgery can improve results and reduce the amount of tissue damage caused. Because the procedure is less invasive, patients experience: Faster surgery recovery time;/ Less pain and discomfort post-operatively;/ Reduced risk of skin infection;/ Minimal scarring;/ //We can perform robotic surgeries to treat:// Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) is the most commonly performed robotic-assisted procedure in the world. To date, more than 600 robotic surgical systems have been installed in Europe, and an estimated 46,000 radical prostatectomy procedures were performed in 2017. PRAR is indicated in all patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer and with a life expectancy of more than 10 years. Prostatectomy is indicated in patients with localized or locally advanced prostate cancer. The aim of RARP is to excise the prostate in order to remove the entire tumor while preserving urinary continence. In patients with localized prostate cancer and an intact capsule, erectile function can be preserved. Preoperative multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging is very important to check the integrity of the prostate capsule and decide whether to perform RARP with preservation of the vascular-nervous bundles in order to preserve erectile function. According to the guidelines of the European Association of Urology, pelvic nodes should be removed in patients with intermediate and high-risk prostate cancer, that is, if it exceeds 5%, according to the MSKCC nomogram.  Robot-assisted surgery is increasingly recommended as the best way to surgically treat kidney tumors smaller than 4cm, in order to remove the tumor and preserve the rest of the kidney parenchyma. This surgical procedure is called partial nephrectomy. Partial nephrectomy may also be indicated in kidney cancers larger than 4cm as long as it is technically possible and the tumor is confined to the kidney.  Robot-assisted surgery is the only surgical approach that allows the creation of a new bladder with intestine in a minimally invasive way. This new bladder made with intestine allows urination to be maintained through the urethra and thus avoids the use of collection bags (urostomy bags) in the abdomen. For this reason, the treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancers (invasion of the muscle wall), which involves excision of the bladder to cure the cancer, is one of the best indications for robot-assisted surgery.  The main indications for robot-assisted surgery in urology are the treatment of kidney cancers with partial nephrectomy, bladder cancers with muscle wall invasion, and localized prostate cancers.  0% incontinence and preservation of sexual function are two advantages of aquablation. Learn about this technique for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Both the patient and the surgeon benefit from robotic surgery, whenever its use is appropriate.

Cirurgia da deformidade escoliose idiopatica juvenil,"//What is it?// Scoliosis surgery is indicated for patients with large curvatures in which the probability of progression is inexorable (according to scientifically established criteria), associated with visible deformities and clear progressions monitored clinically. There are several surgical techniques for treating scoliosis, but most of them involve placing metal rods that restore alignment and fix the spine, reducing the deformity. The details of the surgery are defined based on classifications that consider the characteristics of the spinal curvatures and subdivide scoliosis into different types, which require different correction strategies. A specific derotation maneuver is performed, in most cases, to straighten the spine. The instrumentation will keep the vertebrae in a straighter position while the arthrodesis bone healing takes place. A bone graft can be used to fuse or arthrodesize the vertebrae by being taken from the patient himself (autogenous), bone processed from a bone bank (allogeneic) or using bone substitutes of synthetic origin.  //Indications// In cases of very large curvatures, generally associated with neurological diseases, the deformity of the spine can compromise mobility and even the person's ability to breathe properly, making surgery mandatory. In some cases, the curvature causes an imbalance in the body, causing chronic pain and progressive deformity, also requiring surgery. //Risks/Complications// The risks of more serious complications in deformity surgeries have been greatly minimized today, both due to the evolution of techniques and due to care during surgery, such as intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring and care in the intensive care unit in the immediate postoperative period. In addition to the general complications inherent to any surgical procedure, we can highlight the following possible situations in the context of spinal surgery: Severe intraoperative neurological injury (<0.5%);/ Intraoperative vascular injury;/ Local or systemic infection;/ Failure of implanted material;/ Pseudoartrose;/ Pain at the bone graft harvesting site;/ Load more;/ In surgery, the O-arm allows you to view a 3D model of the spine.

Cirurgia da mao,"//What is it?// Hand surgery is one of the most delicate areas in surgical terms. Because it involves structures of a completely different nature, such as bones, tendons, arteries and nerves, it requires the integration of vast surgical and functional knowledge, and the Plastic Surgeon is often called upon to intervene in this area. The delicacy of the structures and their microscopic size often requires the use of microsurgical techniques. Hand pathology is divided into different subtopics, from traumatic pathology to degenerative pathology, including congenital malformations. It is an extremely common and disabling pathology. More common in women and people who have had manual work throughout their lives. It is characterized by pain and ""numbness"" of the hand, often at night. In more advanced stages it can progress to lack of hand strength, insensitivity and muscle atrophy. There are complementary diagnostic methods that help with the diagnosis, such as the electromyogram. Treatment is almost always surgical and significantly improves quality of life. Surgery is performed under local anesthesia and on an outpatient basis. This pathology can appear at any age. It manifests itself as a ""bouncing"" in a finger when trying to stretch it. There are children who can be born with a flexed finger that only stretches through the external force applied by an adult, we call this congenital trigger finger. It is relatively common and will not cause any consequences for the child if treated in a timely manner. It is a surgery that is performed under local anesthesia and does not require hospitalization. Finger and hand fractures are relatively common, especially in a sporting or even professional context, if your profession requires manual work. Parallel to the fingers there may be an injury to the metacarpals or carpus (bones in the ""body"" of the hand) that require appropriate diagnostic investigation and treatment. Surgery is not always the best option and sometimes conservative treatment is chosen. Tendons allow the hand to move. They are delicate structures that move in a sensitive balance. Given that they are superficially located, they are often struck in a traumatic hand injury. And the hand no longer has the proper function. The reconstruction of a traumatic tendon injury must be quick, effective and precise. After surgery, there is usually a period of immobilization with a splint and physiotherapy. Chronic tendon or even nerve injuries involve a study of each case and a longer recovery.  Arthrosis appears in older populations. The most common arthrosis of the upper limb is rhizarthrosis, arthrosis of the trapeziometacarpal joint, at the base of the thumb. Targeted treatment, whether surgical or medical, allows thumb function to recover functionally in terms of both range of motion and strength. Other systemic diseases such as Rheumatoid Arthritis, Gout, Psoriasis, among others, have disabling manifestations in the hand and are the target of treatment and care by our professionals. There is a diverse range of hand malformations in children. Among the most frequent are syndactyly, joined fingers or polydactyly, which means the existence of another finger. There are many other hand malformations with different frequencies and functional implications. The evaluation of these cases must be carried out by professionals accustomed to this pathology and the treatment carried out at the appropriate times. Dupuytren's disease is a pathology of the palmar aponeurosis of the hand, which is a superficial structure of the palm. This aponeurosis in some people can thicken and retract. The disease manifests itself in most cases as a progressive flexion (contracture) of the affected finger or fingers and the consequent limitation of extension. Sometimes painful nodules may form. Surgery is the best solution for more advanced cases, and there may be simpler solutions for milder cases. The surgery can be performed on an outpatient basis, although post-operative care is required, such as the use of a night splint.

Cirurgia da tiroide,"//What is it?// Thyroid surgery can be performed for benign or malignant diseases. Benign diseases include hyperthyroidism (increased thyroid function), goiter (enlarged thyroid gland), and nodular goiter. In the case of a suspicious nodule, a hemithyroidectomy (removal of half the gland) should be performed to reach a diagnosis. Malignant diseases include well-differentiated carcinomas and medullary carcinoma of the thyroid.  Before performing any thyroid surgery, thyroid function blood tests (T3, T4, TSH) must be carried out. Your otolaryngologist must perform a laryngoscopy to evaluate the function of the vocal cords, as the recurrent nerves, which innervate the vocal cords, are located next to the gland.  The ENT specialist will order an ultrasound of the gland. Certain aspects are suspicious: the presence of microcalcifications, hypoechoic solid nodules, hypervascularity, and the presence of irregular borders.  In the case of a suspicious nodule, aspiration cytology (a puncture to collect cells) should be performed.  In certain cases, a CT scan should be requested to assess the extent of the disease below the sternum, and whether or not there is compression of the trachea.  //What to do if you have a thyroid nodule?// Most nodules are benign, but 5% to 10% are malignant. Any nodule measuring more than 1.5 cm must be investigated, even if it presents benign characteristics on ultrasound. Any suspicious nodule on ultrasound should be biopsied.  Ultrasound-guided aspiration cytology allows for more reliable results.  A benign nodule should be monitored with ultrasound scans, and if it increases by more than 20% of its size, or if suspicious characteristics appear, it should be minced again or excised.  When the aspiration cytology result reveals indeterminate cells (suspicious, follicular, or Hurtle cells), the risk of malignancy increases to 10 to 20%. In these patients, a lobectomy (excision of a lobe of the thyroid) is indicated for diagnosis. If the analysis reveals malignancy, it will be necessary to remove the rest of the thyroid.  In cases where the nodule is larger than 4 cm, or where there is a family history of thyroid carcinoma, a total thyroidectomy should be performed immediately.  Malignant thyroid tumors are normally treated with total thyroidectomy, with some peculiarities depending on size and appearance. For example, papillary thyroid carcinoma, which represents 80% of malignant thyroid tumors, is often multifocal, hence the indication for total thyroidectomy.  The presence of lymph node metastases requires emptying of the lymph nodes in the neck.  If you have thyroid pathology, consult your attending physician or a specialist in thyroid and endocrine diseases, so that they can advise, monitor and operate if necessary.  Load more;/ Did you know that one in ten Portuguese people may have thyroid disease? Inês Sapinho, endocrinologist, and Maria Olímpia Cid, general surgeon, talk about treatments.

Cirurgia nervosa,"//Areas of intervention// Fortunately, brachial plexus injuries are becoming increasingly rare. In general, we are talking about obstetric brachial plexus injuries, which are those resulting from trauma during childbirth, and adult brachial plexus injuries, which are mostly related to acute trauma. Surgical treatment, in short, is divided between nerve surgery and tendon surgery. The work of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation is essential for the success of surgeries.  Peripheral nerve pathology is extremely extensive and varied. These are very delicate structures, which makes surgery more difficult. Surgical options are multiple and innovative. It is an area in constant evolution and limits are reestablished daily. The most frequent pathologies are compression syndromes along the nerve path, acute injuries and tumors.  Facial paralysis is characterized by the lack of mobility of the facial muscles. Normally it only occurs on one side of the face, which contributes to a marked asymmetry. Since the face is so important in social interaction, the importance of reconstruction in cases of facial paralysis is understood. There are multiple causes, including strokes, tumors, infections, trauma, among others. Reconstruction addresses both functional and aesthetic problems. The aim of surgery is to create a face that is as symmetrical, functional and natural as possible. Febrile seizures scare parents, who don't know what they are and how they should act.

Cirurgia para diabetes,"//Type 2 diabetes mellitus// Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DMT2) is the most common form of diabetes, accounting for 95% of all cases. Obesity is the most important cause of T2DM and the alarming growth in the prevalence of diabetes is closely linked to the high prevalence of obesity worldwide. T2DM causes multiple diseases and health problems, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, blindness (retinopathy), kidney failure, neuropathy, amputations, sexual dysfunction, depression, cognitive impairment and increased mortality from certain types of cancer. The risk of premature death from T2DM is increased by about 80% and life expectancy is reduced by 12 to 14 years. Current therapy for T2DM includes lifestyle changes (weight loss, appropriate diet and exercise) and antidiabetic medications. Regular medical monitoring and strict adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen can help maintain acceptable blood sugar levels, although currently available medications and lifestyle changes never lead to diabetes remission. In fact, DMT2 tends to worsen over time, often requiring the combination of new medications or an increase in the respective dose, to keep blood sugar levels under control. For this reason, T2DM was considered a chronic and progressive disease.  Some relevant numbers: Every 10 seconds a person dies worldwide from complications related to T2DM.;/ Diabetes is one of the top 10 causes of death in the Western world.;/ Diabetes consumes about 10% of healthcare spending.;/ Diabetic patients spend about 2.3 times more on health care than non-diabetics.;/ If current trends continue, T2DM or pre-diabetes is expected to affect half of the population of the Western world.;/ The prevalence of diabetes in Portugal is 13%. If diabetes and pre-diabetes (intermediate hyperglycemia) are considered, the prevalence in Portugal is 40%.;/ The incidence of diabetes in Portugal is 600 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants per year.;/ 90% of DMT2 cases are attributable to excess fat in the body.;/ Bariatric and metabolic surgery is the most effective form of treatment for T2DM in patients who concomitantly have some degree of obesity and results in remission or improvement of the disease in almost all cases.;/ //Metabolic Surgery// Metabolic surgery improves T2DM in 90% of patients by lowering blood sugar levels, reducing the dose and type of medications needed, and improving problems associated with diabetes. Metabolic surgery induces remission of T2DM in 30-80% of patients (varies with operation and patient), normalizing blood sugar levels and eliminating the need for antidiabetic medications. In most cases, the effects are maintained in the medium and long term (≥ 5 years). Metabolic surgery consists of a set of operations that are performed on the gastrointestinal tract with the aim of treating type 2 diabetes mellitus (DMT2) and obesity. After the advent of bariatric surgery in the 1950s, it was observed that operations initially designed to treat obesity induced remission of T2DM in a large percentage of cases – more than would be expected for the resolution of obesity. In fact, in some cases, these operations were more effective in inducing remission of T2DM than treating obesity itself. Since 2000, several experiments have confirmed the direct effects of those operations on insulin and glucose metabolism and, since then, surgery has also been used to treat T2DM. Since 2016, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines have considered metabolic surgery as one of the therapeutic alternatives to consider in the treatment of T2DM. //Candidates// According to the 2nd Diabetes Surgery Summit, an international consensus conference that took place in 2016 and brought together a multidisciplinary group of 48 international experts (60% of whom are endocrinologists/diabetologists), surgery should be recommended or considered to treat diabetes mellitus type 2 (DMT2) in the following cases: Patients with T2DM and grade II or III obesity (BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2).;/ Patients with difficult to control T2DM and grade I obesity (BMI 30 – 34.9 kg/m2).;/ In patients of Asian ethnicity, lower those BMI values ​​by 2.5 kg/m2.;/ //Interventions// The operations that are performed to treat diabetes are as follows: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass;/ Mini-gastric bypass;/ Switch duodenal;/ Scopinaro Operation;/ Sleeveless gastrectomy with ileal interposition GS+II;/ //Risks// Every surgery has an associated risk and metabolic surgery is no exception. In general and summarized terms, the risks inherent to metabolic surgery are: The need to convert an operation that began with minimally invasive surgery (laparoscopic or robotic) into conventional open surgery. This is a very rare occurrence in specialized centers, but it can be frequent in centers with less experience, especially in revision surgery.;/ Therapeutic failure: occurs when there is no significant improvement in diabetes after surgery. Therapeutic failure can occur in up to 10-20% of cases, depending on the type of procedure performed and, above all, the patient's behavior.;/ Hemorrhage;/ Dehiscence (rupture) of sutures in the stomach or of sutures that connect the stomach and intestine. This is a rare or very rare type of complication in specialized centers, but it is very serious and difficult to treat when it occurs.;/ Intestinal obstruction due to adhesions or internal hernias.;/ Incisional hernia of one of the incisions in the abdominal wall.;/ Flatulence, foul-smelling stools and diarrhea. They are very rare in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy with ileal interposition. They are more frequent in duodenal switch and, above all, in the Scopinaro operation.;/ Nutritional deficiencies. They are very rare in sleeve gastrectomy with ileal interposition. They can occur during Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, but they are easy to treat; As a general rule, protein deficiencies do not arise. They are more frequent in duodenal switch and, above all, in the Scopinaro operation, and protein deficiencies may arise that are difficult to treat.;/ Mortality: the overall risk of death (considering all operations) as a result of a complication of metabolic surgery is around 1‰: that is, one in every 1000 patients operated on. This risk is clearly lower than what is observed in other operations, some apparently simpler, such as removing the gallbladder or placing a hip prosthesis. If we consider only the most frequently performed operation, the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, this risk is reduced by less than half.;/  For the most frequently performed operation, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, the overall frequency of complications is 2-5%; if we consider only major (severe) complications the frequency is 0.5-1%; In the case of robotic surgery, the frequency of major complications is less than 0.5%. This incidence of complications is what has been published in the best scientific literature and corresponds to the experience of the Center for Surgical Treatment of Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes. Carlos Vaz, General Surgeon at CUF Tejo Hospital Load more;/ Diabetics are at risk for COVID-19 infection, not because they have a greater chance of contracting it, but rather because of the severity of the complications. Diabetes in children is increasingly common and is a chronic disease that can have several complications. Keeping it under control is essential.

Cistite,"//What is it?// Cystitis or bladder infections have a high incidence in females. It is difficult to determine the real prevalence of urinary tract infections in Portugal, but it is estimated that between 50% and 60% of pre-menopausal women will have at least one episode in their lives and, of these, 90% will correspond to cystitis. The peak incidence of uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections in women occurs between 18 and 39 years of age, a period that coincides with the age of maximum sexual activity in women. When it is acute, it occurs in women without underlying diseases and without functional or structural anomalies . //Symptoms// The main symptom of this group of diseases is bladder/suprapubic pain (""lower abdomen""), which typically increases as the bladder fills and eases as it empties. This pain leads to increased urinary frequency as patients prevent their bladder from overfilling so that they do not experience pain. The bacteria that give rise to cystitis in the first stage colonize the vestibule of the vulva and the periurethral region. From these locations, a small number of these microorganisms can ascend to the bladder and, more rarely, to the kidney. Under normal circumstances, they are eliminated by the flow and antibacterial properties of urine. If they are not eliminated, colonization or infection will begin, depending on the balance between the virulence of the bacteria, local defensive mechanisms and the presence or absence of anatomical or functional changes in the urinary tract. If no inflammatory lesions occur in the bladder mucosa, then it is an asymptomatic colonization. When the microorganism manages to cause tissue damage that results in the appearance of symptoms, cystitis occurs. The most suggestive symptoms of cystitis are: Painful urination (dysuria);/ Sensation of urgency and having to urinate more often in small quantities (pollakiuria);/ Hematuria (presence of blood in the urine) may occur;/ Discomfort in the pelvic region;/ Sensation of pressure in the lower abdominal region;/ Mild fever;/ Urine tends to be darker, cloudy and have a strong odor;/ In children, cystitis can result in daytime episodes of enuresis (involuntary urination). //Causes// Uncomplicated cystitis is caused by a small number of bacterial species, and more than 95% are caused by Gram-negative aerobic microorganisms originating from the colon, given the proximity between the anal region and the urogenital area. Among these bacteria, Escherichia coli is the most common. A minority of episodes have an exogenous cause, that is, they are caused by environmental microorganisms that are introduced into the urinary tract during manipulation for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. As such, these cases occur mainly in hospital settings. Several factors increase the risk of infection in premenopausal women: Degree of sexual activity (the biggest risk factor is having had recent sexual intercourse);/ Use of spermicides;/ Delayed post-coital urination;/ History of recent urinary tract infection;/ Genetic factors;/ In addition to those mentioned, there are other reasons that contribute to the risk of cystitis: The use of diaphragms, especially when associated with spermicides;/ Pregnancy induces hormonal changes that also increase this risk.;/ The presence of bladder stones or an enlarged prostate, reduced immune system (diabetes, HIV/AIDS infection, immunosuppressive treatments) or prolonged use of a catheter;/ //Diagnosis// The clinical history and medical examination are very important elements of analysis. To diagnose urinary infection, the most frequently used test is the reactive strip and, if the result is negative, a laboratory study of the urine is used, evaluating its sediment and carrying out cultural tests that allow the microorganism to be identified. Ultrasound, cystoscopy, or imaging studies may be helpful in some circumstances. //Treatment// Treatment is varied. Different types of antibiotics can be used, with different doses, dosages and durations of treatment. With the combination of these treatments and adequate monitoring, it is possible to control the symptoms and greatly improve the quality of life of patients with this problem. //Prevention// The following measures can help prevent: Perform careful hygiene of the genitals after sexual intercourse;/ Use neutral, unscented soaps for intimate hygiene; cleanse from front to back;;/ Empty your bladder completely when urinating, not postponing urination;;/ Avoid tight underwear and pants, prefer cotton clothing;;/ Patients with catheters/catheters should ask the nursing team for help.;/  It is predictable that most women will have at least one episode of cystitis in their lifetime and many will have more than one. When cystitis occurs in men and children, it is important to always consult a doctor. Male cystitis is more likely to be caused by another underlying condition, such as an infection, blockage or enlargement of the prostate, or cancer. Men in same-sex relationships are more likely to develop cystitis. In most cases of male cystitis, early treatment resolves the problem effectively, but untreated bladder infections can lead to inflammation or damage to the kidneys or prostate.

How prevalent is it? And how does it impact quality of life? Paulo Azinhais, urologist at CUF, answers 5 questions about the disease. An ostomy is a surgery in which an alternative exit route for feces or urine is created. It can be temporary or permanent, depending on each case. It is common for those who suffer from urinary incontinence to feel reluctant to admit it, which means they will not receive the most appropriate treatment.

Citomegalovirus,"//What is it?// Cytomegalovirus is a common virus, part of the herpes virus family, that can infect anyone, regardless of age. Once infected, the virus remains dormant and can reactivate. In pregnant women or patients with a depressed immune system, this virus can cause complications. //Symptoms// When they first contract the virus, some individuals may experience flu-like symptoms, such as: Fever;/ Muscle pain;/ Tiredness;/ Manchas na pele;/ Discomfort;/ Sore throat;/ Enlarged lymph nodes;/  As a general rule, treatment is symptomatic - that is, the symptoms are treated. In some cases, cytomegalovirus can cause mononucleosis or hepatitis.  //You drink// Most babies with congenital cytomegalovirus appear healthy at the time of birth. Some of them develop symptoms only later - sometimes months or years after birth. Among these late symptoms, the most common are hearing loss or developmental delay. A small number of babies may still develop vision problems. In the case of babies with congenital cytomegalovirus, who present symptoms right at birth, some of the most common are: Premature birth;/ Low birth weight;/ Yellow skin and eyes (jaundice);/ Enlarged and malfunctioning liver or spleen;/ Purple spots and/or rash;/ Abnormally small head (microcephaly);/ Pneumonia;/ Seizures;/  //Immunocompromised patients// People with compromised immune systems may experience severe symptoms that affect multiple organs. //Diagnosis// The presence of cytomegalovirus can be detected through laboratory tests, for example, of blood or other body fluids. In the case of newborn babies, blood tests are not the best option; It is preferable to do a urine analysis. In pregnant women, there is the possibility of carrying out tests to check whether the woman is infected with this virus. In the case of pregnant women who already have antibodies against cytomegalovirus, the risk of reactivation of the infection - and subsequent transmission to the fetus - is very low. However, if a doctor detects a new cytomegalovirus infection during pregnancy, performing an amniocentesis (taking a sample of amniotic fluid) can determine whether or not the fetus has been infected with the virus. Pregnant women who experience a viral/flu-like condition should speak to their attending physician who, if necessary, may prescribe tests to diagnose cytomegalovirus. The doctor may do this even if the woman has no symptoms. If the attending physician suspects that the baby may have congenital cytomegalovirus, it is important to undergo testing within the first three weeks after birth. If your baby is confirmed to have cytomegalovirus, your healthcare provider may recommend additional tests to assess the status of your baby's organs, such as his liver, kidneys, vision, hearing, and brain. In the case of immunosuppressed patients, it is also important to perform tests to detect the presence of cytomegalovirus. For example, people who have HIV or who have had a transplant are monitored regularly. //Causes// Cytomegalovirus can go through several cycles/periods where it is ""dormant"" and then reactivates. In healthy people, this virus remains essentially inactive. During periods when cytomegalovirus is active in the body, we can transmit it to other people. Transmission occurs through bodily fluids – including blood, urine, saliva, breast milk, tears, semen and vaginal fluids. Casual contact does not transmit cytomegalovirus. Some ways the virus is transmitted include: Touching your eyes or the inside of your mouth/nose after you have come into contact with bodily fluids from an infected person.;/ Having sexual relations with an infected person.;/ Coming into contact with the breast milk of an infected woman.;/ Organ, bone marrow or stem cell transplants or blood transfusions.;/ The birth. An infected mother can pass the virus to her baby before or during birth. The risk of transmission is greater if a woman becomes infected for the first time during pregnancy.;/ //Treatment// As a general rule, healthy children and adults do not need treatment for the infection caused by cytomegalovirus. They simply need to take some precautions to help their body fight the infection, such as rest and symptomatic treatment. On the other hand, newborns and immunocompromised people who show symptoms may need treatment, depending on the severity of the infection. Antiviral drugs are the most common therapy. Although they do not eliminate the virus, they can reduce its reproduction and the risk of more serious problems. New medications and vaccines are being studied to treat and prevent cytomegalovirus infection. //Prevention// The best strategy for preventing cytomegalovirus is good hygiene. In this sense, some important measures include: Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for 15-20 seconds, especially after contact with younger children or their diapers, saliva or other oral fluids.;/ Avoid contact with a child's tears and saliva, especially if you are pregnant.;/ Do not share food or drink from the same glass as other people.;/ Be careful with disposable items, such as diapers or wipes, that may be contaminated with bodily fluids. Before touching your face, wash your hands thoroughly.;/ Clean toys, countertops, or other surfaces that may have come into contact with a child's urine or saliva.;/ Practice safe sex. Using a condom helps prevent the transmission of cytomegalovirus through semen and vaginal fluids.;/ Centers for Disease Controlo and and Prevention, março de 2021 Mayo Clinic, March 2021 National Health Service, March 2021 Load more;/ About us;/ Events;/ Clients and Companions;/ News;/ CUF Academic Center;/ Partnerships;/ Contacts;/ Frequently Asked Questions;/ Join us;/ Virtual Visit;/ English version;/ My CUF;/ Access Solutions and Health Plans;/ Facebook;/ Facebook Instagram;/ Instagram LinkedInCreated with Sketch.;/ LinkedIn Youtube;/ Youtube award4;/ award4 certification1;/ certification1 certification2;/ certification2 certification3;/ certification3 Complaints and compliments;/ Complaints and compliments Privacy and Cookies Policy;/ Terms and Conditions;/ Whistleblower Channel;/ © CUF 2024 All rights reserved Home;/ Health A-Z: Diseases, Symptoms and Treatments;/"
Clamidia genital,"//What is it?// Genital chlamydia is an infection caused by the bacteria Chlamydia Trachomatis. It is, along with infections caused by the bacteria Neisseria Gonorrhoeae, one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases and its incidence has increased. Considering that many of the cases are asymptomatic, it is likely that their occurrence is even greater than previously thought. In the United States of America, it is estimated that around 2.8 million new cases appear every year. In a study carried out in Portugal, there was a global prevalence of infection of around 3%, with a predominance of males (83.3%). //Symptoms// Some types of Chlamydia cause genitourinary infections and, if transmitted during pregnancy, can cause conjunctivitis or pneumonia in the newborn. Others cause a genital lesion known as lymphogranuloma venereum, which is more common in tropical countries. In men, genital infection is usually asymptomatic. Symptoms may include pain or a nonspecific burning sensation in the perineum or testicles, or urethral discharge. There may also be burning when urinating, and other symptoms such as epididymitis, prostatitis or proctitis. Reiter's syndrome, defined by the presence of arthritis, conjunctivitis and urethritis, may also occur. In women, it is also common for the infection to cause no symptoms. In around 20%, symptoms such as discharge, burning and more frequent urination appear. Urethritis or cervicitis may also occur. In some patients, pelvic inflammatory disease appears, which can be complicated by infertility, ectopic pregnancy or occlusion of the tubes. In lymphogranuloma venereum, the primary lesion appears at the site of contact with the microorganism. A few weeks later an inflamed and enlarged ganglion appears (adenopathy, usually unilateral). These can grow, forming a plaque with a tendency to ulcerate and with the possibility of scarring, causing swelling in the affected limb. //Causes// Genital chlamydia is sexually transmitted, making it the most common sexually transmitted disease in the United States. Sexually active people and, especially, those with several sexual partners have a higher risk of contracting this pathology. The infection can be associated with urological and genital complications, infertility, arthritis and a three to six times higher risk of HIV transmission. As such, its identification and treatment are very important. //Diagnosis// Suspicion of an infection is often based on clinical symptoms. Laboratory amplification methods (PCR, LRC) are the best diagnostic procedures. This process is used routinely in many laboratories. Until recently, bacterial culture was considered standard. This technique usually requires the collection of a sample of urethral discharge in men or cervical secretions in women. But there are other laboratory tests available. //Treatment// With the antibiotics doxycycline or azithromycin. Alternatively, ofloxacin or erythromycin can be administered for seven days. Lymphogranuloma venereum therapy requires longer treatment, for at least three weeks. It is important that the medication is extended to the sexual partners of the person with chlamydia, otherwise the infection will tend to recur and perpetuate itself. When there is an early diagnosis, the prognosis is favorable, as antibiotics are very effective and the complications mentioned are very rare. //Prevention// Prevention requires annual laboratory screening for all sexually active women over the age of 25 or with new sexual partners. Using a condom is an effective way to prevent this infection. U.S. National Library of Medicine, July 2010 HIV Medicine, 2006 Rita Guedes et al., Chlamydia Trachomatis and Neisseria Gonorrhoeae Infection in Patients of a Sexually Transmitted Diseases Clinic - Ten-Year Analysis, SPDV 70(1) 2012; 91-9 It is the genital area that we hear most about, but it can also affect the eyes and mouth.

Colera,"//What is it?// It is an infection of the small intestine caused by a bacteria (Vibrio Cholerae). This is capable of producing a toxin that stimulates it to secrete large quantities of a liquid rich in salts and minerals, causing very serious diarrhea. It is a form of acute infectious diarrhea that, if left untreated, can cause death within a few hours. According to the World Health Organization, it is estimated that three to five million cases of cholera occur each year, causing between one hundred thousand and two hundred thousand deaths. This disease is transmitted through ingestion of water, shellfish or other foods contaminated by the excrement of infected people. It usually appears in certain areas of Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America, with outbreaks occurring during the hot months. The incidence is higher among  children. The infection can be caused by other species of the Vibrio bacteria. In this scenario, diarrhea is usually much less severe than cholera. //Symptoms// In about 75% to 80% of cases, no symptoms occur, although the bacteria are present in feces for seven to 14 days after infection. Therefore, infected people without symptoms can be a source of contagion for other people. In other cases, there is acute and very intense watery diarrhea that can cause severe dehydration that, without treatment, can be fatal. Cholera symptoms begin, on average, one to three days after infection. Diarrhea is usually sudden, painless and watery and may be accompanied by vomiting. In the most serious cases, fluid losses can be one liter per hour, although as a rule the amount lost is much smaller. In others, the large decrease in water and salt causes marked dehydration, with intense thirst, muscle cramps, weakness and minimal urine production. The loss of fluid in the tissues causes very sunken eyes and very wrinkled skin on the extremities. If left untreated, the severe imbalances in blood volume and increased salt concentration can lead to kidney failure, shock and coma. Symptoms usually disappear within three to six days. Affected individuals usually clear the organism within two weeks, but some become permanent carriers. //Causes// It is an infection of the small intestine caused by Vibrio Cholera and other species of the same bacteria. As they are sensitive to hydrochloric acid in the stomach, people with a deficiency of this acid are more susceptible to the disease. Those who live in areas where cholera is endemic tend to gradually develop a natural immunity against the infection. //Diagnosis// The diagnosis is made through clinical history and medical examination, and is confirmed in the laboratory by isolating the bacteria in samples of fluid from the rectum or feces. //Treatment// Around 80% of cholera cases can be treated effectively using oral rehydration alone. In severely dehydrated patients who cannot drink, intravenous fluids are administered. The objective is to replace the amount of fluid lost through diarrhea and vomiting. As soon as this condition disappears, solid food intake is permitted. Early treatment with tetracycline or another antibiotic kills the bacteria and usually stops diarrhea within 48 hours. If these measures are taken quickly, mortality is less than 1%. Otherwise, it can exceed 50%. //Prevention// Providing clean water and proper sanitation are essential to prevent cholera and other waterborne diseases. Oral vaccines are an additional control measure. The purification of supplies and the correct disposal of human excrement are essential to control this disease. Other precautions should include using boiled water and not eating raw vegetables or undercooked fish and seafood. It is equally important to wash your hands frequently, drink bottled water and give preference to peeled fruit.

Colesterol,"//What is it?// It is one of several substances produced by the body and is important for our health. Some of the cholesterol is produced by our body - the liver and other cells produce about 75% of the total - and the other part, about 25%, comes from our diet, from the foods of animal origin that we eat. Cholesterol is one of the best known risk factors for the occurrence of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. At high levels, it is responsible for around a third of all cardiovascular diseases in the world, being estimated to cause 18% of total cerebrovascular diseases, 56% of total ischemic heart diseases and around 4.4 million deaths. representing around 7.9% of the total. In relation to Portugal, around 68.5% of Portuguese people have cholesterol values ​​equal to or greater than 190 mg/dl. Approximately a quarter of Portuguese people have high-risk cholesterol (>240 mg/dl) and 45.1% are at risk moderate (190-239 mg/dl). //Types// Generally speaking, it is considered that there is a “good” cholesterol and a “bad” cholesterol. An imbalance between them increases the risk of coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction or stroke. //HDL: ""good"" cholesterol// HDL corresponds to “good” cholesterol, which prevents LDL (“bad cholesterol) from lodging in the artery walls, reducing the risk of myocardial infarction or stroke.;/ Ideal HDL levels should be greater than 40 mg/dL in men and 50 mg/dL in women.;/ HDL levels can be increased through physical exercise and a balanced diet. Sometimes medications designed to increase your levels may be needed.;/ //LDL: “good” cholesterol// When blood levels are high, there is a greater risk of narrowing of the arteries, causing heart or brain disease. These plaques are called atherosclerosis. If a clot forms in an artery already narrowed by these deposits, myocardial infarction or stroke may occur.;/ Although LDL is produced by the body, some people inherit a greater tendency to produce it in large quantities, making it very important to change your lifestyle or, if necessary, seek specialized medical help. Consuming fats and foods rich in cholesterol increases this risk.;/ Triglycerides are another form of fat produced by the body. Its levels may be elevated in cases of overweight, physical inactivity, tobacco or alcohol consumption and diets rich in carbohydrates. Generally speaking, those with high triglyceride levels also have high cholesterol and LDL levels and reduced HDL levels.;/ Average cholesterol values ​​are quite similar between men and women. There is an increase in total cholesterol with age up to the 45-54 age group, after which it appears to stabilize at a value of approximately 220 mg/dl. The percentage of cases with high-risk cholesterol in Portuguese people aged 55 and over is three times higher than in young adults under 35. //Associated diseases// As mentioned, high cholesterol is one of the main causes of coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction and stroke. This risk will be even greater in the presence of high blood pressure or diabetes. On the other hand, there are several factors that can increase the risk, such as an unhealthy diet, smoking and heredity. //Surveillance// Although cholesterol is associated with serious diseases, its presence alone does not cause any symptoms, which means that the only way to detect high cholesterol levels is by carrying out blood tests. These tests can measure the levels of LDL, HDL, total cholesterol and triglycerides. As a rule, cholesterol analysis should be performed in the following cases: Presence of coronary disease;/ Peripheral artery disease;/ AVC;/ Age over 40 years;/ Family history of cardiovascular disease;/ Overweight;/ High blood pressure or diabetes or other diseases that increase cholesterol levels;/ Your doctor will always be able to advise you on the ideal time to perform these tests and help you interpret your results. //Control// The starting point for cholesterol intervention involves counseling on dietary modification, exercise, smoking cessation, and changes in other lifestyle aspects that increase the risk of arterial disease. Food;/ In the typical Western diet, 35% of calories come from fat, providing about 400 to 500 mg of cholesterol per day. Patients with high cholesterol should be advised to eat a diet low in cholesterol and saturated fat. It is also important to limit salt intake. Diets low in fat and high in soluble fiber (found in barley, oats, and fruits and vegetables rich in pectin) can help reduce fat. The consumption of margarines rich in vegetable stanol also contributes to reducing “bad” cholesterol (LDL) by around 5 to 10%. Medication;/ The use of medications can be important in controlling cholesterol, helping to prevent the development of arterial disease and stabilize early artery damage. On the other hand, obstructive lesions may undergo clinical reversal after aggressive treatment with these medications. This reversal takes 6 months to 2 years, which means that treatment with these medications will only be effective if continued for long periods of time. Family members of people with high cholesterol should also be monitored, undergoing regular tests, taking care of their diet and doing physical exercise, as they may have a similar condition.

Colica biliar,"//What is it?// Biliary colic is the clinical manifestation of the presence of stones in the gallbladder. Also known as lithiasis, it is a common condition. In Europe, around 10% of people have this disease, and it is the most common of the bile ducts. In general, it is two to three times more prevalent in women than in men. Age is important and in females it varies from 5% to 20% up to the age of 50 and from 25% to 30% after this age limit. //Symptoms// Most people, around 80%, do not complain. Contrary to popular belief, “poor digestion”, fat, heartburn, increased intestinal gas, nausea, vomiting or headaches cannot be attributed to gallstone disease. The main symptom is pain or cramping in the “stomach” region or under the ribs on the right, which can extend to the left side, back, chest or rest of the abdomen. This pain starts suddenly, sometimes during the night, and lasts for minutes or hours. Sometimes they are accompanied by nausea, vomiting, sweating and paleness. The discomfort is due to blockage of the cystic duct or bile duct by a stone. Complications may occur due to inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis), bile ducts (cholangitis) or pancreas (pancreatitis). In these cases, the pain may be more severe and last longer. Fever and jaundice (“yellow eyes”) may also occur and, in general, hospital admission is required. Gallstone disease is associated with an increased risk of gallbladder cancer. However, this type of carcinoma is rare. //Causes// Most stones form in the gallbladder, which is a small sac located next to the liver, under the ribs on the right. The gallbladder stores bile, which is produced in the liver; After meals, the gallbladder contracts and bile passes into the duodenum through the bile ducts. Bile contains bilirubin and cholesterol. These substances can “crystallize” because the bile in the gallbladder becomes more concentrated. One can only verify the presence of multiple crystals which, when they come together, form stones. Most are cholesterol and are formed when the bile is very concentrated in this element or the gallbladder does not empty properly. Stones are thought to form when there is an imbalance in the various components of bile, especially when it contains too much cholesterol or bile pigments. Another cause is the malfunctioning of the gallbladder, with slow or incomplete emptying during digestion. Stones of other types, such as bilirubin, may also occur in certain diseases and situations. The main causes of risk are obesity, a diet with excess animal fats and few vegetables and fruit, lack of physical exercise, rapid weight loss, which occurs in some obesity treatments, long periods of fasting, use of hormones and contraceptives. Other factors are age (over 60 years), greater prevalence in females, lithiasis in family members, pregnancy, diabetes, hemolytic anemia and liver cirrhosis. //Diagnosis// The best test is an abdominal ultrasound. However, an abdominal CT scan can also be performed. Many cases are diagnosed during tests requested for other reasons. //Treatment// The presence of gallstones does not necessarily imply treatment if there are no symptoms. In this situation, complications may only very rarely arise. Treatment is indicated in the presence of symptoms, such as biliary colic, or other complications. Treatment is also recommended, even in the absence of symptoms, in diabetic patients or those taking immunosuppressants, in the presence of a calcified gallbladder, in the case of patients who live in or frequently travel to countries with poor health care, when there is rapid weight loss or when the stones are located in the bile ducts. Surgery to remove the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) is the ideal treatment for gallstones. It can be performed using the “classic” approach (through a cut in the abdominal wall) or the “laparoscopic” approach, in which the instruments enter the abdomen through small holes. This is recommended because it is less painful and the recovery is easier. The absence of the gallbladder does not cause any major problems. Very rarely are other therapies used to dissolve stones with medication or “shock waves”. When these are in the bile ducts, treatment should be attempted by endoscopic examination. //Prevention// It involves preventing the formation of stones, which can be achieved by correcting some risk factors, such as obesity, a diet with excess animal fats and few vegetables and fruit, lack of physical exercise, rapid weight loss which occur in some obesity treatments, long periods of fasting, use of hormones and contraceptives.

Colicas nas criancas,"//What is it?// Colic is the term used to describe a baby's excessive crying in the first few months of life. Colic is a common problem, occurring in around 40% of babies, and its cause is not yet well established. Excessive baby crying is a cause of anxiety and family discomfort, with effects on the baby and caregivers. A baby with colic usually cries more than 3 hours a day on more than 3 days a week. This condition begins between the 3rd and 6th week of life and resolves spontaneously around 4 months. It is difficult to distinguish colic crying from the rest of the baby's normal crying. But there are some distinctive features: Crying episodes that last about 3 hours/day;/ They have a sudden onset, without a precipitating factor, usually at night.;/ The crying episodes are more intense, with higher-pitched crying, as if they were cries of pain.;/ Crying is associated with physical signs: red face, distended and tense abdomen, extension and flexion movements of the lower limbs, hyperextension of the trunk.;/ Crying that is difficult to console;/ Before attributing crying to colic, it will be necessary to check other possible causes: hunger, pain, cold or heat, tiredness or overstimulation. //What to do?// It is essential that the baby is in a calm environment, with gentle visual and auditory stimulation. If parents feel exhausted, they should ask for help (grandparents, uncles, friends) and take a break. Sometimes you just need a few minutes of silence to regain energy and face your baby's crying more calmly. Anxious parents can pass this anxiety on to their baby, making it more difficult to control periods of crying. There are some techniques that can be used to try to calm the baby: Pacifier;/ Rock the baby calmly in your lap with rhythmic movements of low amplitude, in a calm environment, reducing visual stimulation. Despite what people say, babies at this age are not manipulative, and holding them to comfort them won't spoil them too much!;/ Rocking the baby in the carrier;/ Change the environment, always keeping in mind that the visual and sound stimulus should be gentle.;/ Warm water bath;/ Massage the abdomen, with gentle movements;/ The feeding technique can also reduce the occurrence of colic. In bottle-fed babies, you should try to feed them in a more upright position, taking a few breaks to burp; prefer a bottle with an air escape system (anti-colic) to reduce the amount of air swallowed. In babies who are exclusively breastfed, not prolonging feedings excessively and pausing in between to belch can also reduce the amount of air swallowed. There are several medications and preparations available to relieve colic, but they should only be administered with medical advice. //Warning signs// There are some signs that may raise doubts as to whether the cause of the crying is due to colic. In this case, if any of these symptoms appear, you should seek medical observation: If the baby is crying, without periods of comfort, for more than 2 hours at a time;/ Refusal to breastfeed;/ Fever (Rectal Temperature > 38ºC);/ If the crying occurred after a fall or trauma;/ From hunger to sleep, there are several situations that can cause tears in your child. Over time, parents learn to understand why their baby cries. Baby colic can be scary for parents, but it is perfectly natural and temporary.

Colite ulcerosa,"//What is it?// It is a chronic inflammatory disease of the intestine that affects the layer that internally lines the large intestine or colon. This mucosa becomes inflamed and has small wounds on the surface that can bleed, in addition to producing an excessive amount of secretion that eventually contains pus and blood. It can affect a variable extent of the large intestine, from just a few centimeters of the rectum to the entire colon. This disease has a major impact on patients' lives, causing recurrent symptoms of bloody diarrhea, rectal urgency and a painful sensation caused by contracture of the anal sphincter. The usual age at which symptoms appear has two peaks: between 15 and 40 years and between 50 and 80 years. However, it can appear at any age and in any gender. It is more common when there is a first-degree relative with an inflammatory bowel disease. In 20% of cases it begins during childhood or adolescence. It is estimated that, in Portugal, it affects around 20 thousand people. The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease in Europe is around 16 new patients per 100,000 inhabitants per year. The growth of this disease has occurred in the most industrialized countries due to eating habits, environmental factors and more sedentary lifestyles. //Symptoms// Symptoms vary depending on the severity and amount of colon affected. The most common signs are bloody diarrhea, colicky abdominal pain and the urgent desire to have a bowel movement. In more serious cases, fatigue, weight loss and fever may also occur. This disease has a variable course, with periods in which it is active and others in which it is not associated with any symptoms. Although most crises respond well to treatment, serious or fatal situations can occur. In many patients, extraintestinal manifestations appear, such as oral ulcerations, changes in peripheral joints and cutaneous manifestations. The main complications of ulcerative colitis are severe bleeding; intestinal perforation; sudden dilation of the colon; osteoporosis; renal lithiasis (stones); skin and joint diseases; and increased risk of colon cancer, which is higher in individuals with involvement of the entire colon and with more than 10 years of disease progression. It is therefore essential to carry out regular surveillance through colonoscopy, an examination using a colonoscope, which is a flexible instrument that allows the entire interior of the large intestine to be examined and which can collect small fragments of the mucosa for microscopic study. //Causes// Its cause is unknown. It is thought that dysregulation of the intestinal mucosa's immune system may occur, leading to an exaggerated immune response against normal intestinal microflora, causing the typical lesions of ulcerative colitis. This anomalous response can be triggered by a certain reason, such as a virus or bacteria, and can cause inflammation of the intestine, even when the causative agent is no longer present. On the other hand, there may be hereditary causes and the age factor, as the disease generally develops before the age of 30. It was previously thought that eating habits, stress and emotional issues could be responsible for the onset of ulcerative colitis. However, this hypothesis has not been confirmed. However, stress can worsen symptoms. //Diagnosis// In addition to the clinical history and medical examination, blood and stool tests may be requested. Confirming the diagnosis requires a colonoscopy. //Treatment// There is no cure for ulcerative colitis. Available treatments improve complaints and keep patients symptom-free for long periods of time. Therapy will depend on the severity and extent of the disease, the response to interventions already carried out and the number and severity of previous attacks. In individuals with severe, very frequent acute attacks or with colon lesions with a high risk of malignancy, hospitalization and surgical intervention may be necessary. Most patients can follow a normal diet, without dietary restrictions, with the exception of periods when diarrhea occurs, in which a low-fiber, lactose-free diet must be followed. The most commonly used medications are aminosalicylates, which help control inflammation, corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and newer medications such as infliximab, which are useful when patients do not respond to conventional treatment. Therapies can also be used to relieve pain, diarrhea or treat possible infections. //Prevention// As there is no known cause for ulcerative colitis, prevention is not possible. It is important to highlight that anti-inflammatories can worsen symptoms. Given the association between ulcerative colitis and colon cancer, regular colonoscopy screening is strongly recommended, at intervals of one to two years, always validated by the doctor.

Conflito femoro acetabular,"//What is it?// Femoro-acetabular conflict was recently identified and corresponds to a condition in which there is a mechanical conflict between the femur and the acetabulum (cavity of the iliac bone where the head of the femur fits). In this condition, there is an anomaly in the shape of the bones in the hip region, which does not allow for proper fitting, causing excessive friction between them, which leads to wear. In femoro-acetabular impingement, bone spurs develop in the head of the femur and/or acetabulum that force the bones to bump against each other instead of sliding smoothly. This friction wears down the articular cartilage, causing osteoarthritis. It is the most common hip disease in young adults and mainly affects athletes, especially dancers, martial arts or yoga practitioners, roller hockey and football players. In fact, in these sporting activities, there are repeated large-amplitude hip movements, forcing anomalous contact between the different structures of the hip joint. //Symptoms// The number of people affected by femoroacetabular impingement is unknown, although it is estimated that this disease affects around 25% of people. Some people can live long, active lives with this problem and never complain. When symptoms appear, cartilage damage has already occurred and the disease is likely to progress. Most patients are young and active and the conflict manifests itself as pain in the groin area or, sometimes, on the outer side of the hip. Stiffness also occurs and some patients limp. The onset of complaints may be gradual or related to trauma, which may even be insignificant. These tend to be of the mechanical type, associated with certain movements or positions (such as getting out of the car, crossing your leg, getting up from a chair or sitting for a long time. The pain becomes worse during sports activities and prolonged sitting. In some cases, pain can be felt in the knee, which can create difficulties in diagnosis. In women with deep or prominent hips, groin pain may occur during sexual activity. There are other diseases that cause symptoms similar to those of femoro-acetabular conflict, such as changes in the lumbar or sacroiliac spine, hip synovitis, avascular necrosis of the femoral head, hip dysplasia, some tendinitis and weaknesses in the abdominal wall (with or without hernia). There are some cases in which there is femoroacetabular impingement without any symptoms, so correct diagnosis is essential for therapeutic success. Sometimes, it is during a sporting activity in which maximum hip flexion occurs that this previously latent disease becomes evident. In femoro-acetabular conflict, it is essential to evaluate joint range of motion and determine which movements are painful, as well as evaluating whether the tests reproduce the complaints that motivated the patient to come to the consultation. //Causes// As mentioned, this conflict occurs because the bones in the hip region did not form properly during the growth phase. When this occurs, there is little or nothing that can be done to prevent femoroacetabular conflict. Since people with intense physical activity exercise their hips more vigorously, in these cases painful symptoms may occur earlier than in less active people. In addition to sporting activities, there are other risk factors to consider, such as trauma, the use of corticosteroids or previous surgeries. However, it is important to remember that exercise is not the cause of femoroacetabular impingement. //Diagnosis// On physical examination, there is limited hip mobility, particularly internal rotation. Inguinal pain may be aroused or aggravated by internal rotation, flexion, and adduction of the femur. In fact, there are specific tests and maneuvers that the doctor will perform to make a correct diagnosis. Radiographic examinations, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are relevant for the correct characterization of this clinical condition. //Treatment// When symptoms first appear, it is important to identify the activities that caused the pain. Sometimes, stopping these activities, letting the legs rest and using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be enough to control the situation. If symptoms persist, it is important to seek medical help. The longer the conflict lasts, the greater the damage caused to the hip region. If the patient has conflict factors but has no complaints, nothing should be done. If there are complaints related to the sporting activity that the patient wishes to continue, the solution will be surgical. Surgery involves reconstructing the anatomy, correcting the conflict factors and associated injuries. This correction must be performed without delay in individuals with complaints before irreversible damage to the cartilage sets in. Physiotherapy, in an attempt to gain mobility, worsens the problem and is therefore contraindicated. However, some exercises can increase the range of movement of the hip and strengthen the muscles of this joint, thus relieving stress on the damaged cartilage. There are three techniques for surgical correction of the conflict: Arthroscopy is the least invasive technique, but it requires a lot of experience.;/ Surgical dislocation, the original impingement correction technique, is the most aggressive, but it is the only one capable of adequately correcting some types of impingement.;/ The anterior mini-invasive technique, associated with image intensifier and arthroscopy, is minimally invasive, allows rehabilitation very similar to arthroscopy and corrects most conflicts.;/ //Prevention// Although it is estimated that femoroacetabular impingement may occur in 25% of the population, not all cases will progress to cartilage damage, with pain and osteoarthritis. Everything will depend on the overload exerted on the different structures in the hip region. In the case of practicing sports already mentioned as potentially associated with the development of this disease, due to the flexion and twisting movements they require, it is important to seek medical advice as soon as possible. As each person has a different natural rotation, it is important to practice the sport using this natural rotation. For example, in the case of running, some people run with their feet pointing forward and others place their feet slightly inward. It is important that you maintain the most natural posture throughout the run. It is important that you maintain the most natural posture throughout the run.

Conjuntivite,"//What is it?// There is a very thin and transparent membrane in the eyes, which covers the surface of the cornea and the inner part of the eyelids, protecting them from foreign substances. Sometimes this membrane - called the conjunctiva - becomes inflamed due to an allergic reaction or the action of a virus or bacteria. When this happens, the blood vessels in the eyes widen, turn red, and symptoms such as itching, watering and discharge appear. Conjunctivitis can affect both eyes simultaneously and, although it is not particularly serious nor does it usually leave sequelae, it can become quite uncomfortable and make normal activities difficult. //Symptoms// Different types of conjunctivitis can have different symptoms. Some only occur seasonally and others are felt all year round. However, there are symptoms that are common to most cases: Red and watery eyes;/ Swollen eyelids;/ Itching or burning;/ Light intolerance;/ Feeling of sand in the eyes;/ Secretions;/ //Causes// There are three main forms of conjunctivitis, distinguished according to their origin: Allergic Conjunctivitis is the most common of the three, and is estimated to currently affect a third of the Brazilian population. It occurs after exposure to allergens such as pollens (and is therefore particularly common in spring), animal dander or dust mites. It usually affects both eyes, but is not contagious. Infectious Conjunctivitis is transmitted by viruses, fungi or bacteria that come into contact with the eyes and can be contagious, being transmitted through direct contact with affected people, sharing face towels and other eye hygiene objects or even water from the pool. Toxic Conjunctivitis is caused by exposure to cigarette smoke, hair dye, cleaning products and other potentially toxic agents, as well as taking certain medications. Bacterial conjunctivitis usually causes thicker, yellowish and more abundant secretions than viral conjunctivitis (whiter) or allergic conjunctivitis (lighter).  //When should I suspect allergic conjunctivitis?// Allergic conjunctivitis is a common ocular pathology with potential impact on the patient's quality of life. Generally associated with complaints of allergic rhinitis, it can also appear in isolation. Typical symptoms of the disease are itchy eyes, red eyes, tearing, swelling and local pain or discomfort (foreign body sensation). These signs can range from mild and seasonal to very intense and persist throughout the year. If the eyes tend to be red, painful, itchy or watery and if contact with dust, pets (cat, dog), pollen or other allergens causes itching and watering, this means that we have allergic conjunctivitis. //Diagnosis// Diagnosis is based on clinical observation and symptoms, and may require examination with a slit lamp in the ophthalmology office. If bacterial conjunctivitis is suspected, eye secretion can be collected with a cotton swab and sent for analysis in the laboratory. //Treatment// Treatment largely depends on the cause, but lubricating eye drops (such as artificial tears), antibiotic ointments and antihistamines may be prescribed to relieve symptoms. In general, you should: Wash your eyelids regularly to keep them free of secretions.;/ Wash your hands before and after applying eye drops or ointments;/ Apply cold compresses to reduce swelling;/ Do not wear contact lenses;/ Change pillowcases and face towels daily;/ Avoid direct exposure to light or sunlight;/ Decrease exposure to allergens or other potentially irritating agents (such as tobacco smoke);/ Avoid swimming in lakes or pools;/ //Prevention// Although it is not easy to prevent conjunctivitis, some basic hygiene practices can reduce the risk of contracting it: Wash your hands and face frequently;/ Avoid rubbing or scratching your eyes;/ Do not share face towels;/ Do not share eye cosmetics or use other people's eye cosmetics.;/ Cleveland Clinic Load more;/ Prolonged exposure to television, cell phone and computer screens can have negative effects on your eyes.

Coxartrose,"//What is it?// Coxarthrosis results from inflammation or injury to the coxofemoral joint with changes in the cartilage, pain, swelling and deformation of the joint. It is defined by an alteration of the femoral lame joint (pelvis and femur), with repercussions on mobility and the presence of symptoms and pain. In Coxarthrosis there is wear of the articular cartilage of the acetabulum and femoral head. //Symptoms// The earliest symptom of coxarthrosis is mechanical pain, with effort or exercise involving weight on the lower limbs. The pain is typically in the groin area but can also be located in the thigh, buttock, lateral region of the hip or even the knee. As the disease progresses, there may be a decrease in joint range of motion (joint stiffness), manifested by difficulty in squatting, putting on shoes or socks and even changes in gait. //Causes// The causes of osteoarthritis are not known. However, factors that can contribute to coxarthrosis include joint injury, advanced age, being overweight, and activities that involve significant wear and tear on the joints. //Diagnosis// X-rays are usually the first-line test. In them it is possible to identify the reduction of the joint interline, osteophytes, thickening of the subchondral bone and bone cysts. In the early stages of the disease, these changes may not be visible and MRI may be necessary to identify changes in the acetabular labrum, changes in the thickness and quality of the articular cartilage and the eventual occurrence of small bone cysts. //Treatment// In the initial stages, treatment is non-surgical and involves avoiding strain and exercises that put weight on the lower limbs, as well as controlling weight. It is advisable to maintain joint movement and muscle strengthening. Pain must be controlled with analgesic and anti-inflammatory medication. The main goal of treatment is to increase mobility, including improving hip joint function, control pain, and improve quality of life. Treatment plans may involve: Joint rest and/or guided exercise to promote recovery of mobility;/ Lose weight;/ Use of support (crusader, cane) to relieve weight on the affected hip;/ Use of non-pharmacological techniques for pain control;/ Pharmacological therapy for pain control, including: paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and other analgesics;/ Surgical techniques such as total hip replacement and deresurfacing technique;/ //Prevention// Maintaining regular physical activity and weight control throughout life are important in preventing coxarthrosis, keeping muscles and joints strong and healthy.

Dedo em garradedo em martelo,"//What is it?// Hammer toe, also known as claw toe, is a deformity of the fingers. A traumatic injury that produces a sudden and intense flexion of the distal phalanx. Generally caused by rupture of the extensor tendon or the tearing of a bone fragment from this joint. Deformities of the second to fifth toes are very common, affecting both the proximal interphalangeal joint (first finger joint) and the distal interphalangeal joint (second finger joint), resulting from an imbalance in the entire articular and muscular architecture of the foot. . These deformities are initially mild and correctable, but over time they become rigid and unrecoverable by manipulation. They are often associated with hallux valgus (bunion), metatarsalgia (pain in the sole of the foot), and retraction of the Achilles tendon or short calves. Other less common causes should also be considered, as treatment may be different in these cases. //Symptoms// Patients present calluses (hyperkeratosis) in places where these deformities come into contact with shoes (due to being tight or due to bone hyperpressure). Wounds or ulcers can even form, usually on the tips of the fingers or in the dorsal region of the interphalangeal joints, sometimes making it difficult to wear your usual shoes. //Causes// The muscles in each toe work in pairs; When an imbalance arises between the force exerted by the muscles, finger deformity may arise. Muscle imbalance puts exaggerated pressure on the tendons and joints of the toe, forcing it into a hammer shape. Risk factors include: Flat foot;/ Genes: There is a hereditary tendency to develop hammertoes based on flat or high-arched feet;/ Arthritis;/ Injury: ill-fitting shoes, especially those that are too narrow, short, pointed or high as they put excessive pressure on the toes;/ Aging;/ //Diagnosis// A careful clinical examination and x-ray of both feet allow an accurate diagnosis to be made and the severity and associated changes to other structures of the foot to be assessed. //Treatment// In the initial phase, while the deformities are flexible, manipulation and stretching exercises of the leg and foot muscles are recommended. In the absence of wounds or infection, an insole or the use of specific silicone orthoses may also be used. The use of adapted shoes is an alternative in patients in whom surgical intervention is not an option. In cases of persistent pain and deformity, surgical intervention is indicated. The different types of surgical corrections depend mainly on the underlying cause and include excision (arthroplastic resection) or fusion (arthrodesis) of the painful joint, lengthening or transfer of tendons, and section (osteotomy) of the phalanx or metatarsal. //Prevention// Prevention of these problems is mainly based on wearing appropriate shoes and taking care of your feet. Regular monitoring of the condition of the foot - especially important in diabetic patients or with any other medical condition that causes poor circulation or numbness in the toes. This way, problems can be detected early.;/ Promoting good circulation in the lower limbs is essential - remember that even sitting, you must keep your feet elevated and exercise your legs; Foot massage also promotes circulation.;/  Above all, suitable shoes must be worn: Most people have one foot larger than the other; when trying on shoes, consider the foot with the larger volume.;/ Shoes must have good arch support and not be pointy or narrow.;/ When purchasing new shoes, you should wear the appropriate socks - for example, sports socks when purchasing sports shoes;/ As you age, your feet get bigger and you should only keep the same shoes as long as they fit comfortably.;/ You should keep about a centimeter and a half between the tip of your longest toe and the tip of the shoe.;/ The footwear should be sturdy, so that it only bends at the toe, but never buy footwear that feels tight in the expectation that it will stretch with use.;/ If you have hammer toes and bunions, you should avoid shoes with many seams and poorly malleable areas that do not adapt to the deformities.;/  Record: Your heel should not feel loose inside the shoe when you walk.;/ The higher the heel, the less safe it is;/ Children's shoes should be checked frequently to ensure they are still appropriate for the size of their growing feet.;/ WebMD Load more;/ Having a cast on your arm or leg helps you recover from fractures and reduces pain.

Defice de atencao,"//What is it?// Attention deficit corresponds to the occurrence of scarce or brief periods of attention and impulsiveness exaggerated for one's age. This deficit may or may not be associated with hyperactivity. Although it is more common in children, it can also affect adults. This problem affects about 5% to 10% of school-age children and is 10 times more common in boys than girls. The first manifestations usually appear before the age of four and almost always before the age of seven. Attention deficit, whether isolated or associated with hyperactivity, generates problems at home, at school, at work and in interpersonal relationships, which is why its recognition and approach are fundamental. //Symptoms// Its main characteristic is the difficulty in maintaining continuous levels of attention, concentration and persistence in tasks. A child suffering from this disorder may also be impulsive and hyperactive. Attention deficit disorder in preschool age is associated with anxiety, communication and relationship problems, and inappropriate behavior. Other common signs include constant leg restlessness, hand shaking and rubbing, impulsive speech, forgetfulness, and disorganization. Aggression is rare. About 20% of children with this condition have learning difficulties, and about 90% perform poorly at school. Depression, anxiety or aggression may occur during adolescence. Although impulsivity and hyperactivity tend to decrease with age, inattention and associated symptoms may persist into adulthood. //Causes// It is thought to be hereditary. Some studies indicate that it is caused by abnormalities in brain neurotransmitters. Attention deficit may be reinforced by the family or school environment. Some investigations suggest that it may be associated with environmental factors such as exposure to cigarette smoke or alcohol during pregnancy. It is thought that being exposed to high levels of lead (paint on old buildings) may be another cause of risk to consider. //Diagnosis// It is based on the quantity, frequency and severity of symptoms. This is a difficult diagnosis, as it depends on a subjective assessment. Symptoms may be present in other conditions and these children may present other problems that are associated with different manifestations. //Treatment// Treatment, as a rule, combines the use of medication with behavioral therapy carried out by a child psychologist, adapted to each case. When children are not very aggressive and are in a stable family environment, treatment with medication may be sufficient. Children with attention deficit disorder do not usually fully overcome their difficulties. The problems persist into adolescence and adulthood and include academic failure, low self-esteem, anxiety, depression and difficulties in maintaining appropriate social behavior. In general, these people seem to adapt better to work situations than to school. When left untreated, the risk of alcohol or drug abuse and the rate of suicide tend to be higher than in the general population. It is important to emphasize that therapy can alleviate many of the symptoms but there is no cure for this condition. //Prevention// During pregnancy, it is important to abstain from anything that could harm the development of the fetus, such as alcohol, tobacco, drugs or environmental toxins. Children must also be protected from tobacco smoke, industrial or agricultural chemicals, and lead paint. Although there is no concrete data, it is prudent to avoid excessive exposure to television or video games in the first five years of life.

Deformidades congenitas do membro superior,"//What is it?// Congenital deformities are deformities that are present at birth. Any type of deformity becomes a challenge as children grow. Those that affect the hands and remaining arms are particularly disabling as children learn to interact with the environment through the use of their hands. These anomalies range from simple to severe, examples of this spectrum being having less or more than 5 fingers, having fingers that do not bend, that are too short or too long, that are joined together, having arms that are curved, joints that are not completely formed and not moving as expected or having parts of the arm that have not formed. Some of these deformities appear associated with other problems, but others appear in isolation.  How to react? Although it is normal for parents to feel shocked, disappointed or guilty, it is important to be aware that they could rarely have done anything to interfere with the baby's development and prevent the presence of the malformation. The baby, despite the deformity, has the same needs as any newborn and does not have pain or any type of suffering associated with the deformity it has. A hand surgery appointment should be scheduled immediately after birth. Although surgery is not always or immediately indicated, it is important to determine the need for rehabilitation with physiotherapy or occupational therapy and the possible referral for a genetics consultation. //Causes// There are many causes for congenital deformities, some can be explained but others have no known causes. The process of a baby's development from a fertilized egg is very complex, it involves millions of complicated steps and there can be errors in any of these. The upper limb, which comprises the arm, forearm and hand, forms between the 4th and 7th week of pregnancy, when the baby is less than 2.5 cm. It is estimated that 1 in every 20 babies will have some imperfection, of greater or lesser severity and complexity. Some congenital anomalies are inherited, but they can skip generations or may result from a combination of genetic anomalies carried by the parents. Other genetic alterations are new to the family, with the child having the anomaly for the first time but still presenting a risk of passing it on to their descendants. Other birth defects have non-genetic causes. Some medications, such as the well-known thalidomide and some drugs used in chemotherapy, are known to cause birth defects. Alcohol, tobacco and drugs affect the development of the fetus but are not specifically related to upper limb malformations. Congenital constrictive bands, commonly called amniotic bands, are amniotic bands equivalent to threads that, when wrapped around the upper limbs (arm, forearm and hands) or lower limbs (thigh, leg and foot) can lead to various deformities, from creases to or less deep up to amputations. In other situations, the reason for the malformation is not known. One of the numerous steps in the development of the fetus is not completed effectively, resulting in the changes found //Treatment// The goal for any child with a congenital malformation is to have function of the involved limb as close to normal as possible. To achieve this objective, it may be necessary to carry out rehabilitation with physiotherapy or occupational therapy, the use of splints or prostheses or surgery. Each child must be evaluated individually and treatment must be chosen according, not only to the deformity present, but also to difficulties in function.

Degenerescencia macular da idade,"//What is Age-Related Macular Degeneration?// Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a degenerative disease of the central area of ​​the retina (macula) that leads to a marked and irreversible decrease in central vision, with preservation of peripheral vision. Its incidence and prevalence have been increasing, which is a result of the general aging of the population, the increase in the situations involved in its onset and also the improvement in diagnostic capacity. Age-old Macular Degeneration (AMD) is the main cause of blindness in Western countries. In general, the disease appears after the age of 55 and is progressive, increasing in prevalence with age. In Portugal, around 12% of people aged 55 or over suffer from Age Macular Degeneration (AMD). The earliest form accounts for around 85% to 90% of cases and, as a rule, does not cause relevant symptoms. Late or advanced forms (macular degeneration with geographic atrophy and exudative macular degeneration) are responsible for 10% to 15% of occurrences and can cause severe and irreversible loss of central or reading vision. It is estimated that in Portugal there are around 310 thousand people with the early form and around 45 thousand with the late or advanced form (30 thousand with the exudative form and 15 thousand with the geographic atrophy form). Every year around 45 thousand new cases arise with the early form of the disease and around five thousand with the late form. Early infections can progress to late injuries and the risk increases with age and the severity of the predisposing injuries, with the risk of annual progression reaching 10%. Age-old Macular Degeneration (AMD) has a significant impact on the lives of patients and their families and represents an enormous burden in economic terms for healthcare systems.  //Symptoms of Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)// In most cases, in the first stage, it only affects one eye and the other will compensate for the loss of vision, so the patient may not notice the disease, which delays its diagnosis. The most common complaints are the perception of image distortion in the central area, which leads to a decrease in central visual acuity. This disorder prevents clear vision and impairs reading, with a progressive reduction in the central area of ​​the visual field. This progression can completely prevent reading. There is also a decrease in contrast sensitivity.  //Causes// The causes are not yet well known. The following constitute risk elements: Age;/ Family history;/ Smoking;/ Deficiencies in vitamins and trace elements, chronic exposure to intense light and ultraviolet radiation, high blood pressure and atherosclerosis are cited as potential factors in the prevalence of the disease. Some studies suggest a relationship between daily consumption of acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin®) and a greater risk of developing macular degeneration. Other causes are gender (more common in women), ethnicity (Caucasians are more prevalent) and light-colored eyes.  //Diagnosis// The use of a checkerboard grid (Amsler grid) placed at a distance of approximately 30 centimeters makes it possible to assess the presence of distortions in the different lines. This test must be performed with one eye at a time. The ophthalmological examination allows direct observation of the retina and macular area. Performing an angiography, which allows the retinal circulation to be seen, highlights macular degeneration, which can present itself in different stages, from the earliest to the most advanced forms, with a pattern of atrophy or exudation. Optical coherence tomography allows the evaluation of the different layers of the retina and provides very detailed information about the changes present.  //Treatment of Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)// Treatment with a complete cure is still difficult, if not impossible. Prophylactic therapy for early forms, with high-dose vitamin and mineral supplements, such as zinc, may be indicated for patients at higher risk of progression. As for late forms, geographic atrophy has no known treatment. The exudative form can be treated with laser photocoagulation, photodynamic therapy or intraocular injections of substances capable of improving or controlling the degenerative process. Current therapies for exudative forms allow the vision existing at the start of treatment to be preserved in around 70% to 90% of cases and improve it in around 30%. For these treatments to be effective, early diagnosis is essential.  //Prevention// Possible prevention is related to risk factors, namely smoking, hypertension, nutritional deficiencies and exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Adopting a healthy lifestyle can prevent the onset of diseases such as Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD), among others. Therefore, it is important: No smoking;/ Wear properly certified sunglasses to protect your eyes from UV rays;/ Wear a peaked hat to create eye shadow;/ Reduce saturated fats and cholesterol in your diet, as well as alcohol consumption;/ Keep your blood pressure low;/ Avoid being overweight;/ Practice physical exercise;/ Consult an ophthalmologist at least once a year;/ Eat a diet rich in fruit and vegetables (foods rich in antioxidants, such as carrots, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, spinach, corn, broccoli, peas, green beans, tomatoes, lettuce, turnip greens and turnip greens);/ Prof. J.

Demencia,"//What is it?// Dementia is a generic term used to designate a set of diseases in which there is a deterioration in cognitive and behavioral performance, affecting autonomy. There are several types of dementia and few can be effectively treated or prevented. However, it is believed that a healthy lifestyle can delay the onset of most.  //Dementia without loss of autonomy// When there is cognitive performance lower than age and education but the patient is able to perform all the tasks he previously assumed, he has a mild cognitive defect. This category represents a transitional state between normality and dementia, and conversion occurs at a rate of 15% per year.  //What functions can be lost with dementia?// The main cognitive domains that can be affected are: The ability to organize, plan, decide and judge (executive functions);;/ The ability to retain and recall information (memory);;/ The ability for verbal expression and understanding (language);;/ The ability to recognize people and objects (gnosis);;/ The ability to orientate in space and produce sequences of motor acts (praxis).;/ Each category of dementia tends to affect these cognitive domains in a relatively typical pattern. This arises, on the one hand, from the predilection that each of them has for certain regions of the brain and, on the other, from the relevance that each of these categories assumes for each cognitive function.  //How are dementias classified?// There are several classifications used, one of which has proven to be most clinically useful divides them into: Primary (degenerative, in which dementia is the disease itself);;/ Secondary (in which there is another pathology that manifests as dementia);;/ Among the latter, there are some that can be treated and/or prevented, highlighting the importance of a correct diagnosis, to which the detailed collection of the clinical history, neurological and neuropsychological examination, and the comprehensive use of laboratory and imaging tests contribute.  //What are the most common dementias?// The main ones are: Alzheimer's disease (which accounts for about two-thirds of all cases);;/ Frontotemporal dementia;;/ Dementia with Lewy bodies;;/ Vascular dementia (of these, the only secondary).;/  //What is the prevalence rate of dementia?// When it comes to frequency, the most abundant epidemiological data refers to Alzheimer's disease. Its prevalence rate, which increases exponentially with age, varies from up to 1% between 60 and 65 years old to almost 50% over 90 years old, estimating a total of more than 150 thousand patients in Portugal and 35 million worldwide. . //Symptoms// Symptoms are mainly due to memory changes that can worsen over the years: Loss of recent memories;/ Difficulty perceiving common time and space - where you are, what day or year it is;/ Difficulty in oral and written communication and use of incorrect words;/ Loss of common objects and difficulty with daily tasks;/ Loss of initiative and interests;/ Mood and personality changes, unexplained irritability;/ //Causes// Dementia can be caused by loss of brain cells and neurodegenerative diseases that occur with age, however, aging does not mean dementia! Other causes of dementia can be: stroke, trauma, brain tumor, cerebrovascular disease, depression, alcoholism. //Diagnosis// It is performed by the attending physician who analyzes the patient's history and performs a physical examination. Important factors are: changes in attention, orientation, memory, judgment, language, motor and spatial skills; exclusion of other pathologies - by definition, dementia is not due to major depression or schizophrenia. Additional tests may include memory and psychometric tests, blood and urine tests, imaging tests (MRI, CT scan), electroencephalogram, etc., depending on the type of manifestations of the disease. //Treatment// If we exclude the small percentage of treatable causes of dementia, for the majority there is no curative treatment or treatment that alters the natural history of the disease. However, there are already very useful drugs, either to optimize cognitive functions (such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or memantine) or to reduce behavioral dysfunction (such as antidepressants and anti-psychotics). //Prevention// There is no definitive way to prevent dementia, but it is possible to indicate some precautions to be taken: In Alzheimer's disease, a healthy lifestyle is beneficial, with a balanced diet, regular physical exercise, moderate wine consumption and adequate control of vascular risk factors, especially high blood pressure.;/ In the case of vascular dementia, this takes on an even more relevant role, combined with pharmacological strategies to prevent new cerebral infarctions.;/ One of the most attractive theories points to cognitive reserve, resulting from multiple variables (such as intelligence quotient, level of education, participation in cultural and leisure activities), as responsible for greater resistance to cognitive deterioration. Thus, the greater an individual's reserve, the later he or she becomes clinically ill, although his or her brain may have already shown histological signs of the pathology for many years.;/ Cleveland Clinic Medical News Today There are some signs associated with memory loss that require medical advice and others that are not concerning.

Dengue,"//What is it?// Dengue is an infection caused by a flavivirus and is transmitted through the bite of female mosquitoes of the genus Aedes, particularly Ae. aegypti, infected with the virus, with no person-to-person transmission. Ae. aegypti, also transmits zika and chikungunya. It is possible to contract dengue up to 4 times, as the virus has four different serotypes (DENV1, DENV2, DENV3 and DENV4), and one serotype does not generate immunity against the others. In the last 50 years, cases of dengue have increased worldwide. Every year, 390 million cases of dengue are recorded in the world and of these, 96 million manifest themselves at a clinical level. The World Health Organization estimates that around 4 billion people live in areas at risk of infection with the disease, which is present in 128 countries and is most common in tropical and subtropical areas. For example, in Brazil, where dengue is considered a public health problem, dengue epidemics have been identified since the 19th century. To date, no mosquitoes transmitting the dengue virus have been detected in mainland Portugal and all diagnosed cases were imported from endemic regions. //Symptoms// Dengue fever has an incubation period of 3 to 7 days, and can last up to 14 days. Dengue fever symptoms appear between 3 and 14 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito. The disease is generally manifested by: High fever;/ Headaches;/ Pain behind the eyes;/ Muscle and joint pain;/ Vomiting;/ Red spots on the skin;/ In more serious cases, a hemorrhagic condition appears - hemorrhagic dengue - in the skin, mucous membranes and internal organs, which can cause death. The likelihood of the disease getting worse is greater in those who have previously contracted the infection than in those who have never been infected. //Causes// The dengue virus is contracted through a mosquito bite. This insect is small, brown, with a white stripe on each side of the thorax and several white stripes on the legs. Their feeding, reproduction and egg laying occurs during the day and the mosquito is most active in the early morning and late afternoon. Since females need human blood to mature their eggs, this is when the disease can be transmitted. //Diagnosis// The diagnosis of dengue is normally made through blood tests, which allow detecting the presence of antibodies against this virus. However, it does not allow identifying which of the four dengue serotypes is responsible for the infection. //Treatment// There is no specific medication against dengue fever and its treatment is symptomatic, including: combating fever, maintaining hydration, relieving pain and, in the most serious cases, hospital admission and intravenous therapy. It is important to drink plenty of fluids and you should not take medications containing acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, known as Aspirin®) or anti-inflammatories, as they can increase the risk of bleeding. //Prevention// Since 2015, there has been a vaccine against dengue, recommended for people between 9 and 45 years old who live in areas considered endemic or at risk. Currently, one of the most effective forms of prevention against dengue fever includes combating mosquitoes, eliminating the places where they lay their eggs, usually places with stagnant water (for example, abandoned material such as disused tires, cans, bottles, vase plates plants, animal drinking fountains, ponds, wells and swimming pools). For that: Avoid using saucers on plant pots and, if you do, fill them with sand up to the brim.;/ Keep trash cans covered and drains closed and unclogged.;/ Brush your pet's food and water bowls at least once a week.;/ Clean the house's gutters, removing debris that could obstruct the passage of water.;/ Flush seldom-used toilets at least once a week and keep their lids closed.;/ Good basic sanitation conditions are fundamental in the prevention strategy, as is the rational use of insecticides to combat mosquitoes. Original text adapted from the General Directorate of Health Dengue, Zika and Chikungunya RSV infection can progress to bronchiolitis or pneumonia. Mônica Cró Braz, Pediatrician, points out the warning signs and prevention strategies. The pandemic has brought pediatricians an additional concern: Respiratory Syncytial Virus. Since then, cases have appeared earlier, in greater numbers and with greater severity. The COVID-19 vaccine protects us from developing serious illness, but it is still possible to contract the virus. Find out more about this topic.

Dependencia de substancias,"//What is it?// It is defined as a dependence on a ""toxic"" or drug that additionally causes psychological disturbances. Drugs are not all the same in terms of their toxicity: some are very toxic, others, like alcohol, can be ingested in a controlled way by many people without major problems. On the other hand, heroin, unlike alcohol, is a drug with fewer long-term toxic effects but has an enormous capacity to create dependence. It is important, therefore, to distinguish dependence caused by different substances because they have different characteristics and it is possible to use some of them in a non-abusive way. What makes a substance truly dangerous, as well as what induces and maintains its consumption, is a set of factors that interact dynamically and are related to the pharmacological properties of the substance, the psychological characteristics of the consumer and the social environment that surrounds them. This means that different people in different environments have a greater or lesser potential to become dependent on the same substance. Compulsion for drugs or other substances is defined when different criteria are present simultaneously: A strong desire to consume them;;/ Difficulties in controlling behavior, both in terms of start, end and consumption levels;;/ Physiological withdrawal state when use ceases or is reduced;;/ Evidence of tolerance, in which increasing doses are required to obtain an effect initially obtained with lower doses;;/ Progressive abandonment of alternative pleasures and interests in favor of their use and increasing the amount of time needed to recover from their effects;;/ Persistence in its use, despite evidence of clearly harmful consequences.;/ //Symptoms// Many begin merely casually, in a certain social context. This consumption becomes more habitual until it acquires the characteristics of an addiction, requiring increasingly larger quantities and increasingly frequent use. Over time, this substance becomes essential for a person to feel well and be able to function in their daily lives. Absence of this substance generates physical and emotional discomfort (withdrawal). Typical manifestations include the feeling of needing to consume it more and more regularly, the inability to stop, the need to always keep a supply of the substance, excessive spending of money, often beyond one's means, the impression that its use is essential to overcome daily problems, the carrying out of risky activities under the influence of this element and the increasing expenditure of time and energy in obtaining and using it. It is sometimes difficult to distinguish substance dependence from the behavioral changes that are common in adolescence. In adolescents, this problem should be suspected if they experience problems at school (absences, lack of interest, poor performance), lack of energy or motivation, unkempt appearance, changes in behavior, or excessive spending of money. //Causes// It is related to the chemical characteristics of the drug or substance, the psychological profile of the consumer and the environment in which he or she is inserted. In terms of characteristics, tobacco and coffee, for example, do not significantly alter consumer behavior and, therefore, are compatible with a normal social life. However, tobacco may not cause changes in behavior but can cause serious health problems. Marijuana, on the contrary, causes behavioral changes, which can make it dangerous, for example when driving vehicles, but the way in which it is consumed ( generally smoking fewer cigarettes per day), probably has fewer health implications than tobacco. In terms of their ability to cause addiction, heroin, cocaine and alcohol are the most dangerous. Tobacco, cannabinoids, coffee, ecstasy and LSD are those that cause milder dependence. In terms of the psychological characteristics of the consumer, adolescence is a difficult phase for around a third of young people, which can lead to frustrations that lead to an escape into these substances. Adolescence is, by definition, a time of experimentation and searching for the limits of the ""self"", which often leads to initiation into drugs. The male gender tends to be the most affected by its consumption, although women, after initiation, have a faster and more degrading path. Low tolerance to frustration, low self-esteem, the need for social approval, the systematic non-acceptance of social norms, and a predisposition to mental illness are other characteristics that make some people more susceptible to resorting to these substances and becoming dependent on them. It is important to note that cannabinoids are relatively harmless, but in certain predisposed individuals they can accelerate the onset of serious mental illnesses, such as psychosis. Cocaine, amphetamines, ecstasy and LSD can also induce psychotic episodes in certain users. On the other hand, there appears to be a genetic predisposition to addiction. With regard to the environment, the role of the family, school and workplace can be decisive in the emergence of an addiction or, conversely, in its early detection and correction. Socioeconomic level is also relevant, and the impact of social communication and advertising must also be mentioned. //Diagnosis// The diagnosis often begins with a family doctor or family member but must be confirmed by a psychiatrist, in accordance with internationally defined criteria. Testing for substances in the blood does not allow for a diagnosis but aims to check whether recent consumption has occurred. //Treatment// Treatment should always be individualized. In some cases, an inpatient regimen is effective because it can stop the progression and worsening of symptoms associated with the disease, as well as any impact it may have on the patient's health, family, work or finances. On the other hand, it must include a psychosocial component, where the individual relearns new skills and abilities that provide him with a better quality of life. Psychosocial therapy includes the entire assessment and diagnosis process, in a safe treatment environment free from legal and illegal drugs, with permanent pharmacological support and supervision, a personalized and structured intervention plan, individual and group psychotherapy, education on addictions and abstinence, social activities, family programs and a post-treatment/integration phase, already on an outpatient basis for one year. All of these steps aim at the full recovery of the dependent individual and their reintegration into the community. This work can and should be complemented by medical treatment of all complications and/or illnesses that may be associated with or caused by substance dependence. Drugs are equally essential to offset the effects of withdrawal and allow for a less painful recovery. //Prevention// The best way to prevent addiction to a substance is to not use it. As this can occur even with medications prescribed by a doctor, it is important to respect the doses and inform the healthcare professional about any symptoms of dependence. In adolescents, prevention involves good communication skills within the family, constant attention to warning signs, knowing how to listen and knowing how to set an example. In the case of recovered individuals, there is always a risk of relapse, which is why contact with the substance and all risk situations must be avoided.

Depressao,"//What is it?// Depression is one of the most common psychiatric illnesses. According to the World Health Organization, depression is one of the leading health problems in the developed world. It is estimated that one in four women and one in ten men may experience depression at some point in their lives and children can also be affected. There is no concrete data regarding its frequency in Portugal, but estimates refer to values ​​of 2 to 3% for men and 5 to 9% for women for the most severe forms of depression and values ​​greater than 20% for more severe forms. mild severity of the disease.  //What distinguishes depression from sadness?// Depression is a pathology that can go unnoticed, since its symptoms can be attributed to other causes (such as physical illnesses or stress). It is important to understand that everyone can feel sad, but these feelings do not last long. On the contrary, depression interferes with daily activities and is associated with intense suffering. As such, depression, although common, is a serious illness. Many people with depression do not seek treatment, even though there are effective ways to treat it. //Symptoms// Depression is a mood disorder that should not be confused with feelings of sadness, which are generally reactive to life events, temporary and, generally speaking, not incompatible with a normal life. Depression can present different forms and degrees of severity and its symptoms can last for a long time, and may include: Feelings of sadness and annoyance;/ Feelings of irritability, tension or agitation;/ Feelings of distress, worry, unfounded fears and insecurity;/ Decreased energy, fatigue and sluggishness;/ Loss of interest and pleasure in daily activities;/ Sleep and sexual desire disturbance;/ Significant weight fluctuations due to appetite disturbances;/ Feelings of guilt and self-devaluation;/ Changes in concentration, memory and reasoning;/ Physical symptoms not due to another illness (headaches, digestive disorders, chronic pain, general malaise);/ Ideas of death and suicide attempts;/  Depression significantly affects work performance, family and school life and all activities of the patient, causing great suffering. In the most severe forms, symptoms may appear without any apparent relation to traumatic life events and last for several months. In milder forms, the intensity of symptoms is lower and allows daily activities to be maintained, although the feeling of fatigue, sadness and disinterest is present, and tends to last for years. In some cases, depression does not manifest itself in the form of sadness, but through symptoms such as fatigue, non-specific pain, a feeling of tightness in the chest, insomnia, digestive disorders (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), which raises the hypothesis that a different disease, making diagnosis difficult and delaying. Depression can be part of bipolar disorder, in which episodes of depression alternate with periods of excitement and euphoria. In the euphoric phases, patients' self-esteem is very high and they lose touch with reality, which can lead to excessive spending and impossible deals. //Causes// In general, depression results from a combination of genetic, biological, environmental and psychological factors: There is a hereditary tendency for some types of depression.;/ Traumatic life events contribute to the onset of depression and can trigger or facilitate depressive episodes.;/ The personality type and the way each individual deals with problems is also associated with a greater or lesser predisposition to depression.;/ //Treatment// Treatment is important so that depression does not prolong and worsen. If symptoms are not recognized as part of an illness, negative evaluation by others will tend to accentuate poor personal image and reduced self-esteem. Suicide is a possibility that should not be forgotten and treatment is essential to reduce this risk and allow the symptoms of depression to improve. There are several possible treatments for depression, including antidepressant medication and psychotherapy, which should be chosen by a doctor on an individual basis. In general, these treatments must be continued for a significant period of time in order to be effective. Family and social support is an important complement to the treatment selected by the doctor. The prognosis for depression is good and depends essentially on the treatment instituted and adequate control of all risk factors present in each case. //Prevention// Although it is not possible to prevent depression, there are some lifestyle habits you can adopt to maintain your mental health: Find ways to manage stress and improve self-esteem.;/ Take good care of yourself: get enough sleep, eat a healthy diet and exercise regularly.;/ Seek support from family and friends in the most difficult times.;/ Have regular check-ups and consult your doctor if you are not feeling well.;/ Seek help if you feel depressed; don't wait, as this could make things worse.;/ American Psychological Association, 2013 Support Association for Depressive and Manic-Depressive Patients (ADEB), 2013 Gonçalves, B et al., Prevalence and diagnosis of depression in general and family medicine, Rev Port Clin Geral 2004;20:13-27 G.E.

Dermatite,"//What is it?// Dermatitis is an umbrella term that covers any medical condition in which inflammation of the skin occurs. There are multiple forms of this disease, the most common being seborrheic dermatitis and atopic dermatitis (eczema). Although it is not serious, it can cause intense discomfort and, as such, must be correctly diagnosed and treated. For example, contact dermatitis is the most common occupational disease, although not the most serious, and requires large losses of working days or even changes of profession. Dermatitis is a very common disease and, in relation to allergic forms, it is estimated that, in Portugal, around 10% of children present complaints compatible with dermatitis. In the case of atopic or allergic cases, in addition to cutaneous manifestations, the patient or family members present in around 80% of cases asthma and/or allergic ourinitis, which highlights the importance and impact of this type of disease. //Symptoms// Although each type of dermatitis presents different signs and symptoms, redness, swelling, itching and sores on the skin tend to be present. The main types of dermatitis and their symptoms are: Contact dermatitis, which results from repeated skin contact with irritating or allergenic substances. Symptoms appear at the point of contact (sometimes they actually outline this area) and are manifested by itching, redness and pimples, some with liquid content forming small water bubbles, or small wounds and crusts on the skin. These reactions are not immediate, they appear one or two days after contact and do not occur the first time you come into contact with the substance, requiring several exposures until the individual becomes allergic.;/ Neurodermatitis, a chronic dermatitis localized to specific areas of the skin, characterized by intense itching on the ankles, wrists, neck and arms.;/ Seborrheic dermatitis, a common type of dermatitis on the scalp and face that causes common dandruff. Sometimes the scales are dry, other times they have an oily appearance. This disease depends on the levels of sex hormones and, therefore, only manifests itself in newborns, who receive hormones from their mother, and after adolescence.;/ Stasis dermatitis, related to the accumulation of fluids under the skin in the lower limbs, interfering with the nutrition of the skin.;/ Atopic dermatitis, better known as eczema, associated with intense itching that appears and disappears. It is more common in children than in adults.;/ Perioral dermatitis, a type of dermatitis that affects the area around the mouth.;/ Diaper dermatitis, which corresponds to the traditional “diaper rash” caused by irritation of the skin on the bottom of babies who wear diapers. The convex areas of the genital area become red and irritated with the bottom of the folds being spared. It is estimated to affect between 25 and 65% of children, being most common between 6 and 12 months of age. It is caused by moisture, friction and contact with chemical and biological irritants such as urine and feces. These agents compromise the skin barrier and make the skin more vulnerable to infectious agents. They usually resolve after 2 to 3 days without complications.;/ Dermatitis can be complicated by the appearance of infections or cellulitis, which corresponds to a serious bacterial infection and is manifested by swelling, redness, heat and pain when touched on the affected skin. Other possible complications are the formation of scars and changes in skin color. //Causes// The causes vary depending on the type of dermatitis, but generally speaking, the most common are: Other diseases;/ Allergic factors;/ Genetic factors;/ Physical or irritating factors;/ Stress;/ //Contact dermatitis// Its main cause is direct contact with irritating or allergenic substances, such as detergents and other cleaning products, rubber, metals, perfumes, cosmetics, plants and some antibiotics, such as neomycin and bacitracin. The time of contact with an irritant is much longer than that required for an allergen for dermatitis to occur. When it develops for a certain substance, it will probably remain for life. //Neurodermatite// It is associated with dry skin, chronic irritation and eczema. //Seborrheic dermatitis// It is common in people with oily skin and hair. It appears and disappears depending on the seasons, has a hereditary tendency and is aggravated by stress. //Stasis dermatitis// The most common causes are varicose veins, obesity, pregnancy and other conditions that affect circulation, such as deep vein thrombosis. //Atopic dermatitis// It is associated with allergies and runs in families with asthma, hay fever or eczema. It tends to begin in childhood and is less problematic in adulthood. Dry or irritable skin and changes in the body's defenses are some of the factors associated with atopic dermatitis. Stress can accentuate it, but it is not a direct cause. //Diagnosis// The diagnosis is essentially clinical, based on the clinical history and the appearance of the skin lesions. Although there are not many diagnostic tests, skin tests are available for contact dermatitis that allow you to identify the substances that cause it. To carry out these tests, a type of sticker is applied to the patient's back and the skin is observed after two days to see what substances the skin reacts to. //Treatment// Treatment depends on the cause and may consist of applying corticosteroid creams or moist compresses. It is important to keep the skin well hydrated - to prevent the occurrence of breakouts that could interfere with the skin's barrier function - and avoid contact with irritating or allergenic substances. In some cases, it may be useful to use anti-allergy medications to control itching. Regarding seborrheic dermatitis, there are specific shampoos and creams that can alleviate it. It's important to know that dandruff and excess oil do not cause hair loss. Diaper dermatitis is prevented and treated through the use of appropriately sized, superabsorbent diapers that must be changed frequently. Skin cleansing should be gentle, without friction and without the use of irritating products, such as alcohol or perfumes. The use of emollients or protective pastes after each diaper change reduces maceration and aids healing. The application of talcum powder is not recommended due to the risk of respiratory inhalation. In general, the treatment of dermatitis should always be defined by a dermatologist and self-medication should always be avoided.

Dermatite atopica,"//What is it?// Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease, usually beginning during childhood. Its incidence has increased over the last 40 years, and is currently estimated to affect between 10% and 20% of the pediatric population. It is a very common disease, more common in urban areas. It has an early onset, usually appearing in the first year of life. The prognosis is favorable in most cases, with approximately 60% of children experiencing a reduction or complete disappearance of lesions before puberty. In 90% of cases it appears before the age of five, with 60% of occurrences in the first year of life. Atopic dermatitis has a universal distribution and both genders are equally affected. In Portugal, it is estimated that around 10% of children are affected by the disease. In most situations, the pathology tends to improve a lot and even disappear with age, although it can remain for life. Persistence is more observed in cases where the onset is late. In general, atopic dermatitis affects people with a personal or family history of asthma, allergic rhinitis or atopic dermatitis. //Symptoms// It is characterized by skin itching, which tends to be recurrent, and the distribution of lesions varies with age. The typical ones in the acute phase consist of reddish eruptions, forming papules or vesicles, with exudation and crust formation that evolve, in the chronic phase, into scaly lesions. In early childhood, this dermatitis can affect the entire body surface, but generally spares the diaper area; during second childhood, it occurs mainly on the limbs, with particular emphasis on the flexor surfaces. In adulthood, the lesions are located on the hands and feet, on the flexible areas of the limbs and on the cervical region. The skin in these areas becomes thicker, rougher and darker. Although it tends to be localized in these regions, atopic dermatitis can become generalized, affecting large areas of the body. Scratching can cause skin excoriations and secondary infection. After childhood, the lesions may be completely eliminated, but generally the disease has a chronic course, with periods of improvement and worsening. It is common, after atopic dermatitis disappears, for it to be replaced by one of the other forms of atopy presentation (asthma or rhinitis). Another characteristic of the skin in these cases is its greater tendency to dry out, which can also give rise to the sensation of itching and peeling. Emotional stress can trigger periods of exacerbation. //Causes// The exact cause is unknown. Its origin appears to be immunological mechanisms of immediate hypersensitivity, common to other diseases such as bronchial asthma and rhinitis, and delayed hypersensitivity. The hereditary component is important. In a child where one of the parents has an atopic condition (asthma, allergic rhinitis or atopic dermatitis) there is approximately a 25% chance of also showing some form of atopic disease. This percentage increases to 50% if both parents have this pathology. //Diagnosis// It may take several visits before the doctor can make a diagnosis. There is no specific test for atopic dermatitis. The test is performed based on the characteristics of the lesions and takes into account the existence of possible allergies in other family members. Although it may look a lot like seborrheic dermatitis in children, it is important to distinguish it because the complications and treatment are different. //Treatment// There is no cure for atopic dermatitis but certain measures can be beneficial: It is important to avoid contact with substances that irritate the skin;;/ To avoid dry skin, baths should be quick and with lukewarm water. Avoid using too much soap and apply a neutral moisturizer immediately afterwards, before the water on your skin evaporates;;/ Corticosteroid creams can soothe lesions and control itching. Its use must always be carried out in accordance with the doctor's instructions;;/ It is helpful to apply petroleum jelly or vegetable oil to the affected areas to help keep them soft and lubricated;;/ Antihistamines can sometimes control itching, in part because they act as a sedative. Because these drugs can cause drowsiness, it is best to apply them at night;;/ Keeping your nails short can help reduce the damage caused by itching and decrease the chances of infection;;/ In case of skin inflammation, oral antibiotics may be necessary;;/ Ultraviolet light treatment combined with oral doses of psoralene, a drug that enhances the effects of ultraviolet light on the skin, may help adults. This treatment is rarely prescribed for children.;/ //Prevention// If there is no known cause, atopic dermatitis cannot be prevented. What is important is to adopt measures that protect the skin, reduce dryness and keep it healthier: Bathing should be daily, quick and with warm water. Drying must be done without rubbing the skin and a cream must be applied immediately to promote hydration and maintain its barrier function;;/ It is important to emphasize that dry skin causes more itching, worsening the cycle of atopic dermatitis;;/ Nails must always be well cut and clean to avoid microbial infections secondary to scratching;;/ Sweat tends to aggravate atopic dermatitis and, for this reason, it is recommended to shower after playing sports;;/ Clothing that makes direct contact with the skin, including sheets, should be made from natural fibers, such as cotton. It is recommended that they be rinsed well in order to remove detergent residue, which often aggravates the disease;;/ Footwear must be made of leather and socks must be made of cotton, to allow good ventilation;;/ Excessive heat and sudden changes in temperature can be aggravating factors. Therefore, rooms should be well ventilated and heaters should be avoided. Excessive use of blankets on the bed should be limited to prevent sweating.;/ Dust mites and dust are also involved in atopic dermatitis, so you must remove rugs, carpets, curtains, stuffed animals and everything that could lead to the retention of this subspecies of arachnids in rooms.;/ Manual Merck online Susana Oliveira et al., Eczema/Atopic Dermatitis Syndrome in Portugal - Awareness Profile, See.

Descolamento da retina,"//What is it?// It is an ophthalmological emergency in which there is a separation of the retina from its connection at the back of the eye and requires urgent surgery. It is a serious condition that occurs when the retina (the thin layer of tissue at the back of the eye that processes light) becomes detached from the supporting tissues of the eye. Retinal detachment can lead to permanent vision loss if there is no medical intervention within 24 to 72 hours. Early diagnosis is essential to prevent vision loss associated with retinal detachment. //Symptoms// It manifests itself with “flashes” of light, darkening of peripheral vision and floating points in the visual field, usually without associated pain. You should quickly contact an ophthalmological emergency service for surgery. //Causes// A person is more likely to experience a retinal detachment if they are severely nearsighted, have an eye injury, have had cataract surgery, or have a family history of this condition. //Diagnosis// In response to the patient's complaints, the specialist doctor performs an ophthalmological examination - applying eye drops that enlarge the pupil to check whether the retina is detached. Early diagnosis is essential to prevent vision loss. //Treatment// This is the most advanced procedure - Vitrectomy - surgical procedure carried out in the operating room, with strict aseptic conditions, generally under general anesthesia followed by hospitalization with mandatory rest. //Prevention// A regular eye examination can indicate early changes in the eyes, especially in myopic patients, where there is a higher prevalence of retinal detachment. Treating these cases can prevent future problems. You should continue to see your ophthalmologist every year, or more frequently if you have other associated conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure that increase the likelihood of eye diseases. Eye protection is also recommended when playing sports or working with machines, chemicals and tools. WebMD Myopia, astigmatism and hyperopia often lead to the use of glasses or contact lenses. LASIK surgery can restore good vision. Do you wear contact lenses? There are hygiene precautions that you must adopt to keep your eyes healthy and free from infections. Discover best practices here.

Desequilibrio,"//What is it?// Often defined by a propensity to fall, it can manifest itself as an inability to maintain balance, with sporadic deviations in gait, or it can be permanent, sometimes associated with lateral deviations with a tendency to fall when the patient adopts a static or dynamic body posture. People with balance disorders feel unsteady or like they are going to fall. //Symptoms// People with balance disorders feel unsteady or like they are going to fall. //Causes// For the body to feel balanced, the brain requires information from the inner ear, eyes, muscles and joints as well as resulting from problems associated with the brain or heart. Other pathologies such as changes in blood pressure, cervical spondylitis, Parkinson's disease and diabetes can be a cause of imbalance. //Diagnosis// As the mechanisms to maintain balance are very complex, it is sometimes complex to find its exact cause, involving the contribution of several medical specialties in its research. The medical team assesses the type of disorientation, dizziness or vertigo; evaluates the inner ear, blood pressure, blood sugar level and other physical and laboratory aspects to find the possible origin of the pathology. Additional diagnostic tests may be necessary to define a treatment plan. //Treatment// Treatment may include medications, therapies, and lifestyle changes, depending on the cause found. There are some medications that can be used, including: anxiolytics, for example if the imbalance is caused by panic disorders or anxiety attacks;/ anticholinergics or antihistamines, which may reduce or alleviate symptoms;/ medications for headaches and migraines, if the imbalance has this origin;/ //Prevention// Some measures can help prevent it, including: Reduce stress;/ Maintain hydration by increasing water consumption;/ Reduce alcohol and tobacco intake;/ Sleeping is healing;/ Practice correct neck and head positioning exercises;/ Consider psychotherapy and acupuncture;/ Cleveland Clinic Medical News Today WebMD Vestibular neuritis is an inflammation of the vestibular nerve after an episode of acute vertigo, which can maintain the sensation of imbalance for weeks.

Diabetes,"//What is it?// Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disease, which can have several causes and which results from several pathophysiological changes that lead to a permanent increase in glycemia (blood sugar concentration). This increase is essentially due to defects in the normal action of insulin and/or a lack of it. The incidence is growing and affects around 13% of the Brazilian adult population. It is estimated that there are around 400 million people with diabetes worldwide, and the numbers continue to rise. Sugar is necessary for the metabolism of cells. In order for it to be transported there, the pancreas produces insulin, a hormone that captures glucose from the bloodstream and transports it to cells throughout the body where it is used as energy. Anyone can suffer from this disease, however, exposure to risk factors can increase the likelihood of its occurrence. Around 90% of diabetes cases are classified as type 2 diabetes. This type mainly affects adults and elderly people, who are overweight or obese, sedentary and have unhealthy lifestyles, and there is often a family history. Type 1 diabetes is much less common and essentially results from the sudden and irreversible destruction of pancreatic cells, usually due to autoimmune inflammation. These patients are usually teenagers or young adults. In pregnant women, the new hormonal environment, combined with excess weight, a sedentary lifestyle and an unbalanced diet, can produce a type of diabetes typical of pregnancy, called gestational diabetes. It is usually controlled with diet and physical activity alone, but may require insulin treatment. The main problems with this type of diabetes, when left uncontrolled, are fetal and birth complications. //Symptoms// Symptoms are caused by the amount of sugar in the blood, either associated with an increase in its level (hyperglycemia) or a decrease in its level (hypoglycemia).  //Symptoms of hyperglycemia// Hyperglycemia can occur in poorly controlled diabetics or when a large amount of sugar is ingested. This condition can cause blurred vision, a dry mouth, excessive sweating and fatigue.  //Symptoms of hypoglycemia// Hypoglycemia usually occurs in diabetics who use medications to control the disease, whether insulin or oral antidiabetics. This condition can result from taking too much or incorrect medication, prolonged fasting or inadequate physical exercise. Blood sugar levels should not be below 70mg/dl. When taking medications to control the disease, it is necessary to pay close attention to what you eat so that your sugar levels do not drop too low. Unexplained tiredness, dizziness, blurred vision and difficulty thinking are the main symptoms of hypoglycemia. //Causes// The pancreas releases insulin, the hormone that controls the storage and use of sugar in the blood. Diabetes occurs when: The pancreas produces insufficient insulin or is unable to produce any insulin at all;/ When the body does not respond adequately to insulin - a condition of ""insulin resistance"";/  It is a public health problem that often results from the way people live and the habits they have. Its incidence has been increasing. In 2010, around 34.9% of the Portuguese population between 20 and 79 years old had diabetes or pre-diabetes and around 43.6% of cases were undiagnosed. This disease is responsible for several complications that reduce quality of life and can cause early death. It is an illness that has no cure. However, advances in treatments and understanding of the disease allow diabetics to lead practically normal lives. Often, careful eating and regular exercise are enough to prevent the disease or keep it under control. Some risk factors are possible to control (modifiable); others are not (non-modifiable). Modifiable risk factors: High blood pressure;/ Obesity;/ Sleep deprivation;/ Sedentary lifestyle;/ Smoking;/ Non-modifiable risk factors: Diseases of the pancreas or endocrine diseases;/ Family history;/ Newborn weighing more than four kilos;/ Gender and age: Women over 45 are most affected;/ //Diagnosis// One of the main problems is that symptoms often go unnoticed, leading to late diagnosis. To do this, an analysis of the symptoms and risk factors is necessary. Generally, only one parameter is used to make the diagnosis. If two are used, they must be consistent and, if they are not, the analysis must be repeated two weeks after the first. //Treatment// Type 1 diabetics are treated with insulin (insulin therapy), which is administered subcutaneously several times a day from the beginning of the disease. This must be done together with correct blood glucose monitoring and a healthy diet and regular exercise. Type 2 diabetics monitor their blood sugar levels with oral antidiabetic drugs. Sometimes no medication is necessary, as this type of diabetes can be controlled by adopting a healthy lifestyle, restricting high-calorie foods, eating in portions, exercising, taking medications that facilitate the action of insulin, and in certain cases or more advanced stages of the disease, by administering insulin (if treatment with oral antidiabetics is not able to achieve the expected goals). Weight loss is essential for these patients. //Prevention// Although there is no cure, good blood sugar control can prolong life and prevent complications. Prevention involves three important points: Understanding diabetes: It is important for patients to understand their type of diabetes well. This is the only way to comply with and improve their treatment. The way patients deal with the disease is the main factor for success.;/ Control blood glucose: if it is within normal limits there is less chance of suffering complications.;/ Diet: One of the priorities for type 2 diabetics is to improve their eating habits and lose weight. As this is one of the risk factors that most contributes to the development of the disease and the appearance of complications, it is also one of the most important to control. Medication is not effective if eating habits do not improve.;/ Diabetes Portal (http://portaldadiabetes.pt) Gardete-Correia L e col.,First diabetes prevalence studyin Portugal: PREVADIAB study, Diabet Med. 2010 Aug;27(8):879-81 Medscape Reference(http://emedicine.medscape.com) Load more;/ Diabetics are at risk for COVID-19 infection, not because they have a greater chance of contracting it, but rather because of the severity of the complications. Diabetes in children is increasingly common and is a chronic disease that can have several complications. Keeping it under control is essential. One means your blood sugar levels are too low and the other means your blood sugar levels are too high. But they have one thing in common: they are both harmful to health.
