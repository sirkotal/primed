Laryngeal cancer,"//What is it?// The cells of the laryngeal epithelium are responsible for the formation of the tissue that lines the larynx. In their normal state, these cells grow and divide into new cells, formed as they are needed, and this process is called cell regeneration.  When cells lose their control mechanism and undergo changes in their genome (DNA), they become cancer cells, which do not die when they age or are damaged, and produce new cells that are not needed in an uncontrolled manner, resulting in the formation of cancer.  Laryngeal cancers form in response to continuous aggression to the epithelium. Laryngeal cancer is part of a group of cancers that we group under the general name of head and neck cancer. //Prevention// Preventing laryngeal cancer fundamentally involves adopting healthy habits, namely not smoking and avoiding alcohol consumption.  It also involves being alert to the symptoms of the disease and should consult your doctor if they appear.  If you are a habitual smoker or drink alcohol excessively, you should consult your doctor regularly to make an early diagnosis of laryngeal cancer or another type of head and neck cancer. //Risk factors// Any behavior or condition that increases your risk of developing a disease is a risk factor. Just because one or more risk factors apply to you, it does not necessarily mean that you will develop laryngeal cancer. Likewise, laryngeal cancer can occur in individuals who have no known risk factors. The causes of laryngeal cancer have not yet been determined, but some risk factors are known. The main risk factors are:  Tobacco – smoking is the cause of most laryngeal cancers; heavy smokers who have smoked for several years are at higher risk;  Alcohol – excessive alcohol consumption increases the risk of laryngeal cancer; this factor combined with tobacco increases the risk of developing laryngeal cancer. //Symptoms// The symptoms of laryngeal cancer are not exclusive and can occur in other diseases. The fact that you have one or more of the symptoms described here does not mean that you have laryngeal cancer.  You should be alert and consult your doctor if you have the following symptoms: Inflammation in the throat that does not go away despite treatment;;/ Mass in the neck or throat;;/ Hoarseness or voice change that does not go away;;/ Difficulty or pain when swallowing;;/ Difficulty breathing;;/ Persistent cough that does not go away despite treatment;;/ Ear pain that won't go away.;/ //Who should I contact?// If you notice any of the signs or symptoms described, you should consult an Otolaryngologist or a specialist in Maxillofacial Surgery. CUF Oncology has specialized teams at its disposal, with extensive experience in different approaches to diagnosing and treating head and neck cancer.

There are several types of laryngeal cancer: squamous cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma – represent around 95% of laryngeal cancers, and originate in the cells of the stratified epithelium – epithelium with several layers and flat cells – that covers the inside of the organ;;/  carcinomas verrucosos;;/  adenocarcinomas;;/  small cell carcinomas.;/ ""We can never give up. As long as we have strength we must move forward."" //Diagnosis and Staging// In a patient suspected of having laryngeal cancer, tests may be requested to diagnose the disease.  The first step will be to have an otorhinolaryngology consultation, during which a laryngoscopy will be performed – an examination that involves inserting an endoscope into the throat to view the larynx. The doctor may perform a biopsy on suspicious areas of the larynx, collecting samples of the suspicious tissue. Imaging tests should also be requested, the most common being CT scan and general blood tests. Only observation under a microscope by Pathological Anatomy of the material collected in a biopsy of the suspicious laryngeal mass can confirm the diagnosis of laryngeal cancer. Staging is the process by which we determine whether cancer cells have spread from the larynx to other nearby or more distant structures. The information obtained through the staging process determines the stage of the disease, which is essential for planning treatment.  When the diagnosis of laryngeal cancer is confirmed, the next step is to stage the disease through the following diagnostic tests: Cervical and thoracic CT scan;;/ Chest X-ray;;/ Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.;/  Based on the diagnostic tests performed, the staging of laryngeal cancer can be classified as follows: Stage 0 – also called carcinoma in situ, at this stage the cancer is only found in the innermost layer of the laryngeal epithelium;  Stage I – at this stage the cancer presents as follows: Supraglottic – Cancer located on one of the walls of the supraglottis;;/ Glottic – presence of cancer in one of the vocal cords. The other vocal cord moves normally;;/ Subglottic- Cancer located in the subglottis.;/  Stage II - at this stage the cancer presents as follows: Supraglottic- Cancer located in the various walls of the supraglottis and surrounding tissues;;/ Glottic– the cancer has spread to the supraglottic or subglottic floor. The vocal cords do not move normally;;/ Subglottic – the cancer has spread to one of the vocal cords.;/  Stage III – the cancer invades lymph nodes on the side of the tumor but the nodes are smaller than 3 cm;  Stage IV- In this stage the cancer has spread to distant organs. //Treatment// Taking into account the staging of laryngeal cancer, the multidisciplinary clinical team will assess the best treatment to follow.  Options may include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, either alone or in combination.  Stage 0 – the treatment option involves surgery to remove the lesion, preserving the larynx;  Stage I – at this stage and depending on the type of cancer, treatment options may be: -Non-glottic cancer: surgery to partially remove the larynx - supraglottic, partial or hemilaryngectomy - or total laryngectomy and radiotherapy; -Glottic cancer: the same options presented for non-glottic cancer, and/or even performing a cordectomy, that is, removing the vocal cords;  Stage II – in this stage the treatment option is surgery, with or without radiotherapy or exclusively radiotherapy;  Stage III – options include surgery with or without radiotherapy, or radiotherapy alone, or chemotherapy concurrent with radiotherapy (with or without surgery);  Stage IV - Surgery may be performed to control the local disease, but the most common is the use of non-surgical modalities such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, in combination or in sequence.  Carrying out a total laryngectomy causes consequences for the patient, such as stopping speaking and having a permanent tracheostomy, that is, breathing must be done through an artificial hole in the throat, made by the surgeon.  Fortunately, over the years, safe forms of conservative treatment have been developed, that is, those that do not require a laryngectomy to treat laryngeal cancer.  Patients who have had laryngeal cancer may be monitored by an oncologist or otorhinolaryngologist if they have undergone surgery. Patients must be observed in the Otorhinolaryngology consultation where observation of the larynx must be carried out and the tests to be requested are imaging tests and blood tests, depending on the clinician's decision.

Cancer yes mom,"//What is it?// Breast cancer originates in the mammary gland. When normal breast cells age or become damaged, they die naturally. When cells lose this control mechanism and undergo changes in their genome (DNA), they become cancer cells, which do not die when they age or are damaged, and produce new cells that are not needed in an uncontrolled manner, resulting in the formation of cancer. Unlike normal cells, breast cancer cells do not respect the boundaries of the organ, invading surrounding tissues and potentially spreading to other parts of the body. For example, cancer cells can invade nearby lymph nodes, such as those located under the armpit, the nodes at the base of the neck, and the nodes in the chest wall. They can later reach distant organs such as bones, liver, lungs and brain. This process is called metastasis. //Prevention// Early diagnosis of breast cancer, before any signs or symptoms appear, is essential as it increases the likelihood of treatment being more effective and, consequently, enabling a better prognosis of the disease. In addition to reducing mortality, early diagnosis can, in some cases, avoid mutilating surgeries such as radical mastectomy and the use of chemotherapy. You should talk to your doctor about your personal risk of having breast cancer, determining the age at which you should start screening tests for the disease and how often they should be done.  For early detection of breast cancer, it is generally recommended that: After a certain age, which should be between 40 and 50 years old, women should have a mammogram annually or every two years. There is no consensus regarding the recommended age for onset or frequency, this milestone must be decided on a case-by-case basis with your doctor.  Mammography allows you to visualize nodules in the breast, before they can be felt or palpated by the woman, as well as possible microcalcifications. Based on the results of the mammogram, the doctor may ask for it to be repeated and, if necessary, request a breast biopsy.  In addition to mammography, early detection measures for the disease also include breast self-examination and clinical breast examination performed by your doctor.  Breast self-examination should be done once a month, with the best time being the week following your menstrual period. Women should bear in mind that breasts are not the same and that changes may occur due to various factors, such as age, taking contraceptive pills, menstrual cycles, pregnancy or menopause.  If a woman detects anything unusual during her self-examination, she should always contact her doctor as soon as possible.  Learn how to do a breast self-exam.  Regarding the clinical breast examination, the doctor palpates the breasts to look for changes and/or nodules or other signs of the disease, in different positions: standing, sitting and lying down. The doctor may ask the woman to raise her arms above her head, leave them hanging or press her hands against her thighs.  It should be noted that breast ultrasound is not a recommended method for early diagnosis of the breast. //Symptoms// The symptoms of breast cancer are not exclusive to this disease, they can appear in other diseases, such as benign cysts. Just because you have one or more of the symptoms described here does not mean you have breast cancer.  You should be alert and consult your doctor if you have the following symptoms: lump or thickening of the breast or armpit area, detectable by touch;/ changes in breast size or shape;/ I miss my mother;/ changes in the breast or nipple, visible or to the touch;/ nipple sensitivity;/ discharge or loss of fluid from the nipple;/ nipple retraction;/ cracked or flaky skin of the breast, nipple or areola, redness or swelling;/ //Risk factors// Any behavior or condition that increases your risk of having a disease is a risk factor. If one or more risk factors apply to you, it does not mean you will necessarily develop breast cancer. Likewise, breast cancer can appear in individuals who have no known risk factors. The causes of breast cancer have not yet been found, but some risk factors are known. The main risk factors are as follows:  Age It continues to be the greatest risk factor for breast cancer: a 60-year-old woman has an eight times greater risk of developing it in the following 5 years than a 30-year-old woman; 25% of neoplasms occur in women under 50.  Family background There is evidence of familial aggregation of breast cancer in approximately 10% of cases. In half of these, that is, 5%, there are changes in inherited genes that can be characterized in a DNA analysis, if this is decided after a medical genetics consultation. In most cases, they are mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. However, in other cases, familial aggregation is observed but no inherited mutations in susceptibility genes are found. Genetic transmission is suspected in families with more than three young women with breast cancer or in situations where there is a family history of ovarian cancer. The family risk is greater as the number of family members affected. These genetic mutations are generally absent in sporadic breast cancer.  Hormonal factors Some hormonal factors are described as risk factors for breast cancer, such as: early menarche - first menstruation at an early age;/ late age at first full-term pregnancy;/ late menopause;/ not having had children;/ use of contraceptives - slightly increases the risk, but not all studies are consensual;/ use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) - widespread and prolonged use (more than 2 years) of HRT in postmenopausal women increases the risk of breast cancer;/  Proliferative breast diseases Diseases that affect the epithelium of the mammary gland, suspected on imaging but only proven in the case of biopsy.  Food and weight High fat consumption, especially in childhood and adolescence, and excess weight also contributes to an increased risk.  Exposure to ionizing radiation For example resulting from radiotherapy, particularly if it occurs at a young age. //Who should I contact?// If you suspect breast cancer, due to symptoms or a complementary diagnostic test that shows a change, you should go to a Gynecologist, a General Surgeon specialized in Senology or, alternatively, less commonly, an Oncologist. Thinking about your comfort and convenience, the CUF network has formed teams specialized in treating breast pathologies, especially breast cancer. Get to know the CUF Breast Units. Make your contact request so we can follow up from the first moment. If you prefer, you can schedule an appointment through our free line. //Breast cancer subtypes// The breast is a gland that produces milk. To do this, the glandular part of the breast is made up of lobules and ducts. The most common type of breast cancer is carcinoma that originates in epithelial cells. Breast carcinoma can be classified as: -ductal carcinoma- the most common, originating in duct cells -lobular carcinoma- carcinoma originating in the cells of the lobules is called lobular The cells of the ducts and lobules are separated from the other cells of the breast by a membrane, called the basement membrane because it is at the base of these cells. When malignant cells, in addition to proliferating in a disorganized way and not dying, acquire the capacity to invade, surpassing this basement membrane. When this happens, carcinomas begin to include the designation of invasive – invasive ductal carcinoma or invasive lobular carcinoma. If the cancer has not yet surpassed the basement membrane, it is called carcinoma in situ -ductal carcinoma in situ or lobular carcinoma in situ- because it is “in its anatomical place”. There are three proteins whose presence is systematically evaluated in all cases of breast cancer: the estrogen receptor (ER);/ o receptor deprogesterona(RP);/ epidermal growth factor type 2(HER2);/  The evaluation of these proteins allows breast cancer to be subdivided into three main groups: cancer that has the presence of the estrogen receptor;/ cancer that has the presence of HER2;/ cancer that does not have any of the previous proteins, which is called triple negative;/ //Diagnosis and Staging// In the presence of one or more symptoms, the doctor will evaluate your case and may recommend imaging such as mammography, breast ultrasound, and, possibly, a breast MRI. With the results of these tests, and maintaining the degree of suspicion, you may request a breast biopsy. Breast biopsy consists of collecting suspicious breast tissue. Only observation of the breast cells obtained by biopsy and analyzed under a microscope by Pathological Anatomy will determine whether or not you have breast cancer.  Breast Imaging is one of its basic areas in the diagnosis of breast diseases, both benign and malignant, facilitating better diagnosis and subsequent treatment of women with this pathology. Of note is the most recent examination, Tomosynthesis or 3D direct digital mammography, which is a rapidly developing technology that is expected to be crucial in the early diagnosis of breast cancer. Approved in 2011 by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration), studies carried out in 2017 reveal that when performed in conjunction with 2D mammography, it provides: - an increase in diagnostic information of 27 to 30% -a 15 to 20% reduction in false diagnoses compared to 2D mammography alone; -an increase in the diagnosis rate of new breast cancers, 25 to 27% of which 40% were invasive at the time of diagnosis. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, it is essential to know the extent of the tumor in the breast, regional lymph nodes and other organs. This is called staging. The information obtained determines the stage of the disease, which is essential for planning treatment. The number and type of staging exams may vary from case to case. In general, bone metastases should be excluded through bone scintigraphy, liver metastases through liver ultrasound and possible lung metastases through radiography. More sensitive tests can be performed, such as computed tomography (computed tomography) and positron emission tomography (PET). Based on the tests performed, breast cancer staging can be classified as follows: Stage 0 - the cancer is non-invasive, called in situ, as it is in its own location, that is, limited to a very early location. Stage I - the cancer is less than 2 cm in size and there is sometimes microscopic evidence of tumor cells in the lymph nodes in the armpit on the same side. Stage II - breast cancer is larger than 2 cm but there is only microscopic evidence of tumor cells in the lymph nodes in the armpit on the same side. Stage III - breast cancer is greater than 5cm in size and there is evidence of disease in the axillary lymph nodes on the same larger side. Stage IV- breast cancer cells have spread to other organs, calling this phenomenon metastases. Bearing in mind the importance of a quick and accurate diagnosis for the timely start of treatments, CUF Oncologia has organized a rapid response in the event of a strong suspicion of breast cancer. //Breast Cancer Treatment// Breast cancer treatment involves joint work by several specialists who determine the best strategy for each patient. In general terms, it can be said that the majority of breast cancer patients are treated with surgery, radiotherapy and medical treatment (chemotherapy and other modalities). Determining factors for treatment selection are age and pre- or post-menopausal status, disease stage and disease subtypes (as mentioned in point 3, according to the presence of estrogen receptor, HER2 or the absence of any from them). Based on the staging of breast cancer, it is possible to determine the most appropriate treatment: Stage 0 – therapeutic options include surgery and radiotherapy. It may also include the administration of anti-estrogen hormonal therapy, if the cancer shows the presence of the estrogen receptor (ER+); Stage I – therapeutic options include surgery and radiotherapy. It may also include the administration of anti-estrogen hormone therapy, if the cancer shows the presence of the estrogen receptor (ER+). If the presence of epidermal growth factor type 2 (HER2+) is also evident, treatment generally also involves the administration of antiHER2-directed therapy. Chemotherapy treatment may be considered; Stage II - therapeutic options include surgery, radiotherapy and generally also chemotherapy. It may also include the administration of anti-estrogen hormonal therapy, if the cancer shows the presence of the estrogen receptor (ER+). If the presence of epidermal growth factor type 2 (HER2+) is also detected, treatment also involves antiHER2-directed therapeutic administration; Stage III – therapeutic options include surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. It may also include the administration of anti-estrogen hormonal therapy, if the cancer shows the presence of the estrogen receptor (ER+). If the presence of epidermal growth factor type 2 (HER2+) is also detected, treatment also involves antiHER2-directed therapeutic administration; Stage IV – in this stage, treatment is individualized, but necessarily includes systemic therapy, whether with antiestrogen hormonal therapy, antiHER2 targeted therapy or chemotherapy. Breast cancer treatment usually begins with surgery. The surgical procedure used to treat breast cancer must include the approach to the breast and armpit. For the breast it can be of two natures: Conservative surgery – the cancer and part of the breast are removed, leaving the remaining breast unaffected; the surgeon usually also removes the lymph nodes in the armpit. In the case of conservative surgery (also called lumpectomy or quadrantectomy), the woman will then undergo radiation therapy. Mastectomy – the entire breast is removed; usually the surgeon also removes the lymph nodes in the armpit; If the woman wishes, and her clinical case allows it, in the same surgical procedure as the mastectomy, breast reconstruction can be performed immediately by a plastic surgeon. The most suitable type of reconstruction varies depending on the age, the woman's physiognomy and the type of surgical treatment that was used for breast cancer, and breast implants or tissue from another part of the woman's body may be used. The approach to the armpit can be done by dissection - removal of all nodes in the armpit or by the sentinel node technique. Sentinel lymph node test - If breast cancer is confirmed, it will be necessary to perform a sentinel lymph node test, which consists of identifying the lymph node in the lymph node area closest to the lesion to which the cancer may have invaded. To find this lymph node and determine whether it has been involved by breast cancer, a dye is injected into the lesion site, and the lymph node to be removed is the one to which the contrast goes. This test is performed if there is no evidence of lymph node involvement by the cancer to begin with. The removed lymph node will be analyzed by Pathological Anatomy, and if the presence of cancer is confirmed, it will be necessary to remove all the lymph nodes in this lymph node area, a procedure called lymphedenectomy.  Side Effects Surgical treatment for breast cancer may have some side effects, including: increased sensitivity and numbness in the operated area;/ imbalance due to the absence of weight from the removed breast;/ lymphatic edema of the arm on the affected side, which should be prevented by avoiding carrying large loads, wounds or burns; physiotherapy is very useful for preventing and treating lymphatic edema in women who have undergone a mastectomy.;/ Systemic treatment is currently indicated for the majority of patients and may include anti-estrogen hormonal treatment, cytostatic chemotherapy and treatment targeting the HER2 protein. A more detailed description goes beyond the scope of this text due to its length and diversity. Typically, women seek to know the consequences of breast cancer treatment, particularly in terms of physical sequelae and impact on their daily life. You should check with your doctor and nursing team and discuss the various treatment options, adapted as far as possible to your needs.  Side Effects Chemotherapy Chemotherapy, on the other hand, can cause the following side effects: fatigue;/ appearance of bruises;/ temporary hair loss;/ lack of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, sores in the mouth and/or lips;/ Some drugs can affect the ovaries, interfering with hormone production, which can cause symptoms similar to menopause, make the menstrual period more irregular or even suppress it. In some cases, chemotherapy can cause infertility.;/  Antiestrogenic Hormone Therapy Depending on the hormone therapy administered, it may cause the following side effects: confrontations;/ vaginal discharge;/ fatigue;/ vaginal itching;/ headaches;/ nausea, vomiting;/ If the hormonal treatment option is surgery, namely surgical removal of the ovaries, menopause is immediate as are the symptoms associated with it.  AntiHER2 Targeted Therapy AntiHER2 targeted therapy may cause the following allergic reactions during treatment: pains;/ fatigue;/ nausea, vomiting;/ fever;/ chills;/ difficulty breathing;/ skin rashes;/ The use of this type of therapy can cause heart problems that should be evaluated by your doctor using cardiac exams. Radiotherapy treatment requires careful and precise planning, which is why the CUF Oncologia Radiotherapy team has radio oncologists dedicated to the treatment of breast cancer. Radiotherapy for breast cancer is mainly prescribed as an adjuvant treatment (after surgery) with the aim of reducing the risk of recurrence of these tumors. The effectiveness of this treatment has been documented in numerous trials and randomized studies. In order to reduce the toxicities of treatments, the Radiotherapy Unit has a non-invasive guided image system, allowing treatment to be carried out in forced inspiration (DIBH - Deep Inspiration Breath Hold). In selected cases, this technique allows the exposure dose to the lungs and heart to be reduced. //Follow up// International standards recommend the following monitoring: During the first 3 years after treatment: collection of clinical history and clinical physical examination, every 3 to 6 months;/ From the 4th year onwards: collection of clinical history and clinical physical examination, every 6 to 12 months;/ From the 6th year onwards: collection of clinical history and clinical physical examination, annually;/ Monthly breast self-examination and alertness to symptoms of possible recurrence;/ Annual mammogram. If the woman has undergone conservative treatment, the first mammogram should be performed after 6 months.;/ Annual gynecological examination;/ Follow-up by a medical oncologist for the first 5 years after treatment;/ In case of symptoms and not routinely, use chest radiography, bone scintigraphy, liver ultrasound, pelvic ultrasound, blood count, liver biochemistry, and CA 15.3 or CEA tumor markers for diagnosis.;/ ""From my experience, what I take away is that we should not ignore the signs that our body gives us.""

Non-melanoma skin cancer,"//What is it?//  In recent decades, there has been a significant increase in the various types of skin cancer. More than 95% of these skin cancers are not melanoma. The most common are basal cell carcinoma, or basalioma, and squamous cell carcinoma. Skin cells are responsible for the formation of skin tissue. In their normal state, these cells grow and divide into new cells, which are formed as they are needed. This process is called cell regeneration. When normal skin cells age or are damaged, they die naturally. When cells lose this control mechanism and undergo changes in their genome (DNA), they become cancer cells, which do not die when they age or are damaged, and instead produce new cells that are not needed in an uncontrolled manner, resulting in the formation of cancer. //Prevention// You've probably heard that the most effective method of preventing melanoma is avoiding the sun. In fact, excessive exposure to the sun not only causes skin aging, but can contribute to the development of skin cancer, particularly melanoma. Reinforcing this association is the increased incidence of malignant melanoma in people with a history of sunburn in childhood. However, exposure to sunlight in moderation is beneficial. In addition to the psychological effect, sun exposure is essential for the synthesis of vitamin D in the skin. Vitamin D promotes joint and bone health, but it has also been linked to the prevention of certain types of cancer and autoimmune diseases. A healthy person needs 5 to 15 minutes of sun exposure most days, on their hands, arms and face, to produce enough vitamin D. During the winter, you need 2 to 3 hours a week. The required exposure times increase for darker skin types. Neither the use of sunscreen nor the use of protective clothing in the summer (hat, sunglasses or long-sleeved shirt) cause vitamin D deficiency. In cases of vitamin D deficiency, supplements can help. You should never use tanning beds to synthesize vitamin D. Tanning beds are artificial sources of ultraviolet radiation. Their use is associated with an increased risk of melanoma, particularly in people who started using them under the age of 35.  -Stay in the shade: the best way to avoid UV rays when outdoors; -Wear clothes that protect your skin: long-sleeved clothes, pants and hats with brims make all the difference. You can find clothing and sporting goods made with materials designed to limit exposure to UV radiation; -Use sunscreen: with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 or higher. Follow the instructions on the sunscreen label. Reapply sunscreen if you sweat or after each swim. Use sunscreen on sunny, cloudy or grey days, as UV rays are always present. Remember that sunlight reflects off the water, so take extra care when you are at the beach. Do not use sunscreen to increase the time you spend in the sun. UV rays can reach the skin even when we use sunscreen; -Use a lip balm or a broad-spectrum sunscreen cream to protect your lips. However, using higher SPF sunscreens can be misleading. Higher SPF sunscreens may prevent the skin from becoming red, but they do not prevent some of the ultraviolet rays from reaching the skin and causing cumulative damage. There is no such thing as a “full-screen” sunscreen. You should avoid creating a false sense of security when using sunscreen. Using high SPF sunscreens does not justify reducing the amount applied or the frequency of applications, nor should it exclude the application of the other sun protection methods previously described. -Wear sunglasses: with 99% or 100% UV protection. This type of glasses offers greater protection for the eyes; -Do not use tanning beds or UV lamps: these types of equipment expose the skin to UV radiation and are no safer than sun exposure. Additionally, “getting a base tan” in a tanning bed does not prevent sunburn or reduce UV exposure. If you want to look tanned, use products such as self-tanners or tanning sprays.  Self-examination and examination of your family members The importance of self-examination is scientifically demonstrated. It is recommended to do a complete self-examination monthly.  //Symptoms// The main warning signs of skin cancer are: A change in the size or appearance of a mole or wart;/ Appearance of persistent scale or crust over months or years, especially in a place exposed to the sun;/ Wound that does not heal in the usual time despite the care applied;/ Injury that bleeds spontaneously or after mild trauma (e.g. when shaving, combing, blowing the nose or contact with glasses) over the course of weeks or months.;/ Brown or pink pigmentation that extends beyond the boundaries of the skin lesion;/ Itching or pain in a mole or wart;/ //Risk factors// Basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma are associated with excessive exposure to the sun and its ultraviolet (UV) rays. Excessive exposure to UV rays is associated with some risk behaviors: Severe burns, whether or not accompanied by the formation of blisters, especially during childhood (commonly called scalds);/ Spending a lot of time in the sun over many years, whether at the beach, at work or while playing sports;/ Use of tanning beds, which are artificial sources of UV rays;/  There are other risk factors such as: Light skin;/ Skin infection by some types of human papillomavirus (HPV);/ Occupational or medical exposure to X-radiation or arsenic;/ Family history of skin cancer;/ Multiple nevi (moles) or atypical nevi;/  Risk factors combine with excessive sun exposure to significantly increase the risk of skin cancer. //Who should I contact?//  In addition to your family doctor, you should also consult a Dermatologist, a General Surgeon or, alternatively, a less common Oncologist.

Basal cell carcinoma is the most common of all types of skin cancer, with squamous cell carcinoma being the second most common. Most of these carcinomas are treatable with current therapies available to the population.  Actinic keratosis is a skin lesion induced by ultraviolet radiation that can progress to invasive squamous cell carcinoma. It is the most common skin lesion with malignant potential. Its diagnosis and treatment can prevent the occurrence of squamous cell carcinoma. The development of squamous cell carcinoma in skin damaged by sun exposure is a gradual process that manifests itself through a spectrum of lesions of increasing malignancy, ranging from the pre-neoplastic precursor lesion, called actinic keratosis, through squamous cell carcinoma in situ (limited to the epidermis), invasive squamous cell carcinoma (when it reaches the dermis) and, at the opposite extreme, metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. Actinic keratosis is more common in individuals over the age of 55, with light skin and eyes, especially in areas subjected to long periods of sun exposure. Given the risk of progression to squamous cell carcinoma, it is mandatory to carry out early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Treatment of actinic keratosis includes topical application formulations (cream or gel) or destruction of the lesion by applying a chemical that produces a localized peeling effect, by the cold of liquid nitrogen, by laser or even topical photodynamic therapy. In more advanced lesions, surgical excision may be performed. These methods do not exclude compliance with sun protection recommendations such as paying attention to the time of day when you are exposed to sunlight, wearing protective clothing and regularly applying sunscreen. //Diagnosis and Staging// Your treating physician may refer you for a dermatology consultation if you suspect cancer. Many skin changes are not cancer, but only a dermatologist can confirm this.  Dermatoscopia Dermatoscopy (also called epiluminescence microscopy) is a skin assessment technique using a dermatoscope, an optical magnifying device (usually 10x) with its own light source. It is a technique widely used by dermatologists in the evaluation of skin diseases and in particular in the diagnosis of melanocytic nevi (“moles”) and malignant melanoma. It is particularly useful in the evaluation and monitoring of patients with multiple melanocytic nevi that pose diagnostic difficulties (clinically atypical nevi) and especially when there are other family members with multiple atypical nevi and malignant melanoma (dysplastic nevi syndrome).  Microscopia confocal In vivo confocal microscopy is an advanced imaging technique that allows non-invasive study of the skin in real time. This technology allows images to be obtained with a cellular and subcellular resolution identical to conventional histology obtained through a biopsy, but without the need to extract a skin sample. It is a painless technique, with no need for anesthetic procedures and no risks related to radiation. Confocal microscopy is a means of choice for the diagnosis and monitoring of skin cancer treatment.  Digital photographic record of the entire body Full body digital photographic registration is a medical procedure in which the majority of the skin is recorded using digital photographs. These records allow the identification of new signals or even the appearance of changes in existing signals.  Biopsy Based on the results of the physical examination, the dermatologist may decide to perform a biopsy. A biopsy consists of removing part of the skin to be observed under a microscope by a specialist in Pathological Anatomy. It is the only way to confirm the diagnosis of melanoma. Staging is the process by which we determine whether cancer cells have spread from the skin to other nearby or more distant structures. The information obtained through the staging process determines the stage of the disease, which is essential for planning treatment. In addition to the information obtained by diagnostic biopsy, the following tests are used to stage the melanoma: blood tests;;/ imaging tests such as X-rays, CT scans, MRI scans or PET scans.;/ //Treatment// A large proportion of squamous cell carcinomas arise from precancerous lesions, Actinic Keratoses, so timely treatment of these lesions is essential to prevent the development of cancer cells. In these cases, possible treatments are cryotherapy or photodynamic therapy, which consists of applying a chemical to the skin lesion and then exposing it to a special light source (such as laser light) to kill the cancer cells. Another option for low-risk lesions may be topical chemotherapy, through the application of a cream or lotion containing chemotherapeutic agents. Surgery;/ Treatment is surgical and it is very important to be early, including safety margins for a more complete cleaning of the lesions. Mohs Surgery;/ Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) is a surgical technique used in the treatment of malignant tumors of the skin and, more rarely, of the mucous membranes. The malignant tumors most frequently treated by MMS are squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma, but also include dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans and Merkel cell carcinoma. This technique consists of sequential excision of the tumor in thin layers and microscopic observation of the respective margins in fresh frozen sections. This procedure saves healthy tissue, while ensuring total excision of the tumor in a single surgical procedure. It is associated with a high cure rate and is a preferred therapeutic option in the treatment of recurrent tumors, with a high risk of recurrence or located in areas where a minimal surgical defect is desired. Electrocoagulation and Curettage;/ The cancer is removed with a sharp, spoon-shaped device called a curette. This treated area is then subjected to an electric current that controls bleeding and destroys any cancer cells. These procedures are quick and easy to perform. Cryosurgery;/ The treatment involves the application of liquid nitrogen to the area to be treated, which leads to the rapid freezing of tumor cells and their destruction. Laser surgery;/ With this technique, the tumor is vaporized through the application of a thin, concave beam of light. As it is mainly used in neoplasms located only in the outer layer of the skin, this treatment requires stricter monitoring. Radiotherapy;/ It is mainly recommended for treating tumors in hard-to-reach areas or in people at higher risk of complications and therefore not suitable for surgery. In some cases, it is also recommended after surgery, especially in tumors with a higher probability of recurrence. The treatment to be carried out depends on several factors: tumor location;/ tumor size;/ tumor depth;/ your general state of health;/ your medical history;/ if the tumor had already been treated;/ In most cases, treatment is surgical. In some more superficial cases, treatment with photodynamic therapy, CO2 laser, cryosurgery and imiquimod may be possible. In more extensive or difficult to locate lesions, plastic surgery, Mohs surgery or radiotherapy may be necessary. Load more;/ In summer, achieving healthy, tanned skin is a difficult task.

Prostate cancer,"//What is it?// Prostate cancer is currently one of the main cancers faced by the male population, being the most common and the second most common type of mortality. As average life expectancy increases, there is an increase in the incidence and mortality of prostate cancer. When prostate cells undergo changes in their genome (DNA), which do not die when they age or become damaged and produce new cells that are not needed in an uncontrolled manner, they become cancer cells.  //Prevention// Mass population screening is defined as the systematic screening of asymptomatic (at-risk) men and is usually initiated by health authorities. In contrast, early detection or timely screening is a process that begins on the initiative of a man who is being assessed by a doctor. The primary goal of screening is to reduce mortality from prostate cancer while maintaining quality of life. Mortality from prostate cancer varies widely from country to country in the industrialized world. However, mortality from prostate cancer has been decreasing in most Western countries. //Risk Factors// Epidemiological studies have shown strong evidence for a genetic predisposition to prostate cancer, based on two of the most important factors, ethnic background and family history. Genetic studies have identified 100 common susceptibility loci that contribute to prostate cancer risk. A small subpopulation of men with prostate cancer (about 9%) has true hereditary prostate cancer. This is defined as the existence of three or more affected relatives, or at least two relatives who developed early-onset disease, that is, before the age of 55. Patients with hereditary prostate cancer generally have disease onset six to seven years earlier than in sporadic cases. Factors such as diet, alcohol consumption, sexual behavior, ultraviolet radiation exposure, chronic inflammation, and occupational exposure have been discussed as being important in the causation of non-hereditary prostate cancer. However, there is not yet sufficient evidence to recommend lifestyle changes (such as reducing animal fat intake and increasing fruit, grain, and vegetable intake) to reduce the risk. However, such lifestyle changes may be associated with other benefits and should therefore be encouraged. //Symptoms// The symptoms of prostate cancer are not exclusive, they can appear in other diseases, such as benign prostate hypertrophy. Just because you experience one or more of the symptoms described here does not mean you have prostate cancer. You should be alert and consult your doctor if you have the following symptoms: - Presence of blood in urine or semen; - Frequent need to urinate, especially at night; - Inability to urinate, or difficulty starting or stopping the flow of urine; - Weak or intermittent urine flow; - Pain or burning during urination; - Difficulty getting an erection; - Persistent pain in the lower back, hips or upper thighs. //Who should I contact?// If you suspect cancer, due to symptoms or a complementary diagnostic test that presents an alteration, you should consult a Urologist, or alternatively, less commonly, an Oncologist. Meet our team of experts Make your contact request so we can follow up from the first moment. If you prefer, you can schedule an appointment via our toll-free line. The prostate is a gland that is part of the male reproductive system and produces part of the seminal fluid. During ejaculation, the seminal fluid helps to transport sperm (part of the semen or sperm) until it is released outside. The prostate is located below the bladder, near the base of the penis. The urethra connects the bladder and passes through the prostate to the penis. Above the prostate and behind the bladder are the seminal vesicles. Testosterone produced by the testicles causes the prostate to grow. At the end of puberty, the prostate is the size of a walnut. After the age of 40, the prostate may still grow a little, although some men may have a high growth rate of this gland. An enlarged prostate may mean the presence of benign prostatic hypertrophy - an abnormal growth of benign prostate cells - a very common problem in men, or other types of medical problems. If the prostate grows too much, it can reduce or stop the flow of urine by putting pressure on the urethra. Most prostate cancers occur in the epithelial cells of its glandular tissue. This type of cancer is called adenocarcinoma. It usually appears initially in the peripheral area of ​​the prostate. The second most frequent location is in the transition zone. There are also rare prostate tumors that occur in neuroendocrine cells. One of the neuroendocrine prostate tumors is the small cell tumor, and it is treated differently than adenocarcinoma. Over time, cancer cells grow and divide enough to form a tumor. Prostate tumors can grow large and affect the entire prostate. They can also grow through the prostate capsule and invade surrounding tissues. This growth is called extracapsular extension. Some prostate tumors can cause the appearance of new blood and lymphatic vessels in addition to existing ones, in order to receive nutrients to grow. If the prostate tumor invades the blood and lymphatic vessels, it can metastasize, and the most common way is to first affect the bones and lymph nodes. Although treatments can control prostate cancer after it metastasizes, it is not considered curable. //Diagnosis and Staging// Prostate cancer is usually suspected by a prostate digital rectal exam and/or an altered PSA level. Definitive examination depends on histological verification by performing a prostate biopsy or incidental verification of prostate cancer in tissue from transurethral resection or prostate adenomectomy.  Your doctor will usually examine you to check for signs of the disease. The most common exam is called a digital rectal exam and is used to assess whether your prostate is a normal size, whether it is soft or lumpy, or whether it causes pain when touched. The peripheral area of ​​the prostate, where most cancers begin, faces the wall of the rectum. If your doctor feels that your prostate is enlarged, lumpy or hard, he or she will recommend tests that will include a PSA test and will probably refer you for a prostate biopsy.  Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a protein produced by the cells where most cancers begin. PSA is what turns the semen that clots after ejaculation back into liquid, and can be measured by a blood test once part of it enters the blood vessels of the prostate.  A biopsy is the means of confirming the existence of prostate cancer. This consists of removing small fragments of prostate tissue for pathological anatomy analysis. Typically, 12 samples of prostate tissue are collected in order to check the presence of cancer and its location in the prostate. Prostate biopsy is not an infallible method, and therefore there may be false negatives. If cancer is not detected, the patient may need to undergo a new biopsy if prostate cancer remains suspected. Normally biopsies are performed without any complications.  Prostate fusion biopsy improves the prostate cancer detection rate from the current 65% to more than 85%. This method, which uses the images previously provided by 3 Tesla Magnetic Resonance Imaging and merges them with the image provided by prostate ultrasound, makes the prostate biopsy more precise and accurate. Not only does this new technique increase the likelihood of detecting malignant disease, it also minimizes the number of punctures needed in each procedure and reduces the likelihood of having to repeat biopsies. The aim is to offer patients a more effective and efficient alternative, reducing the suffering and potential complications inherent to performing multiple punctures. Staging is the process by which we determine whether cancer cells have spread from the prostate to other nearby or more distant structures. The information obtained through the staging process determines the stage of the disease, which is essential for treatment to be planned. Prostate cancer staging includes Pathological Anatomy analysis of collected tissues, imaging or Nuclear Medicine exams. Bearing in mind the importance of a quick and accurate diagnosis for the timely start of treatments, CUF Oncologia has organized a rapid response in case of strong suspicion of prostate cancer. //Treatment// The extent of prostate cancer is assessed by digital rectal examination and PSA and can be complemented with Bone Scintigraphy, Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (mpMRI) and/or Computed Axial Tomography (CT).  Surgical procedures for treating prostate cancer can be: Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy;/ Video-assisted radical prostatectomy;/   Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) is the most commonly performed robot-assisted procedure in the world. PRAR is indicated in all patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer and with a life expectancy of more than 10 years. Prostatectomy is indicated in patients with localized or locally advanced prostate cancer. The objective of PRAR is to excise the prostate in order to remove the entire tumor while preserving urinary continence. Patients with localized prostate cancer and an intact capsule can preserve erectile function. Preoperative multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging is very important to check the integrity of the prostate capsule and decide whether to perform RARP with preservation of the vascular-nervous bundles in order to preserve erectile function.  CUF Technique An extraperitoneal approach, i.e. before starting the surgery, a space is created below the navel, between the abdominal wall and the bladder, and it is in this space that the surgeon inserts the surgical instruments, allowing the surgery to be performed without contact with the large intestine. With this technique, the post-operative period is even shorter and with less associated pain, which leads to a hospital stay of less than 24 hours. This may be a treatment option if your case does not require surgery. Radiation therapy can shrink or even kill tumor cells. External beam radiation therapy (IMRT);/ Robotic radiosurgery - Cyberknife;/ Brachytherapy;/ Hormonoterapia;/ Chemotherapy;/ Immunotherapy;/ Hormonoterapia;/ Possible side effects of Prostatectomy and Radiotherapy: Erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, colitis Today, robotic radical prostatectomy clearly reduces the likelihood of urinary incontinence and allows full recovery of continence within one month of surgery. Possible side effects of lymphadenectomy Lymphatic edema, venous thromboembolism Possible side effects of hormone therapy and chemotherapy Erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, obesity, hot flashes, increased emotional sensitivity, breast enlargement, infections, vomiting, loss of appetite, fatigue, mouth ulcers, hair loss.  Follow-up of patients after curative treatment In asymptomatic patients, a specific history of the disease and serum PSA determination, complemented by digital rectal examination, are the recommended assessments in routine follow-up. They should be performed at 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment, then every 6 months until 3 years, and annually thereafter. After radical prostatectomy, total PSA should be undetectable (<0.1 ng/mL). A total PSA >0.1 ng/mL after radical prostatectomy is a sign of recurrence or residual prostate tissue. After undetectable total PSA after radical prostatectomy, a total PSA >0.2 ng/mL and rising is associated with disease recurrence. After radiotherapy, a rise in PSA >2 ng/mL above nadir is the most obvious sign of disease recurrence. Palpable nodules and a rise in serum PSA are signs of local recurrence.

Thyroid cancer,"//What is it?// The cells that make up normal tissue grow and divide as necessary, in a controlled manner, with the aim of replacing aged cells and thus preserving the function of the organ to which they belong. During this process, which is continuous, one of the cells may suffer one or more genetic mutations, causing its division to stop being regulated and become excessive, giving rise to a tumor. In malignant tumors, cells may no longer respect the limits of the organ, infiltrating neighboring tissues or giving rise to cell colonies in other organs or structures, a process called metastasis. The thyroid gland has two types of endocrine cells in its composition, which synthesize and secrete hormones, and which can give rise to different malignant tumors: the follicular cell, which secretes the thyroid hormones T4 and, to a lesser extent, T3, and the parafollicular Cou cell, which produces calcitonin. //Prevention and screening// In terms of prevention, from what was said above, it follows the need to avoid exposing the thyroid to radiation, including that used in a medical context, especially in children. This exposure should be reserved for cases in which it is strictly necessary.  For most people, no form of thyroid carcinoma screening is recommended, given the fact that its benefit is doubtful. Carrying out screening tests is only indicated in very specific cases, such as belonging to a family with medullary thyroid carcinoma. //Risk Factors// The best-known risk factor for the development of thyroid carcinoma, especially the papillary type, is exposure of the gland to radiation, especially when this occurs in childhood. There are several syndromes that are associated with  an increased risk of thyroid carcinoma. Also, the fact that there are several close relatives with well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma increases the probability of having a malignant nodule. As mentioned previously, some medullary carcinomas have a familial incidence. //Symptoms// The diagnosis of thyroid carcinoma arises, in the vast majority of cases, following a clinical study of a nodule located in this gland. With the widespread use of ultrasound, nodules are often diagnosed that, due to their small size, are not identified either by the person or during medical examination, that is, they are asymptomatic. However, it is important to highlight that these small lesions, even when they are malignant, have a small impact on survival. A thyroid nodule that increases in size or is associated with symptoms such as difficulty breathing or swallowing or hoarseness is more suspicious and should immediately lead to seeking medical evaluation. //Who should I contact?// The identification of a thyroid nodule should prompt a medical consultation. The specialists best qualified to carry out this evaluation are the Endocrinologist and the General Surgeon, who specializes in thyroid surgery. There are several types of thyroid carcinoma, which are differentiated microscopically (histology or anatomopathological examination), by associated genetic alterations and by clinical behavior. The most common forms of malignant thyroid tumor belong to the group of well-differentiated carcinomas. They originate from follicular cells and present, in most cases, an excellent prognosis, with a survival rate of over 95% at 10 years. They are divided into two main groups: Papillary carcinoma – This is the most common form of thyroid carcinoma, accounting for approximately 85% of cases. Under the microscope, the nuclei of its cells show changes that, although not exclusive to this entity, are typical. From a clinical point of view, metastases are frequently identified in the lymph nodes of the neck.;/ Follicular carcinoma – Represents around 10% of all thyroid carcinomas and, unlike papillary carcinoma, is not associated with the emergence of lymph node metastases.;/  There are other, less common forms of thyroid carcinoma that, as a group,  are associated with more aggressive biological behavior. These tumors include: Medullary carcinoma - It originates from the C or parafollicular cells of the thyroid and, in most cases, has the ability to secrete a hormone called calcitotin which, being able to be measured in the blood, constitutes a very useful marker for the diagnosis, staging and monitoring of this condition. type of tumor. Around 25% of cases are familial, resulting from the occurrence of a mutation in the RET gene.;/ Anaplastic or undifferentiated carcinoma – This is very rare, mainly affecting people over 60 years of age. It is the most aggressive malignant thyroid tumor.;/ Poorly differentiated carcinoma – It presents a clinical behavior that is between that of well-differentiated and undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma.;/ Meet our team of experts Make your contact request so we can follow up from the first moment. If you prefer, you can schedule an appointment via our toll-free line. //Diagnosis and Staging// One of the questions that arises when a thyroid nodule is diagnosed is whether it is malignant, requiring treatment, or benign and therefore eligible, in most cases, for monitoring. The majority of thyroid nodules are benign. It is estimated that only about 5% of people with one or more thyroid nodules have a malignant tumor. In order to identify which nodules are malignant, in addition to a thorough clinical history and medical observation, some diagnostic tests must be requested, the most important of which are: Blood tests to assess thyroid hormone levels – Some thyroid nodules produce hormones in an uncontrolled and often excessive manner. They are called toxic nodules and are only very rarely malignant. The suspicion that we are facing one of these nodules arises from the observation of thyroid function analyses, but confirmation of the diagnosis requires carrying out other tests.;/ Blood tests to assess thyroid hormone levels – Some thyroid nodules produce hormones in an uncontrolled and often excessive manner. They are called toxic nodules and are only very rarely malignant. The suspicion that we are facing one of these nodules arises from the observation of thyroid function analyses, but confirmation of the diagnosis requires carrying out other tests.  Neck ultrasound with assessment of the thyroid and neck lymph nodes – Ultrasound to assess thyroid nodules is a very important examination today. A correct ultrasound assessment allows the nodules to be stratified according to their risk of malignancy and thus, in conjunction with the clinical assessment, identify those that are indicated for aspiration cytology. In order to maximize its diagnostic accuracy, this examination should be performed by doctors with special expertise in this area.;/  Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) – This is a very simple, very safe and practically painless test. It allows, through a simple prick in the neck, almost always performed with ultrasound imaging control, the collection of some cells from the nodule for analysis. In most cases, FNAC allows a diagnosis of benignity or malignancy, with a very low margin of error. It is, however, possible that, even having obtained cellular material for study, this does not allow a certainty to be stated whether the nodule is benign or malignant. In these cases, we say that the cytology is indeterminate and, when the risk assessment is considered unacceptably high, surgery may be indicated.;/ A malignant tumor is characterized by the potential of its cells to go beyond the limits of the organ of origin, invading other structures, locally or remotely. After diagnosis, in order to correctly plan the initial treatment, which is almost always surgical, it is essential to assess the extent of the disease. The diagnostic process that allows us to carry out this assessment is called staging. The most important examination for the initial staging of thyroid carcinoma is an ultrasound of the neck. The aim, especially in papillary carcinoma, is to evaluate the lymph nodes in the neck, which should undergo FNAC if they meet suspicion criteria. Occasionally, other examinations, such as a CT scan of the neck or chest, may prove useful. There are data obtained following surgery, anatomopathological examination, possible treatment with I-131 and laboratory evaluation, which allow the staging to be completed and thus optimize the assessment of the tumor's prognosis. //Treatment// The definition of the most appropriate treatment for each person with thyroid carcinoma must be subject to evaluation and discussion within the scope of a Multidisciplinary Consultation, in which the specialties most directly linked to the approach to this pathology participate, taking into account the type of tumor and its staging. For well-differentiated carcinomas, originating in follicular cells, which constitute more than 90% of malignant thyroid tumors, treatment is based on three fundamental pillars: Surgery, Therapy with radioactive iodine (I-131) and Suppressive therapy with levothyroxine. The need for external radiotherapy or chemotherapy does not arise for the majority of malignant thyroid tumors, although there are situations in which, due to their aggressiveness or poor response to usual therapy, their use is justified. Surgery is, as a rule, the first therapeutic procedure for these tumors. Its extent depends on the stage of the disease. The most conservative (least extensive) surgery, accepted for some tumors considered to be at very low or low risk of recurrence, is thyroid lobectomy with isthmectomy, also known as hemithyroidectomy, which involves removing half of the thyroid that contains the carcinoma. However, for the vast majority of cases, the surgery of choice is total thyroidectomy (removal of the entire thyroid) with removal of the lymph node chains in the neck (cellulectomy) affected by the disease. As thyroid follicular cells have the ability, which is rare in the human body, to concentrate iodine within themselves, treatment with I-131 constitutes a form of radiotherapy directed at thyroid cells which, for this reason, has a low probability of complications. In most cases, the sole purpose of hospitalization is to reduce community exposure to radiation. This treatment should only be carried out after a total thyroidectomy and consists of the oral administration of I-131. The purpose of this treatment is to destroy normal and malignant thyroid cells that were not removed during surgery and to perform a staging examination called body scintigraphy. The aim, therefore, is to improve disease surveillance conditions and reduce the likelihood of recurrence and death from the tumor. This treatment is only indicated for thyroid carcinomas originating in follicular cells, in which the risk of negative events is considered significant. Treatment with radioactive iodine is not useful in tumors in which the follicular cell has lost its differentiation and, therefore, its capabilities (for example, in anaplastic carcinoma) or in medullary carcinoma originating in parafollicular cells. Thyroid replacement, with a dose of thyroid hormone (levothyroxine or LT4) slightly above the physiological level, allows the suppression of TSH production by the pituitary gland, which has a stimulating action on the proliferation of thyroid follicular cells. The use of this strategy may be useful in thyroid carcinomas originating in follicular cells. However, over time, when there is no persistent disease, it is necessary to consider reducing the dosage of thyroid hormone, ensuring the replacement of the gland removed during surgery. Patients undergoing treatment for thyroid carcinoma should be monitored regularly in an Endocrinology Consultation with differentiation in oncological diseases of this gland. Normally patients with thyroid carcinoma are not monitored by an oncologist. Monitoring of differentiated thyroid carcinoma is based on clinical observation, blood tests, which should include the measurement of thyroglobulin, a tumor marker for this type of tumor, and periodic ultrasound of the neck, performed by a doctor with special expertise in this area.

The thyroid is an endocrine gland located at the base of the neck in front of the trachea. It is shaped like a butterfly with a right and left lobe that surround the trachea, joined by a thin piece of tissue called the isthmus. A healthy thyroid is about 2.5 cm long and cannot be felt through the skin. On the back of the thyroid gland are four pea-shaped organs called parathyroid glands. The thyroid and parathyroid glands produce, store and release hormones into the bloodstream. The hormones produced by the thyroid gland contain iodine, a mineral that we get in our diet. There are foods that contain iodine, such as fish and vegetables, and there are foods to which iodine is added, such as salt. The hormones produced by the thyroid regulate the body's metabolism and organ function, having the following functions: Control heart rate, body temperature and metabolism, generally the speed at which food is transformed into energy, memory, among other bodily functions;;/ Control the amount of calcium in the blood.;/ Portugal's largest private cancer care network.

Biliary tract cancer,"//What is it?// Bile duct cancer is one of the types of cancer of the digestive system, and is also one of the types of hepatobiliary pancreatic tumors (liver, pancreas and bile ducts). Epithelial cells are responsible for the formation of the bile duct tissue. In their normal state, these cells grow and divide into new cells, which are formed as they are needed. This process is called cell regeneration. When cells lose their control mechanism and undergo changes in their genome (DNA), they become cancer cells, which do not die when they age or are damaged, and produce new cells that are not needed in an uncontrolled manner, giving rise to tumors called cholangiocarcinoma. Unlike normal cells, bile duct cancer cells do not respect the borders of the organ, invading the surrounding tissues and can spread to other parts of the body. This process is called metastasis. Bile duct cancers are rare diseases, usually diagnosed at an advanced stage and therefore with a poor prognosis. //Prevention// Patients with sclerosing cholangitis or ulcerative colitis should have regular liver and bile duct imaging tests. //Risk Factors// Bile duct cancer can occur in individuals who have no known risk factors. The causes of bile duct cancer have not yet been determined, but some risk factors are known. The main risk factors are: Primary sclerosing cholangitis (an autoimmune disease);/ Ulcerative colitis;/ Bile duct cysts;/ Infection with a bile duct parasite;/ //Symptoms// The symptoms of bile duct cancer are not exclusive, they can appear in other diseases such as lithiasis (gallstones). Just because you have one or more of the symptoms described here does not mean you have bile duct cancer. You should be alert and consult your doctor if you have the following symptoms: Abdominal pain;/ Jaundice;/ Fever;/ Itching;/ Weight loss for no apparent reason;/ Weakness;/ //Who should I contact?// If you suspect cancer, due to symptoms or a complementary diagnostic test that presents a change, you should always go to your family doctor, your CUF Assistant Physician, a Gastroenterologist, a General Surgeon or alternatively, less commonly to an Oncologist. Meet our team of experts Make your contact request so we can follow up from the first moment. If you prefer, you can schedule an appointment via our toll-free line. Although there are no subtypes regarding the cell type of bile duct cancers, there are subtypes regarding their location. Lower bile duct cancers and those in the area where the right and left bile duct bifurcate are called Klatskin tumors. //Diagnosis and Staging// In patients with a clinical history and clinical examination suspected of bile duct cancer, the following should be requested: - General blood tests that include assessment of liver function and the following tumor markers: carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carcinoma antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), which may be elevated in patients with bile duct cancer - Imaging tests that may include ultrasound, computed tomography and MRI; - Endoscopic examinations of the bile duct - the doctor can perform a biopsy of a suspicious lesion, that is, collect cells to be analyzed under a microscope. There are several ways to obtain biopsy material:  Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) - examination that consists of the oral introduction of an endoscope - a flexible tube that allows the doctor to visualize the orifice where the bile duct connects to the duodenum. A contrast substance may be injected into the main bile duct and visualized using radioscopy. The doctor can collect samples of cells from the wall of the bile ducts to be observed under a microscope later by pathological anatomy;;/  Percutaneous cholangiography (bile duct x-ray) – test that involves injecting a contrast substance into the liver, which allows the flow of bile to be assessed as it drains from the liver. The doctor can collect cell samples to be observed under a microscope later by pathological anatomy;;/  Liver biopsy – examination that consists of introducing a needle through the skin to the site of the lesion, through which tissue samples can be collected, usually guided by computed tomography.;/ Only when the material collected in a biopsy from a suspicious mass is observed under a microscope is it possible to confirm the diagnosis of bile duct cancer.  Staging is the process by which we determine whether cancer cells have spread from the bile duct to other nearby or more distant structures. The information obtained through the staging process determines the stage of the disease, which is essential for planning treatment. When the diagnosis of bile duct cancer is confirmed, the next step is to stage it, and the following tests may be requested if they have not been performed to obtain the diagnosis: Abdominal, thoracic and pelvic CT scan;/ Liver magnetic resonance imaging;/ Bone scintigraphy;/ Positron emission tomography (PET scan);/ Often the staging of the disease is only complete after the treatment surgery, through microscopic analysis by Pathological Anatomy of the tissues collected during surgery.  Based on the diagnostic tests performed, the staging of bile duct cancer can be classified as follows: Stage 0- At this stage, the cancer cells are only in the innermost layer of the epithelium that comes into contact with the bile, also called carcinoma in situ because it is in its location; Stage I- In this stage the cancer has spread to the muscle and fibrous tissue that forms the wall of the bile duct; Stage II- In this stage the cancer has spread to the fat outside the bile duct wall or to the liver; Stage III - At this stage, the cancer has spread to the arteries and veins of the liver or regional lymph nodes; Stage IV- In this stage the tumor has spread (spread) to distant organs.   Stage 0- At this stage, the cancer cells are only in the innermost layer of the epithelium that comes into contact with the bile, also called carcinoma in situ because it is in its location; Stage I - At this stage, the cancer has grown throughout the thickness of the bile duct wall; Stage II- At this stage, the cancer has spread to regional lymph nodes or regional organs such as the gallbladder, pancreas, small intestine or other organs; Stage III - At this stage, the cancer has spread to the large arteries and veins of the abdomen; Stage IV- In this stage the tumor has spread (spread) to distant organs.  Bile duct cancer can also be separated in a more practical way according to how it is treated: Localized and operable- This cancer can be completely removed by the surgeon;/ Inoperable or metastatic- This cancer can no longer be treated by surgery and must be followed up by medical oncology.;/ //Treatment// The multidisciplinary clinical team will assess the best treatment to follow, taking into account the stage of the disease, the location of the tumor and your general health status: Localized and operable cancer – the treatment option is radical surgery and possibly radiotherapy; Inoperable or metastatic – the treatment option is palliative surgery and usually chemotherapy. Radiotherapy is used in specific situations.  Radiotherapy for biliary tract carcinomas can be applied in cases after surgery, with the aim of reducing its recurrence.   - Radical surgery for bile duct cancer may consist of the following surgical procedures: Removal of the bile duct - In this surgery, the diseased part of the bile duct is removed. It is a surgical procedure used in cases of early cancer.;/ Partial hepatectomy- This surgery removes the part of the liver that has cancer.;/ Cephalic duodenopancreatectomy (CPD) or Whipple surgery - In this surgery, the head of the pancreas, the gallbladder, part of the stomach, part of the intestine and the bile duct are removed;/ - Palliative surgery or local endoscopic techniques for bile duct cancer may consist of the following surgical procedures: Biliary bypass- Surgery in which the cancer is not removed but in which a diversion or bypass is made to the tumor;;/ Placement of a biliary prosthesis - Placement of a tube in the bile duct that prevents it from collapsing and the patient from becoming jaundice.;/ Patients who have had bile duct cancer may be monitored by the oncologist or surgeon if they have undergone surgery. Follow-up generally consists of observation in consultation, with imaging tests and blood tests usually being requested, depending on the clinician's decision.

Head and neck cancer,"//What is it?// Head and Neck Cancer is a designation used by doctors to group a group of other cancers that are present in the head and neck area, such as: Laryngeal Cancer, 25% of head and neck cancers;/ Oral Cavity Cancer, 42%;/ Oropharyngeal Cancer, 15%;/ Hypopharyngeal Cancer, 6%;/ Nasopharyngeal Cancer, 12%;/ Cervical metastases from occult primary;/ Salivary Gland Cancer;/ Nasal and Paranasal Sinus Cancer;/ Skin Cancer of the Face, Neck and Scalp;/   More than 90% of these tumors occur in people over 40 years of age, although their incidence is increasing in younger people. Unfortunately, many are diagnosed late, which greatly compromises their prognosis. That is why early diagnosis is so important and otorhinolaryngologists play a fundamental role in diagnosing these early-stage tumors as well as pre-malignant lesions in order to allow effective treatment.  //Prevention// There are several ways to prevent head and neck cancer or reduce the risk of developing it, such as reducing tobacco and alcohol consumption and avoiding being affected by the Human Papillomavirus (HPV), among others. However, not everyone diagnosed with head and neck cancer has a specific cause or associated risk factor. Sometimes, the reason why the tumor appears is still unknown. //Symptoms// The main warning signs and symptoms are: Swelling (“lump”) in the neck;/ Voice changes (hoarseness);/ Persistent difficulty or pain when swallowing;/ Appearance of blood in saliva or in the mouth;/ Persistent pain in one ear without ear disease;/ Changes in the skin of the face or neck;/ Other warning signs may be the appearance of white or red spots in the mouth, wounds in the mouth that do not heal, swelling or wound in the jaw that causes poor adaptation or discomfort of the dental prosthesis, chronic infection of the sinuses that does not respond to antibiotic therapy. recurrent nosebleeds, recently established permanent nasal obstruction, persistent headaches, increased volume of the salivary glands or paralysis of facial muscles.;/  In the vast majority of cases, these symptoms do not mean the existence of a tumor, but a careful examination by your doctor is essential to rule out this hypothesis. //Risk Factors// It is common knowledge that there are risk factors for tumors that make some people more at risk than others. The main risk factors for head and neck tumors are: Tobacco – tobacco is associated with the appearance of tumors in the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, nose and paranasal sinuses;;/ Alcohol – people who consume alcohol excessively are more likely to develop a tumor of the oral cavity or pharynx and the risk increases further if these people, in addition to drinking alcohol, also smoke;;/ Papilloma virus (HPV) infection – some strains of HPV can infect the mouth and throat and their presence may be associated with the appearance of tumors in this area;;/ Sun exposure – excess exposure to sunlight is responsible for the appearance of tumors in this area of ​​the body that is normally very exposed (skin and lips);;/ Exposure to industrial products such as wood, nickel and other heavy metals, asbete or previous radiotherapy are associated with a higher incidence of tumors in these territories;;/ A diet low in vegetables and fruits is often associated with an increased risk of developing tumors of the oral cavity and pharynx;;/ Poor oral hygiene – is normally associated with the appearance of these tumors.;/ //Who should I contact?// If you are concerned because you suspect that you have any of these signs or symptoms or because you consider yourself to be at increased risk, then you should seek out a specialist in Otorhinolaryngology or Maxillofacial Surgery as soon as possible. Remember that the success of treating head and neck tumors depends largely on early diagnosis. ACUF Oncology has multidisciplinary teams with extensive experience in the oncology field, capable of diagnosing, treating and monitoring all these situations. Meet our team of experts Make your contact request so we can follow up from the first moment. If you prefer, you can schedule an appointment via our toll-free line. Laryngeal Cancer;/ Located in the area of ​​the vocal tract, its appearance is associated with tobacco use and excessive alcohol consumption. Other risk factors are consecutive exposure to environments with metal dust, asbestos, paint chemicals, etc.  Oral Cavity Cancer;/ It usually starts on the lips or inside the mouth and is often detected at the dentist. It is mainly associated with tobacco use and excessive alcohol consumption.  Oropharyngeal Cancer;/ The oropharynx is the middle part of the throat (the pharynx) and begins at the back of the mouth. The main risk factors are tobacco and alcohol. Another risk factor for the development of this cancer is the Human Papilloma Virus, the incidence of which has been increasing.  Hypopharyngeal Cancer;/ It corresponds to the lower part of the throat, next to the trachea and esophagus. As with most head and neck cancers, the main risk factors are tobacco and excessive alcohol consumption.  Nasopharyngeal Cancer;/ This is the uppermost part of the throat, connecting the mouth to the nose. It also includes the Eustachian tubes, which connect the throat to the ears. Most of these cancers start in the squamous cells that line the nasopharynx. Some lymphomas can also appear in this area, but this is rare. Some types of salivary gland cancer can also start in the nasopharynx due to the presence of minor salivary glands in the throat, but this is also rare.  Salivary Gland Cancer;/ It corresponds to cancer that arises in the parotid, submaxillary or minor salivary glands. They are characterized by the appearance of swellings in these glands, which increase in size. The main etiological factors are tobacco, alcohol, radiation, and a diet low in polyunsaturated fatty acids.  Nasal and Paranasal Sinus Cancer;/ It corresponds to cancer that appears inside the nose, and in the cavities associated with it. The most frequent causes are tobacco, contact with wood dust and nickel. Other causes are chromium, hydrocarbons, viral and genetic causes. There may also be malignant transformation of benign inverted papilloma-type tumors. There is no evidence that chronic sinusitis predisposes to cancer.  Cervical metastases from occult tumor;/ The nodules (swellings) that appear on the neck, which do not disappear after 2 weeks, may correspond to nodes affected by tumor cells originating in the mouth, pharynx or larynx. In adults, 80% of these nodules are lymph node metastases from malignant tumors, if we exclude thyroid pathology. Hence the need to consult your ENT doctor, who will carry out an observation and a fibroscopy, and request an aspiration cytology (“prick”), to define the cause of the nodule.  //Diagnosis and Staging// The diagnosis of head and neck tumors must be made through a careful clinical history, direct observation of the entire suspected territory or using endoscopy of the various regions during the consultation and, when necessary, carrying out laboratory and imaging tests (simple X-ray, CT or MRI) to allow clarification of the situation. When suspicion persists, a biopsy is necessary to fully clarify the situation. Only after the pathologist observes the tissue sample under a microscope can he confirm the presence of cancer cells.  Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing is a routine test for people with throat cancer. HPV-positive patients have a better prognosis for the disease, as the tumor is more sensitive to treatments and is more easily destroyed. This way, it is also possible to carry out less intense treatments with fewer side effects. Staging is the process by which we determine whether head and neck cancer cells have spread to other nearby or more distant structures. The information obtained through the staging process determines the stage of the disease, which is essential for planning treatment.  The recommended tests for staging are: Rx Torax PA;/ Clinical Pathology;/ Electrocardiogram;/ CT Head and Neck;/ CT Chest (stages III-IV);/ Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Neck (possible);/ PET (eventual);/ Endoscopy Alta (if any);/ //Treatment// The treatment or combination of treatments to be carried out depends on the stage of the disease, its location and your general state of health. The main treatment for mouth or salivary gland cancer is usually surgery. Sometimes, radiotherapy or chemotherapy is also used to prevent the cancer from returning.;/  Surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy are possible approaches for people with throat cancer or nasal cavity tumors. There are also specialized treatments for oropharyngeal cancer related to the HPV virus.;/  For people with advanced disease, our experts are prepared to recommend innovative treatments such as immunotherapy and targeted therapies for head and neck tumors. In some cases, there is also the possibility of participating in clinical trials available on the CUF network.;/  Our team of specialists in the field of head and neck cancer pays close attention to the people they care for throughout the treatment process, in order to ensure the care and resources they may need to better deal with possible side effects of treatments. Therefore, considerations for our patients' quality of life are a vital part of the treatment process.  Through our rehabilitation services, we can support people with limitations in speech, voice, swallowing and other possible effects of treatments.;/  The dentistry and maxillofacial surgery teams can ensure your oral health even before starting your treatment.;/ Our goal is to be able to support you in the best possible way before, during and after your treatment plan. The multidisciplinary Head and Neck Cancer team includes specialists in plastic surgery and reconstruction who participate in a coordinated manner in surgeries where their work is essential for a quality result and so that the procedures can be performed in a single surgery. Reconstructive surgery involves transplanting tissue from one area of ​​the body to the affected area using a microsurgical approach. The plastic surgeon transfers a portion of tissue and blood vessels to repair the area from which the cancer was removed. This allows tissues to regenerate and recover properly. After treatment, one of your clinical team's priorities is to continue monitoring your health status, your response to treatments, and evaluating  signs or symptoms of a possible cancer recurrence.  Your doctor will give you instructions on the next steps after the end of treatments, which may include: Periodic consultation with physical examination and review of your clinical history;/ Carrying out the necessary tests to assess a possible recurrence of cancer;/ Identifying, assessing and managing possible long-term effects (both physical and emotional) of cancer and its treatments;/ Discuss with you methods to prevent new health problems and recommendations related to nutrition, exercise and smoking cessation;/ Recommendation for the next appropriate tests for early diagnosis of cancer or genetic testing;/ Portugal's largest private cancer care network.

Brain cancer,"//What is it?// The abnormal proliferation of cells that invade or compress normal tissues constitutes a tumor, thus resulting in bone, meningeal or nervous tissue tumors. Primary tumors of the Nervous System originate in cells of the nervous tissue or meninges. Secondary tumors are tumors that originate from tumors in other organs of the body that spread to the Nervous System, or to the surrounding membranes or bone. Metastases constitute the majority of tumor lesions found in the Central Nervous System. //Prevention// There are no prevention strategies for brain cancer. You should adopt healthy habits and pay attention to any symptoms. //Risk Factors// It is not yet possible to find the causes of brain cancer. However, there are genetic syndromes that can increase the risk of developing a brain tumor. Genetic syndromes associated with risk factors for the development of brain cancer are: - Neurofibromatosis type I or type II - von Hippel-Lindau disease - Tuberous sclerosis - Li-Fraumeni syndrome - Turcot syndrome type I or II - Gorlin syndrome //Symptoms// The clinical complaints and changes in the neurological examination of a patient with a tumor depend on the tumor location.  The tumor can cause cognitive complaints (disorientation and changes in reasoning or language, for example), or motor complaints (difficulties with walking and mobility or coordination of the limbs) and sensory complaints (persistent changes in sensitivity in the body), epileptic seizures, more rarely visual difficulties, headaches and repeated vomiting. It can arise in the cervical (neck), dorsal (thorax) or lumbar spinal cord. And it can be intramedullary or external to the spinal cord, compressing it. The tumor may cause persistent local pain. However, warning signs for the patient and the doctor are the development of a lack of strength and/or sensitivity in the limbs (arms and/or legs).  //Who should I contact?// The hospitals in the CUF network have specialists in Neurology and Neurosurgery on their teams. The Brain Tumor Units in the North and South of the country were also established, within the scope of CUF Oncology's activities, namely in the CUF Infante Santo, CUF Descobertas and CUF Porto hospitals, to respond to more complex cases. These are multidisciplinary teams that include specialist doctors in Neurosurgery, Neuropathology, Neuroradiology, Radiotherapy, Oncology, Neuro-oncology, Onco-Psychology and Palliative Care. Count on a specialized medical evaluation service, carried out by experts in oncological diseases, with administrative support from a dedicated manager throughout the entire process.  The Central Nervous System is made up of the brain (which includes the cerebrum, cerebellum and brain stem) and spinal cord. The brain and spinal cord are bathed in a fluid, the cerebrospinal fluid, and are surrounded by membranes - the meninges. This membrane is externally protected by a covering of bone. The bones of the skull protect the brain and the spinal column protects the spinal cord. Nervous tissue is made up of two fundamental types of nerve cells: neurons, linked in a network to transmit information permanently, among themselves and to the rest of the body, and glial cells that provide them with support. The brain centralizes and controls all the capabilities of thought, language and emotions, but also the bodily functions of motor, sensory or sense organs (such as vision or hearing). The communication pathways between the brain and the body are established and ensured by the spinal cord and the nerve bundles that emerge from it and are distributed throughout the organism, which are the nerves. Meet our team of experts Make your contact request so we can follow up from the first moment. If you prefer, you can schedule an appointment via our toll-free line. //Brain cancer subtypes// Tumors that develop in the Nervous System include primary tumors and secondary malignant tumors originating from other organs. In addition to the morphological microscopic classification without further specification, complementary molecular studies are also carried out, in a selected manner, for each type of tumor, in which some important characteristics are analyzed, not only for the more specific diagnosis of that tumor, but also for establishing the prognosis of tumor evolution, allowing a more informed decision regarding the best treatment to apply. The behavior and potential aggressiveness of primary tumors of the nervous system are due, on the one hand, to the location and consequent initial damage to the nervous tissue at the site where it develops, and, on the other hand, to the risk associated with both increased damage to the nervous system and recurrence (new growth of the tumor after its complete or incomplete removal). The evolution of tumors and the reported risk depend on several factors: Anatomopathological and molecular classification of tumor type;/ Location of the tumor and possibility of surgical removal;/ Responsiveness and tumor control capacity by other complementary treatments (radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy);/ //Classification of Primary Tumors// The international classification of primary tumors of the Nervous System adopted for diagnosis is that of the World Health Organization (WHO, 2016). It includes tumors originating in the meninges (meningiomas), neurons (neuronal tumors) or glial cells supporting nervous tissue (gliomas). This classification is based on the study of surgically removed tumor material and its microscopic (anatomical-pathological) analysis. Meningiomas and gliomas are the most common primary intracranial tumors. Within each of these groups there may be subgroups that are associated with different degrees of aggressiveness or malignancy, classified by microscopic analysis. There are also several intracranial tumors, which do not originate in the nervous tissue, and are specific to the affected structure, for example tumors of the cranial nerves (neurinomas) or pituitary tumors (adenomas) or tumors of the pineal gland or tumors of the bones of the skull or spine. There are around 25% of brain tumors and in 85% of cases they are benign. They are more common in people aged 60 to 80 and in females. They originate in the meninges that surround the CNS, with symptoms associated with the place where they grow and the function of the area they compress. Some are atypical or malignant, developing more quickly Primary brain tumors originate in the CNS itself. Almost always, the primary tumors are gliomas, which grow from the cells that surround and support neurons. There are several types of Gliomas: Glioblastoma Multiforme is the most common and most aggressive type; other types may be Astrocytoma and Oligodendroglioma. -Glioblastomas: These are the most common primary brain tumors in adults (50-60%). They are more common between 60 and 70 years of age, presenting rapid and infiltrative growth of the CNS. -Astrocytomas: These are tumors that can appear in the brain, cerebellum, brain stem or spinal cord. They are of low grade malignancy (slower growing) or intermediate grade, but may over time change to a higher grade. They usually occur in young adults. -Oligodendrogliomas: These are less common gliomas, often slow growing and low malignancy, but their behavior may change over time (or be a more aggressive oligodendroglioma from the beginning). They are more frequent in the third and fourth decades of life. -Ependymomas: They are rare, originating from the cells that line the various interior brain cavities that contain Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF). They are more common in children and young people. They typically arise in the CSF cavities near the cerebellum and brainstem, or centrally in the medulla. They are the most common tumors in children and characteristically develop in the cerebellum. These are malignant tumors that can extend throughout the CNS, but with a good chance of effective treatment. Primary or secondary, lymphomas are generally malignant tumors of the body's lymph nodes and other organs that can reach the CNS, compressing it (especially the spinal cord) or infiltrating it (secondary lymphomas). There are primary lymphomas exclusive to the CNS, usually in the brain. They account for only 2% of brain tumors. They are benign but can be multiple, and in some cases they are familial tumors, associated with other cysts and tumors in the body. They are rare bone tumors that typically originate in the bones at the base of the skull or the lower end of the spine, so their growth interferes with normal CNS functioning. These are tumors that grow beneath the frontal area of ​​the brain, close to the pituitary gland, and can interfere with both brain and hormonal functions. They are frequently diagnosed in children, adolescents and young adults. They are also associated with problems, mainly visual and hormonal, such as weight problems, growth problems or severe diabetes. They are tumors of the pituitary gland, which produces hormones that in turn control several other body hormones such as the thyroid or adrenal gland. They can also compress and compromise vision pathways. They originate in the cranial nerves (e.g. auditory nerve) or peripheral nerves of the body. The complaints arise from its location, in the case of acoustic cranial nerve neuroma, which is the most common, hearing and balance are lost. Acoustic neurinomas at a very young age or bilaterally suggest a hereditary disease – neurofibromatosis Type II. They are more frequent than primary tumors of the nervous system. They constitute metastases (cells that spread and grow at a distance, forming new tumors) of malignant tumors in other organs of the body, and can be located in the bones of the skull or spinal column, as well as in nervous tissue, especially the brain or cerebellum. The clinical complaints they cause depend, as in the case of primary tumors of the nervous system, on the location of the metastasis. Not infrequently, and unlike what happens with primary tumors, metastases occur in more than one location simultaneously, both in the brain and outside it, in other organs and systems. They generally appear at a stage of the cancerous disease in which the initial tumor / originating in another part of the body (breast, lung, prostate, digestive tract, kidney, skin, etc.) is already known and/or is even undergoing cancer treatment. //Classification of Secondary Tumors// These are tumors of the brain, cerebellum or brain stem. The patient may present cognitive complaints (disorientation and changes in reasoning or language, for example), or motor complaints (difficulties in walking and mobility or coordination of limbs) and sensory complaints (persistent changes in sensitivity in the body), epilepsy crisis, visual difficulties, headaches and repeated vomiting. Secondary medullary tumors are more often located in the bones of the spine than in the spinal cord itself. They can appear in the cervical (neck), dorsal (chest) or lumbar region. The growth from the bone usually causes intense persistent pain in the spine followed by signs of compression and malfunction of the spinal cord. The warning signs for the patient and doctor are pain and the development of a lack of strength and/or sensitivity in the limbs (arms and/or legs). - Metastases: are secondary to malignant tumors in different parts of the body and constitute the most common tumors in the CNS. They can affect the bones of the skull or spine and trigger neurological complaints in the brain or spinal cord. These may be due to direct growth of the metastasis within the nervous tissue, especially in the brain, or to compression, for example, of the spinal cord from bone metastases in the spine. They can be single or multiple and the treatment involves combining treatment of the body tumor and treatments aimed at the CNS. //Diagnosis and Staging// In a patient suspected of having brain cancer, tests may be ordered to diagnose the disease. To make the diagnosis, tests that examine the central nervous system are used, such as: Clinical examination and neurological examination- The neurological examination evaluates the function of the nervous system, more specifically: Cognitive functions, coordination, gait, muscle function, senses and reflexes.;/ Visual field examination to see if vision is unchanged;;/ General analysis;;/ Radiological examinations such as tomography, MRI and angiography. Spectroscopy can be performed to evaluate how certain substances that are injected are used by the tumor;;/ Nuclear Medicine exams such as SPECT and PET;;/ Biopsy - it is essential to obtain a small fragment of the lesion to be able to observe it under a microscope and make a diagnosis in relation to the type of cells and the grade of the tumor. This fragment can be obtained through biopsy or surgery.;/ There may be occasions when a biopsy is difficult due to the region where the tumor grows. In these cases, the diagnosis is made taking into account the imaging tests; however, it is desirable to always obtain a fragment for biopsy. Only observation of suspicious cells under a microscope by Pathological Anatomy can confirm the diagnosis of brain cancer. Staging is the process by which we determine whether cancer cells have spread to other structures. The information obtained through the staging process determines the stage of the disease, which is essential for planning treatment. This process is used for most cancers but not for tumors of the nervous system, as they rarely spread beyond the brain. Treatment of brain tumors is based on the following parameters: Cell type of origin;/ Anatomical location of the tumor;/ Tumor remaining after surgery;/ Grau do tumor;/ //Treatment// Tumor images obtained by CT and MRI serve as a basis for making some diagnostic hypotheses according to the location of the tumor and the characteristics of the image in these exams. They are also used to plan the best surgical intervention. Surgery is almost always an important treatment tool. In addition to allowing tumor tissue to be obtained to confirm the diagnosis of the type of tumor, removing the maximum amount of tumor possible is a factor that positively influences the disease and its progression. The decision on the possibility of surgical intervention and complete or less complete removal of a tumor or biopsy depends on the location of each tumor and the corresponding risk of damage, loss of nervous tissue function and neurological deficit. In cases where the tumor is located in areas of great eloquence such as motor or language areas, preoperative MRI techniques such as functional MRI can help to better define the relationship between the location and the brain function at risk.  Functional MRI During surgery, the use of sophisticated techniques for intraoperative marking of tumor tissue with fluorescence products, or electrical stimulation of the areas to be manipulated and preserved, constitute an important resource. In selected cases of patients with tumors in areas that control language functions, surgery techniques can be used with the patient awake. The latter case involves testing the patient's capabilities during surgery while the tumor is removed. Radiotherapy after surgery is indicated in most gliomas, and in some meningiomas, again depending on the grade of the tumor and the extent of surgical excision. The radiotherapy indicated for most cases, whether cerebral, cerebellar, brain stem or spinal cord, is generally focal or stereotactic focal (for tumors too close to very vulnerable structures), divided into several sessions, directed at the tumor area and with a safety margin. Holocranial radiotherapy to the whole brain, even if in a lower dose and sparing more vulnerable structures, is used less frequently, aimed at more extensive tumors, with a high risk of dissemination through the nervous system or with multiple tumor foci. Radiosurgery (with Gamma-Knife, Cyberknife or with linear accelerator) is a form of radiotherapy with a very concentrated dose applied to a tumor focus, with very limited indications in primary CNS tumors. It is mainly recommended for selected cases of meningiomas or neurinomas, or even in some brain metastases. Chemotherapy is indicated in many gliomas, usually concomitantly or after radiotherapy, and consists of taking medications orally (taken by mouth) or by injection, administered periodically and with drugs selected according to the specific type of tumor. The type and number of chemotherapy treatments is initially planned by the neuro-oncologist according to internationally defined standards and the patient's physical condition. During chemotherapy treatments, it may be necessary to adjust the dose or intervals according to tolerance and possible undesirable effects on the patient's body.  nausea or vomiting are generally prevented or well controlled by specific medications.;/  toxic effects on the blood (e.g. anemia, reduction in white blood cells - defenses against infections - and reduction in platelets - increased risk of bleeding) are partly dependent on the doses and the accumulation of treatments, but also on the organism of each patient, and are always monitored by regular laboratory tests.;/ In rare cases of more severe (e.g. more serious infections) or unpredictable (e.g. allergies) drug complications, special treatment measures such as blood product transfusions or inpatient treatment may be necessary. Other effects such as hair loss or infertility, which may or may not be reversible (depending on the treatment), are discussed initially with the patient. During radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatments, patients of childbearing age must use contraceptive measures to avoid pregnancy, as this may be associated with a greater risk of embryo-fetal malformations in the child. Contact one of our Oncology Managers to guide you and monitor you from the start. If you prefer, you can schedule an appointment via our toll-free line. //General Care// Patients with central nervous system tumors often need to take medications that reduce excessive inflammatory reactions and local edema (“swelling” in the CNS), usually corticosteroids. These are useful for improving neurological symptoms and pain. Corticosteroids can, however, have adverse effects that are tried to be minimized whenever possible. There are earlier effects, such as insomnia and agitation (which may benefit from taking the medicine earlier during the day), gastric discomfort (prevented by taking a stomach protector), possible decompensation of diabetes, body swelling and other more serious effects. which include greater vulnerability to infections, skin lesions and osteoporosis over time.  If the tumor is in the brain, it often requires taking anticonvulsant/antiepileptic medications to prevent and treat epilepsy. Of these drugs, those that have less interference with other medications, such as chemotherapy, are preferably prescribed, and it is recommended that the patient and his/her family members monitor for epileptic seizures and undesirable effects. The main adverse effects of most of these medications are drowsiness and dizziness, especially at high doses, but more rarely they can have toxic effects, for example hepatic or allergic. Pain, if any, may involve taking specific pain medications or just taking the corticosteroids mentioned above. //Follow-up// Patients who have had brain cancer may be regularly monitored in consultation by a neuro-oncologist or by a surgeon if they have had surgery, and will be asked for exams, usually MRI.

Cervical cancer,"//What is it?// Cervical cancer is the third most common malignancy in women worldwide and remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related death in women in developing countries.  With rare exceptions, cervical cancer results from genital infection with the Human Papillomavirus (HPV). Although HPV infections can be transmitted non-sexually, most result from sexual contact. Consequently, the main risk factors identified in epidemiological studies are the following: Onset of sexual activity at a very early age;/ Multiple sexual partners;/ Promiscuous male partners;/ History of sexually transmitted diseases;/  HIV infection, for example, is associated with a 5-fold increase in the risk of cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is generally a slow-growing tumor and is preceded by cellular changes called dysplasias, in which altered cells begin to appear in the cervix. //Prevention// Primary Prevention: Introduction of prophylactic vaccination against HPV, within the scope of the National Vaccination Plan (PNV) in 2007. Our country has one of the best vaccination coverage rates in Europe and even in the world, around 87%. Secondary prevention: Carrying out a cervical screening test. Conventional cytology, liquid cytology and the HPV test or a combination of the latter two can be used as screening methods. Recognition of the etiological role of HPV infection in cervical cancer has led to the recommendation to add HPV testing to the screening regimen in women 30 to 65 years of age. However, women who have symptoms, abnormal screening test results, or a macroscopic lesion of the cervix are best evaluated with colposcopy and biopsy. There are two types of screening: -Organized Screening – It is a population-based screening -Opportunistic Tracking – So called because it is the performance of the screening within the scope of a consultation and without a defined frequency  Screening Recommendations: Based on guidelines from the American Cancer Society (ACS), the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP), the American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP), the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the recommendations are as follows: < 21 years: Screening is not recommended;/ 21-29 years: Cytology (Pap smear) every 3 years;/ 30-65 years: Human Papillomavirus (HPV) testing and cytology every 5 years (preferred) or cytology only every 3 years (acceptable);/ 65 years: Screening is not recommended if a previous adequate screening has been negative, and no risk factors are present.;/ //Risk Factors// Any behavior or condition that increases your risk of having a disease is a risk factor. If one or more risk factors apply to you, it does not mean that you will necessarily develop cervical cancer. Likewise, cervical cancer can appear in women who have no known risk factors.  It has not yet been possible to find the causes of cervical cancer, but some risk factors are known. The main risk factors are the following: Human papilloma virus (HPV) infection is the biggest risk factor for cervical cancer. The presence of this infection is highly correlated with changes in the cells of the cervix, which could lead to cancer or other complications. HPV is transmitted through sexual contact with an infected partner. HPV infections are very common, and the vast majority of the adult population will have been infected throughout their lives.;/ Not all HPV subtypes cause cancer, the most dangerous are 16 and 18. The Pap test is essential to detect this infection and the presence of abnormal cells in the cervix. There is a vaccine that protects women from HPV subtypes 16 and 18 and is being administered to young people before they begin sexual activity. It can also be administered to women who have already started, but this should be discussed with your gynecologist.  Have many children;/  Having many sexual partners – the risk increases if sexual partners have had equally many sexual partners;/  Having started sexual activity early;/  Smoking – women who smoke with HPV have a higher risk of developing the disease;/  Age – with advancing age, the risk of developing cervical cancer increases, particularly from the age of 40;/  Taking the Pill for long periods of time: In women with HPV, taking the Pill for 5 years or more may increase the risk of developing cervical cancer;/ //Symptoms// The symptoms of cervical cancer are not exclusive, they can appear in other diseases. Just because you have one or more of the symptoms described here does not mean you have cervical cancer. In general, this type of cancer does not cause symptoms when diagnosed at an early stage, which is why screening for the disease is carried out. However, you should be alert and consult your doctor if you experience the following symptoms: Vaginal bleeding;/ Abnormal vaginal discharge;/ Pelvic pain;/ Pain during sexual intercourse;/  //Who should I contact?// If you suspect cancer, due to symptoms or a complementary diagnostic test that presents an alteration, you should always seek an Oncological Gynecologist. He will carry out a first clinical and imaging assessment, and will forward your case for discussion in a multidisciplinary team, which carries out a personalized assessment, and which will propose the best therapeutic option for each case.

The most common form of cervical cancer is squamous cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, epidermoid carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma. Other rarer types of the disease are adenocarcinoma or small cell carcinoma of the cervix.  Cancer cells may appear only within the epithelium, without invasion beyond the superficial lining, which is called cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) with different degrees of severity according to the shape and size of the cells under the microscope.  In most cases, atypical cells detected on a Pap smear are not cancerous. However, over time and without treatment, atypical cells can develop into cancerous cells: -Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL): these are changes seen in the cells on the surface of the cervix, normally caused by HPV infections (human papilloma virus). In most cases, these lesions disappear on their own over time, even without treatment. However, they can sometimes develop into a high-grade lesion (HSIL), increasing the risk of degenerating into cervical cancer. Its incidence is higher in young women;  -High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL): although not considered cancer, these lesions can develop into cervical cancer if left untreated. Pre-cancerous cells are only on the surface of the cervix, so treatment at this stage is essential. //Diagnosis and Treatment// If a woman has symptoms or has a Pap test result that identifies the presence of pre-malignant cells or cancer, the doctor will use the following tests to obtain a diagnosis: Colposcopy: the doctor uses equipment – ​​a colposcope – that allows you to view the cervix, obtaining enlarged images of it.;/ Biopsy: the doctor performs local anesthesia and collects tissue samples.;/ There are several types of biopsy: -Endocervical curettage: the doctor uses an instrument - the curette - to scrape a sample of tissue from the cervical canal. Alternatively, a soft brush can be used instead of the curette; -Punch biopsy: the doctor uses a hollow, sharp device to collect small samples of cervical tissue; -LEEP: the doctor uses an electrode that, through low voltage and high frequency electrical energy, allows a small fraction of tissue to be cut; - Cone biopsy or conization: the doctor collects a cone-shaped tissue sample, allowing the Pathological Anatomy to analyze the existence of atypical cells in the tissue below the surface of the cervix. Cone biopsy can also be used to remove a pre-cancerous lesion. Only observation under a microscope by Pathological Anatomy of the cells collected through biopsy can confirm the diagnosis of cervical cancer. Staging is the process by which we make sure whether cancer cells have spread from the cervix to other nearby or more distant structures. The information obtained through the staging process determines the stage of the disease, which is essential for treatment planning. If the biopsy diagnoses cervical cancer, staging must be done through clinical observation and imaging tests such as pelvic MRI, computed tomography and ultrasound. Based on the tests performed, the staging of cervical cancer can be classified as follows: Stage I - Carcinoma limited to the cervix;/ IA- Preclinical carcinoma (histological diagnosis only) IA1- Stromal invasion ≤ 3 mm in depth and ≤ 7 mm in extensionIA2- Stromal invasion > 3 mm and ≤ 5 mm in depth and ≤ 7 mm in extension. IB- Clinical lesions limited to the neck or preclinical with dimensions greater than stage IA.IB1- Clinically visible carcinoma measuring ≤ 4cm IB2- Clinically visible carcinoma > 4cm Stage II-Carcinoma extends beyond the colon,;/ but does not reach the pelvic wall, nor the lower 1/3 of the vagina IIA- Tumor involves up to the upper 2/3 of the vagina, without obvious infiltration of the parametrium IIA1- Clinically visible carcinoma ≤ 4cm, without parametrium involvement IIA2- Clinically visible carcinoma > 4cm, without parametrium involvement IIB- Carcinoma infiltrates the parametrium, without reaching the pelvic wall Stage III-Carcinoma extends to the pelvic wall and/or invades the lower 1/3 of the vagina, and/or hydronephrosis or non-functioning kidney (unless another cause is known);/ IIIA- Invasion of the lower 1/3 of the vagina, without reaching the pelvic wall IIIB- Extension to the pelvic wall, and/or hydronephrosis, and/or non-functioning kidney Stage IV – Carcinoma extends beyond the pelvis, and/or invades the mucosa of the bladder and/or rectum;/ IVA- The tumor invades the mucosa of the bladder and/or rectum IVB- Distant metastases //Treatment// Stadium 0 (in Situ): Carcinoma in situ is treated with local ablative or excisional measures, such as cryosurgery, laser ablation, laser conization and diathermic loop excision. Excision is preferred as it allows further pathologic evaluation to rule out microinvasive disease. After treatment, these patients require lifelong surveillance. IA1 Stadium The treatment of choice for stage IA1 disease is surgery. Total hysterectomy, radical hysterectomy, and conization are accepted procedures. Lymphadenectomy (removal of lymph nodes) is not necessary if the depth of invasion is less than 3 mm and there is no lymphovascular invasion. Selected patients with stage IA1 disease, without invasion of the lymphovascular space, who wish to maintain fertility, can be treated by conization, but with strict monitoring, including cytology, colposcopy and endocervical curettage.  Internship IA2, IB or IIA For patients with stage IB or IIA disease, there are two treatment options: External radiotherapy combined with brachytherapy Chemoradiotherapy Radical hysterectomy with bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy Radical trachelectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy may be indicated for fertility preservation in women with stage IA2 and stage IB1 disease whose lesions are ≤ 2 cm. The main problems with pregnancy after trachelectomy are premature labor and the need to undergo a cesarean section for delivery.   Stage IIB, III or IVA The results of well-conducted prospective randomized clinical trials have demonstrated a dramatic improvement in survival when chemotherapy is combined with radiation therapy. Consequently, the use of cisplatin-based chemotherapy in combination with radiation has become the standard of care for patients with locally advanced cervical cancer. There are two types of radiotherapy treatment for cervical cancer: - External radiation: radiation is administered through a large device that focuses the radiation beam on the area to be treated with high precision. In most cases, women undergo 5 sessions per week, for 5 to 7 weeks, without needing to be hospitalized; - Intracavitary radiotherapy: radiation is administered by placing implants containing a radioactive substance in the vagina; the treatment may last just a few hours or up to 3 days, after which the implants are removed; this type of treatment requires the woman to be admitted to hospital and protective measures are taken to prevent other people from being unduly exposed to radiation. It may be necessary to repeat the treatment, which may be carried out two or more times over a period of several weeks. The goal of cervical cancer surgery is to remove all cancer cells. This may include Conization (removal of a cone from the cervix), Hysterectomy (in which the uterus and cervix are completely removed), or a Trachelectomy (which partially removes the cervix but retains the body of the uterus). During cervical cancer surgery, some lymph nodes in the pelvis may also be removed. Chemoradiotherapy Chemoradiotherapy is a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Chemotherapy destroys cancer cells, and radiation therapy uses ionizing radiation to damage the DNA of cancer cells, causing them to die. Chemoradiotherapy for cervical cancer involves giving external beam radiotherapy and/or internal radiotherapy (brachytherapy) at the same time as a course of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy may be used to treat some patients with locally advanced cervical cancer or as palliative treatment for metastatic disease. Radiotherapy can be used in cervical carcinoma as a definitive (single) treatment with the aim of eradicating the tumor, or as an adjuvant treatment (after a surgical intervention), in association or not with Chemotherapy. In selected cases there may be an indication to complete treatments using Intra-cavity Brachytherapy. The most used technique is Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy or Arc Therapy (IMRT/VMAT), which allows the radiation beam to be shaped and healthy tissues to be spared, thus reducing treatment toxicities. Targeted therapies are drugs that block specific cancer cell signaling pathways that encourage them to grow. The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor bevacizumab prevents tumors from stimulating the growth of blood vessels, depriving them of the oxygen and nutrients they need to continue growing. Cervical cancer treatment varies depending on the stage of the disease. For early invasive cancer, surgery is the treatment of choice. In more advanced cases, radiation combined with chemotherapy is the current standard of care. In patients with disseminated disease, chemotherapy or radiation therapy provides palliation of symptoms. Cervical cancer treatment requires a multidisciplinary approach. CUF's multidisciplinary team encompasses Gynecological Oncology, Medical Oncology, Radiotherapy, Anatomy-Pathology and Imaging. Because cervical cancer often affects women of childbearing age, fertility-preserving surgery is an important option to consider. Women who wish to preserve their fertility and have stage IA1 cervical cancer without lymphovascular invasion may be treated with conization or simple trachelectomy. In stage IA2, they may undergo conization or radical trachelectomy (in which most of the cervix is ​​removed along with the upper part of the vagina) with excision of the pelvic lymph nodes (pelvic lymphadenectomy). Stage IB1 cancers <2 cm in size can be treated with radical trachelectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy, while stage IB1 tumors >2 cm in size may require presurgical (neoadjuvant) treatment with chemotherapy before surgery. It is important to understand that fertility-sparing surgery for early-stage cervical cancer remains an experimental treatment; your doctor will explain in detail the pros and cons of the available options. Fertility preservation surgery is only offered to women who express a strong desire to become pregnant; if your desire to have children has already been fulfilled, radical surgery is considered the best treatment option. After finishing treatment, your doctor will schedule follow-up appointments. During these consultations, a clinical examination will be carried out, which will include an examination of the pelvic and rectal areas. Imaging tests such as a CT scan or pelvic MRI or PET/Scan may be requested. Even if you have received the best treatment available at the time of diagnosis, there is always a chance that the cancer will come back. This condition, called recurrence, occurs most often in the first few years after treatment, so a typical follow-up program includes visits every 3–6 months for the first 2 years after treatment, then every 6–12 months after 3 years, and annually after 5 years. In case of recurrence, the treatment that will be proposed will depend on the extent of the recurrence and the type of treatment already carried out. When the tumor appears as a recurrence in a single location in the pelvis after primary surgery, radiotherapy or pelvic exenteration (removal of the bladder, part of the intestine, ovaries, uterus, cervix and vagina) may be used.

Colon and rectal cancer,"//What is it?// Colon cancer and rectal cancer are two of the most common types of cancer in men and women. Cancer that starts in the colon is called colon cancer and cancer that starts in the rectum is called rectal cancer. Cancer that affects any of these organs can also be called colorectal cancer. The difference between the colon and rectum lies in the anatomical location and the need for different treatment, however, the tumor biology is the same.  Colon and rectal cancer often begins in a polyp, which is an anomalous growth of epithelial tissue in the wall of the intestine. Not all polyps turn into cancer. Polyps can be removed before they become malignant. If malignant cells are identified in the removed polyp but do not invade other layers of the organ, the patient may be cured. When polyps are not removed and transform into cancer, the tumor cells can invade the various layers of the organ and spread throughout the body. This process is called metastasis. The colon and rectum, known as the large intestine, are part of the digestive tract. The colon measures approximately 1.5 meters and is made up of 5 parts: ascending, transverse, descending, sigmoid and rectum colon. The colon wall has 5 layers. The innermost layer that comes into contact with feces is called the mucosa. Mucosa has three types of tissue: epithelial, connective and muscular. The next layer is the submucosa, which has connective tissue and vessels. The third layer is muscular, the fourth is subserous and is made up of connective tissue, and the fifth is aserous. //Prevention// Preventing colorectal cancer fundamentally involves adopting healthy habits and carrying out tests for the early detection of polyps or lesions in the colon and rectum. According to international recommendations, early diagnosis should begin from the age of 50. However, the right time depends on each person's individual risk of developing the disease, so your doctor should evaluate your specific case and determine when to start this routine. Three types of tests are normally used for the early diagnosis of cancer. of the colon and rectum: Total colonoscopy - this is the most complete exam as it allows you to view the entire rectum and colon; colonoscopy consists of introducing a tube through the anus – a colonoscope – which allows the doctor to see inside and look for polyps and possible lesions; if polyps are detected, the doctor will perform a polypectomy, that is, remove the polyps found for later analysis;;/ Flexible sigmoidoscopy – this examination only visualizes the rectum and the lower part of the colon, i.e. the sigmoid colon; it involves inserting a tube through the anus – a sigmoidoscope – which allows the doctor to see inside and look for polyps and any lesions; if polyps are detected, they are removed for later analysis, as in a total colonoscopy;;/ Fecal occult blood test – it is an indirect test to find signs of cancer and not the lesion itself; Polyps can bleed, so the presence of blood can be an important indicator and if found, a colonoscopy should be performed. However, other benign pathologies, such as hemorrhoids, may be the cause of the presence of blood.;/ There are other complementary tests for the early diagnosis of colorectal cancer, such as barium enema and CT colonography. //Symptoms// The symptoms of colon and rectal cancer are not exclusive, they can appear in other diseases. Just because you have one or more of the symptoms described here does not mean you have colon and rectal cancer.  You should be alert and consult your doctor if you have the following symptoms: - Diarrhea or constipation - Feeling that the intestines are not completely empty after having a bowel movement - Blood in the stool - Stools of different consistency - Pain or discomfort from cramps, feeling bloated or gassy - Sudden weight loss for no apparent reason - Extreme fatigue without any apparent cause - Nausea or vomiting //Risk factors// If one or more risk factors apply to you, it does not mean that you will necessarily develop colon and rectal cancer. Likewise, colon and rectal cancer can appear in individuals who have no known risk factors. It has not yet been possible to find the causes for colon and rectal cancer, but some risk factors are known.  The main risk factors are the following: - Age- The risk of colon and rectal cancer increases with age. About 90% of cancer patients are over 50 years old. The average age of diagnosis for colon and rectal cancer is 72 years. - Colon polyps- Not all polyps are the same. They all grow from the mucosa, but differ in size, shape and appearance. The chance of having or developing cancer in a polyp depends on the type of polyp. The three types are: Hyperplastic polyps- These have rapidly growing cells, appear at the end of the colon and rarely contain or develop cancer;;/ Adenomatous polyps or adenomas- They have cells that look different from normal colon cells and are the most common. Most do not contain or develop cancer, but most cancer polyps begin as adenomas. Your risk of developing cancer in adenomas is high if you have more than 3 adenomas, if they are larger than 4 cm and/or if they look like a cauliflower (villous adenoma);;/ Inflammatory polyps - These rarely have or develop cancer and appear in the context of inflammatory bowel diseases.;/ -Inflammatory bowel disease- Patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease have a higher risk of colon or rectal cancer. -Personal history of cancer- A patient who has had colon or rectal cancer, even if they do not show any evidence of disease, has a greater risk of having the disease again. There are other cancers linked to colon and rectal cancer, related to a genetic syndrome, which are cancers of the uterus, pancreas and ovary. -Family history-If a first or second degree relative had this type of cancer, your risk is greater for having this disease. The risk is higher if several family members have had colon and rectal cancer, and if they had the disease at a young age. -Lynch Syndrome- Two out of every 100 patients with colon and rectal cancer have Lynch Syndrome. The average age of colon and rectal cancer in these patients is 44 years. This syndrome is also known as hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer, in order to distinguish it from colon cancer in familial adenomatosis polyposis. Familial adenomatous polyposis is rare, patients have cancer at age 40, and represents only 1% of colon cancer cases. During colonoscopy in these patients, hundreds of polyps can be seen. -Diet- Some studies suggest that a diet poor in fruits and vegetables, calcium and fiber, and rich in fat, may constitute a risk factor, although this is not unequivocally established. -Smoking- Tobacco consumption is considered a risk factor, as it increases the likelihood of developing polyps in the intestine. //Who should I contact?// If you suspect cancer, due to symptoms or a complementary diagnostic test that presents an alteration, you should go to a Gastroenterologist, a General Surgeon or alternatively, less commonly, an Oncologist.  If you need help you can also contact one of our oncology managers.  The CUF Lisbon Hospitals (Hospital CUF Descobertas and Hospital CUF Tejo) are recognized by the Ministry of Health as a Reference Center for the treatment of rectal cancer. These centers are considered to be highly differentiated and high-quality entities for the treatment of certain diseases or more complex procedures. The Rectal Cancer Reference Center is managed by the Colorectal Cancer Unit of CUF Oncology. A pathology unit, made up of a multidisciplinary team specialized in malignant tumors of the colon and rectum.

Colorectal cancer is almost always adenocarcinoma, that is, a carcinoma originating in the glandular epithelium of the colon, and division into subtypes has not been carried out. //Diagnosis and Staging// In a patient with a clinical history and clinical examination with suspected colon and rectal cancer, some tests should be requested to confirm or rule out this suspicion. In addition to colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy, additional tests such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging may also be requested. However, the effective diagnosis of colon and rectal cancer is only possible by analyzing under a microscope, through Pathological Anatomy, polyps or samples of lesions resulting from their collection through colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy. Staging is the process by which we assess whether cancer cells have spread from the colon or rectum to other nearby or more distant structures. The information obtained through the staging process determines the stage of the disease, which is essential for planning treatment. Tests to stage colon and rectal cancer may include: total colonoscopy – if it was not carried out during the diagnosis phase; is performed to detect signs of other synchronous cancer(s) throughout the organ;;/ CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis – allows you to check whether the cancer has metastasized to the liver, lungs or other organs.;/ MRI of the rectum (for rectal cancer): allows the depth of the cancer to be assessed in the different layers of the rectal wall, and whether or not the lymph nodes in the vicinity of the rectum have already been invaded by the cancer.;/ endorectal ultrasound (for rectal cancer) – consists of introducing a probe through the anus and allows, if necessary, to complement the rectal MRI information: assess the depth of the cancer in the different layers of the rectal wall, and the status of the local lymph nodes -regional.;/ Sometimes, it is only possible to conclude the local staging of the disease unequivocally after surgery to remove the tumor and detailed analysis of it by Pathological Anatomy.  Based on the diagnostic tests performed, staging allows colon or rectal cancer to be classified as follows: Stage 0 – The cancer has not spread beyond the basement membrane, and is considered in situ, that is, it is confined to its site and has not invaded nearby tissues (in fact, it does not yet meet the criteria for “malignancy”); Stage I – The cancer has invaded the submucosa or muscularis; Stage II– The cancer has invaded the serosa or organs neighboring the colon; Stage III- The cancer has invaded surrounding lymph nodes of the colon; Stage IV – Cancer has metastasized to distant organs Bearing in mind the importance of a quick and accurate diagnosis for the timely start of treatments, CUF Oncologia has organized a rapid response in the event of a strong suspicion of colorectal cancer. //Treatment// The multidisciplinary clinical team will decide the best treatment to follow, after an individual assessment of each case. However, in general, the recommendations for each stage are: Stage 0 and I– in these stages the treatment option is generally surgery; Stage II – at this stage the treatment option is generally surgery, and systemic therapy (chemotherapy) may be applied in addition to surgery; in the case of rectal cancer, radiotherapy may also be indicated; Stage III – therapeutic options include surgery and chemotherapy; in the case of rectal cancer, radiotherapy may also be indicated; Stage IV – at this stage, treatment is very variable, with therapeutic plans being completely individualized. Surgical procedures for treating colon and rectal cancer can be: -laparoscopic surgery- consists of the introduction of a laparoscope and surgical instruments through small cuts in the abdomen (between 5 and 10 mm), allowing to reduce the trauma of the entire intervention, with numerous advantages for the patient, both from the point of view of recovery whether from the point of view of oncological control (due to less aggression to the defense/immune system); the part of the colon or rectum that contains the cancer and any affected lymph nodes are removed; Sometimes, other organs, or parts thereof, may also be removed if they contain branches (metastases) of the cancer (for example, a part of the liver). -robotic surgery – similar to laparoscopic surgery, with the advantage of increasing the surgeon’s precision and safety; This translates, especially in the case of rectal cancer, into fewer post-surgical sequelae: less anal and urinary incontinence, less sexual dysfunction and less need for permanent ostomies (that is, less need to place a “bag” on the belly to evacuate ); at the same time, the control of oncological disease appears to be better (i.e., a greater probability of curing cancer). -open surgery – a more or less long incision is made in the abdomen to access the abdominal cavity; it is used for the same purpose as laparoscopic surgery or robotic surgery; it is more aggressive and seems to result in more after-effects but is sometimes still necessary. When surgery to treat cancer involves removing part of the colon or rectum, whenever possible the surgeon connects the normal parts of the intestine to ensure normal intestinal transit. When this situation is not possible, the surgeon will perform a colostomy. A colostomy is a surgical procedure that consists of creating an opening in the abdominal wall – a stoma – connecting the upper part of the intestine to the outside, placing an outer bag to collect the feces that are expelled by the body through this opening . Typically, a colostomy is only necessary until surgical healing of the colon or rectum is complete, after which the surgeon reconnects the intestine and closes the stoma. However, in some cases, a colostomy may be necessary permanently, particularly in certain cases of rectal cancer very close to the anus; Fortunately, and thanks to currently available technology, this situation is increasingly rare. Radiotherapy in colorectal carcinoma is generally used with the aim of reducing the risk of local recurrence. It is usually indicated as neo-adjuvant treatment (before surgical intervention) in association with Chemotherapy, with the aim of tumor reduction and reducing the likelihood of definitive colostomy. Around 15 to 20% of tumors show a complete response, and active surveillance in these cases can be considered in the context of a clinical trial. Patients who have had colon or rectal cancer should be monitored by an oncologist, gastroenterologist or surgeon. Monitoring may include control colosnoscopy, CEA marker, Computed Tomography, among others. Count on a specialized medical evaluation service, carried out by experts in oncological diseases, with administrative support from a dedicated manager throughout the entire process.

Esophageal cancer,"//What is it?// Esophageal cancer is one of the types of cancer of the digestive system. The epithelial cells of the esophagus are responsible for the formation of the mucosal tissue of the esophagus. In their normal state, these cells grow and divide into new cells, which are formed as they are needed; this process is called cell regeneration.  When cells lose their control mechanism and undergo changes in their genome (DNA), they become cancer cells, which do not die when they age or are damaged, and produce new cells that are not needed in an uncontrolled manner, resulting in the formation of cancer.  Unlike normal cells, esophageal cancer cells do not respect the organ's borders, invading surrounding tissues and can spread to other parts of the body. This process is called metastasis. //Prevention// There are no prevention or screening strategies for esophageal cancer. //Risk factors// Any behavior or condition that increases your risk of developing a disease is a risk factor. Just because one or more risk factors apply to you, it does not necessarily mean that you will develop esophageal cancer. Likewise, esophageal cancer can occur in people who have no known risk factors.  The causes of esophageal cancer have not yet been determined, but some risk factors are known. The main risk factors are:  Excessive alcohol consumption- consuming more than 3 alcoholic drinks per day increases the risk of developing squamous esophageal cancer. Combining excess alcohol with tobacco considerably increases the risk.;/  Smoking;/  Gastric reflux – very common, gastric reflux is the abnormal movement of acid from the stomach into the esophagus and can cause burning. The acid can damage the tissues of the esophagus, so prolonged gastric reflux over time (years) can lead to the development of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.;/  Barrett's esophagus - This premalignant condition involves the transformation of the glandular epithelium at the end of the esophagus into a different epithelium that is more similar to that of the intestine. The cells in this epithelium are more likely to transform into cancer cells. Gastric reflux can cause Barrett's esophagus and most people are unaware that they have it. The combination of gastric reflux and Barrett's esophagus is a greater risk factor than gastric reflux alone.;/  Age – is the main risk factor for esophageal cancer. The incidence points to the diagnosis of the disease around the 6th and 7th decade of life.;/  Being male – men have 3 times more risk of developing esophageal cancer than women.;/  Being of black race;/  Obesity;/ //Symptoms// Esophageal cancer symptoms are not exclusive, they can appear in other diseases. Just because you have one or more of the symptoms described here does not mean you have esophageal cancer.  You should be alert and consult your doctor if you have the following symptoms: Pain or difficulty swallowing;/ Weight loss;/ Food regurgitation;/ Chest or back pain;/ Prolonged cough and/or hoarseness;/ Indigestion;/ Burning sensation (heartburn);/ //Who should I contact?// If you suspect cancer, due to symptoms or a complementary diagnostic test that presents an alteration, you should consult a Gastroenterologist, a General Surgeon or alternatively, less commonly, an Oncologist. Meet our team of experts Make your contact request so we can follow up from the first moment. If you prefer, you can schedule an appointment via our toll-free line. There are two types of esophageal cancer that account for 98% of all cases, both diagnosed and treated in the same way:  Squamous, squamous cell, epidermoid, spinocellular or squamous cell carcinoma in which the cells originate from the stratified epithelium, this disease is more frequent in the cervical and thoracic anatomical parts;  Adenocarcinoma is a cancer of the esophagus that originates in the epithelial cells of a glandular layer in the abdominal part of the esophagus, next to the stomach.  However, the epidemiology is different. In the last 30 years there has been a change in the dominant histological type between squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, which is currently more frequent. The incidence of esophageal cancer increases with age, and on average, adenocarcinoma preferentially affects the age group of 50 to 60 years, on average 10 years earlier than squamous cell carcinoma.  In the Western world, the incidence by sex is also different between the two types of esophageal cancer, with squamous cell carcinoma being 3 to 4 times more frequent in males, while adenocarcinoma has an even higher incidence, being around 6 to 8 times more frequent in men. //Diagnosis and Staging// In a patient suspected of having esophageal cancer, tests may be requested to diagnose the disease. In a patient with a clinical history suspected of esophageal cancer, an upper digestive endoscopy should be performed. This procedure consists of introducing an illuminated tube – endoscope – through the patient's mouth or nose using local anesthesia. If the doctor finds a suspicious lesion, he will simultaneously perform a biopsy, that is, a tissue collection for later analysis. Only observation of suspicious cells under a microscope by Pathological Anatomy can confirm the diagnosis of esophageal cancer. Staging is the process by which we determine whether cancer cells have spread from the esophagus to other nearby or more distant structures. The information obtained through the staging process determines the stage of the disease, which is essential for planning treatment. Once the diagnosis of esophageal cancer is confirmed, the next step is to stage it. Oesophageal cancer, due to the nature of the organ's location in the thoracic cavity close to several important structures, such as the trachea, bronchi, heart and large vessels, requires a complex staging process, with the following tests being carried out: Bronchoscopy - This procedure consists of introducing a tube with a camera through the trachea and bronchi, similar to an upper digestive endoscopy. Biopsies of suspicious lesions may be necessary, possible by inserting a needle through the microscope;;/ Computerized Axial Tomography and/or Magnetic Resonance Imaging;;/ Echoendoscopy - this examination consists of introducing a tube - endoscope - through the throat with an ultrasound probe at its end, which allows the extension of the tumor in the esophageal wall to be assessed by emitting ultrasound; if an injury is suspected, the doctor may collect tissue for analysis by inserting a needle into the endoscope;;/ PET scan - is an exam in which sugar molecules are injected into the bloodstream and the presence of cancer and metastases is detected using equipment; as cancer cells are greedy for sugar, they absorb these molecules more frequently than normal cells, allowing their location to be identified using this technique;;/ Thoracoscopy or laparoscopy are surgical procedures under general anesthesia in which cannulas with cameras - laparoscope - are inserted into the cavities through small cuts, allowing the organs to be observed to identify the presence of cancer; the doctor may collect tissue for later analysis;;/ Bone scintigraphy – to identify the presence of metastases in the bones.;/  Often the staging of the disease is only complete after the treatment surgery, through microscopic analysis by Pathological Anatomy, of the esophagus, lymph nodes and other tissues collected during surgery.  Based on the diagnostic tests performed, the staging of esophageal cancer can be classified as follows: Stage 0 – The cancer is in situ, that is, it is confined to its site, found only in the epithelium of the esophagus; Stage I – In this stage the cancer has reached the submucosa; Stage II – At this stage, the cancer has reached the submucosa and invaded 1 to 2 lymph nodes, or the cancer has invaded the muscular layer and may have invaded the lymph nodes, or even invaded the serous layer of the esophagus; Stage III – Esophageal cancer may have invaded 3 or more lymph nodes, affecting the serous layer or neighboring organs such as the aorta, trachea or spine; Stage IV- The cancer has spread to distant organs, such as the liver. //Treatment// Taking into account the staging of esophageal cancer, the multidisciplinary clinical team will assess the best treatment to follow. Options may include surgery, radiation treatment, and chemotherapy. Stage I – in this stage the treatment option is surgery; radiotherapy and chemotherapy are occasionally used; Stage II – The treatment option is radiotherapy and chemotherapy; surgery is assessed on a case-by-case basis and may eventually be used; Stage III – Treatment options include surgery and radiation therapy; Stage IV – In this stage, treatment options include chemotherapy and possibly radiation therapy. The surgical procedure used is esophagectomy, which consists of the removal of the esophagus, totally or partially, and which may involve the removal of lymph nodes and also the partial or total removal of the stomach. It is a complex surgery and there are several techniques to perform it. If an esophagectomy has been proposed, you should discuss this procedure with your doctor. Radiotherapy is used in esophageal carcinoma as definitive treatment, in order to eradicate the tumor, or as neo-adjuvant treatment (before surgical intervention). It is usually prescribed in combination with chemotherapy, in order to allow the greatest possible tumor reduction, enabling surgery with fewer risks.  Patients who have had esophageal cancer may be regularly monitored in consultation by the oncologist or by the surgeon if they have undergone surgery. In addition to the physical examination and blood tests, imaging tests such as tomography, x-ray and even upper digestive endoscopy may be requested.

Stomach cancer,"//What is it?// Stomach cancer is one of the types of cancer of the digestive system. The epithelial cells of the stomach are responsible for the constitution of the epithelial tissue of the stomach, the mucosa. In their normal state, these cells grow and divide into new cells, which are formed as they are needed; this process is called cell regeneration. When cells lose their control mechanism and undergo changes in their genome (DNA), they become cancer cells, which do not die when they age or are damaged, and produce new cells that are not needed in an uncontrolled manner, resulting in the formation of cancer. Unlike normal cells, stomach cancer cells do not respect the boundaries of the organ, they invade the surrounding tissues and can spread to other parts of the body. This process is called metastasis. Stomach cancer usually starts in the cells of the inner lining of the stomach. Over time, the cancer can invade the stomach wall and spread to the outer lining, where it can invade organs such as the liver, esophagus, intestine, and nearby lymph nodes. //Prevention// Preventing stomach cancer involves practicing healthy habits, such as maintaining a balanced diet, rich in fish, poultry, fruits and vegetables, and free from smoked, salted or preserved foods in vinegar, as well as fatty meats and their derivatives. It also involves giving up tobacco and alcohol consumption, and doing regular exercise to control your weight. There are no established practices for early diagnosis of stomach cancer. //Risk Factors// Any behavior or condition that increases your risk of developing a disease is a risk factor. Although you may have one or more of the following risk factors for stomach cancer, it does not mean that you will develop the disease. On the other hand, the opposite also applies, that is, if you do not have any risk factors for stomach cancer, it does not mean that you cannot develop this disease. For stomach cancer, the most common are: Helicobacter Pylori infection – although evidence does not indicate that stomach ulcers are a risk factor for stomach cancer in themselves, some studies suggest that the bacteria Helicobacter pylori – which causes inflammation (gastritis) and stomach ulcers – constitutes an important risk factor for the development of stomach cancer;/  Inflammation of the stomach, chronic gastritis, especially atrophic gastritis (associated with a type of anemia called pernicious);/  Change in the epithelium of the stomach to an epithelium similar to that of the intestine, called intestinal metaplasia;/  Presence of stomach polyps, either in the context of familial polyposis or as an isolated event. Familial polyposis is a genetic condition in which there is a mutation in a gene that leads to the appearance of hundreds of polyps in the intestine and stomach.;/  Family history- having a first-degree relative (father, mother or siblings) who has had stomach cancer;/  Have a diet rich in smoked foods and low in vegetables and fruit; Recent studies suggest that grilled foods and barbecues may increase the risk of stomach cancer;/  Ingestion of food that has not been stored and prepared properly, namely food preserved by smoking, drying, salting or vinegar;/  Age - stomach cancer is more common in people over 55;/  Being male – stomach cancer is twice as common in men as in women;/  Race – stomach cancer is more common in blacks than in whites;/  Smoking;/  Salt consumption;/ //Symptoms// Stomach cancer symptoms are not exclusive and can occur in other diseases. Having one or more of the symptoms described here does not mean that you have stomach cancer. You should be alert and consult your doctor if you have the following symptoms: Symptoms of early stages of stomach cancer: - Indigestion or gastric discomfort- Bloating after eating- Mild nausea- Loss of appetite- Burning sensation (heartburn) Symptoms of advanced stages of stomach cancer: - Blood in the stool- Vomiting- Unexplained weight loss- Gastric pain- Jaundice- Accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity (ascites)- Difficulty swallowing //Who should I contact?// If you suspect cancer, due to symptoms or a complementary diagnostic test that shows a change, you should go to a Gastroenterologist, a General Surgeon or alternatively, less commonly, an Oncologist. Meet our team of experts Make your contact request so we can follow up from the first moment. If you prefer, you can schedule an appointment via our toll-free line. Stomach cancers can be of several types: -Adenocarcinoma- is the most common stomach cancer, accounting for around 95% of the total. In this type of cancer, the cells originate from the epithelium; -Stomach lymphoma- originates in lymphoid tissue cells, white blood cells in the stomach; -Gastrointestinal stromal sarcoma (GIST) - cancer of the tissues of the stomach wall that are neither epithelium nor muscle. It is a tumor of the connective tissue.  Adenocarcinomas of the stomach can present in the following subtypes: - Intestinal: Intestinal-type gastric adenocarcinomas are similar to the glandular epithelium of the intestine, hence they are sometimes indicated as “well differentiated” or “moderately differentiated” in the Pathological Anatomy report. The Pathological Anatomy report may include words such as tubular, papillary or mucous (mucus producing); - Diffuse: These stomach adenocarcinomas do not look like glands, therefore they can be described in the pathological anatomy report with the word “undifferentiated” associated with the diagnosis. These tumors may not form a rounded lesion in the gastric mucosa but have the appearance of diffuse infiltration of the stomach wall, which is called linitis plastica. //Diagnosis and Staging// In a patient with a clinical history and clinical examination suggestive of stomach cancer, some tests should be requested to confirm or rule out this suspicion. To diagnose stomach cancer, the following tests are usually performed: Physical examination: Your doctor will examine your abdomen for fluid, swelling, or other changes, and will also check for enlarged lymph nodes.;/  Testing for occult blood in the stool: stomach cancer can cause bleeding, although other benign pathologies can also cause blood in the stool, such as hemorrhoids. Testing for occult blood in the stool can detect the presence of bleeding, and if confirmed, additional tests are necessary to find its origin.;/  Upper digestive endoscopy: this is an examination of the stomach and esophagus that involves inserting a thin, illuminated tube – a gastroscope – through the mouth, passing through the esophagus to the stomach.;/  If the doctor detects the presence of any suspicious changes in the stomach through the gastroscope images, he or she will collect tissue for analysis, that is, perform a gastric biopsy. After collecting the suspicious tissues, they are sent to the Pathological Anatomy laboratory to be analyzed under a microscope and check for the presence of cancer cells.;/ Only a stomach biopsy observed under a microscope by Pathological Anatomy allows the diagnosis of stomach cancer. Staging is the process by which we assess whether cancer cells have spread from the stomach to other nearby or more distant structures. The information obtained through the staging process determines the stage of the disease, which is essential for planning treatment. In the case of stomach cancer, the following may be requested: Imaging exams such as CT scan;;/ Endoscopic exams such as echoendoscopy (exam that consists of an ultrasound performed inside the gastric cavity through a gastroscope);;/ Surgical tests such as laparoscopy. This surgical procedure can be useful because it allows the most accurate staging possible of the abdominal disease. Laparoscopy involves inserting a camera into the abdominal cavity through an incision in the skin, and thus allows the organs to be seen better than with any imaging test.;/ The stage of stomach cancer can be classified as follows: Stage 0 - there is the presence of cancer cells in the mucosa, also called carcinoma in situ, because it is in its location; Stage I - the cancer has invaded the submucosa and may have invaded 1 to 2 lymph nodes; Stage II – the cancer has invaded the serous layer and may have invaded up to 7 or more lymph nodes; Stage III - the cancer has invaded neighboring organs such as the spleen, colon, liver, diaphragm, pancreas, kidneys, adrenal glands or small intestine; Stage IV- the cancer has spread to distant organs. //Treatment// The multidisciplinary clinical team will assess the best treatment to follow on a case-by-case basis: Stages 0 and I – the treatment option is surgery, through a gastrectomy; Stage II and III – the treatment option includes, in addition to gastrectomy, chemotherapy; eventually, radiotherapy may be used; Stage IV - the treatment option consists of chemotherapy; Radiotherapy may eventually be used. The surgical procedure for stomach cancer is a gastrectomy, which consists of the partial or total removal of the stomach and surrounding lymph nodes. Often, the full staging of the disease is only achieved after gastrectomy, so the therapeutic strategy following surgery will be based on the analysis of the lymph nodes and other surgically removed tissues by pathological anatomy. It is a technically demanding surgery, if it was proposed, you must discuss this procedure with your surgeon and clarify any doubts. Chemotherapy can precede surgery or be performed in addition to surgery (in this case often associated with radiotherapy) to reduce the risk of recurrence. Patients who have had stomach cancer may be monitored by the oncologist or surgeon if they have undergone surgery. Follow-up tests may include imaging tests and blood tests. Weight loss is consistent after total or partial gastrectomy surgery; nutritional problems and deficiencies in iron and vitamin B12 absorption often result from surgery.

Liver cancer,"//What is it?// Liver cancer is one of the types of cancer of the digestive system, and is also one of the types of hepatobiliary pancreatic tumors (liver, pancreas and bile ducts). Liver epithelial cells are responsible for the formation of liver tissue. In their normal state, these cells grow and divide into new cells, which are formed as they are needed; this process is called cell regeneration.  When cells lose this control mechanism and undergo changes in their genome (DNA), they become cancer cells. These do not die when they age or are damaged and produce new cells, which are not needed, in an uncontrolled manner, giving rise to the formation of cancer.  Unlike normal cells, liver cancer cells do not respect the boundaries of the organ, invading surrounding tissues or spreading to other parts of the body. This process is called metastasis. //Prevention// Patients with cirrhosis, whatever the cause, must undergo medical monitoring with laboratory evaluation of the alpha fetoprotein tumor marker and liver imaging tests. //Risk factors// Any behavior or condition that increases your risk of developing a disease is a risk factor. Just because one or more risk factors apply to you, it does not necessarily mean that you will develop liver cancer. Likewise, liver cancer can occur in people who have no known risk factors.  The causes of liver cancer have not yet been found, but some risk factors are known. The main risk factors are:  Hepatitis B or C virus infection;;/  Family history - having a close relative with hepatitis B virus infection and liver cancer;;/  Cirrhosis, which can be caused by excessive alcohol consumption;;/  Obesity;;/  Diabetes;;/  Consumption of foods colonized by aflatoxin, a substance produced by a fungus that can grow in foods such as legumes and nuts that have not been stored correctly.;/ //Symptoms// The symptoms of liver cancer are not exclusive, they can appear in other diseases. Just because you have one or more of the symptoms described here does not mean you have liver cancer.  You should be alert and consult your doctor if you have the following symptoms: Appearance of a mass on the right side of the upper abdomen, below the ribs;/ Pain or discomfort on the right side of the upper abdomen, below the ribs;/ Pain in the right shoulder blade;/ Loss of appetite or feeling full;/ Weight loss for no reason;/ Nausea;/ Vomiting;/ Jaundice;/ Fatigue for no apparent reason;/ //Who should I contact?// If you suspect cancer, due to symptoms or a complementary diagnostic test that presents a change, you should consult a Gastroenterologist, a General Surgeon or alternatively, less commonly, an Oncologist.

There are several types of liver cancer: Primary liver cancer - cancer originating in the liver, uncommon;;/ Metastatic or secondary cancer- cancer that has disseminated or spread to the liver but has originated in other organs.;/  Primary liver cancers can present in several subtypes: Hepatocellular carcinoma (hepatoma or hepatocarcinoma) - These cancers originate in the epithelial cells that form the liver. Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common liver tumor in adults, and is the liver cancer discussed on this website;;/ Hepatoblastoma- These pediatric tumors originate in embryonic liver cells;;/ Liver sarcomas- These are very rare tumors that originate in liver cells that are not epithelial, they can be vessels, muscle or supporting tissues.;/ //Diagnosis and Staging// In a patient with a clinical history and clinical examination suspected of having liver cancer, general blood tests should be requested, which include assessment of liver function and a tumor marker called alpha fetoprotein. Imaging tests should be performed, which may include ultrasound, computed tomography and MRI.  The doctor can perform a tissue biopsy, that is, collect liver cells for analysis under a microscope. A liver biopsy can be performed by introducing a fine needle through the skin into the organ, guided by computed tomography or ultrasound. Alternatively, laparoscopic surgery can be performed, a procedure in which the surgeon introduces equipment – ​​a laparoscope – through a small incision in the abdomen, which contains a tool to remove part of the liver tissue.  Only when the material collected in a biopsy from the suspected liver mass is observed under a microscope is it possible to confirm the diagnosis of liver cancer. Staging is the process by which we determine whether cancer cells have spread to other nearby or more distant structures. The information obtained through the staging process determines the stage of the disease, which is essential for planning treatment.  When the diagnosis of liver cancer is confirmed, the next step is to stage it, and the following tests may be requested if they have not been carried out to obtain the diagnosis: Abdominal and thoracic CT scan;;/ Liver magnetic resonance imaging;;/ Bone scintigraphy;;/ Positron emission tomography (PET scan).;/  Often the staging of the disease is only complete after the treatment surgery, through microscopic analysis by Pathological Anatomy of the tissues collected during surgery.  Based on the diagnostic tests performed, the staging of liver cancer can be classified as follows: Stage I - The tumor is single and has not invaded the blood vessels of the liver, spread to the lymph nodes*, or to other parts of the body. Stage II - At this stage we have one of two situations: there is no single lesion and none of the lesions is more than 5 cm or, if there is a single lesion, it invades blood or lymphatic vessels; Stage III - Stage III is divided into the following three substages. In all cases, the tumor cells have not spread to the lymph nodes or to more distant organs: IIIA) There are several tumors in the liver and at least one has a diameter greater than 5 cm. IIIB) The tumor invaded an artery of one of the main veins of the liver. IIIC) The tumor has spread to an adjacent organ (other than the gallbladder) or to the outer lining of the liver. Stage IV- The tumor has spread to the lymph nodes* or to more distant organs. IIIA) Any of the above and invasion of a regional lymph node IIIB) Any of the above and spread of the tumor to other parts of the body  For liver cancer, there is yet another form increasingly used by specialists, called the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system, and its main advantage is that it identifies patients with early-stage cancer who can benefit from curative therapies (stage 0 and stage A), those of intermediate (stage B) or advanced (stage C) who can benefit from life-prolonging treatments and, finally, those with very limited life expectancy (stage D). //Treatment// Taking into account the staging of the liver cancer, the multidisciplinary clinical team will assess the best treatment to follow. This may include surgery, liver transplantation, ablation techniques, radiotherapy and systemic therapy. Operable localized disease - usually treated by surgery;/ Locally advanced disease – treatment options include surgery with transplantation or other local techniques, radiotherapy and systemic therapy;;/ Disseminated disease – treatment options include systemic therapy and eventually radiotherapy.;/ The surgical procedure for liver cancer is called hepatectomy and consists of abdominal surgery that can be of two types: Partial hepatectomy - In this surgery, part of the liver that has cancer is removed;;/ Total hepatectomy - In this surgery, the entire liver is removed and the liver from a donor must be transplanted.;/ During this surgery, samples must also be taken from the lymph nodes. There are other local techniques used to treat liver cancer, performed by surgeons, interventional radiologists or radiation oncologists: Radiofrequency ablation – procedure that consists of introducing a probe containing small electrodes to destroy cancer cells through heat. Generally, the doctor introduces the probe through the skin, using local anesthesia and it may be necessary to use an ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging or CT scan to guide the probe to the tumor;;/ Cryosurgery – procedure that consists of introducing a probe to destroy cancer cells through cold;;/ Ethanol injection into the lesion – the doctor introduces a thin needle guided by ultrasound, injecting alcohol (ethanol) directly into the tumor and destroys the cancer cells. Generally the needle is introduced using local anesthesia, but if the patient has multiple liver cancers, general anesthesia may be necessary;;/ Embolization – This procedure consists of introducing a catheter into an artery in the leg to reach the liver artery. Through the catheter, the doctor injects particles that block the blood flow of the liver artery, causing the tumor to weaken. The liver continues to work normally as it receives blood through other vessels;;/ Transarterial Chemoembolization (TACE)– this procedure is similar to embolization, in that the doctor injects a chemotherapy drug, which means it aims to kill the cancer cells and/or limit their growth. Through the blood vessels, the drug reaches cancer cells and normal liver cells, but the latter break down the drug before it reaches the rest of the body.;/ Radiotherapy treatment for liver cancer can be of two types: External radiotherapy – radiation treatment to the chest and abdomen, using equipment called a linear accelerator;;/ Internal radiotherapy – radiation treatment involving the introduction of small radioactive spheres injected through a catheter into the liver artery. These spheres block the blood flow in the liver artery, causing the tumor to weaken and delivering radiotherapy selectively to the affected area.;/ Regarding systemic therapy in liver cancer, classical chemotherapy is of little use. Currently, targeted therapies and immunotherapy are used.  Regarding targeted therapies, the use of a substance called surafenib has shown good results in controlling the disease. This type of therapy slows the growth of the tumor and reduces blood flow to it.  Immunotherapy, particularly the drug nivolumab, can help reduce tumors in people with advanced metastatic cancer who underwent first-line targeted therapy and which did not work. Several studies are being carried out to determine whether immunotherapy can be administered as a first treatment option or in combination with other treatments. One of the therapeutic options that may be presented to you by your doctor and care team is participation in a clinical trial. Clinical trials help doctors better prevent, diagnose and treat cancer, namely liver cancer. There are different phases of clinical trials with the aim of determining the efficacy, safety and durability of the treatment being tested. Consult your doctor about the possibility of participating in a clinical trial.  Patients who have had liver cancer may be monitored by the oncologist or surgeon if they have undergone surgery. They must be observed during the consultation and the tests to be requested are imaging tests and blood tests, depending on the clinician's decision.

Ovarian cancer,"//What is it?// Ovarian cancer is the most common cause of death from gynecological tumors in the United States. Malignant ovarian tumors include primary lesions (which arise from normal ovarian structures) and secondary lesions that are metastases from other cancers in other parts of the body. Primary lesions include epithelial ovarian carcinoma, which represents 70% of all ovarian tumors. Recent studies suggest that most of these tumors originate in the fallopian tubes. Ovarian stromal tumors include germ cell tumors, sex cord stromal tumors, and other rarer types. Metastases to the ovaries are relatively common; The tumors that most frequently metastasize to the ovary are tumors of the endometrium, breast, colon, stomach and cervix. In this text we refer exclusively to epithelial ovarian tumors, that is, tumors that originate in epithelial cells (the basic tissue of the human body that covers the entire skin and mucous membranes). //Prevention// No type of screening for ovarian cancer is recommended in the general population, particularly with the use of serum CA125 level (tumor marker) or transvaginal ultrasound, as no benefit has been demonstrated in reducing mortality rates, and adding potential damage related to false-positive results. No tumor marker (CA125, HE-4, beta-human chorionic gonadotropin, alpha-fetoprotein, lactate dehydrogenase) is completely specific, therefore, the use of these tests should be done in conjunction with morphological and clinical findings //Symptoms// In the early stages, epithelial ovarian cancer may have few or no symptoms, making it difficult to diagnose. Symptoms are more commonly seen in advanced stages of the disease and may include: Abdominal or pelvic pain.;/ Vaginal bleeding.;/ Constipation;/ Distended abdomen.;/ Diarrhea.;/ Feeling of extreme tiredness.;/ Frequent need to urinate.;/ //Risk factors// The causes of ovarian cancer have not yet been found, but some risk factors are known. The main risk factors are: Family history of ovarian cancer - the risk of ovarian cancer is greater the more first-degree and/or second-degree relatives who have had this disease. The risk is even greater if your family members had the disease at an early age, whether it be ovarian cancer or breast cancer. If this is the case, the woman may undergo genetic testing to detect whether she has any mutations that indicate a propensity to develop the disease.;/  Personal history of cancer – women with a history of breast, uterine or colorectal cancer are at increased risk of ovarian cancer;/  Inherited genetic mutations – approximately 6% - 25% of ovarian cancers have a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation. These mutations are most frequently seen in high-grade serous tumors. Inheriting a BRCA1 mutation increases a woman's risk of developing ovarian cancer by 15% - 45%, while inheriting a BRCA2 gene mutation increases her risk by 10% - 20%.;/ These genetic syndromes can give rise to a profile of cancers that may include only ovarian cancer, breast and ovarian cancer, and ovarian and colon cancer; Age – the older you are, the greater the risk;;/ Having undergone hormone replacement therapy after menopause;;/ Have taken drugs to treat infertility, namely ovulation stimulators;;/ Not having had children;/ //Who should I contact?// The information contained herein is not intended to replace the advice of your doctor. Your doctor knows your complete medical history and will advise you on the best treatment for your case. If you suspect cancer, due to symptoms or a complementary diagnostic test that presents an alteration, you should always seek an Oncological Gynecologist. He will carry out a first clinical and imaging assessment, and will forward your case for discussion in a multidisciplinary team, which carries out a personalized assessment, and which will propose the best therapeutic option for each case. Meet our team of experts Make your contact request so we can follow up from the first moment. If you prefer, you can schedule an appointment via our toll-free line. The four main subtypes of epithelial ovarian cancer are: Serous Carcinoma: This is the most common subtype and represents about 80% of advanced ovarian cancers. These cancers are subdivided into high-grade tumors and low-grade tumors.;/  Mucinous Carcinoma: this subtype represents 7-14% of all primary epithelial ovarian cancers, but may be associated with metastasis of intestinal tumors;/  Endometrioid carcinoma: this subtype is responsible for epithelial ovarian cancer in around 10% of women;/  Clear Cell Carcinoma: About 5% of women with ovarian cancer have this subtype.;/ //Diagnosis and Staging// If your doctor clinically suspects the existence of ovarian pathology, additional tests will be requested to diagnose the disease. In addition to the gynecological examination, which will look for signs of the disease through palpation, in order to look for anomalous abdominal or pelvic masses or the presence of abnormal fluid in the abdomen (ascites), the following tests may be carried out: CA125 tumor marker analysis – consists of a blood test to determine the level and concentration of this marker, whose concentration may indicate the presence of cancer or other pathologies.  The CA 125 marker is not specific for epithelial ovarian cancer; it may be increased in people with other types of cancer and also in women with non-malignant gynecological conditions. CA125 is important to help assess the success of the treatment to be followed if ovarian cancer is confirmed.;/ Abdominal and Pelvic Ultrasound;/ Abdominal and Pelvic CT Scan and/or MRI;/ Biopsy – if there is a strong suspicion of cancer, the gynecologist will take a sample of tissue or fluid for analysis by anatomical pathology. The biopsy is usually performed surgically through a laparotomy, but it can also be performed by laparoscopy.;/  Only observation of the tissues collected by biopsy under a microscope by Pathological Anatomy can confirm the diagnosis of ovarian cancer. Staging is the process by which we assess the extent of the disease in the ovary, nearby structures, or distant organs. The information obtained through the staging process determines the stage of the disease, which is essential for planning treatment.  Stage I– In stage I, growth is limited to the ovaries. Stage IA- Tumor limited to 1 ovary, capsule intact, no tumor on the external surface Stage IB- Tumor involves both ovaries, capsule intact, no tumor on outer surface Stage IC - Tumor in stage IA or IB, surgical rupture of the capsule (IC1), rupture of the capsule before surgery or tumor on the ovarian surface (IC2) or malignant cells in ascites or peritoneal washings (IC3)  Stage II – In stage II, the tumor involves one or both ovaries, with pelvic extension (below the pelvic floor) Stage IIA- Extension and/or implants in the uterus or fallopian tubes Stage IIB- Extension to other pelvic intraperitoneal tissues  Stage III – In stage III, the tumor involves one or both ovaries, with cytologically or histologically confirmed spread to the peritoneum outside the pelvis and/or metastases to the retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Stage IIIA- Positive retroperitoneal nodes and/or microscopic metastases beyond the pelvis Stage IIIA1- Only positive retroperitoneal nodes (IIIA1), metastasis ≤10 mm (IIIA1 [ii]) or metastasis >10 mm (IIIA1 [ii]) Stage IIIA2- Microscopic peritoneal involvement, extrapelvic (above the pelvic brim) ± positive retroperitoneal nodes Stage IIIB - macroscopic peritoneal metastasis, extrapelvic ≤ 2 cm ± positive retroperitoneal nodes; includes extension to liver/spleen capsule Stage IIIC - macroscopic peritoneal metastasis, extrapelvic > 2 cm ± positive retroperitoneal nodes; includes extension to liver/spleen capsule.  Stage IV– Stage IV comprises distant metastases, excluding peritoneal metastasis. Stage IVA - pleural effusion with positive cytology Stage IVB - hepatic and/or splenic parenchymal metastasis, metastasis to extra-abdominal organs (including inguinal lymph nodes and lymph nodes outside the abdominal cavity) //Treatment// Taking into account the stage of ovarian cancer, the multidisciplinary clinical team will assess the best treatment to follow. Stage I and II – in these stages the treatment option is generally surgery. Chemotherapy is considered a complement to surgery to prevent tumor recurrence from stage III onwards. Stage III and IV – therapeutic options include chemotherapy; the surgical option is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Standard treatment for women with ovarian cancer involves cytoreduction surgery and chemotherapy. Treatment will depend on how advanced the cancer is at the time of diagnosis. The surgery aims to confirm the diagnosis, define the extent of the disease and resect the entire visible tumor, and must be carried out in a specialized center with qualified and experienced teams. Postoperative chemotherapy is indicated in all patients with ovarian cancer except those with stage I disease with low-risk surgical-pathologic features. Standard postoperative chemotherapy for ovarian cancer is combination therapy with a platinum compound and a taxane (e.g., carboplatin and paclitaxel). Radiotherapy is rarely used in the treatment of ovarian cancer, only in palliative treatment situations. After finishing treatment, your doctor will schedule follow-up appointments. During these consultations, a clinical examination will be carried out, which will include an examination of the abdominal and pelvic area. Imaging tests may be requested, such as a CT scan or pelvic MRI or PET/Scan, and determination of the tumor marker Ca125. Even if you received the best treatment available at the time of diagnosis, there is always the possibility that the cancer will return, especially due to the aggressiveness of these ovarian tumors. This situation, called relapse/recurrence, occurs more frequently in the first years after treatment, and therefore a usual follow-up program includes consultations every 3 months during the first 2 years after treatment, then every 4 months in the 3rd year and every 6 months in the 4th and 5th years. In case of recurrence, the treatment that will be proposed will depend on the extent of the recurrence, its location and previous therapies.

Cancro do pancreas,"//What is it?// Pancreatic cancer is a type of cancer of the digestive system, and is also one of the hepatobiliary pancreatic tumors (liver, pancreas and bile ducts). The exocrine and endocrine cells of the pancreas are responsible for the formation of pancreatic tissue. Endocrine cells produce hormones, while exocrine cells produce enzymes. In their normal state, these cells grow and divide into new cells, which are formed as they are needed. This process is called cell regeneration. When normal cells age or are damaged, they die naturally. When cells lose this control mechanism and undergo changes in their genome (DNA), they become cancer cells, which do not die when they age or are damaged, and instead produce new cells that are not needed in an uncontrolled manner, resulting in the formation of cancer.  Unlike normal cells, pancreatic cancer cells do not respect the borders of the organ, invading the surrounding tissues and spreading to other parts of the body. This process is called metastasis. Pancreatic cancer can metastasize in three ways: it can invade nearby organs such as the stomach and small intestine through its growth; it can detach from the main tumor, giving rise to new tumors on the affected peritoneal surface – peritoneal implants or peritoneal carcinomatosis – and it can spread through cells that are released from the main tumor, and can reach other distant organs through the lymph nodes or the bloodstream. //Prevention// There are no prevention strategies for pancreatic cancer. You should adopt healthy habits, such as not smoking and having a balanced diet, as well as paying attention to possible symptoms. //Symptoms// Pancreatic cancer symptoms are not exclusive, they can appear in other diseases. Just because you have one or more of the symptoms described here does not mean you have pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer usually has no symptoms in the early stages. You should be alert and consult your doctor if you have the following symptoms: - pain in the abdominal region, radiating to the dorsal region, which does not disappear when changing position; - jaundice - Jaundice translates into a yellowish color of the eyes and skin, and can be caused by a tumor that is blocking the channel that drains bile from the liver; - dark colored urine and/or light colored stools; - nausea and vomiting; - weight loss for no apparent reason; - anorexia; - fatigue; - loss of appetite and rapid feeling of fullness.  //Risk Factors// Any behavior or condition that increases your risk of developing a disease is a risk factor. Just because one or more risk factors apply to you, it does not necessarily mean that you will develop pancreatic cancer. Likewise, pancreatic cancer can occur in people who have no known risk factors. The causes of pancreatic cancer have not yet been determined, but some risk factors are known. The main risk factors are: Smoking – the most important risk factor; smokers have a higher risk of developing pancreatic cancer than non-smokers, especially smokers with a heavy smoking history; Family history – the risk of developing pancreatic cancer is greater if there are direct relatives (parents, siblings) who have or have had the disease; Diabetes – diabetic people have an increased risk of having pancreatic cancer; Pancreatitis – pancreatitis is an inflammation of the pancreas that causes pain; chronic pancreatitis may increase the risk of pancreatic cancer; Obesity – obese individuals have a slightly higher risk of developing pancreatic cancer; Alcoholism – individuals with high alcohol consumption have an increased risk of developing pancreatic cancer; Risky professions – working in the oil, metals, industrial gas and chemical industries. //Who should I contact?// If you suspect cancer, due to symptoms or a complementary diagnostic test that presents an alteration, you should consult a Gastroenterologist, a General Surgeon or alternatively, less commonly, an Oncologist. Meet our team of experts Make your contact request so we can follow up from the first moment. If you prefer, you can schedule an appointment via our toll-free line.  Approximately 90% of pancreatic cancers begin in the exocrine cells that line the pancreatic ducts. This type of cancer is called ductal adenocarcinoma, the main type of pancreatic cancer, accounting for 75 to 90% of cases. Another type of tumor, less frequent, is neuroendocrine carcinoma, which originates in the endocrine cells of the pancreas. Pancreatic cancer in the form of sarcoma or lymphoma is very rare. Approximately 60% of cancers occur in the head of the pancreas, near the duodenum, 20% occur in the body and tail of the pancreas, and the remainder are diffuse tumors. //Diagnosis and Staging// In a patient suspected of having pancreatic cancer, tests may be ordered to diagnose the disease. In addition to a physical examination to look for signs of jaundice or the presence of abdominal fluid, your doctor may order imaging tests to aid in the diagnosis. The most common in the case of the pancreas is a CT scan, but other tests may be requested, such as an MRI, ultrasound or endoscopy. Your doctor may, if suspected, request the following tests or procedures: -Endoscopic ultrasound (echoendoscopy) - consists of introducing a tube – endoscope – through the throat through the stomach to the beginning of the small intestine, allowing the formation of an image of the pancreas through ultrasound; -Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) – consists of introducing an endoscope through the throat that allows the introduction of a smaller tube into the bile and pancreatic ducts, injecting a substance through this tube (radiological contrast) that allows images to be produced. ERCP images allow the doctor to detect obstructions in the ducts due to a tumor or other patient-specific condition. ERCP is an important method in the differential diagnosis of tumors of the pancreaticobiliary junction, where the vast majority of pancreatic cancers begin; -Percutaneous aspiration biopsy – which consists of collecting tissue by pricking it through the skin, for analysis in the laboratory. The pancreas biopsy can be performed using an echo-endoscopy or guided by a computed tomography scan; -Exploratory laparoscopy, a type of surgery that allows the doctor to view your internal organs and assess the presence of disease. It is a minimally invasive, quick surgery performed on an outpatient basis; -Pancreas surgery – some patients undergo pancreas surgery, with the diagnosis confirmed by analyzing the samples collected during the procedure. Only observation of suspicious cells under a microscope by Pathological Anatomy can confirm the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Staging is the process by which we determine whether cancer cells have spread to other nearby or more distant structures. The information obtained through the staging process determines the stage of the disease, which is essential for planning treatment. When the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is confirmed, the next step is to stage the disease through imaging tests such as magnetic resonance imaging and CT scans to check its extent. Exams such as PET or staging procedures such as exploratory alaparoscopy may also be requested.  Based on the diagnostic tests performed, the staging of pancreatic cancer can be classified as follows: Tx – primary tumor, without classified staging T0 – No evidence of cancer Tis – Cancer in situ T1 – Cancer limited to the pancreas, measuring less than 2 cm T2 – Cancer limited to the pancreas, measuring more than 2 cm T3 – Cancer affects tissues other than the pancreas, but without involving the vessels, namely the superior mesenteric artery T4 – The cancer involves the blood vessels, and in this case it is not operable  The staging of the disease translates into the combination of the type of primary tumor, with the presence of disease in the lymph nodes and/or metastases. Stage 0 – pancreatic cancer is in situ, that is, it is confined to its site; Stage I – in this stage the pancreatic cancer is only in the pancreas; Stage II – in this stage the cancer has invaded surrounding tissue and possibly lymph nodes. The cancer has not yet reached the bloodstream; Stage III – pancreatic cancer has spread to nearby blood vessels; Stage IV - the cancer has spread to distant organs, such as the liver and lungs. Often the staging of the disease is only complete after surgery, through analysis by Pathological Anatomy under a microscope, of the pancreas, lymph nodes and other tissues collected. Given the difficulty of diagnosing this disease, in around 65% of cases pancreatic cancer presents as stage IV, in 21% of cases in stage III, and in only 14% of cases the stage is I or II. //Treatment// The multidisciplinary clinical team will assess the best treatment to follow. Options may include surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, either alone or in combination. Stages 0, I and II - the therapeutic option is normally surgery, by performing a duodenal pancreatectomy (DPC) or Whipple procedure, partially or completely removing the pancreas, duodenum, gallbladder and part of the stomach, exemplified in the image. If the cancer is located in the tail of the pancreas, a distal pancreatectomy is performed. The spleen and nearby lymph nodes can also be removed; the use of radiotherapy and chemotherapy based on the drug 5-flourouracil (5-FU) is evaluated on a case-by-case basis and may eventually be used in addition, before or after surgery; Stage III - in this stage, the treatment used is chemotherapy (5-FU and/or gemcitabine); radiotherapy is also generally used, as long as the patient is autonomous and has few symptoms; Stage IV - in this stage, the treatment used is chemotherapy; radiotherapy is generally not used. One of the therapeutic options that may be presented to you by your doctor and care team is participation in a clinical trial. Clinical trials help doctors better prevent, diagnose and treat cancer, namely pancreatic cancer. There are different phases of clinical trials with the aim of determining the efficacy, safety and durability of the treatment being tested. Consult your doctor about the possibility of participating in a clinical trial. Patients who have had pancreatic cancer may be regularly monitored in consultation by the oncologist or by the surgeon if they have undergone surgery. Tests such as CT scans and blood tests, including the tumor marker CA 19-9, may be requested.

Lung cancer,"//What is it?// Lung cancer is, in the vast majority of cases, of epithelial origin and, as such, is classified as carcinoma. Lung carcinomas usually arise in the epithelial cells of the main bronchi (central tumor) or in small bronchi, bronchioles, or alveoli (peripheral tumor). Unlike normal cells, lung cancer cells do not respect the boundaries of the organ and can invade surrounding tissues and spread to other parts of the body. This process is called metastasis. //Prevention// Preventing lung cancer fundamentally involves adopting healthy habits, namely not smoking and avoiding smoking environments. It also involves being alert to the symptoms of the disease and should consult your doctor if they appear. If you are a habitual smoker, you should have regular consultations with your family doctor or a pulmonologist to make an early diagnosis of lung cancer. You can also carry out a smoking cessation consultation at one of our units. In 2011, it was established that low-dose computed tomography (CT) is a valid and safe procedure for screening for lung cancer in populations at risk essentially based on smoking history.  The criteria for inclusion in an early diagnosis program are: Age between 55-74 years, with an indicator greater than 30 pack-year units (A - calculated by the number of packs per day multiplied by the number of years the patient has smoked) and smoking cessation for less than 15 years;/ Or Age over 50 years, UMA indicator greater than 20 and presence of other risk factors: lung disease (COPD, fibrosis), family history of lung cancer, occupational exposure or personal history of cancer.;/ //Risk factors// Any behavior or condition that increases your risk of developing a disease is a risk factor. Just because one or more risk factors apply to you, it does not necessarily mean that you will develop lung cancer. Likewise, lung cancer can occur in people who have no known risk factors. The causes of lung cancer have not yet been found, but some risk factors are known. The main risk factors are as follows:  It is the main risk factor for lung cancer. Between 80 and 90% of lung cancer patients smoke or have smoked. Tobacco is considered to cause 70% of lung cancers, but only 20% of smokers develop lung cancer. On the other hand, 20% of women with lung cancer have never smoked but this number drops to half in men.  As with almost all cancers, it is another risk factor as the median age of lung cancer patients is 71 years. The annual incidence in Portugal in more advanced age groups rises to more than 200 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in the age group between 70 and 74 years old.  The existence of familial aggregation of lung cancer suggests a possible genetic association, however this has not yet been proven and it may be due to similar environmental exposures in individuals from the same family.  Risk factor less well defined as causal. //Symptoms// Lung cancer symptoms are not exclusive, they can appear in other diseases. Just because you have one or more of the symptoms described here does not mean you have lung cancer. You should be alert and consult your doctor if you have the following symptoms: a pneumonia that does not heal;/ persistent chest pain;/ shortness of breathe;/ expectoration of blood;/ progressive weight loss;/ //Who should I contact?// If you suspect cancer, due to symptoms or a complementary diagnostic test that shows a change (for example: x-ray or chest CT), you should go to a Pulmonologist, Medical Oncologist or Thoracic Surgeon as soon as possible.  If you need help you can also contact one of our oncology managers. Recommended for smokers and ex-smokers, over 50 years old. On the same day, you will have your Lung Cancer Early Detection consultation and the necessary exams, such as low-dose tomography. Consult one of our experts. Make your contact request so we can follow up from the first moment. If you prefer, you can schedule an appointment via our toll-free line. There are several types of lung cancer, divided into two main groups based on the appearance of the cells under the microscope, which behave differently in terms of how they develop and metastasize: non-small cell lung cancer and lung cancer of small cells.  It is the most common cancer, normally accounting for 85% of lung cancer cases. This type of lung cancer generally grows and metastasizes more slowly compared to small cell cancer. It can be classified into the following subtypes: Adenocarcinoma - is the most common malignant epithelial lung cancer, accounting for 30-50% of cases. It is more common in women and non-smokers, and is therefore less associated with a history of smoking.;/ Squamous cell carcinomas - squamous cell carcinoma - represent about 25-30% of all lung tumours and occur mainly in men. It is strongly related to a history of smoking. However, although smoking habits have not changed considerably, the incidence of this type of cancer has been decreasing in relation to adenocarcinoma, probably due to changes in the constituents of tobacco.;/ Large cell carcinomas – rarer, representing 3% of cases.;/  It is a very malignant tumor and is strongly linked to smoking. This type of lung cancer occurs both in the large bronchi and in the periphery of the lung. //Diagnosis and Staging// The most frequently used tests for the initial diagnosis of lung cancer are imaging tests such as chest x-ray and computed tomography (CT). If the above indicate a suspicion of lung cancer, it will be necessary to perform a lung biopsy, that is, the collection of fragments of lung tissue for confirmation. This material can be obtained during a flexible bronchoscopy (flexible tube that is introduced through the nose or mouth and directed to the airways and lungs), transthoracic biopsy (needle placed through the chest and guided by imaging methods to reach the lung lesion generally in peripheral tumors) or echoendoscopy (similar to flexible, but with a probe at the tip). Biopsies may also need to be performed from locations other than the lung in case of suspected metastasis of the disease (extension to other organs). The collected material and cells are sent for study by Pathological Anatomy, which is the only way to confirm the existence of the disease.  Nowadays, after the Pathological Anatomy analysis, other procedures follow, namely molecular biology tests and other specific markers, in order to select the best drug for each person with cancer, allowing the so-called “personalized” therapy, when this is possible. The goal is to find genetic mutations - changes in genes - that may be linked to your type of cancer. For example, approximately 60% of patients with lung adenocarcinoma have tumors with very specific mutations. All of these genetic mutations are only found in cancer cells, not normal cells, which means they will not be passed on to your children. The most frequent genetic alterations tested in the diagnosis of lung cancer are found in the EGFR, KRAS and ALK genes. Staging is the process by which we determine whether lung cancer has spread to other nearby or more distant structures. The information obtained through the staging process determines the stage of the disease, which is essential for treatment to be planned correctly. Based on the diagnostic tests carried out, which may include Computed Tomography, bronchial ultrasound, bone scintigraphy, PET (positron emission tomography) or magnetic resonance imaging, lung cancer is staged: which can range from Stage I (less severe, best prognosis) to Stage IV (most severe, worst prognosis) according to the current TMN classification for lung tumors (8th edition, TNM). TNM is short for tumor (T), lymph nodes (N), and metastasis (M): T. Indicates the size of the primary tumor and how far it has spread.;/ N. Describes whether there is spread of the disease to the nearest lymph nodes.;/ M. Indicates whether there is metastasis in other parts of the body.;/ Bearing in mind the importance of a quick and accurate diagnosis for the timely start of treatments, CUF Oncologia has organized a rapid response in the event of a strong suspicion of lung cancer. ""Early detection saved my life"" “I always felt very well informed and supported” //Treatment// Based on the staging (TNM) of non-small cell lung cancer mentioned above, it is possible to guide the most appropriate treatment: Stages I and II– at this stage the treatment option is generally surgery; Stage III – therapeutic options include chemotherapy and radiotherapy, in sequence or combined; rarely surgery. Stages IV – at this stage, the most common treatment is chemotherapy, although currently in a high percentage of cases there are already new medications, which allow “personalized” therapy in selected patients.  For the treatment of small cell lung cancer, treatments are almost exclusively chemotherapy. Radiotherapy is used in certain situations of the disease, particularly in limited stages of the disease. Surgery can rarely be performed in these cases. The main goal of lung cancer surgery is to remove all of the cancer. Your surgical team’s priority is to keep you safe and do everything possible to maintain your quality of life after surgery.  The choice of the type of surgery to be performed largely depends on the size of the tumor and where it may have spread in the lungs. Sublobar surgery is indicated mainly for very small tumors or when resection of a larger part could have a very negative impact on the patient.;/ Sublobar surgery is indicated mainly for very small tumors or when resection of a larger part could have a very negative impact on the patient. Lobectomy is the complete removal of one of the lobes of the lung (there are three lobes in the right lung and two in the left). It is the most common surgery in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer and is the best option in isolated cancer and in patients in good general health.;/ Lobectomy is the complete removal of one of the lobes of the lung (there are three lobes in the right lung and two in the left).

Bilobectomy involves removing two lobes of the right-sided lung.;/ Bilobectomy involves removing two lobes of the right-sided lung. Pneumonectomy is the removal of the entire lung. It is performed when the cancer is located in the center of the lung and more localized surgery is not possible. Pneumonectomy is only performed in patients with good lung function, good recovery capacity and who can live without supplemental oxygen support.;/ Pneumonectomy is the removal of the entire lung. It is performed when the cancer is located in the center of the lung and more localized surgery is not possible. Pneumonectomy is only performed in patients with good lung function, good recovery capacity and who can live without supplemental oxygen support. Recently (in the last 5 years) the approval of immunotherapy drugs (directed at our immune system and not directly at the tumor) for an already very considerable group of patients, either as first-line therapy or after the use of other therapies, has increased the expectations of doctors dedicated to the treatment of lung cancer. Today, it is a growing area of ​​development and there is great hope that in the short term we can change survival by 5 years, making lung cancer a chronic disease. The use of these therapies, in addition to increasing patients' survival, simultaneously increases their quality of life, as the side effects of the drugs are significantly smaller when compared to those of chemotherapy. The clinical indication for the use of immunotherapy is not directed to all patients with lung cancer. In the CUF network there are also several ongoing clinical trials that hope to contribute to a significant improvement in the lives of lung cancer patients. Keeping in mind that the likelihood of this type of cancer spreading to other parts of the body is high, the first treatment approach often involves chemotherapy, either as a single treatment or in combination with radiotherapy. This approach always depends on the stage of the disease.  Even in tumors that are completely removed during surgery or destroyed by radiation therapy, the cancer can return if microscopic cells have managed to break away from the primary tumor and travel to other parts of the body. Therefore, your clinical team may decide to give you chemotherapy treatment before or after surgery.  Radiotherapy treatment can be carried out with the aim of curing patients whose cancer is confined to the rib cage but cannot be removed by surgery. Through advanced technology it is now possible to treat these tumors using high doses of radiation with high precision which reduces the number of sessions and minimizes side effects. Radiotherapy can also be used for palliative purposes to improve the quality of life of patients unresponsive to surgery or chemotherapy.  Patients who have had lung cancer must be monitored by an Oncologist, Pulmonologist or Surgeon if they have had surgery. Follow-up includes clinical history collection and clinical physical examination. It also includes imaging tests such as radiography, CT and others depending on the situation.  The entire process is usually monitored by a panel of specialists (Pneumologist, Oncologist, Thoracic Surgeon, Imaging Specialist, Anatomical Pathologist, among others) whose areas complement each other, in order to provide the best diagnosis, staging and follow-up for a person with lung cancer. The Lung Cancer Unit's mission is to diagnose, treat and monitor patients with malignant tumors of the trachea, bronchi, lungs, pleura and mediastinum. At CUF Oncology, this unit has coordination in the south and another in the north of the country, in order to standardize and mainstream best practices in the approach to lung cancer, in hospitals and clinics within the CUF network.

Cancro do rim,"//What is it?// Kidney cancer is one of the types of tumors of the urological system. Most kidney cancers originate in cells in the nephron tube. In fact, renal cell carcinoma and papillary carcinomas of the kidney, which are the majority of kidney cancers, originate from cells in the proximal convoluted tube. Tumor cells have changes in their genome that make them autonomous and difficult to regulate. //Prevention// There are no prevention or screening strategies for kidney cancer. You should maintain healthy habits and be aware of any symptoms. People with family members diagnosed with Von Hippel Landau disease should be tested for a possible VHL gene mutation. //Risk Factors// If one or more risk factors apply to you, it does not mean you will necessarily develop kidney cancer. Likewise, kidney cancer can appear in individuals who have no known risk factors. Tobacco is the main risk factor for kidney cancer. Other risk factors include high blood pressure and obesity. Therefore, it is important not to smoke, to control your blood pressure very well and to have healthy habits. Some kidney cancers are genetic, such as Von-Hippel-Lindau syndrome, Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome, hereditary leiomyomatosis, hereditary papillary carcinoma, hereditary paraganglioma/pheochromocytoma and tuberous sclerosis. In these cases, these patients should seek advice from a urologist. //Symptoms// Most kidney cancers do not cause symptoms. In fact, most kidney cancers are currently diagnosed accidentally during an abdominal ultrasound or CT scan. However, you should be alert and consult your doctor if you have the following symptoms: Blood when urinating;/ Appearance of a mass in the lumbar region on one side;/ Lower back pain on one side that won't go away;/ Loss of appetite;/ Weight loss for no apparent reason;/ Anemia;/ Fever;/ Fatigue;/ //Who should I contact?// If you suspect cancer, due to symptoms or a complementary diagnostic test that shows an alteration, you should see a Urologist. This pathology unit brings together all the resources of the CUF network for a comprehensive approach to different urological tumors, from diagnosis to treatment and patient follow-up after the treatment period.  Meet our team of experts. Make your contact request so we can follow up from the first moment. If you prefer, you can schedule an appointment via our toll-free line. Kidney cancer can be of several types:  Renal cell carcinoma – makes up the majority of kidney cancers (80%).;/ Papillary carcinomas – are often bilateral and have a more favorable prognosis as long as they are type I. Type II carcinomas associated with leiomyomatosis have a poor prognosis.;/ Chromophobe carcinoma – are rare and originate from the interspersed cells of the nephron collecting tube.;/  //Diagnosis and Treatment// In a patient with a clinical history and clinical examination suspected of having kidney cancer, general and urine analyzes should be requested. Imaging tests must be performed, which may include ultrasound, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. You may also be asked to perform a kidney biopsy - which consists of introducing a needle through the skin to collect a sample of tissue from the suspected kidney mass, guided by ultrasound or CT scan. The collected sample is then sent to the Pathological Anatomy laboratory to be analyzed under a microscope. Only the observation of suspicious cells under a microscope by the Pathological Anatomy can confirm the diagnosis of kidney cancer.  Staging is the process by which we determine whether cancer cells have spread from the kidney to other nearby or more distant structures. The information obtained through the staging process determines the stage of the disease, which is essential for planning treatment. Staging is usually done with the following tests: Abdominal and thoracic CT scan;/ RM abdominal;/ //Treatment// The multidisciplinary clinical team will assess the best treatment to follow. Most kidney cancers are treated by performing surgery to remove the kidney tumor. However, in cancers with metastases, treatments with immunotherapy or chemotherapy must be carried out. Surgical procedures for treating kidney cancer can be: Partial nephrectomy- In this surgery, part of the kidney where the tumor is located is removed; Radical nephrectomy – In this surgery, the entire kidney is removed; The techniques available at CUF are: Robot-assisted partial nephrectomy;/ Laparoscopic partial nephrectomy;/ Open partial nephrectomy;/ Laparoscopic radical nephrectomy;/ Open radical nephrectomy;/ For some patients, robot-assisted surgery may be an effective treatment option for certain types of cancer. CUF Oncology offers the combination of robotic technology with surgeons with experience and knowledge to help patients fight cancer. Robot-assisted surgery allows the surgeon to have greater ability and precision to perform surgical gestures in an easier and more comfortable way. Thanks to this precision, robot-assisted surgery can improve results and reduce the amount of tissue damage caused. Because the procedure is less invasive, patients experience: Faster surgery recovery time;/ Less pain and discomfort post-operatively;/ Reduced risk of skin infection;/ Minimal scars;/ Robot-assisted surgery is increasingly being recommended as the best way to surgically treat kidney tumors smaller than 4 cm, in order to remove the tumor and preserve the remaining renal parenchyma. This surgical procedure is called partial nephrectomy. Partial nephrectomy may also be indicated for kidney cancers larger than 4 cm, provided that it is technically possible and the tumor is confined to the kidney. Regarding systemic pharmacological therapy in kidney cancer, it may be necessary to undergo immunotherapy or chemotherapy Kidney tumors are usually radioresistant. However, high doses such as those used by Cyberknife can be used in certain situations when surgery is contraindicated. In our units we also use the Guided Image Radiotherapy technique, which allows us to control the effects of treatments and their clinical evolution with greater precision. For individuals at risk of surgical complications due to other health problems and who have a tumor smaller than 4 cm, the surgeon may choose to ablate the tumor using one of the following techniques: -Cryosurgery– the surgeon introduces an instrument into the tumor through a small incision to freeze it and thus destroy it. -Radiofrequency ablation – the surgeon introduces a probe through the skin or through a small incision into the tumor. The probe contains small electrodes that destroy kidney cancer cells through heat. If a kidney is removed in its entirety, the remaining kidney can usually perform the functions of both kidneys. However, if it is not functioning properly, dialysis treatments may be necessary. This period begins after the therapeutic plan drawn up for you by your care team.  In the defollow-up query, the following is performed: a review of recent medical history and physical examination;/ exams are requested to screen for cancer recurrence, such as blood tests and imaging tests such as tomography, MRI, PET.;/ recommendations are made for adopting a healthier lifestyle that includes nutrition, exercise, smoking cessation, among other recommendations;/ Patients who have had kidney cancer may be monitored regularly by a urologist or oncologist. At CUF Oncologia we believe that all patients should have the right to second opinions. To this end, we are completely available for patients to have at hand, in addition to a report that can be requested from your team, all paper and digital exams (CDs) necessary to obtain a second opinion that may be useful.

Cancer of the testicle,"//What is it?// Testicular cancer is the most common cancer in men aged 15 to 35 and accounts for 1% of all male cancers. Testicular cancer can occur in the tissue of one or both testicles. Although the cause is unknown, it is much more common in Caucasians than in other ethnicities and its incidence has been increasing. Testicular cancer is one of the tumors where it is possible to obtain a high cure rate, even in advanced stages. //Prevention// There are no prevention strategies for testicular cancer, nor are there any practices in place for prevention and early diagnosis. You should be aware of any symptoms and consult your doctor if they appear. //Risk Factors// Any behavior or condition that increases your risk of developing a disease is a risk factor. Just because one or more risk factors apply to you, it does not necessarily mean that you will develop testicular cancer. Similarly, testicular cancer can occur in men who have no known risk factors. It is not yet possible to find the causes of testicular cancer, but some risk factors are known. The main risk factors are as follows: Testicle that has not descended into the scrotum (cryptorchidism);;/ History of cancer of the other testicle;;/ Family history of testicular cancer;;/ History of hypospadias;;/ Decreased spermatogenesis and infertility.;/ //Symptoms// Testicular cancer symptoms are not exclusive, they can appear in other diseases. Just because you have one or more of the symptoms described here does not mean you have testicular cancer.  You should be alert and consult your doctor if you have the following symptoms: A painless mass, swelling, fluid buildup, or discomfort in the scrotum;;/ A pain in the pelvic or groin area.;/ //Who should I contact?// If you suspect cancer, due to symptoms or a complementary diagnostic test that presents an alteration, you can consult a Urologist, or alternatively, less commonly, an Oncologist. Meet our team of experts Almost all testicular cancers start in the germ cells. There are two types of testicular cancer: Seminomas - these cancers originate in the cells that produce sperm; Non-seminomas- these cancers originate in other cells in the testicle. These cancers are often epithelial, which is why they are called non-seminomas and are generally carcinomas. They may be embryonal or yolk sac carcinomas, or choriocarcinomas. They may also be teratomas, which are not epithelial //Diagnosis and Staging// To diagnose testicular cancer, the following tests are usually performed: Collection of clinical history and performance of physical examination with more detailed examination of the lymph nodes and testicles;;/ Ultrasound of the testicle;;/ Assessment of the presence of tumor markers in serum: tumor markers help doctors understand how the disease is behaving, both during treatment and during follow-up. Not all cancers produce substances that we can detect in the blood, but in the case of testicular cancer there are three substances that serve as tumor markers: alpha fetoprotein (αFP), chorionic gonadotropin (βHCG) and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH);;/ Testicular removal surgery - This surgical procedure, called radical inguinal orchidectomy, involves removing the testicle through an incision in the groin. An incision should not be made through the scrotum to take a biopsy.;/ Partial orchidectomy surgery – this surgery can be performed in the presence of bilateral testicular tumor, tumor in a single testicle and tumors with a volume of less than 30% of the testicular mass. There may be a need for extemporaneous anatomopathological examination.;/ The material collected during surgery is subsequently analysed by Pathological Anatomy under a microscope and the cells are evaluated. Only the evaluation of the cells allows the diagnosis of testicular cancer to be established. Staging is the process by which we determine whether cancer cells have spread to other nearby or more distant structures. The information obtained through the staging process determines the stage of the disease, which is essential for planning treatment. When confirming the diagnosis of testicular cancer, the next step is to stage the disease through imaging tests such as magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography to check its extent. Exams such as PET can also be requested. //Treatment// Testicular cancer is curable, especially when detected early. Some variables affect the prognosis of testicular cancer, in addition to the stage of the disease, namely: Levels of alpha fetoprotein (αFP), chorionic gonadotropin (βHCG) and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH);/ The tumor subtype;/ The presence of metastases;/  Available treatments Radical orchidectomy;/ Partial orchidectomy;/ Retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy;/ Chemotherapy;/ External radiotherapy;/ Robotic Radiosurgery - CyberKnife;/  Based on the staging of testicular cancer, it is possible to determine the most appropriate treatment.

Uterine cancer,"//What is it?// Uterine cancer is one of the tumors of the female reproductive system that forms in the tissues of the uterus. The uterus is a pear-shaped, hollow organ of the gynecological system where the fetus grows. The wall of the uterus has two layers of tissue: an inner layer, or lining, called the endometrium, and an outer muscular layer, the myometrium. The endometrium is the epithelial tissue that lines the inside of the uterus. It is located in the lower abdomen behind the bladder. //Prevention// Unlike cervical cancer, the use of a screening test is not recommended for endometrial cancer. Cervical cytology (used in cervical cancer screening) is not used to detect endometrial cancer, however, some vaginal cytology tests can detect abnormal endometrial cells, although this is not their purpose. Vaginal bleeding is the most common sign of endometrial cancer. After menopause there should be no vaginal bleeding of any kind, so its presence is not normal and if it occurs you should consult your doctor immediately. In premenopause, if a woman has vaginal bleeding between periods, or If you have heavy menstrual vaginal bleeding, you should also see your doctor. Endometrial cancer is not the only cause of vaginal bleeding and your doctor will do a more thorough examination to determine the source of this abnormal bleeding. //Risk factors// It is currently unclear why endometrial cancer occurs, but some risk factors have been identified that increase the likelihood of developing endometrial carcinoma. It is important to note that some women with these risk factors will never develop endometrial cancer, while other women without any of these risk factors may develop an endometrial tumor. Most endometrial cancers need estrogens to grow. Without estrogens they stop growing or grow more slowly. Thus, with some exceptions, endometrial cancer risk factors are linked to estrogens. The main risk factors for endometrial cancer are: - Aging: The risk of developing endometrial cancer increases as women get older. - Genes: Women with Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colon Cancer (HNCPC) syndrome, also called Lynch syndrome, have a high risk of developing colon and endometrial cancer. One in two women with this syndrome will develop endometrial cancer at some point in their lives. This syndrome is an inherited disease and is responsible for up to 5% of endometrial cancer cases. - Family history of endometrial cancer: having a first-degree relative (mother, sister, daughter) who has had endometrial cancer increases the risk of having endometrial cancer. - Personal history of breast or ovarian cancer: Having had breast or ovarian cancer increases the risk of having endometrial carcinoma. In women with a personal history of breast cancer, the risk is also higher if the patient has been treated with tamoxifen. Tamoxifen has a stimulating effect on the endometrium that may help the development or growth of endometrial cancer. - Personal history of certain gynecological diseases: Polycystic ovary syndrome: this syndrome produces higher than normal estrogen levels and therefore increases the risk of endometrial cancer. - Endometrial hyperplasia: in the case of simple hyperplasia, the risk of suffering from cancer is very low, but in atypical hyperplasia it is high. - Exposure to estrogens without or with insufficient amounts of progesterone, for example: the use or ingestion of external estrogens, especially in the form of hormonal therapies after menopause. - Overweight and obesity: being overweight or obese increases the risk of endometrial cancer, as it modifies the level of estrogen and its effects. - Diabetes: women with diabetes have a higher risk of endometrial cancer - Arterial hypertension: it has been suggested that hypertension is associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer, although the mechanism of this possible association is not yet clear. There are other factors associated with increased risk (alcohol consumption, lack of physical activity) or decreased risk (consumption of phytoestrogens found in soy, coffee, legumes...) of endometrial cancer, but studies are contradictory. //Symptoms// The symptoms of uterine cancer are not exclusive, they can appear in other diseases, namely benign tumors or other pathologies. Just because you have one or more of the symptoms described here does not mean you have uterine cancer. You should be alert and consult your doctor if you have the following symptoms: Non-menstrual uterine bleeding;/ Pain or difficulty urinating;/ Pain during sexual intercourse;/ Pelvic pain;/ Abnormal vaginal discharge;/ //Who should I contact?// If you suspect cancer, due to symptoms or a complementary diagnostic test that presents an alteration, you should always seek an Oncological Gynecologist. He will carry out a first clinical and imaging assessment, and will forward your case for discussion in a multidisciplinary team, which carries out a personalized assessment, and which will propose the best therapeutic option for each case.

The most common uterine cancer is cancer originating from endometrial cells - endometrial carcinoma. Another less common type is cancer originating from the cells in the muscular walls of the uterus, which is called desarcoma.  Uterine Sarcoma Uterine sarcoma is another type of cancer that forms in the body of the uterus. It forms in the muscle of the uterus (myometrium) or other tissues of the uterus. Although the treatment of uterine sarcoma and endometrial cancer has some similarities, the information presented here is valid for endometrial cancer but not for uterine sarcoma.  Endometrial Cancer Cancer that forms in the tissue lining the inside of the uterus. Most endometrial cancers are adenocarcinomas. Endometrial cancer usually occurs in women over 50 years of age and therefore after menopause, but in 25% of cases it can occur before menopause. //Diagnosis and Staging// The diagnosis of endometrial cancer is based on the following three tests: Clinical examination: Includes a gynecological pelvic examination, which will look for signs of the disease in the vagina, cervix, bladder and rectum, through palpation and visualization by inserting a speculum into the woman's vagina, to determine the location of the tumor and whether other organs are already affected.;/  Imaging: Includes performing a transvaginal ultrasound: the gynecologist or radiologist inserts a probe into the woman's vagina, allowing the endometrium to be visualized. If the endometrium shows thickening, the doctor may perform a biopsy. Other imaging tests may be performed, such as a chest X-ray, abdominal ultrasound, and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan to rule out the presence of distant metastases.;/  Histopathological examination: This examination will confirm the diagnosis of endometrial cancer and provide further information about its characteristics. The biopsy is usually performed by hysteroscopy (the most recommended method), which involves inserting a thin telescope into the uterus along with a special device to obtain the biopsy. It can also be obtained through curettage and/or with a device called a Pipelle.;/ Staging is the process by which we assess the extent of the disease in the uterus, nearby structures, or distant organs. The information obtained through the staging process determines the stage of the disease, which is essential for planning treatment. The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) 2008 staging system for carcinoma of the uterine body is as follows: Stage IA - Does not invade or invades less than half of the myometrium Stage IB - Invasion equal to or greater than half of the myometrium Stage II - The tumor invades the cervical stroma but does not extend beyond the uterus Stage III - local and/or regional spread of the tumor Stage IIIA - Tumor invades the serosa of the uterine body and/or the adnexa Stage IIIB - vaginal metastasis and/or involvement of parametria Stage IIIC -Metastases in pelvic and/or para-aortic lymph nodes Stage IIIC1 - positive pelvic nodes Stage IIIC2 - positive para-aortic nodes with or without positive pelvic nodes Stage IV - Tumor invasion of the bladder and/or intestinal mucosa and/or distant metastases Stage IVA - Tumor invasion of the bladder and/or intestinal mucosa Stage IVB - Distant metastases, including intra-abdominal and/or inguinal nodes. //Treatment// Taking into account the staging of the endometrial cancer, the multidisciplinary clinical team will assess the best treatment to follow. Options may include surgery, radiation treatment, and chemotherapy. Stage I – at this stage the treatment option is surgery; Stages II and III – in both stages, treatment options include surgery and radiotherapy; Stage IV – at this stage, treatment options include chemotherapy and possibly radiotherapy. After finishing treatment, your doctor will schedule follow-up appointments. During these consultations, a clinical examination will be carried out, which will include an examination of the pelvic and rectal areas. Imaging tests such as a CT scan or pelvic MRI or PET/Scan may be requested. Even if you received the best treatment available at the time of diagnosis, there is always the possibility that the cancer will return. This situation, called relapse/recurrence, occurs most frequently in the first few years after treatment, and so a typical follow-up program includes visits every 3-6 months during the first 2 years after treatment, then every 6-12 months from 3 to 5 years, and annually after 5 years. In case of recurrence, the treatment that will be proposed will depend on the extent of the recurrence and the type of treatment already carried out. Tumors that recur in distant organs are considered metastatic cancers and can be treated with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.

Bone cancer,"//What is it?// Primary bone cancer –osteosarcoma- is a malignant tumor originating from cells that form bone, osteoblasts, and can appear, above all, in the knee or upper part of the arm. It is the most common bone cancer, especially in adolescents. It may rarely originate from non-bone tissue. Secondary bone cancers are bone lesions that are formed by cells originating in other organs that circulate through the vessels and implant themselves in the bones. This condition is called bone metastases, common with prostate, lung and breast cancer. Secondary bone cancer is much more common than primary bone tumors. As these are rare tumors, they must be treated by experienced teams, both in diagnosis and in the treatment of different types of cancer. //Prevention// Patients with familial syndromes or diseases referred to in risk factors may be subject to closer surveillance by the attending physician. //Risk Factors// Any behavior or condition that increases your risk of developing a disease is a risk factor. Just because one or more risk factors apply to you, it does not necessarily mean that you will develop bone cancer. Likewise, bone cancer can occur in people who have no known risk factors.  The causes of bone cancer have not yet been found, but some risk factors are known. The main risk factors are: Treatment with radiotherapy or chemotherapy, namely alkylating agents, especially in children;;/ Change in the retinoblastoma gene;;/ Paget's disease;;/ Anemia de Diamond-Blackfan;;/ Genetic cancer syndromes such as Rothmund-Thomson, Bloom, Li-Fraumeni and Werner;/ //Symptoms// Bone cancer symptoms are not exclusive and can occur in other diseases. Having one or more of the symptoms described here does not mean that you have bone cancer. You should be alert and consult your doctor if you have the following symptoms: pain and swelling in a bone;/ joint pain;/ fracture without trauma;/ //Who should I contact?// If you suspect cancer, due to symptoms or a complementary diagnostic test that shows an abnormality, you should contact an Orthopedist with experience in osteosarcoma tumors, or alternatively, less commonly, an Oncologist. Meet our team of experts Make your contact request so we can follow up from the first moment. If you prefer, you can schedule an appointment via our toll-free line. There are several types of primary bone cancer according to its location and cell type. Bone cancers can appear in any type of bone tissue, whether in osteoid, which is compact bone, or in cartilaginous bone, which is resistant and flexible.  Osteosarcoma This type of primary bone cancer is most common in children and adolescents or young adults. It can appear in any of the 2016 bones in the human body, but about 50% appear near the knee. It can rarely originate in non-bone tissue.  Condrosarcoma It is one of the most common types of primary tumors and originates from the cartilaginous tissue that lines the ends of the bones and forms the joints. It is located in the pelvis, upper limb and shoulder.  Malignant fibrous histiocytoma It is rare and also originates in the cells that form new bone, just like osteosarcoma. Therefore, both have the same form of treatment. Bone cancers weaken the bone, making it more prone to fractures.  Sarcoma de Ewing Tumors in this family can also appear in bones or other tissues and are also treated in a similar way. The cell that gives rise to these tumors is not certain, but it could be nervous tissue and not bone. The most common locations are the spine, pelvis and less frequently the upper and lower limbs.  //Diagnosis and Staging// In a patient with a clinical history and clinical examination suspicious of bone cancer, several tests should be performed: -Radiological examinations: Conventional radiography, computed tomography and MRI; -Bone biopsy: collection through needle biopsy of fragments of the injured bone. Only when the material collected through a biopsy is observed under a microscope is it possible to confirm the diagnosis of bone cancer. Staging is the process by which we determine whether bone cancer cells have spread to other nearby or more distant structures. The information obtained through the staging process determines the stage of the disease, which is essential for planning treatment.  In the case of bone cancer, the following may be requested, if they have not already been requested: Imaging Exams: Conventional X-ray, CT and MRI;;/ Nuclear Medicine Exams: Bone scintigraphy and PET.;/  Bone cancer can spread to other parts of the body in two ways: By contiguity- invading through the surrounding normal tissue;;/ From a distance - through the circulatory systems: blood or lymphatic.;/  The stages of bone cancer have implications for treatment and can be classified as follows: Localized: Has not invaded or metastasized outside the bone where it originated. This disease can be removed surgically;;/ Metastatic: The disease has spread to other organs. The most frequent site of osteosarcoma metastases is the lungs, the next site in order of frequency is the bones.;/ //Treatment// The multidisciplinary clinical team will evaluate the best treatment to follow. There are some initial factors that can affect the prognosis of this disease and determine therapeutic choices: - Location of the tumor and whether there is disease in more than one bone; - The size of the tumor; - The type of tumor, based on the evaluation by Pathological Anatomy of the type of cells that gave rise to it; - The presence of genetic diseases in the patient; - The extent of the disease, that is, whether the tumor has metastasized to other parts of the body; - If the bones are still growing; - The age and general condition of the patient; - Whether the cancer is a new diagnosis or a recurrence of a previous cancer. After a meeting of the multidisciplinary team, treatment options may include surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy: Localized disease – options usually include surgery, and chemotherapy before and after surgery as neoadjuvant treatment; if it is not possible to remove the entire tumor surgically, radiotherapy may be used; Metastatic Disease – The most common locations for bone cancer to metastasize to are other bones and the lungs. In these cases, treatment options include: Chemotherapy followed by surgery to remove the primary bone tumor and its metastases; chemotherapy is usually given again after surgery;;/ Surgery to remove the primary tumor from the bone, followed by chemotherapy, and surgery to remove the metastases.;/ Radiotherapy;/ Patients who have had bone cancer may be monitored by the oncologist or surgeon if they have undergone surgery. Patients must be observed during the consultation and the tests to be requested are imaging tests and blood tests, depending on the clinician's decision. Cancer treatment can cause adverse cardiac effects. Monitoring patients in Cardiology is essential to prevent cardiovascular disease. Cancer treatment can cause changes in the image that affect the self-esteem of the cancer patient. But it is possible to minimize them.

Cancro neuroendocrino,"//What is it?// Neuroendocrine cancer originates from neuroendocrine cells. Given the dispersed location of these cells in epithelia, neuroendocrine cancer can appear in numerous locations throughout the body. The most common is neuroendocrine cancer of the digestive tract or pancreas, but these cells can also give rise to neuroendocrine cancers in the respiratory and genitourinary systems, although less frequently. Neuroendocrine cancers are rare and grow slowly. Most originate in the appendix, small intestine or rectum. Sometimes more than one tumor forms. //Prevention// Patients with familial syndromes or diseases referred to in Risk Factors may be subject to closer surveillance by the attending physician. //Risk Factors// Any behavior or condition that increases your risk of having a disease is a risk factor. If one or more risk factors apply to you, it does not mean that you will necessarily develop neuroendocrine cancer. Likewise, neuroendocrine cancer can appear in individuals who have no known risk factors. It has not yet been possible to find the causes of neuroendocrine cancer, but some risk factors are known. The main risk factors are: Genetic diseases: Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1);;/ Neurofibromatosis type 1.;/  Diseases that affect the stomach's ability to secrete acid: Atrophic gastritis;;/ Pernicious anemia;;/ Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.;/ //Symptoms// The symptoms of neuroendocrine cancer are not exclusive, they can appear in other diseases. Just because you have one or more of the symptoms described here does not mean you have neuroendocrine cancer. The growth of neuroendocrine cancer and the hormones it produces can cause symptoms. Some neuroendocrine cancers, particularly those of the stomach or appendix, may not cause symptoms. Neuroendocrine cancers are often diagnosed as an occasional finding during the investigation of other diseases. Neuroendocrine cancers of the small intestine (duodenum, jejunum and ileum), colon and rectum cause symptoms because of the way they grow or because of the hormones they produce. You should be alert and consult your doctor if you experience the following symptoms or a combination of them: Abdominal pain;/ Constipation;/ Diarrhea;/ Change in stool color;/ Nausea;/ Vomiting;/ Jaundice;/ Heartburn (burning sensation);/ Weight loss for no reason;/ Huge tiredness;/ Feeling of bloating;/ Diarrhea;/ Unreasonable weight loss;/ Bleeding in the stool;/ Pelvic pain;/ Constipation;/ The hormones produced by neuroendocrine cancer of the digestive tract are usually destroyed by substances produced in the liver called enzymes. If hormones produced by neuroendocrine cancer enter circulation or if the liver or other distant organs have already been invaded by neuroendocrine cancer and are unable to destroy them, patients may experience symptoms related to the presence of these hormones in the blood. This is called carcinoid syndrome and its symptoms are as follows: Red face and neck or feeling of increased temperature;/ Abdominal pain;/ Feeling of bloating;/ Diarrhea;/ Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing;/ Increased heart rate;/ //Who should I contact?// If you suspect cancer, due to symptoms or a complementary diagnostic test that presents an alteration, you should consult your attending physician, a Gastroenterologist, a General Surgeon or alternatively, less commonly, an Oncologist. Make your contact request so we can follow up from the first moment. If you prefer, you can schedule an appointment via our toll-free line. There are several types of neuroendocrine cancers according to their location and type of cells that are at their genesis: Carcinoid of the lung or digestive tract;/ Pancreatic neuroendocrine cancer;/ Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid gland;/ Merckel cell carcinoma or neuroendocrine skin cancer;/ Adrenal pheochromocytoma;/ Small cell carcinoma of the lung or genitourinary system;/ Large cell carcinoid, most common in the lung;/ On this site we essentially address neuroendocrine cancers of the digestive tract and pancreas, the most common. //Diagnosis and Staging// In a patient with a clinical history and clinical examination suspected of neuroendocrine cancer, several tests should be performed: - General tests that include a tumor marker called chromogranin A and urine tests; - Radiological examinations that may include ultrasound, CT scan, Magnetic Resonance Imaging; - Nuclear medicine exams that may include positron emission scintigraphy (PET) and also a specific scintigraphy of neuroendocrine cancers with metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG); -Endoscopic examinations to look for a lesion from which it is possible to collect a sample through a biopsy. Only after observation under a microscope of biological material from a tumor by an anatomopathologist can an unequivocal diagnosis of neuroendocrine cancer be made. Staging is the process by which we determine whether neuroendocrine cancer cells have spread to other nearby or distant structures. The information obtained through the staging process determines the stage of the disease, which is essential for planning treatment. In the case of neuroendocrine cancer, the following may be requested, if they have not already been: Radiological examinations which may include ultrasound, CT scan, MRI;/  Nuclear medicine exams that may include positron emission scintigraphy (PET) and even a specific scintigraphy of neuroendocrine cancers with metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG).;/ The stages of neuroendocrine cancer have implications for treatment and can be classified as follows: Localized neuroendocrine cancer – these are neuroendocrine cancers that are located at the level of the digestive tract and regional lymph nodes. They never have distant spread with metastases;/  Metastatic neuroendocrine cancer - disseminated or metastatic neuroendocrine cancers, particularly in the liver and/or lungs.;/ //Treatment// Taking into account the staging and origin of the neuroendocrine cancer, the multidisciplinary clinical team will evaluate the best treatment to be followed. - Localized neuroendocrine cancer – the treatment option is surgery; - Metastatic neuroendocrine cancer – treatment options may include: Surgery to remove most resectable tumor;/ Hormonal treatment with a hormone analogue called somatostatin, which counteracts the effects of hormones produced by neuroendocrine cancer;/ Radiotherapy;/ Chemotherapy that can be systemic or local. Systemic therapy is injected into the veins in the arm and goes throughout the body, which is why we call it systemic. Local liver chemotherapy is injected directly into the hepatic artery (liver);/ - Medical therapy against the various symptoms of carcinoid syndrome. Patients who have had neuroendocrine cancer may be monitored by the oncologist or surgeon if they have undergone surgery. Patients must be observed during the consultation and the tests to be requested are imaging tests and blood tests, depending on the doctor's decision. The digestive system is made up of a set of organs that form the digestive tract, connecting the mouth to the anus, through which food passes from being chewed until only the waste resulting from digestion remains, which is eliminated through feces. Lining each of the organs in the tube are epithelial cells that form the mucous membranes of all these different anatomical regions. Neuroendocrine cells are scattered throughout the mucous membranes of the digestive tract, most commonly between the stomach and the colon, particularly in the small intestine. Neuroendocrine cells are also found in the mucous membranes of the respiratory and genitourinary systems. Neuroendocrine cells have a different embryonic origin from other epithelial cells, forming close to the tissue that will give rise to the central nervous system and then migrating to these locations. For this reason, neuroendocrine cells are found throughout the respiratory, digestive and genitourinary systems. The digestive system has the largest number of these cells in the body. These cells have mixed characteristics: on the one hand, they are similar to the cells that form the nervous system – neurons – and, on the other, they are similar to the hormone-producing cells of the endocrine glands. The function of these cells is to produce hormones that control the secretion of the mucous membranes where they are inserted and to control the movement of the muscular layers of these organs.

Candidiasis,"//What is it?// Candidiasis is an infection caused by a fungus of the genus Candida. There are several species, but the dominant one is Candida albicans, which can cause inflammation in almost any part of the body. Candidiasis infections can be superficial, affecting the skin and mucous membranes, or invasive, and are more common in patients who are weakened by other diseases or undergoing medical or surgical treatments. This fungus is present in the oropharynx in 30% to 55% of healthy young adults and can be detected in 40% to 65% of normal fecal flora. Candida Albicans is considered opportunistic because it only causes infection when the host is in poor health. Genital candidiasis is one of its most common forms, affecting the vagina or penis. The Candida fungus normally resides on the skin and intestines. From these areas it can spread to the genitals. However, it is not usually transmitted sexually. Candidiasis has become very common, mainly due to the increasing use of antibiotics, oral contraceptives and other medications that modify the conditions of the vagina, favoring the growth of the fungus. It is more common among pregnant women, those who are menstruating and those with diabetes. Much less frequently, the use of drugs (such as corticosteroids or chemotherapy) and the presence of diseases that depress the immune system (such as AIDS) can facilitate infection. In 90% of women, vulvovaginal candidiasis is caused by Candida albicans. The other cases are caused by other species of Candida. About 75% will have at least one episode in their lifetime and 40% to 45% will have two or more. About 10% to 20% are asymptomatic carriers, and during pregnancy this can reach 40%. Invasive candidiasis encompasses a wide range of pathologies and tends to occur in critically ill patients. Its incidence has increased significantly in recent decades due to the increase in invasive procedures performed in hospital settings and new forms of immunodeficiency associated with organ transplants and viral infections (such as HIV/AIDS). This disease is a major cause of increased mortality, longer hospital stays and higher costs. //Symptoms// Symptoms will depend on the affected territory. In the case of female genital candidiasis, there is itching or irritation in the vagina and vulva and, occasionally, light, thick, odorless vaginal discharge. The vulva may become red from inflammation, and the vaginal wall becomes covered in a white cheese-like substance, although it may appear normal. Sexual intercourse can become painful. Candidiasis in men generally has no symptoms, but the end of the penis (the glans) and the foreskin may show signs of irritation and pain, especially after intercourse. Sometimes a small discharge appears from the penis. Its extremity and foreskin may be reddish in color, with small ulcerations or crusty vesicles and covered with a substance similar to white cheese. The cutaneous forms of candidiasis are manifested by the presence of an itchy rash with the formation of vesicles. When these become infected they become filled with pus. There may be forms of gastrointestinal infection (from the oropharynx to the esophagus), respiratory, urinary (bladder and kidneys), hepatic and invasive forms where several organs can be affected simultaneously, including the heart itself, the brain, the eyeball, the bones and joints. Each of these types of disease will present a different clinical picture and, likewise, the diagnosis and treatment must be differentiated. //Causes// These fungi are opportunistic agents and cause infection whenever the host's defenses are lowered. Thus, the use of medications (antibiotics, oral contraceptives, corticosteroids, chemotherapy), pregnancy, diabetes and all diseases that affect the immune system (such as HIV/AIDS) increase the risk of candidiasis. //Diagnosis// In the case of genital candidiasis, immediate diagnosis is possible by taking samples from the vagina or penis and examining them under a microscope. This is essentially a clinical procedure that can be confirmed in the laboratory by microscopic examination of fresh specimens and/or culture (in a culture medium specific for fungi). It is particularly important to document the frequency of episodes, establish the diagnosis and confirm it by culture. Depending on the location of the candidiasis, other complementary diagnostic methods may be requested to better characterize the severity of the infection. //Treatment// Treatment depends on the location of the infection and the patient's general condition, but is based on the use of antifungal medications. As this fungus can be resistant to some of these medications, it is important to first assess resistance patterns in order to select the most appropriate drugs. Antifungals can be used in the form of creams or ointments, orally or by injection, depending on the clinical picture. //Prevention// In the case of cutaneous forms, prevention involves keeping the skin clean and dry, appropriate use of antibiotics, adequate nutrition and a healthy lifestyle. Monitoring diseases that increase the risk of candidiasis, such as diabetes or HIV/AIDS infection, is essential. Manual Merck, 2009 Pereira, JM et al., Treatment of Invasive Candidiasis in Critically Ill Patients, Rev Port Med Int 2010; 17(1): 23-30 Review of Consensus on Vulvovaginal Infections, Brazilian Society of Gynecology, 2012 Jose A Hidalgo, Candidiasis, Medscape Reference, Agosto 2013 Load more;/ It's the genital area that we hear most about, but it can also affect the eyes and mouth.

Adhesive capsulitis,"//What is it?// It is a disease of unknown origin, more common in middle-aged women, which is manifested by predominantly nocturnal pain that disturbs sleep and a progressive restriction of shoulder mobility. Adhesive capsulitis or ""frozen shoulder"" is a disease of unknown cause. But it is known that women between 45 and 55 years old, diabetics or those with a family history of this pathology and people with thyroid problems are more likely to develop it. //Symptoms// Sometimes patients associate its onset with a traumatic episode. Others cite occasional pain in the shoulder, which does not prevent them from carrying out daily activities and which progressively turns into a disabling condition. In this pathology, the inflammatory process within the joint leads to a progressive reduction in the axillary cul-de-sac, shortening of all the ligaments, formation of adhesions (bridges between various structures) and an increase in the thickness of the capsule, which loses its distensibility. These factors cause a limitation of passive mobility (that which the examiner looks for in the patient), especially external rotation. Three phases of this disease are classically described: A phase that corresponds to the period of greatest inflammation of the joint. The patient feels pain predominantly at night that does not allow for peaceful sleep and a progressive reduction in mobility that prevents him from raising his arm and reaching behind his back, for example.;/ A frozen phase in which the pain decreases, but the reduction in flexibility and the inability to live a quality life remain.;/ A resolution phase in which the patient progressively regains movement.;/ It is a pathology considered self-limiting as it lasts for around two years. However, it is impossible to ask a patient with intense pain, who cannot sleep and who has significant mobility limitations, to wait in these circumstances for this period to end. More recently, the benign nature of its course has been challenged as it was found that a significant percentage of patients who followed the natural history of the disease present mobility limitations that interfere with their quality of life. //Causes// Adhesive capsulitis is a disease of unknown cause. //Diagnosis// In the initial phase, it is difficult to make a differential diagnosis between this pathology and acute subacromial impingement syndrome or calcific tendinopathy, but a careful examination, focusing on pain, signs of conflict and mobility restrictions, allows its recognition. Complementary examinations are of limited value in this disease. X-rays may be normal, while ultrasound sometimes shows inflammatory changes in the tendons. Magnetic resonance imaging indicates variations in the joint capsule compatible with the disease and inflammatory or structural changes in the tendons. //Treatment// The initial aim of treatment is to reduce pain. Most individuals have already tried various medications, without success, and also physiotherapy with little improvement. It is important to emphasize that when this pathological condition exists, it takes precedence over all other conditions that the shoulder may have. Therefore, if there is a rupture of the cuff demonstrated on the MRI, it is essential to restore mobility and only later, if the cuff rupture persists, then treat this condition. Intra-articular injection is the medical procedure with the greatest chance of controlling the inflammatory process, leading to a significant reduction in pain and creating the possibility of the patient regaining lost mobility with physiotherapy. The vast majority recover it this way. However, there is a minority who are left with pain or who, even without suffering, are unable to recover lost flexibility with physiotherapy. These patients are indicated for surgery. Although a technique for mobilizing the shoulder under anesthesia has been described in which the joint is forced, thus breaking the structures that first give way, this practice is not used. Surgical treatment is performed by arthroscopy. The objective is to release the joint capsule under direct vision, obtaining practically normal passive mobility. Therefore, at the end of the intervention, the patient no longer has the structural restriction that impedes their motor skills and must immediately begin recovery. The protocol involves placing a catheter (very thin tube) during anesthetic induction, which allows the shoulder and arm to be anesthetized. In the immediate post-operative period, it is possible to demonstrate the mobility achieved. In the following days, bi-daily physiotherapy is performed under loco-regional anesthesia (of the shoulder and arm), thus facilitating the maintenance of the flexibility achieved. Physiotherapy treatments can be continued for another three months, daily in the initial phase, subsequently reducing the frequency as mobility gains continue. Most likely, in the end, the individual will regain motor skills that are very close to normal. The remaining restrictions are not impediments to any activities of daily living. //Prevention// As one of the most common causes is immobilization during recovery from surgery, fracture or stroke, it is important to define active and passive exercises that prevent this prolonged immobility.

Carcinoma,"//What is it?// There are two types of carcinomas, with distinct characteristics: basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). //Basal cell carcinoma// //How does basal cell carcinoma manifest itself?// It may appear as a wound that does not heal, as a scab that when removed bleeds easily and forms a scab again, a small nodule or a pinkish or brownish spot that progressively increases in size.  //What are the causes of basal cell carcinoma?// Ultraviolet (UV) rays received directly from sun exposure or tanning beds are the main cause of this disease. This type of radiation can, over time, damage the genetic code (DNA) of skin cells, giving rise to tumor cells.  //How is basal cell carcinoma diagnosed?// A dermatologist should be consulted to analyze a wound that bleeds easily or does not heal within about two weeks, a wound that becomes crusted repeatedly without ever healing, or a scar in a place where there was no previous injury, to assess whether it can correspond to a carcinoma.  //What are the complications of having basal cell carcinoma?// There is a risk of having a BCC again even if the previous one has been completely removed or an increased danger of having another type of skin neoplasm related to sun exposure. Usually, this carcinoma destroys locally and can, very rarely, spread to other parts of the body.  //How is basal cell carcinoma treated?// There are a number of treatment modalities that are selected according to each case, depending on the individual characteristics of the patient, the location and type of BCC. The most common are curettage, electrofulguration, simple surgery, Mohs surgery, freezing and topical medications. //Squamous cell carcinoma// //What is squamous cell carcinoma (or squamous cell carcinoma)?// It is a type of skin cancer that is distinct from melanoma and basal cell carcinoma (also called basal cell carcinoma) and rarely causes problems if detected and treated early. If not, it can grow in size and spread to other areas.  //How does squamous cell carcinoma manifest?// Although squamous cell carcinoma appears more frequently in areas exposed to the sun, it can appear in other locations, such as the mouth, anus or genitals. The appearance of the tumor is varied: a red, firm nodule that bleeds frequently; a stain that peels off easily and doesn't go away; an ulceration that appears on a scar; a wound that does not heal; or a lesion or white plaque in the mouth. Skin changes can be difficult to notice, especially if there are other mutations resulting from sun damage.  //What causes squamous cell carcinoma?// They result from UV radiation received from exposure to the sun or in solariums, in areas of exposed skin mainly on the head, neck, chest, back, ears, lips, arms, legs and hands. It may also be associated with prolonged exposure to chemicals such as arsenic and have a hereditary cause.  //What are the risk factors for having squamous cell carcinoma?// This tumor is associated with prolonged and cumulative exposure to ultraviolet radiation and usually appears in areas of the body exposed to the sun.  //How is squamous cell carcinoma diagnosed?// Some squamous cell carcinomas can be difficult to detect (especially in the early stages), however, the sooner they are identified and treated, the better the prognosis. A dermatologist should be consulted if you have a wound that does not heal or a scab that does not go away.  //What are the complications of having squamous cell carcinoma?// When treated early, this type of tumor rarely causes complications. If not cured, it can destroy the surrounding normal skin, spread to lymph nodes, and involve other organs.  //If you have already had squamous cell carcinoma, is it possible to have another one?// Yes, if you have already had squamous cell carcinoma, you are more likely to have another one. That is why you should see a dermatologist regularly.  //What is the treatment for squamous cell carcinoma?// Most squamous cell carcinomas can be completely removed with minor surgery. Treatment is defined in each case, depending on the size of the tumor, its location, and its aggressiveness, and may include one or a combination of several techniques: simple surgery, Mohs surgery, laser treatment, freezing, radiation and/or topical medications. //Prevention// You should avoid sun exposure during the hours of greatest radiation intensity, wear protective clothing or photoprotection in unprotected areas whenever you practice outdoor activities, avoid tanning beds and medications that can make your skin more sensitive to the sun, perform self-examination of your skin and undergo periodic clinical evaluations. In summer, achieving healthy, tanned skin is a difficult task. Is it possible with self-tanners? The sun is part of our life. It is a source of heat, a generator of well-being and a regulator of biological rhythms. Furthermore, it is essential for the synthesis of vitamin D Due to excessive optimism, ignorance or simple haste, we tend to make some mistakes when it comes to sun protection.

Tooth decay,"//What is it?// Tooth decay is a very common disease, affecting almost 90% of the population. Its frequency is so high that it has been considered by the World Health Organization as a serious public health problem that affects people of all ages, regardless of race, gender or social status. In fact, no one is immune to the disease. In addition to the discomfort it causes, it harms general health by making chewing difficult, altering the development of the body and facial appearance, and can even cause speech disorders and lead to infectious complications. It is caused by the action of some bacteria that can lead to partial or total destruction of the tooth. Available studies suggest that diets high in sugar may be one of the causes of this common disease. Despite its frequency, there has been a substantial improvement in the oral health of Portuguese people in recent years, which allows us to admit that education and awareness efforts have yielded good results. For example, at age 12, the percentage of children free from cavities nearly tripled between 1983 and 2006. //Symptoms// The process is generally slow and the beginning is marked by the appearance of a white spot on the surface of the enamel that progresses to form a small cavity. Through this, the bacteria quickly reach the dentin (less hard than enamel) which is easily dissolved by the acids produced by the bacteria. During the initial stages (small cavities) no significant symptoms are detected. In the more advanced stages (deeper cavities) discomfort arises with increased sensitivity and bad breath or pain in the presence of different types of stimuli (hot, cold or sweet) or even the appearance of very intense spontaneous pain, which means that the cavity has reached the dentin, causing increasingly worse symptoms as it becomes deeper. //Causes// It's normal to have bacteria in your mouth, which convert food into acids. Bacteria, acids, food debris and saliva combine to form a thick substance that adheres to patients: plaque. It begins to form 20 minutes after a meal and, if not properly removed, can cause several changes to the gums and teeth. It is a disease of bacterial origin, involving the participation of several factors over a certain period of time for it to manifest itself clinically. In fact, the presence of bacteria in the mouth, associated with inadequate nutrition and poor oral hygiene, is a decisive factor in its development. When foods containing carbohydrates (such as sweets, cakes, chocolates, gum, among others) are ingested, bacteria decompose them, forming acids that dissolve the mineral content of the teeth, thus causing cavities. This effect is more evident when these foods are eaten very frequently outside of meals or at night, before bed. Not all teeth are affected in the same way, and some are more susceptible. Newly erupted molars and premolars, which, due to their more irregular shape, allow food debris to lodge more easily and for longer, are teeth that are more prone to developing cavities. //Diagnosis// The diagnosis is simple and results from direct observation of the teeth. In the initial phase it is difficult to detect it and, therefore, a regular visit to the dentist is essential. Signs that should make you suspect its presence are changes in color, white, yellowish, brownish or black spots on the top of the teeth (grooves and cracks). Cavities located between the teeth are even more difficult to identify and can be discovered when flossing, which gets stuck or breaks in their presence. Sometimes it may be necessary to take an x-ray. //Treatment// There are several possible options, such as fillings, crowns or root canal treatments. The dentist, depending on the patient's condition, will define the best strategy for each case. //Prevention// Here are some simple rules that help prevent this condition; perform correct daily oral hygiene; brush your teeth at least twice a day with a toothpaste rich in fluoride after meals. Nighttime brushing is the most important, and then you should not eat any more food. This is because during the night, salivary secretion decreases and, therefore, defenses against food debris and bacteria are reduced. You should use dental floss between your teeth at least once a day, preferably at night; maintain a balanced diet and avoid “picking”; Whenever brushing after a main meal is not possible, chew sugar-free gum, even though this practice never replaces it. It is also very important to maintain the habit of regular consultations with the dentist, who may recommend, whenever necessary, the use of a fluoride supplement or the sealing of fissures. The ideal rhythm will be every six months. An early diagnosis is also important because it allows intervention and reversal of the situation by stimulating the remineralization of the tooth structure, without the need to lose it.

Childhood cataract,"//What is it?// Childhood cataracts are an opacity/loss of transparency of the crystalline lens (transparent lens, located inside the eye, behind the pupil), which occurs at birth (congenital) or during childhood. They function like opaque glass, and depending on their severity, can compromise the child's vision. It is one of the main causes of preventable blindness in pediatrics. It is estimated that worldwide, there are 200,000 children blind due to cataracts. Cataracts can be unilateral or bilateral, and may or may not be accompanied by other ocular anomalies. If it prevents good vision, it can secondarily cause strabismus (eye deviation) or nystagmus (constant eye tremor). Any of these symptoms should prompt observation by an ophthalmologist. The critical period of visual development occurs in the first years of life, as during this period adequate visual stimulation will lead to the correct development of vision. Loss of image sharpness during this period will lead to amblyopia (“lazy eye”). //Causes// Most childhood cataracts do not have a defined cause, although they may be hereditary, or have other causes (such as intrauterine infections, chromosomal syndromes or metabolic diseases). //Diagnosis// The diagnosis of the disease can be made through the red reflex test, carried out by the pediatrician in the maternity ward, or later, detected by the pediatrician or parents, as a white spot/opacity in the pupillary area. //Treatment// In the case of significant cataracts, where they significantly impede the normal visual development of the baby/child, treatment must be early and consists of surgery. However, not all cataracts require surgical treatment. Surgery is not free of risks/complications, so if the child has good visual development, the approach should be wait and see. Small cataracts, with partial obstruction of vision, can be monitored and receive a clinical approach, which may involve glasses, occlusion and/or the use of eye drops. The ophthalmologist should define which cases should be operated on. The time between diagnosis and surgical procedure is essential for therapeutic success. The more significant the cataract, the earlier its treatment should be initiated. The most appropriate period will be before the 12th week of life in cases of dense bilateral cataracts, and in unilateral cases before the 6th week of life. After surgery, the visual rehabilitation period begins. This rehabilitation consists of using glasses, contact lenses or occlusive treatment, so that the brain ""learns"" to see again. This involves prolonged ophthalmological monitoring throughout childhood. Results depend on early diagnosis and treatment. We seek the best possible vision, respecting the potential of each case.

Waterfalls,"//What is it?// Cataracts are the clouding of the lens of the eye - one of the structures in the eye responsible for focusing images and, as the name suggests, is transparent - causing a decrease in vision. When this transparency is lost, light passes through with greater difficulty and, as such, vision decreases. Cataracts can affect one or both eyes and can develop at different rates in each eye. They are not a contagious disease and therefore cannot be transmitted from one eye to the other. Most cataracts are age-related and correspond to a degenerative process, which is more common in older people. However, some degree of opacification of the lens may be evident after the age of 40, generally not associated with symptoms. Cataracts remain one of the leading causes of curable blindness in the world. In Portugal, it is estimated that around 170 thousand people suffer from this disease, with six in ten people over 60 showing signs. //Symptoms// The main manifestation of cataracts is a gradual reduction in vision, both near and far. In the early stages, the decrease in vision may not be apparent. As the lens changes color throughout the cataract formation process, becoming more yellow and brownish, vision takes on a different tone, making it difficult to distinguish certain colors. Other possible symptoms are: Presence of halos around lights;/ Decreased night vision;/ Double vision;/ Need to frequently change prescription glasses;/ //Causes// In addition to age, cataracts may be associated with other conditions or caused by other diseases: They can form after surgery for another eye problem, such as glaucoma, and are more common in diabetic patients.;/ Be triggered by eye trauma.;/ In some cases, they form during embryonic life and, if they are dense, they must be removed promptly so as not to compromise the normal development of vision during childhood.;/ Radiation therapy may increase the risk.;/ Smoking, alcohol, prolonged exposure to ultraviolet rays and an unbalanced diet are other factors to consider.;/ //Diagnosis// The diagnosis is simple, as the lens is easily accessible during ophthalmological examination. Thus, in a routine consultation, it is possible to observe it directly and assess the presence of cataracts. Determining visual acuity allows quantifying the degree of disability that the cataract is causing, an important aspect in surgical planning. Observation of the ocular fundus and measurement of ocular tension are important in order to exclude other forms of eye disease. //Treatment// In the initial stages, changing glasses, using more powerful lighting, using anti-reflective lenses or a magnifying glass for close-up can help reduce the symptoms of cataracts. However, the only definitive treatment is surgery, in which the cataract is removed and replaced with an artificial lens. The indication for surgery is related to the impact of cataracts on daily life; While the patient managed to have a normal life, it can be postponed as there is no urgency in the intervention. There are cases in which surgery is more urgent, for example, when the presence of cataracts prevents other eye treatments from being carried out or the correct observation of the ocular fundus, which is essential for monitoring patients with diabetic retinopathy or age-related macular degeneration. As mentioned, congenital cataracts are a medical and surgical emergency, and urgent removal is essential for normal vision development. When the cataract is bilateral, surgery is usually performed first on the eye with the worse vision, with the second eye operated on after an average interval of one to two months. Removal can be done by a process that involves its fragmentation by ultrasound, aspiration and introduction of an intraocular lens or it can be removed en bloc by making a larger incision, with an intraocular lens also being placed. This type of surgery is usually performed on an outpatient basis. //Prevention// The formation of cataracts is almost always an inevitable process related to the aging of ocular structures. A balanced diet rich in antioxidants can result in a lower risk of developing it. Wearing sunglasses is also important, as is not smoking. National Program for Health Vision, Directorate-General for Health, 2008 The National Eye Institute, 2009 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, Julho de 2013 University of Maryland Medical Center Elderly people suffer most from this vision problem and it is important that they are aware of the warning signs to identify cataracts early.

Anophthalmic cavity,"//What is it?// Space created after removal of the contents of the eyeball (evisceration) or the entire globe (enucleation). These procedures may be necessary in the context of serious infections with total and irreversible loss of vision, atrophy after multiple surgical procedures, trauma or intraocular tumours. In cases of extensive, aggressive periocular tumours that cannot be cured with less invasive therapies, exenteration may be indicated, which consists of removing the eyeball and other surrounding tissue. There are also cases of anophthalmia (absence of the eyeball) or microphthalmia (abnormally small globe) that result from changes in intrauterine development and are present from birth. The procedures for this disease are: Evisceration;/ Enucleation;/ Exenteration;/ Orbital rehabilitation;/ //Evisceration// Removal of intraocular contents while preserving the outer layers of the eye. An implant is usually placed to replace volume. //Enucleation// Removal of the entire eyeball. An implant is usually placed to replace volume. //Exenteration// A more extensive procedure, consisting of the removal of the eyeball and surrounding tissues (muscles, fat, lacrimal gland, eyelids). It is indicated for extensive and aggressive tumors. //Orbital rehabilitation// Assessment, rehabilitation and monitoring of anophthalmic sockets and ocular prostheses. The need for procedures to optimise the adaptation of the prosthesis and improve the aesthetics of the periocular area is decided on a case-by-case basis and may involve one or more procedures depending on whether it is necessary to replace volume (through implants or the patient's own fat), increase the space in the socket and/or correct the position of the upper or lower eyelid. Myopia, astigmatism and hyperopia often lead to the use of glasses or contact lenses. LASIK surgery can restore good vision. It's important to have sunglasses on hand all year round.

Headaches headaches,"//What is it?// Headaches (commonly known as headaches) are one of the most common clinical complaints and most people, at some stage in their lives, experience headaches of various causes. A headache can come on suddenly or gradually, affecting the entire head or just a specific area (above the eyes, for example). It can generally last between 30 minutes and several hours. //Causes// According to the International Headache Society, headaches can be characterized by: Primary: when they are not the result of another health problem; they are caused directly by hyperactivity or malfunctioning of the structures responsible for sensitivity to pain in the head (blood vessels, muscles, nerves) and changes in the chemical activity of the brain. Some of the most common types of headaches are:MigrainesCluster headachesTension headaches;/ Migraines;/ Cluster headache;/ Tension headache;/  Secondary: when headache symptoms can be attributed to another cause, the factors that may be at the origin of this type of headache are:Alcohol consumptionBrain tumorBlood clotsBrain hemorrhageGlaucomaConcussionDehydrationBruxismFlu (influenza)Medication overdosePanic attacksStroke;/ Alcohol consumption;/ Tumor cerebral;/ Blood clots;/ Cerebral hemorrhage;/ Glaucoma;/ Concussion;/ Dehydration;/ Bruxism;/ Gripe (influenza);/ Medication overdose;/ Panic attacks;/ Stroke;/ //Diagnosis// Recognizing and avoiding stimuli that can trigger attacks or increase pain is important for the diagnosis and treatment of headaches. Although they can occur spontaneously, in many cases the factors that lead to their onset or worsening can be identified. Diagnosis can usually be made by describing the symptoms, but if the origin is more complex, tests such as blood tests and imaging tests (x-ray, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging) may be necessary. //Treatment// To relieve headaches: Drink plenty of water;/ Rest, especially if the headache is associated with a cold or flu;/ Try to relax (stress can make headaches worse);/  Consult your physician if: Have recurring headaches;/ Common painkillers do not provide relief and the pain has worsened;/ Feel intense throbbing pain;/ If you feel sick, vomiting and/or sensitive to light or noise;/ If other associated symptoms appear, for example: weakness or numbness in the hands or arms;/  Contact an emergency room if the pain is severe and accompanied by: Jaw pain;/ Blurred or double vision or you are dizzy and confused;/ Have a fever, chills;/ If you have suffered any trauma - fall, blow, accident.;/ These signs may indicate seriousness and the need for urgent treatment. //Prevention// The consumption of alcoholic beverages is not recommended.;/ Keep regular intervals between meals (even if you don't have an appetite).;/ Don't sleep more than usual.;/ Avoid prolonged exposure to television or computer monitors; If there is a  need to continually use a screen (e.g. for professional reasons), you should take breaks regularly.;/ Medical News Today, March 2020 National Health Service UK, março 2020 Load more;/ We often don't realize that some headaches can originate in the muscles of the mouth and jaw, a condition known as temporomandibular dysfunction.

Blindness,"//What is it?// It is defined as the absence of visual perception caused by an eyeball and/or neurological defect. From a legal perspective, blindness exists when the better eye has a visual acuity of less than 1/10 and/or the visual field is less than 10º. With increasing life expectancy, there is a tendency for the number of blind people to increase. It is estimated that in 2020 there will be 75 million worldwide. In fact, the increase in the global population, life expectancy and the lack of adequate ophthalmological healthcare are the main causes for the increase in these numbers. The prevalence increases after age 60 and 90% of cases occur in the poorest nations. Childhood blindness is still a dramatic problem in underdeveloped countries, with an estimated 1.4 million blind children, 90% of whom live in places with greater needs. A person can be considered blind when they have no visual potential even though they can sometimes have a perception of light. Regarding the moment of its installation, it can be congenital (from zero to one year of age); early (one to three years); acquired (after 3 years). In congenital blindness there are no visual references (mental image) and, as such, the patient has an intellectualized representation of the environment (colors, perspectives, volumes, reliefs) without having a visual concept. In acquired blindness, the individual has all the visual heritage prior to blindness and, therefore, there is the ability to represent an object or an environment by analogy. Partial blindness (also referred to as legal or professional) includes people who are only able to count fingers at a short distance and those who can only perceive figures. Closer to total blindness are those who only have light perception or light projections. In the first case, there is only the distinction between light and dark; in the second, the individual is able to identify the direction from which the light comes. Total blindness, or amaurosis, corresponds to the complete loss of vision. //Symptoms// It is manifested by the inability to see. Depending on the degree, there may be a total absence of vision or perception of lights, movements or figures. The way in which it is experienced depends on the moment of its onset and whether or not there have been previous visual experiences. //Causes// Blindness occurs whenever there is a serious and profound deficiency in the eyes, in the nervous structures that conduct images to the brain or in the brain. Therefore, the cause can be very diverse and includes traumas, diseases, malformations, malnutrition, in addition to congenital and hereditary forms. It is important to know that around 80% of the causes can be prevented or treated. Cataracts and refractive errors (myopia, astigmatism, hyperopia) continue to be the most common cause, accounting for around two-thirds of cases worldwide. As situations are simple to approach, it is important that global plans for their treatment are implemented. Glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy are two other important causes of blindness for which there are very effective therapeutic resources, as long as they are started early. Trachoma (a bacterial eye infection) and vitamin A deficiency (which is prevented with adequate diets) are characteristic of poor societies, represent around 15% of blindness cases and are easily preventable. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), pigmentary retinopathy and congenital anomalies of the visual system are more difficult to prevent and treat. AMD has been increasing in prevalence in more developed societies, where life expectancy is higher, and, fortunately, new treatments have emerged that slow its progression and, in many cases, manage to regress the changes already present. //Diagnosis// The diagnosis is clinical, carried out by an ophthalmologist, sometimes in collaboration with other specialties such as Neurology, Neurosurgery, Endocrinology or Internal Medicine. There are several tests that can be requested taking into account the causes: from ophthalmological tests, laboratory tests or imaging studies. Currently, technology allows a very rigorous and detailed investigation of the eyeball and the entire visual system, allowing us to visualize it in detail and analyze its function. //Treatment// Most causes, such as cataracts or refractive errors, are easily treatable. For cataracts, treatment is surgical and relatively simple. For myopia, astigmatism and hyperopia, glasses or contact lenses can be used. Glaucoma is currently controlled with eye drops. Diabetic retinopathy can be managed with medication. In these cases, laser surgery can solve the problem. AMD can be controlled with intraocular medications or surgery. For all these situations, the key to success is a correct diagnosis as early as possible, in order to prevent diseases from progressing and causing irreparable damage. In untreatable forms of blindness, there are auxiliary means that allow residual vision to be enhanced, offering some quality of life and vision. On a social level, it is important to realize that a blind person is a fully valid element, capable of performing numerous functions with high quality and efficiency. The integration of these individuals into society is a moral and social imperative from which everyone can benefit and should be seen as an extension of medical treatment. //Prevention// Early diagnosis and correct treatment allow, in a large number of cases, to avoid blindness. Unfortunately, for many populations the conditions that allow for improved hygiene, nutrition and access to essential health care do not yet exist. Fundamental elements of prevention are a regular ophthalmology consultation, adequate nutrition, respect for safety rules at work, use of duly certified sunglasses and adequate control of diabetes and blood pressure. Of all, the elementary aspect is systematic screening, the only way to diagnose and treat diseases that can cause it early. It is worth remembering that blindness is not a disease in itself but the consequence of an illness or disorder that, in most cases, has not been properly controlled. By treating these diseases, blindness can be effectively prevented.

Cellulite,"//What is it?// Cellulite is a condition in which the skin has fatty deposits, giving it a lumpy appearance, resulting from an uneven distribution under the skin's surface. It is also commonly known as ""orange peel skin"". It is important not to confuse it with infectious cellulitis, which corresponds to a serious and potentially fatal bacterial skin infection, which results in areas of redness, heat and pain on the affected skin that tend to spread quickly. Cellulite is classified into three degrees: Grade 1: no symptoms and only detected by microscopic examinations;/ Grade 2: the skin becomes paler and less elastic;/ Grade 3: visible roughness on the skin;/ Although it can affect both genders, cellulite is very common in women - around 80% have some degree of cellulite - partly due to their greater tendency to accumulate certain types of fat. Although it is not a serious illness, it can affect the self-esteem and, therefore, the quality of life of people affected by it. //Symptoms// Cellulite is manifested by the presence of uneven-looking skin. In milder forms, cellulite is only detected when the skin is compressed. In more advanced cases, the skin forms very pronounced irregularities, with depressed and raised areas. It tends to be most evident on the buttocks and thighs and generally occurs after puberty, but can also be visible on the chest, lower abdomen and arms. //Causes// Cellulite results from the combined effect of the connective tissue cords that connect the skin to the muscle and the accumulation of fat under the skin. While the fat pushes against the skin, the connective tissue cords attach it to the deeper layers and this set of forces translates into an uneven surface. The causes of cellulite are poorly understood. These include: Hormonal factors (estrogens, insulin, norepinephrine, thyroid hormones, prolactin);/ Genetic factors;/ A diet very rich in fat, carbohydrates and salt and low in fiber;/ Lifestyle habits, such as smoking, being sedentary, standing or sitting for long hours;/ Clothing that is too tight and restricts blood flow;/ Stress;/ Taking the pill;/ Age;/ //Diagnosis// Cellulite is diagnosed by observing the skin. //Treatment// Although there are numerous treatments for cellulite, none of them are properly supported by scientific evidence. There are treatments that are based on mechanical or physical principles, such as: Massages;/ Lymphatic drainage;/ Heat treatment;/ Use of ultrasound;/ Radio frequency;/ Magnetic or radio wave therapy;/ Endermologie;/ Electrical stimulation;/ Other approaches to treating cellulite are based on the use of substances that supposedly help remove fat accumulated under the skin, such as methylxanthines, caffeine, pentoxifylline, amino acids and ginkgo biloba. These agents can be applied locally or administered orally or injected, but none of them have fully demonstrated their effectiveness. Applying a 0.3% retinol cream twice daily for six months has been shown to improve the appearance of cellulite. Weight loss can help reduce cellulite, as can maintaining a healthy diet. Liposuction helps to sculpt the body, but it does not remove cellulite and can even make it more visible. There is a newer technique, performed using a laser, that destroys fat cells and firms the skin and which may be a more effective way of treating cellulite. //Prevention// Preventing cellulite involves a healthy diet that is low in fat and rich in fruit, vegetables and fibre. Regular exercise, maintaining a healthy weight and reducing stress are also important aspects. Wearing comfortable clothing prevents the formation of cellulite that results from wearing clothes that are too tight.

Cervicalgia,"//What is it?// The cervical spine is formed by seven vertebrae, which extend from the thorax to the base of the skull, and which are separated by intervertebral discs whose primary function is to distribute weight and allow movement. For this reason the discs have a role in the entire shock absorber column. The neck is highly mobile and supports the weight of the head. Being less protected than the rest of the spine, the neck is vulnerable to various types of injuries that cause pain and limited movement. In most cases, neck pain is temporary. However, in some cases medical treatment is required. With aging and over the years, these discs tend to “wear out” and through a degenerative process they decrease in height, becoming narrower, thus contributing to the decrease in mobility of the cervical spine and compression of the foramina. (holes where the roots exit the spine). However, the literature shows that around 25% of people under 40 years old and around 60% of people over 40 years old present varying degrees of degenerative changes in the spine without, however, having typical symptoms. When these discs with degenerative changes tear, we find situations of cervical disc herniation with more or less acute symptoms, although in some cases the clinical picture is very much a diffuse degenerative disease. Although this degenerative disc disease is often associated with age, the truth is that lifestyle can also play a relevant role in the development and progression of these changes, often conditioned by a favorable genetic substrate. For this reason, regular and adequate physical exercise, correcting unhealthy work postures, as well as a balanced diet and abstaining from tobacco are so important. //Symptoms// The most common symptoms of this type of pathology are neck pain, stiff neck movements, often associated with tingling, and decreased sensitivity and muscle strength in the area of ​​that root (shoulder, arm, forearm and hand). Whenever a trauma involving the neck occurs, it is crucial to properly immobilize this region in order to prevent the occurrence of additional injuries that could cause paralysis. This immobilization should be performed by properly trained personnel. Neck pain can often radiate to the shoulders, arms or even legs and can be accompanied by a sensation of tingling, numbness or weakness in parts of the body. In the absence of trauma, any neck pain that is continuous, persistent, severe, that is accompanied by radiation to the arms or legs or that is associated with headache, weakness or tingling warrants a medical consultation. These symptoms in the setting of neck pain suggest compression of the spinal cord or other nerves. There may also be a burning sensation when touching the skin of the arm or hand or a shock-like pain that spreads to the arm and hand. Loss of control of the urinary sphinters or anus is a serious sign that reflects pressure on the spinal cord and requires urgent therapeutic measures. //Causes// Neck pain results from abnormalities in the soft tissues (muscles, ligaments, nerves) or in the bony structures of the cervical spine. The most common causes are injuries caused by trauma or excessive strain. More rarely, neck pain can result from tumors, infections or congenital anomalies and these possibilities should never be ignored. Rheumatoid arthritis can also destroy the cervical vertebrae and cause pain and stiffness in the neck. As the intervertebral discs function as impact-absorbing elements, their degeneration (which usually begins after the age of 40) causes a narrowing of the space between the vertebrae, increasing the overload exerted on the cervical vertebrae, with consequent increased wear. On the other hand, these discs can become displaced, compressing the spinal cord or other nerves (disc herniation). The fact that the neck is such a flexible region makes it more vulnerable to trauma. Motorized sports, swimming pool jumping, contact sports and falls can result in injury to the cervical vertebrae. Rear-end car collisions cause the neck to be hyperextended or hyperflexed beyond its normal limits, with damage to muscles and ligaments. In extreme cases, spinal fractures can occur, resulting in spinal cord injury and paralysis. //Diagnosis// The diagnosis of neck pain involves a medical examination, clinical history and evaluation of the neck region. Radiographic studies, computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging complement this assessment and should be requested whenever neck pain does not improve after a few weeks or when there is an associated trauma. //Treatment// Even if you have a cervical disc herniation or degenerative disease of the cervical spine discs, there is a very high probability that the symptoms will improve with conservative treatment. The first line of treatment is medication to treat pain. If the pain is radicular due to compression of the root, it may be necessary to resort to the use of cortisone, since anti-inflammatories do not act on the chemical mediator of neurological pain (only cortisone does). In some cases, it is worth combining physiotherapy to improve the clinical picture and posture. Treatment will depend on the cause. Many cases of neck pain can be easily controlled with medication, such as heat and anti-inflammatories. Heat has a muscle-relaxing effect that provides significant relief. In other cases, cold is more effective. The responses of neck pain to cold and heat have not been scientifically validated, but depending on the case and the person, they can be a valuable aid. It is also important to modify daily activities that can contribute to neck pain, such as your sleeping or sitting position. There are exercises that can increase neck flexibility. Massages, performed by properly qualified professionals, can also help. Surgery is necessary in the case of severe injury, evidence of spinal cord compression, presence of tumor or narrowing of the canal. When neck pain results from everyday activities, such as using a computer or sleeping position, it tends to improve over 4 to 6 weeks with just the use of painkillers, modification of these activities and some exercises. When they result from trauma, the recovery time without surgery is longer, and can take between 3 and 12 months, with intermittent pain. Neck pain can become chronic, especially with age, given the association with the progressive narrowing of the spinal canal and the phenomena of arthritis in the neck region. These cases greatly interfere with patients' quality of life and may be associated with fatigue, depression or anxiety. As such, they require special attention. The most common type of surgery to resolve pain caused by cervical degenerative disease is anterior arthrodesis of the cervical spine associated with discectomy and foraminectomy. //Prevention// It is important to avoid staying in positions that strain the neck for long periods of time, such as working in front of a computer. During this time, your back should be straight, your feet should be flat on the floor and you should take regular breaks. The computer should be at eye level. During the night, you should use a pillow that keeps your neck aligned and you should avoid sleeping on your stomach, as this position forces the neck to become twisted. Wearing a seat belt and helmet in motor sports reduces the risk of injuries to the cervical spine. While driving, the seat must be adjusted to keep your back straight. Maintaining an adequate weight is always important, in this and other cases.

Chalazio,"//What is it?// It is a chronic inflammatory granuloma of a gland that causes a small nodule on the eyelid. Chalazion appears in adults and also in children as a small nodule on an eyelid. It may start as a small red, swollen and painful area on the eyelid and after a few days the pain tends to disappear while maintaining the swelling. //Symptoms// A small nodule or swelling may appear in the eyelid area with red, painful skin, accompanied by eye discomfort, watery, irritated eyes and blurred vision. //Causes// There are small glands in the upper and lower eyelids (meibomian glands) that produce oil that mixes with tears to moisten and protect the eyes. If the glands are blocked by inflammation or if the consistency of the oil changes, it can lead to chalazion. Sometimes an infection can be causing this, although this is rare. //Diagnosis// Diagnosis is based on symptoms and an eye examination, and no other tests are generally necessary. The attending physician may recommend a consultation with an ophthalmologist. //Treatment// To treat it, surgery is used, which consists of making a small vertical incision on the inner side of the eyelid. Its contents are then drained through this small cut. This procedure is painless and it may be necessary to use a suture if the chalazion is larger. There is no need for hospitalization, and the procedure lasts around 30 minutes. The patient is then discharged, with an occlusive dressing and therapy to apply. //Prevention// Cleansing the eye area should be part of daily facial cleansing. You should always remember not to rub your eyes and  ensure your hands are clean before touching your eyes. Eyes should always be protected from dust and air pollution by wearing sunglasses outdoors and safety glasses when using machines (such as power tools). To prevent chalazion from developing or recurring, using cleansing wipes can prevent the sebaceous glands from becoming clogged, especially if you wear makeup; Respect expiration dates and replace makeup products frequently.

Cyclothymia,"//What is it?// Cyclothymia is a rare type of mood disorder, however, it is not easy to estimate its prevalence with certainty, as many patients are not diagnosed or receive a wrong diagnosis, for example, of other types of mood disorders, such as depression. It is less severe and has less pronounced symptoms than bipolar disease type I and type II, in which there are fluctuations in the patient's emotions, fluctuating between periods of depression and hypomania for at least two years (or one year in the case of children and adolescents), interspersed or not with periods of normal and habitual behavior (which may last more than a month). In most people, this pattern is irregular and even unpredictable. This mood disorder can have a negative impact on the patient's life, particularly on relationships and even at work. People with a cyclotomy have a higher risk of developing bipolar disorder. This disease is as common in females as in males and usually appears during adolescence or in young adults - on average, at age 25. //Symptoms// In cyclothymia, the mood fluctuates between states of depression and hypomania (similar to an episode of mania, but of less severity, with a change in behavior that appears different from normal), which means that the symptoms of the disease also vary. varying.  Some of the symptoms of depressive states include: Sadness;/ Feeling hopeless or empty;/ Irritability, especially in children and adolescents;/ Loss of interest in activities that were once considered a source of pleasure;/ Want;/ Feeling worthless or guilty;/ Restlessness;/ Fatigue;/ Difficulty concentrating;/ Thoughts about death (however, these are more common in those with bipolar I or II disorder);/ Changes in weight;/ Sound problems;/  Some of the possible symptoms of hypomania are: Euphoria (exaggerated happiness or well-being);/ High self-esteem;/ Excessive physical activity;/ Extreme optimism;/ Talking more than usual;/ Tendency to be easily distracted;/ Difficulty concentrating;/ Less need for sleep;/ Uncontrolled thoughts;/ Adoption of risky behaviors and imprudent decisions;/ Irritability or agitation;/ Greater impulsiveness to achieve goals;/  Both depression and hypomania can last several days or even weeks. Even so, depressive symptoms tend to be more frequent and have a more significant impact on the patient and, therefore, are what often leads them to seek help. When faced with symptoms of cyclothymia, it is important to consult your doctor as soon as possible. . This problem can not only interfere with the performance of normal day-to-day activities, but also increase the risk of suffering from bipolar disorder. //Causes// The specific causes of cyclothymia are not yet known, but it is thought that there may be some genetic influence, as people with this pathology are more likely to have family members with bipolar disorder and vice versa. Furthermore, it may also be favored by differences in the way the brain works or even environmental factors, such as traumatic experiences or prolonged periods of stress. //Diagnosis// There are frequent cases in which cyclothymia is not diagnosed, which means that the patient does not receive treatment. This happens because the symptoms are often mild or undervalued and many people end up not seeking healthcare. To diagnose cyclothymia, during the consultation, the attending physician will collect the clinical and family history, carry out an objective examination and, possibly, request some complementary diagnostic tests, especially to exclude another pathology with a non-psychological cause. The consultation with a specialist doctor includes a psychological assessment of the patient's thoughts, feelings and even behavioral patterns. It is also important to monitor how the patient feels over time and, therefore, the attending physician may ask the patient to make a daily report of how they feel, sleep patterns and daily routines. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), from the American Psychiatric Association, for the diagnosis of cyclothymia the following must be present: Periods of hypomania and depression lasting at least two years or one year in the case of children and adolescents, with these mood swings occurring for at least half of that time.;/ Periods of stable mood that usually last less than two months.;/ Symptoms that have a significant impact on different areas of a person's life (social, professional, among others).;/ Symptoms that do not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, major depression, or another mental health problem.;/ Symptoms are not caused by taking any type of substance or by another health problem.;/ //Treatment// The treatment of cyclothymia can involve several strategies, such as medication (for example, medications used in bipolar disorder, as there are no specific medications for cyclothymia) and psychotherapy (such as cognitive-behavioral therapy), always under the supervision of the attending physician. mental health specialist. These measures can help prevent mood fluctuations. The aim of treating cyclothymia includes reducing the risk of progression to bipolar disorder, reducing the frequency and severity of symptoms, preventing relapses and, eventually, treating problems with alcohol consumption or other substances that can worsen symptoms. In addition to the treatment prescribed by the attending physician, there are strategies that the patient should adopt to control cyclothymia: Maintain the prescribed medication with strict schedules and doses, even if you feel well.;/ Be alert to warning signs (early action can help prevent symptoms from progressing).;/ Do not consume alcohol or drugs.;/ Consult your doctor before starting to take other medications, which may interfere with the medication.;/ Keep a diary recording mood changes, routines and other events considered significant - this measure will allow the patient and the attending physician to perceive the effects of the treatment, as well as identify patterns of thoughts and behaviors associated with symptoms.;/ Know the disease and its possible complications and share this information with family and friends.;/ Attend a support group - the attending physician will be able to give the patient some suggestions.;/ Exercise regularly - helps maintain a stable mood and leads to the release of neurochemicals that promote a sense of well-being (endorphins).;/ Get the right amount of sleep - sleep has a significant impact on mood.;/ Implement relaxation and stress management techniques, such as meditation or yoga.;/ //Prevention// Early treatment of this disease can help prevent it from getting worse. American Psychiatric Association, outubro de 2021 Support Association for Depressive and Bipolar Patients, March 2022 Mayo Clinic, October 2021 National Health Service, October 2022 WebMD, October 2021 Impulsivity, instability and self-harming behaviors are some of the signs that can alert you to a borderline personality disorder.
