Pelvic organ prolapse,"//What is it?// The pelvic organs are supported by muscles and ligaments that attach to the bones of the pelvis. When these supporting tissues (called the pelvic floor) are weakened, organs such as the bladder, uterus and bowel can protrude through the vaginal wall, causing prolapse. It is a very common pathology, with an estimated 40-50% of women experiencing some type of prolapse, being more common in older patients. There are several risk factors for its occurrence: aging of the pelvic floor associated with menopause and genetic factors that cause changes in the supporting tissues, obesity, chronic cough, pregnancy, childbirth and heavy work throughout life. //Types of prolapse// There are several forms of prolapse, depending on the organ that has “dropped” and often, in the same patient, it is possible to find more than one type: Cystocele (bladder), Hysterocele (uterus), Rectocele (rectum), Prolapse of the vaginal vault (“top” of the vagina). //Symptoms// Symptoms vary depending on the severity of the prolapse. Patients are often asymptomatic and the diagnosis is made during gynecological examination. There are some symptoms that may suggest that you are dealing with a genital prolapse, namely, the sensation of discomfort in the pelvic region and of a “ball” inside or outside the vagina, especially after long periods of standing or exertion, tending to improve when lying down. The externalization of the organs can lead to difficulty in hygiene and bleeding, often preventing a normal life. Patients may experience urine loss and fecal incontinence; others report constipation and a feeling of defecation obstruction. This type of pathology can also affect sexual performance, due to psychological changes, in a woman's self-image, in addition to discomfort during penetration. //Diagnosis// Gynecological observation is generally sufficient for diagnosis; in other situations, the doctor needs to perform tests to complement his observation and decide on the most appropriate treatment (ultrasound, pelvic magnetic resonance imaging, urodynamic study, among others). //Treatment// Patients with no symptoms or mild symptoms generally do not require any intervention and should avoid situations that may increase the risk of worsening their prolapse, such as lifting weights. Treatment of constipation and weight loss are essential. In more serious cases there are some options to consider, and in some cases a combined approach is advised: - Medications: the vaginal application of estrogen creams improves the quality of the mucosa, reduces irritative symptoms, as well as contributing positively to postoperative recovery; - Pelvic floor exercises: therapy that involves a joint activity with Physiotherapy, usually for 6 to 8 weeks, whose objective is to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles. They can help improve or prevent worsening in the early stages of the disease. They require time, motivation and adequate technique. - Pessaries: devices, usually made of silicone, that are inserted into the vagina, and whose function is to provide mechanical support to prolapsed organs, relieving symptoms. Pessaries come in different shapes and sizes. They are suitable for situations where surgery is to be postponed or avoided. They need to be adjusted by a doctor in order to find the most suitable type and size for each patient. They should be removed and replaced every 3 months or when necessary, to prevent infections and to reassess the situation. - Surgery: in symptomatic women with significant changes in their quality of life, surgery is the most effective approach. There are different ways to approach pelvic reconstruction (vaginally, laparoscopically or abdominally), with and without the use of prostheses. The choice depends on a number of factors, such as the patient's age, general health, previous surgeries and the severity of the prolapse. The surgeon's experience and the patient's preference are also important factors. A long-term cure rate of 75-90% is estimated. Recurrent prolapse may be due to the persistence of the factors that caused the initial prolapse, such as physical exertion, constipation and tissue weakness itself. Abnormal uterine bleeding can occur at any age, but it requires proper evaluation and treatment due to the risk of anemia and other complications. The name comes from cone - the shape of the portion of the cervix that is collected during conization surgery. Learn how it is done and what its objectives are. Yes, they can, but not always.

6-minute walk test,
Respiratory function tests,"//What are they?// Respiratory function tests can detect respiratory diseases and provide a detailed assessment of lung function.  There are different types of tests and each one assesses a different aspect of lung function.  In general, these tests make it possible to measure air retention capacity, inspiratory, expiratory and oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange capacities.  As a rule, these tests are adequate to determine the type and severity of lung disorders but do not allow defining the specific cause of the disease. However, they are used to diagnose some diseases such as asthma.  Respiratory function tests include lung capacity and output velocity (spirometry), output-volume testing, assessment of muscle strength, and measurement of diffusion capacity. //Advantages and benefits// The main advantage of these tests is their simplicity, easy understanding and interpretation.  The results obtained are reproducible and reliable and are an integral part of the evaluation of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, for whom spirometry before and after the use of a bronchodilator is the basic diagnostic and staging test. //Methodology// Often, assessment of respiratory disease consists of looking at how much air the lungs can hold, how much they can exhale, and how quickly they can do so.  All of these measurements are performed using a spirometer, an instrument that consists of a mouthpiece and a tube connected to a recording device. In spirometry, the patient inhales deeply, then exhales forcefully and as quickly as possible through the tube while measurements are taken.  During the examination, the volume of air inhaled or exhaled and the duration of each respiratory movement are recorded and subsequently analyzed. The examination is often repeated after the administration of a drug that dilates the airways of the lungs (bronchodilator).  A maximum flow counter is a simpler instrument that allows you to measure the speed of air exhalation. As in spirometry, after taking a deep breath, the person blows forcefully into this small manual device. It is a low-cost device that allows asthmatic patients to control their disease at home.  Lung capacity measurement reflects the degree of stiffness or elasticity of the lungs and rib cage. These values ​​are abnormally low in disorders such as pulmonary fibrosis and spinal deviations (kyphoscoliosis).  Disorders that cause loss of lung elasticity or reduce movement of the rib cage are called restrictive disorders.  Measuring respiratory output serves to determine the degree of narrowing or obstruction of the airways. Records are abnormal in diseases such as bronchitis, emphysema and asthma. These processes are called obstructive disturbances.  The most modern spirometers can assess lung capacity and measure exhaled air during a forced inhalation test. Flow-volume recordings can be particularly useful for detecting changes that partially obstruct the larynx and trachea.  Respiratory muscle strength can be measured by asking the person to inhale and exhale intensely against a pressure gauge. A disease that weakens muscles, such as muscular dystrophy, makes breathing difficult, resulting in low inspiratory and expiratory pressures. This test also helps determine whether the person who is connected to an artificial respirator is able to breathe on their own when they stop using it.  The carbon monoxide diffusion capacity test can determine how effectively oxygen is transferred from the alveoli into the bloodstream. In this technique, a person inhales a small amount of carbon monoxide, holds it for 10 seconds, and then exhales it into a carbon monoxide detector.  With normal lungs, carbon monoxide from inspired air is well absorbed. When the test shows otherwise, it means that the exchange of oxygen between the lungs and the blood is abnormal. Abnormal diffusing capacity is characteristic in people who suffer from pulmonary fibrosis, emphysema, and other disorders that affect the blood vessels in the lungs. //Indications// The diagnosis of bronchial obstructive syndrome is one of the main applications of respiratory function tests in medical practice.  Early diagnosis of chronic airflow limitation, detecting individuals at risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, allows the doctor to try to convince them to give up the smoking habit, at a stage in which the structural changes are less extensive.  Spirometry is indicated for the diagnosis of some diseases and for assessing their severity. It also allows the evaluation of the effect of a treatment or exposure to certain occupational or environmental elements.  It is useful in the diagnosis of various lung diseases, in the presence of lung symptoms (shortness of breath, wheezing), changes in the medical examination (abnormality of the thoracic cavity); in quantifying the severity of diseases already diagnosed (cystic fibrosis, asthma, heart and neuromuscular diseases); in evaluating the effects of occupational or environmental exposure (smoke, dust), the use of certain medications (bronchodilators and corticosteroids), and the risk in lung surgery.  They are also indicated in the assessment of disability or invalidity. //Care to be taken//  There are several factors that can alter the results of spirometry. As such, some precautions must be taken before performing the test: Stop taking bronchodilators 6 to 48 hours before the exam;/ Eat well, avoiding large meals, teas or coffee;/ Do not smoke 4 to 6 hours before the exam;/ You should wait approximately two weeks after a respiratory infection and 7 days after a hemorrhage before performing the test.;/  As these tests involve more forced and rapid breathing, the patient may experience some difficulty breathing after the exam or a headache. This discomfort is only temporary.  The risks of lung function tests are minimal. Very rarely, a pneumothorax (collapse of a lung) can occur in patients who already have lung disease.  These tests should be avoided in patients who have recently suffered a myocardial infarction or who have some types of heart disease.

Psoriasis,"//What is Psoriasis?// Psoriasis is a chronic skin disease, autoimmune in nature, which means that it appears when the immune system emits abnormal signals that accelerate the normal growth cycle of skin cells. Psoriasis is quite common and is not contagious. This aspect is important, because there may be a fear of contracting this pathology when swimming in a pool or through contact with affected people. There are five types, the most common form being the one that appears as raised, reddish plaques covered with a whitish area (which corresponds to dead skin cells). A particularly disabling form is one that affects the joints and occurs in about 10% of patients. It is called psoriatic arthritis and causes pain and deformity of the joints in the hands, feet, limbs or spine. Although psoriasis can present at any age, most cases occur between the ages of 15 and 30, and it is also common between the ages of 50 and 60. It affects 1% to 3% of the population and can appear anywhere on the body, being associated with diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and depression. The most affected areas tend to be the elbows, knees, scalp, nails and lower back. //Symptoms of Psoriasis// The manifestations of psoriasis can be mild, moderate or severe, depending on the extent of skin affected. Mild forms correspond to an impairment of less than 3%, moderate forms between 3% and 10% and severe forms are those in which more than 10% of the skin is affected. Fortunately, the mild form is the most common (80% of cases). However, even this can have a very negative impact on quality of life, especially when it appears on the palms of the hands or soles of the feet. The symptoms of this disease depend on its type and location. As a rule, a patient has only one type of psoriasis at a time. Plaque is the most common, accounting for around 80% of the total, and causes itching and, when scratched, the plaques become thicker. Nails become fragile and brittle. There are other types such as: guttate (small, individual red spots); inverse (occurs mainly in skin folds); pustular (formation of blisters with pus surrounded by reddened skin); and erythrodermic (more intense inflammation of the skin, resembling a burn; affects large areas of skin and is accompanied by intense itching, pain and accelerated heart rate), requiring urgent medical observation. //Causes of Psoriasis// Although its origin is still poorly understood, there appears to be a genetic basis for this alteration of the immune system. As such, it is common for psoriasis to appear in several members of the same family. It is often triggered by a stressful event, tonsillitis, the use of certain medications (beta-blockers, antimalarials, some anti-inflammatories), a cut on the skin, sunburn or cold, dry weather. This means that, generally speaking, psoriasis depends on the existence of a genetic predisposition associated with an external stimulus. //Diagnosis of Psoriasis// There are several diseases with symptoms similar to psoriasis, and therefore the diagnosis should always be established by clinical observation by a dermatologist. In some cases, confirmation with a skin biopsy may be necessary. The doctor also seeks to learn about the patient's family history and better understand their daily activities in order to rule out triggering factors. //Psoriasis Treatment// There are many treatment options. Since the skin has different characteristics in different parts of the body, the treatment must also be different. In general, phototherapy or creams are used in limited areas of the affected area. Oral or injectable medications are useful when the impact of psoriasis on quality of life is significant. In many cases of plaque psoriasis, moisturizing creams, ointments or shampoos are enough to control the disease. These local treatments control inflammation and reduce the rate at which skin cells multiply. Phototherapy involves exposure to ultraviolet A or B rays, which can also slow down the multiplication of these cells. In other situations, exposure to sunlight can be beneficial, and it is always important to evaluate the best options with your dermatologist. Another option is to combine a medication, psoralen, with sun exposure, to achieve better results. Finally, it may be necessary to resort to laser therapy or medication administered orally or by injection. //Psoriasis Prevention// There is no way to prevent this disease, but it is possible to reduce the number of outbreaks by keeping your skin dry and well cared for, avoiding stress, anxiety and medications that can trigger it. It is also helpful to reduce alcohol and tobacco consumption, as these can increase the severity of flare-ups.

Pterygio,"//What is it?// Pterygium is a vascularized lesion located in the conjunctiva of the eye. It can begin with a previous injury, pinguecula (type of degeneration of the conjunctiva in the eye) or develop on its own. This type of thick lesion can grow towards the cornea, the transparent outer layer located in front of the eyeball and which is essential for vision. It is usually shaped like a triangle and can be yellow, pink or red. //Symptoms// Symptoms of pterygium can range from mild to severe: redness and edema of the conjunctiva of the eye;/ yellow spot on the white conjunctiva of the eyeball;/ sensation of dryness, burning and itching in the eyes. Sensation of the presence of sand;/ blurred vision;/ //Causes// This growth of conjunctiva tissue is caused by dry eyes and prolonged exposure to wind, dust, sand and sunlight. //Diagnosis// An ophthalmological examination allows the pterygium to be identified and the need for surgical correction to be assessed. The clinical history includes screening habits, namely the use of contact lenses, frequency of windy, dry and sandy environments, whether you use too many eye drops, false eyelashes or other accessories. //Treatment// Currently, the most common surgical technique for treating pterygium is to remove an area of ​​conjunctiva of the same size from the upper region of the same eye to cover the affected area. This surgery is performed with an injection of local anesthesia, does not require hospitalization and lasts approximately 45 minutes. The patient is discharged immediately, taking only an occlusive dressing and appropriate therapy to apply. //Prevention// Avoid exposure to environmental factors that can cause pterygium. Some measures include wearing sunglasses and a hat to protect your eyes from sunlight, wind, dust, pollen and smoke. Moisturize your eyes properly.

Eyelid ptosis,"//What is it?// Eyelid ptosis corresponds to the drooping of the upper eyelid. It is usually caused by a dysfunction of the upper eyelid elevator muscle, responsible for its elevation. Ptosis, in addition to the aesthetic impact, may cause a restriction of the upper visual field or even occlusion of the visual axis. Ptosis should not be confused with the presence of a redundant fold of skin (dermatochalasia), which frequently develops at older ages. //Types of Eyelid Ptosis// Eyelid ptosis can be unilateral or bilateral and, depending on the age of onset, it can be divided into congenital or acquired: Congenital ptosis: It is present from birth. Changes during the development of the eyelid elevator muscle lead to a deficit in its function and an inability to normally elevate the eyelid. When the upper eyelid occludes the visual axis, there is a risk of amblyopia (limitation in vision development), and its correction must be discussed. Acquired ptosis: Develops later and is divided into aponevrotic, traumatic, mechanical, neuropathic or myopathic. A detailed clinical history associated with a complete objective examination usually allows the cause to be identified. Aponeurotic or involutional ptosis is the most common, occurring progressively at more advanced ages due to laxity and stretching of the insertion tendon of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle. There are other factors that may be associated with eyelid drooping, for example direct trauma (traumatic ptosis), or the presence of a lesion that, due to its weight, can limit eyelid movement (mechanical ptosis). Neuropathic aptosis is due to dysfunction in the innervation of the muscle and is associated with cases of third cranial nerve palsy, Horner's syndrome, multiple sclerosis, Guillian-Barré syndrome, among others. Myogenic aptosis results from a dysfunction of the muscle itself and is often associated with changes in eye movements in the context of pathologies such as progressive external ophthalmoplegia, myotonic dystrophy, myasthenia gravis, among others. //Symptoms// In ptosis, in addition to the drooping appearance of the eyelid, there may be a reduction in the upper visual field. The eyebrow rises on the same side as the ptosis in an attempt to indirectly elevate the eyelid, and in more advanced and mainly bilateral cases, there is a need to elevate the chin and tilt the head back in an attempt to improve vision.  //Treatment// Surgical elevation of the affected eyelid(s). Techniques vary according to the type and severity of ptosis as well as the function of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle, and can be divided into 3 types: advancement of the aponeurosis of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle, suspension of the eyelid to the frontalis muscle or resection of the Muller muscle, located on the posterior surface of the eyelid.  Myopia, astigmatism and hyperopia often lead to the use of glasses or contact lenses. LASIK surgery can restore good vision. Do you wear contact lenses?

Pubalgia,"//What is it?// Pubalgia results from excessive and repetitive use of the pubic symphysis and can involve prolonged interruption in physical activity. This entity is also known as pubic osteitis, since it causes pain and inflammation of the structures around and over the pubic symphysis. The pubic bone is the site of insertion of several muscles, whose tendons become inflamed due to repetitive stress in the pubic symphysis region. Many athletes, sportspeople, football players, long-distance runners, among others, feel uncomfortable pain in the region close to the pubic symphysis, caused by overload, overuse, direct trauma or a blow that produces inflammation and pain. //Symptoms// The pain only increases in intensity as the disease worsens. The onset of pubalgia is insidious, progressively increasing until movement becomes limited. Over time, the pain that was previously concentrated only in the hip migrates to other parts, such as the lower abdomen and groin. This disease can easily be confused with other problems, such as inguinal hernias, ruptures, urinary infections and tendonitis in the adductor muscles. The symptoms are identical to those of a muscle strain, with pain occurring during running, abdominal exercises and squats. Pain may also occur in the lower abdominal region, radiating to the inner thigh. Pain may also be felt at the insertion of the rectus abdominis. Lateral movements, heading movements, hip and trunk flexions can be painful. This pain worsens with exercise, effort or certain postures, and can also be felt when climbing stairs or pushing the hips forward. Pain can also radiate to the perineum and testicles and can cause low back pain when associated with a sacroiliac injury. //Causes// Athletes are often subjected to a large number of games and training sessions, often lacking the necessary time for rest or an adequate stretching program, which predisposes the appearance of this entity. The lack of or inadequate stretching of the adductor muscles of the thigh, combined with the excessive abdominal exercises that athletes perform, can cause muscular imbalance in the pubic symphysis and, consequently, pubalgia. Pregnancy is also a risk factor for pubalgia. On the other hand, there are risk factors that are intrinsic to each person, such as congenital or acquired anomalies of the abdominal wall, especially in its lower locations, such as anomalies of the inguinal canal or inequalities in the length of the lower limbs, which are very common, although unapparent, and which generate pelvic instability. The quality of the ground and footwear used (hard floors and use of footwear with little shock absorption) can also contribute to the development of pubalgia. //Diagnosis// Diagnosing pubalgia can take a long time, given the large number of disorders that affect this region of the hip, which can mask the symptoms of pubalgia and delay an accurate diagnosis. In general, the diagnosis is clinical and is confirmed by an X-ray of the pelvic area, to observe the presence of instability of the pubic symphysis of more than 2 mm. The X-ray also reveals the presence of signs of bone thickening, a sign that indicates the presence of inflammation. Nuclear magnetic resonance allows the study of soft tissues. //Treatment// Treatment involves rest, the use of ice and oral anti-inflammatories. After the acute phase, hot water compresses can be used on the region, which promotes vasodilation, which is beneficial for reducing pain and relaxing the adjacent muscles. Once the pain has subsided, stretching exercises for the inner thigh muscles, abdominal and lower back strengthening exercises, exercises to strengthen the adductors, abductors, hip flexors and extensors, and exercises to stabilize the trunk and spine can be started. Return to sporting activity may occur in milder cases after 3 to 5 days. In more severe cases, rest and treatment should last 3 weeks to 3 months, and may take up to 6 months. If, after 3 months, conservative treatment is not effective, surgical treatment should be considered. //Prevention// Prevention involves programmed and progressive training and the prevention and treatment of all predisposing factors. The abdominal muscles must be well worked and muscle stretching must be done in all training sessions, in order to achieve correct dynamic balance of the pelvis.

Keratoconus,"//What is it?// It corresponds to a progressive change in the shape of the cornea, the most superficial layer of the eyes, which develops progressively and asymmetrically, in which the central portion assumes a conical shape, while the periphery remains relatively normal. As the disease progresses, the cornea becomes increasingly prominent, irregular astigmatism develops, scars form, and visual acuity decreases. Its prevalence is around 54.5 cases for every 100 thousand inhabitants, although it is admitted that there is a higher number, due to unreferenced cases. It is usually diagnosed in adolescence, however, it can manifest itself earlier, and tends to progress until the third or fourth decade of life, when it usually stops. It usually starts in one eye and then affects the other, and there does not appear to be a significant difference in incidence between the right and left eyes. It is a more common disease in males. //Symptoms// Symptoms vary depending on the stage of the disease. As the cornea is the transparent layer of the eye that allows light to enter, any anomaly on its surface significantly affects vision, making simple tasks very difficult and tiring, with a strong impact on the quality of life of those affected. The most common complaints are reduced visual acuity, even with glasses, fluctuating vision, need to change glasses frequently, double vision, “ghost” images, blurred or distorted vision, eye fatigue, sensitivity to light and perception of halos around the eyes. around the lights. Corneal distortion associated with keratoconus also causes reduced contrast sensitivity. //Causes// It is a genetic disease. Around 6% to 12% of patients mention having other family members with the same pathology. Keratoconus can be associated with the act of rubbing the eyes vigorously, with other eye diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa, retinopathy of prematurity or allergic conjunctivitis. It is more common in patients with Down syndrome and has been associated with prolonged contact lens wear. //Diagnosis// Although clinical observation allows us to suggest the diagnosis, topographic maps that evaluate the curvature and surface of the cornea are the best instruments to confirm its presence and define its morphology, even when the disease does not yet present characteristic signs. Early detection is becoming increasingly important, given the progressive expansion of laser refractive surgery to correct myopia, hyperopia and astigmatism. In the presence of this pathology, these surgical interventions could lead to future complications and, as such, early diagnosis is essential. //Treatment// Your treatment depends on the stage at which you are diagnosed, its severity and its impact on vision. In some cases, the use of glasses is enough to compensate for visual difficulties. In others, contact lenses of different types are used to provide more stable vision. In more advanced stages, surgical techniques are recommended to alter the curvature of the cornea and reduce the cone that has formed. There are also other, more recent, treatment modalities that aim to strengthen the structure of the cornea. In the most serious situations, a cornea transplant becomes necessary. This procedure is necessary in around 15% of cases. //Prevention// There are no known preventive measures for keratoconus.

Sacrococcygeal cyst,"//What is it?// It corresponds to a chronic inflammatory process that occurs in the sacrococcygeal region, and is generally associated with the presence of hair. It is an abnormal pocket of skin filled with cellular debris, sebaceous and sweat glands, and hair. These folds of skin form during embryonic development and are normally eliminated. Some may remain hidden and are called embryonic clefts. When they are large enough to become inflamed or visible to the naked eye, they are called a dermoid cyst. The fact that this cyst contains sweat glands inside explains why the lesion worsens with heat, which stimulates the production of sweat that accumulates in the skin fold, causing inflammation and/or infection. In general, this cyst forms following the eruption of a hair follicle that becomes “ingrown” under the skin. When it becomes infected, an extremely painful abscess forms. It is more common in men than in women, three to one, especially at the beginning of the third decade of life, and tends to occur more than once. It is more common in people who spend a lot of time sitting, such as drivers of heavy vehicles. //Symptoms// The disease presents in a variety of ways, from a small, painless nodule to a large, painful inflammatory mass. When infected, it takes on the appearance of an abscess with pain, redness, spontaneous drainage of blood and pus with a foul odor through the skin. The first symptoms appear in adolescence or early adulthood in the form of inflammation in the sacrum region, with a feeling of discomfort, especially when sitting for a long time. As the condition progresses, a nodule becomes evident, usually measuring one to five centimeters, with a soft consistency and which may present inflammatory signs, such as pain, heat and redness. Very rarely, a chronic and infected pilonidal cyst, if not treated properly, can develop into a skin carcinoma. //Causes// They often appear to be caused by hair penetrating the skin. Friction and pressure (tight clothing, prolonged sitting, etc.) push the hair into the skin, which reacts as if it were a foreign body, creating a cyst around it. Another possible explanation is that stretching of the skin and movement of its deeper layers causes a hair follicle to rupture, which then forms a cyst around it. There are some risk factors that increase the susceptibility to the formation of these cysts, such as obesity, a sedentary lifestyle, a profession or sport that requires many hours of sitting, excessive or very thick body hair, as well as poor hygiene. //Diagnosis// This injury can be diagnosed based on its characteristics and medical examination. As a rule, laboratory or imaging studies are not necessary. //Treatment// Traditionally, these cysts were surgically removed, leaving the wound open, without stitches, so that it would heal by secondary intention. Nowadays, with a better understanding of their cause, they are removed and closed surgically, which allows for faster healing and recovery. This closure can only be performed if there is no inflammation or infection, which is why the ideal time for surgery is when the lesion is silent, without symptoms. When there are manifestations, it is preferable to resort to an initial treatment with antibiotics and partial drainage, scheduling the surgery for another stage. Post-operative care is very important. The operated area must be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected and it may be necessary to remove adjacent hair so that it does not enter the wound. //Prevention// The main preventive measures are good hygiene, weight loss, avoiding sitting for long periods of time and not wearing tight clothing. In cases where a pilonidal cyst has already formed, it is useful to remove hair from the sacrococcygeal region regularly to prevent a new episode.

synovial cyst,"//What is it?// It is a pathological dilation of the synovial membrane of any tendon that accumulates synovium, a lubricating fluid that facilitates the sliding of tendons within the sheaths. It tends to form in the lower part of the spine. It is not cancerous and generally does not cause symptoms, but it can lead to problems such as sciatica. //Symptoms// It depends on its size and location. Many people with synovial cysts do not experience any symptoms or discomfort. However, symptoms may include: Lower back pain or discomfort;/ Difficulty walking or standing;/ Pain, numbness, or tingling in the legs, such as sciatica;/ //Causes// Their causes are not fully understood. However, it is known that they are more common in older people and those with joint diseases, such as arthritis. In these patients, the facet joints can degenerate more quickly, producing synovial cysts. //Diagnosis// If your doctor finds a lump along your spine, he or she will perform an ultrasound to determine whether or not it is a synovial cyst. Other imaging tests include an MRI, CT scan, or X-ray. These tests can also help rule out other pathologies. //Treatment// It is a surgical procedure that consists of incising and removing the cyst and its capsule, in order to prevent recurrence. //Prevention// As its causes are not known for sure, it is not possible to prevent it.

Cervical radiculopathy,"//What is it?// The roots of the cervical nerves from C1 to C8 exit the spine above the vertebra with the same number with the exception of C8 which exits the cervical spine below the C7 vertebra. The nerves then divide to innervate all the muscles of the shoulder, arm, forearm and hand giving them motor function and sensation. When any of these nerves is subject to an irritative process through compression or inflammation, the symptoms of tingling, pain and decreased sensitivity and decreased muscle strength along the path and in the territory of the innervation of this root appear with greater or lesser intensity. The symptoms of cervical radiculopathy may appear intermittently at first, with ups and downs, but it can also appear more or less suddenly. The pain can be felt in a single location (pain in the shoulder or elbow) or along a path radiating distally to the hand and fingers. These symptoms can affect grip strength, as well as changing the type of handwriting. During these phases of more intense pain, the mobility of the cervical spine is greatly reduced due to the risk of worsening local or radiating pain. Some patients feel relief from pain when lying down with their arm raised and their hand behind their head, as this indirectly reduces tension in the inflamed root. //Causes// Any situation that compresses or causes irritation of the nerve root can cause cervical radiculopathy. The most common causes are: Cervical disc herniation. If the interior material of the intervertebral disc comes into contact with the nerve root (due to rupture of the fibrous ring on the periphery of the disc), it causes irritation, inflammation and compression of the nerve, leading to all the symptoms described. In a young adult, this is perhaps the main cause of cervical radiculopathy.;/ Stenosis (tightening) of the Cervical canal. As part of the degenerative process of the cervical spine, changes in the “wear and tear” of the posterior interapophyseal joints can contribute to the reduction of space available for the neurological structures within the cervical canal and thus cause tightening of the various cervical roots and the spinal cord itself. This is the reason why this type of symptomatology is more common in patients over 60 years of age.;/ Degenerative disease of the cervical discs. When a disc in the cervical spine undergoes degeneration, the disc becomes narrower, and obviously less mobile (more rigid) and overloads the posterior interapophyseal joints, a fact that often explains the pain reflex in the region of the scapulae or trapezius at the posterior base of the neck, often associated with difficulty in supporting the weight of the head. The narrowing of the cervical discs will also lead to a narrowing of the foramina (holes through which the cervical nerves exit the spine). In these situations, inflammation and irritation of a cervical nerve is common, which is why this cause of radiculopathy is more common in patients over 50 years of age.;/ //Diagnosis// If the symptoms do not regress with initial symptomatic therapy, the doctor should request imaging tests – static and dynamic X-rays + Magnetic Resonance Imaging and a computed axial tomography scan. In some cases, an electromyogram (EMG) should be requested to clarify the nerve root involved in the process. //Treatment// Conservative treatment should always be attempted initially through medication, moist heat and immobilization with a cervical collar in the acute phase. However, if symptoms persist after 6 to 12 weeks then surgical treatment should be considered. However, if severe pain persists or if neurological signs such as decreased muscle strength worsen then surgery should be considered as an alternative treatment. However, the vast majority of cervical radiculopathies resolve without surgery. Most common types of surgical treatment: Anterior cervical discectomy and interbody fusion. This is perhaps the most common type of surgery – see additional information on Anterior Cervical Spine Arthrodesis;/ Cervical disc arthroplasty. As an alternative to interbody fusion/arthrodesis, the possibility of replacing the torn disc with a hernia with an artificial disc has emerged in recent decades – see additional information – cervical disc arthroplasty.;/ Cervical surgery to reduce radiating pain or decrease strength in the upper limb has a success rate that, according to the literature, can be around 80 to 90%. However, like any surgery, cervical spine surgery has risks that should be shared with the patient in the conversation prior to surgery, as well as the outcome of the proposed surgery should be estimated.

X-ray,"//What is it?// Different types of medical examinations that allow visualization of different structures of the human body using X-rays.  The use of radiography in Medicine is very old and allows, among other applications, the diagnosis of multiple structural alterations, diseases or the presence of foreign bodies.  In these techniques, X-rays are emitted through the human body. This radiation will be absorbed or reflected by the internal structures and the remaining radiation will be transmitted to a detector, creating an image that can be studied. This recording can be on film but, increasingly, it is done on electronic media.  By their nature, the images obtained are static. There are other diagnostic methods that correspond to variations of the radiograph. One example is contrast studies, in which a radiopaque contrast agent is introduced into the body in order to differentiate certain structures. These studies are useful for evaluating blood vessels, the digestive tract and the bile ducts. //Advantages and benefits//  Radiography is a simple exam to perform, relatively inexpensive and allows an effective diagnosis of numerous conditions.  The radiation dose received by the patient will depend on the purpose of the examination but, in general, it is lower than that emitted in contrast studies or tomography. //Methodology// The radiography methodology will depend on the type of examination to be performed. Considering that, within radiographic studies, there are different modalities depending on the structures to be studied, the methodology is also very variable and will be explained to each patient in a detailed manner and adapted to their case. //Indications// Dental exams;/ Verification of correct placement of surgical markers prior to an invasive procedure;/ Mammography;/ Orthopedic evaluations;/   As a rule, it is the most readily available imaging method and, as such, is the first imaging method indicated in the evaluation of the extremities, chest, and sometimes the spine and abdomen.  It is also a first-line method for evaluating fractures, lung infections or intestinal occlusions, allowing the collection of very useful elements for diagnosis. //Care to be taken//  The most significant risks associated with radiography are the possibility of inducing neoplasia or cataracts and, in the case of a pregnant woman, it may cause changes in the development of the fetus.  As such, it is always important to consider in each case whether the benefits of a radiographic examination outweigh these risks, which, although reduced, are significant.  On the other hand, it is important to always use the lowest possible dose of radiation and to only take the necessary images. The use of appropriate protection reduces the patient's exposure to radiation during the examination.

Cervical screening,"//What is it?// Cervical screening is done by cytology, that is, a “Pap smear” test on a slide (conventional method) or liquid-based cytology. Opportunistic screening, that is, not organized and carried out in a gynecology consultation, is part of the secondary prevention of cervical cancer, like organized screening. Primary prevention includes HPV vaccines. There are two types of vaccine, the bivalent, which covers two types of HPV viruses (16 and 18) and the quadrivalent, which also prevents HPV 6 and 11, responsible for condylomas. There are national and international indications for screening, with cytology, which we will present:  //Tracking// Screening should be done at the age of 21, regardless of whether you have been sexually active for a longer period of time. If the woman has not had any disease of the cervix (CIN 2 or CIN3 lesions) she can finish screening between the ages of 65 and 70. According to some authors, at age 65, if cytology results have been normal in the last 10 years. If you had a hysterectomy, that is, extraction of the uterus and the cause was not due to pathology of the cervix, you can suspend the cytology tests. //Types of cytology// Liquid-based cytology or conventional cytology.;/ The advantage of the liquid medium is the possibility of performing viral typing in the remaining liquid medium, in the event of altered cytology or at the request of the attending physician. The request for cytology (+) HPV typing, called “Coteste” should not be made to women under 30 years of age. Cytology with “AS-CUS” changes indicates HPV typing if the woman is over 26 years old. The evaluation of this screening method by the attending physician will be important in preventing cervical cancer. Repeating the tests will depend on the results, age and clinic and must be explained to each patient. Women who have had a hysterectomy resulting from CIN2 and/or CIN3 should continue to have cytology of the vaginal vault. Only after three consecutive negative cytology tests can you discontinue the test. This interruption is not advised by ACOG (American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology). Regardless of the frequency of cytology tests, women should have an annual gynecology appointment. Women who received the HPV vaccine also need to continue undergoing cytology tests according to the proposed schedules. Abnormal uterine bleeding can occur at any age, but it requires proper evaluation and treatment due to the risk of anemia and other complications. The name comes from cone - the shape of the portion of the cervix that is collected during conization surgery. Learn how it is done and what its objectives are. Yes, they can, but not always.

Hearing rehabilitation,"//What is hearing?// The ear can be divided into three parts - the outer ear, the middle ear and the inner ear.  The Outer Ear is made up of the pinna (ear) and the external auditory canal, acting as an antenna that captures sound waves from the environment and channels them to the eardrum.  The Middle Ear consists of an air-filled space and encompasses the tympanic membrane and the three smallest bones in the human body (the malleus, the anvil and the stapes). When sound reaches the eardrum, it vibrates (transformation of acoustic energy into mechanical energy), and this vibration is transmitted by the ossicles to the inner ear.  The Inner Ear is made up of the cochlea (hearing organ), vestibule and semicircular canals (balance organs). The cochlea is made up of a bony tube in the shape of a snail, containing liquid and a “carpet” of hair cells. When the vibration transmitted by the ossicles reaches the cochlea, it triggers waves in this liquid with movement of the hair cell filaments. These movements generate electrical stimuli that will be conducted by the auditory nerve to specific areas of the brain, where they will be understood as sound and processed so that they can be understood and used in language.  Hearing loss affects around 10% of the Portuguese population, and is estimated to affect around 500 million people worldwide. The cause of this extraordinary increase is due to the fact that we are increasingly exposed to noise in our daily lives. This also means that hearing loss is not just a problem that comes with age. More and more young people are suffering from hearing problems. Hearing difficulties can affect professional activity, social life and quality of life. On average, it takes about 7 years for a person to seek help for their hearing problem. Therefore, it is extremely important to treat the problem as quickly as possible, as the sooner you act, the greater the chances of hearing rehabilitation. For this reason, you should not let too much time go by without having a hearing assessment. //Most common hearing problems at each age// At the beginning of school, one in three children suffers from hearing loss. The main causes of these cases include genetic origins, otitis media and childhood illnesses. Main symptoms: If your child watches television very close to the device and with the sound turned up loud, if they are asked to repeat what has been said several times, or if they have problems concentrating at school, you should consult your ENT doctor and carry out an evaluation auditory. Many adults suffer from hearing problems without realizing it, which has implications for their personal, social and professional lives. If you experience this type of difficulty, we advise you to have your hearing capacity assessed by consulting an ENT doctor. Progressive hearing loss occurs with age, due to aging of the auditory function (presbycusis), with its manifestation being more noticeable after the age of 55. This appears earlier and more pronounced in men than in women. Constantly asks for what was said to be repeated;/ Tends to speak louder;/ Listen to television and radio at very high volume;/ Have difficulty following group conversations;/ Do you feel any intolerance to loud sounds?;/ There are three possible approaches, depending on the type of hearing problem: Medical treatment;/ Surgical Treatment;/ Hearing Aid and Auditory Rehabilitation, when there is no medical or surgical solution;/ //Hearing rehabilitation// In cases where it is not possible to treat the disease that causes deafness, it is possible, however, to improve hearing through electronic devices. These devices capture ambient sound and process it, then stimulate the auditory pathway. Depending on the type of stimulus they use, they can be divided into three groups: Hearing Aids, Middle Ear Implants, Osteo-Integrated Implants and Cochlear Implants. These devices capture ambient sound through a microphone and amplify it by emitting, in the form of sound applied to the external auditory canal, a more intense stimulus to the structures of the middle ear. They are the most used devices despite it being estimated that less than 25% of people who would benefit from hearing aids use them. Certain conditions (skin diseases in the ear canal, chronic ear infections,...) may prevent the use of these devices. When deafness results from the loss or damage of a large number of hair cells in the cochlea, greatly increasing the intensity of sound sent to the ear can create an uncomfortable sensation without improving speech understanding. A medical consultation and hearing tests (simple pure tone audiometry and vocal audiometry with and without hearing aids) may demonstrate the inability to rehabilitate deafness through hearing aids and recommend other more effective electronic devices. There are currently implantable electronic devices that capture ambient sound, processing it and stimulating the auditory pathway through vibration (mechanical energy). Osteo-integrated implants;/ These devices transmit sound to the skull bone, which will conduct this vibration directly to the inner ear. They require a simple surgical intervention to place a small titanium screw in the bone behind the ear, an intervention similar to that used in the placement of dental implants. Because it leaves the auditory canal free and does not require transmission through the chain of ossicles, it can be indicated for people with absence or severe pathology of the external auditory canal, destruction of the eardrum and/or ossicles and in patients with active infection of the middle ear. Active Middle Ear Implants;/ In these implants, mechanical energy is used to directly stimulate structures in the middle ear, thus achieving powerful auditory stimulation without the inconvenience of the blocked ear sensation described by hearing aid wearers and without the risk of damage to the skin of the ear canal by the prosthesis mold. Cochlear Implants;/ Cochlear implants are electronic devices that convert environmental sound into electrical signals and transmit them directly to the auditory nerve through electrodes surgically implanted inside the cochlea. Electro Acoustic Stimulation;/ With electroacoustic stimulation, a hearing aid and a cochlear implant are used simultaneously in the same ear. You will once again have ease in understanding conversations;/ You will hear soft sounds without louder sounds becoming uncomfortable;/ You can choose the device that best suits your needs.;/ We offer a wide range of hearing aids, in various sizes and colors;/ We have qualified professionals to carry out your hearing rehabilitation;/ We guarantee technical assistance for your hearing aids allowing you to get the maximum benefit from your hearing aid;/ All this with the guarantee of the world's leading hearing aid manufacturer Widex High Definition Hearing Aids  It takes a few weeks to adapt to hearing aids, but in some cases it may take longer to feel comfortable with your new hearing. It is a process that requires patience. Don't give up! In addition to adapting to a foreign body in the ear, the brain and the ear itself will have to get used to receiving an entire universe of sound again. It requires patience and persistence. It is often necessary to adjust the device until a satisfactory result is achieved. It is important to use the hearing aid regularly so that it becomes easier to get used to it. It may be important to start by talking to one person, so that it is easier to understand in group conversations. After the audiological examination and if indicated, you can try the hearing aid right away. Because we know how important your hearing is, we have hearing solutions available right away so you can start improving your hearing right away. At CUF you can have your first hearing rehabilitation consultation, using the most advanced audiological diagnostic equipment, and professionals with the necessary qualifications and experience to help you solve your hearing problem.

Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction,"//What is it?// The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is a ligament located between the femur and the tibia, responsible for the stability of the knee joint. A ruptured ACL can make the knee unstable, preventing you from performing more demanding daily or physical activities and increasing the risk of suffering other injuries to the joint (menisci and cartilage). //Surgical Indication// Patients with a formal surgical indication are those who intend to practice sports that contain the aforementioned movements (Football, snow skiing, handball, tennis, dancing, etc.). Likewise, all patients who present symptoms of instability (feeling of failure or insecurity) in activities of daily living. Surgery should generally not be performed immediately after an injury, as this increases the risk of joint stiffness and pain in the postoperative period. Physical therapy may be necessary 2 to 6 weeks before surgery to allow the knee to regain nearly full mobility and muscle mass.  //Technique// ACL reconstruction, or ligamentoplasty, aims to anatomically reproduce the damaged ligament and is a technique performed using arthroscopy (by introducing an imaging camera and specific instruments through small incisions in the skin). To replace the ACL, tendons from the knee region are used, obtained through complementary incisions measuring approximately 6 to 10 cm (OTO: central 1/3 of the patellar tendon or IT: semitendinosus and internal rectus on the proximal anterointernal surface of the leg). introduced into tunnels made in the femur and tibia and fixed to the bone by suspension devices or screws (titanium or absorbable), sometimes associated with a metal clip. All of these systems are biocompatible and do not require removal, allowing nuclear magnetic resonance to be performed. In the same surgical procedure and using the same technique, associated injuries to the menisci (suture/repair or partial resection) and articular cartilage are treated. In some cases, it may be necessary to add reinforcement of ligament stability, with an extra-articular procedure (anterolateral ligament). This surgery is usually performed with locoregional anesthesia, depending on the patient's wishes and the evaluation in an Anesthesiology consultation.  //Complications// Possible, but rare, complications include sensory changes in the area of ​​scars, joint stiffness, infection and neurovascular injury. //Physiotherapy// Physiotherapy is extremely important for the final result of the surgery. The work of gaining range of motion, muscle strengthening and joint balance training are the main factors that prevent the rupture of the new ligament. In the postoperative period, weight-bearing of the operated lower limb is limited to 50% of body weight for 2 to 4 weeks in the OTO technique and 4 to 6 weeks in IT reconstruction. Flexion is limited to 90 to 110 degrees for approximately 4 weeks. The “new ligament” is in a particularly fragile period between 4 and 12 weeks, so all activities must be performed with caution. The total recovery time for resuming sporting activity usually varies between 6 and 9 months. Having a cast on your arm or leg helps you recover from fractures and reduces pain.

Breast reconstruction,"//Goals// With Breast Reconstruction, the aim is to reconstruct a breast that comes close to the patient's expectations, whether from a psychological or aesthetic point of view, taking into account several parameters, namely with regard to symmetry (volume and shape) with the opposite breast, projection ptosis and level of the inframammary fold. The priority criteria that arise from the understanding of the disease as a solution to the continuity of a state of balance that is not only psychological but also socio-psycho-emotional mean that the only acceptable criterion for excluding a patient from the breast reconstruction program is refusal after adequate clarification or a situation in which the reconstructive act itself significantly increases the patient's risk. From this situation, fears that reconstruction may camouflage recurrence must be excluded, in light of current imaging techniques and information that all clinicians must have about these procedures and their semiological repercussions. Likewise, it must be stated that reconstruction does not harm or invalidate the indication of any of the ancillary oncological therapeutic methods subsequent to its implementation. Reconstructive surgery is a personal decision, as only a woman who has had a mastectomy or is about to undergo one can assess the significance of this surgery. However, if we look not only at the aesthetic aspect, but above all at helping to rebalance and psychologically reunite the woman as a “whole”, we see that the result is often positive and that in almost all cases this additional effort is worth it. //Timing// In the patient's treatment plan, the timing of Breast Reconstruction must be taken into account, as it can be started at the same operative time as the Mastectomy. This therapeutic attitude must, however, be considered on a case-by-case basis. Immediate Reconstruction, when performed on selected patients and by a well-organized multidisciplinary team, has considerable benefits. We believe that it is currently not necessary for the patient to live with the Mastectomy deformity to adequately appreciate Breast Reconstruction and understand its limitations. In any case, we cannot and should not forget that this reconstructive process is long and slow and can take around 1.5 years in certain clinical situations. //Methods// There are several breast reconstruction techniques. It cannot be said that a given technique is better than another, but rather that one is more suitable for a given case. Almost all women can begin reconstruction at the same operative time as the Mastectomy. Except for patients with certain pathologies or with a certain type (histological) of tumors, they may not be able to undergo Breast Reconstruction. Breast Reconstruction involves at least three other surgical procedures in addition to the Mastectomy. It begins with the Reconstruction of the breast and chest wall, requiring two operative times (one of these times may be at the time of the Mastectomy); Reconstruction of the nipple-areolar complex occurs at a later stage. At this time and/or initially, modifications can also be made to the opposite breast with the aim of achieving the most appropriate symmetry possible. Additional operating times for aesthetic refinement cannot be ruled out. The methods commonly used can be:  Breast implant;/ Expansion (tissue expander) and Breast Implant;/ Musculoskeletal flaps:;/ The broadest back (L. D.);/ Rectus abdominis (T.R.A.M. ou Hartramph);/ Microsurgical methods (Gluteus maximus, T.R.A.M., L.D. D.I.E.P., S.G.A.P., etc.);/ The selection of a given method depends on the overall clinical status, the patient's expectations and tolerance, the condition of the contralateral breast, as well as obtaining a Reconstruction that can approach the aforementioned objectives. //Techniques// It is technically the simplest reconstruction; it consists of introducing an implant under the muscle and fascia of the chest wall. This type of Reconstruction has few complications; The most frequent problems, such as insufficient size of the prosthesis, are not true complications of the intervention, but limitations of its indications, in addition, both size and shape can be improved in subsequent interventions. As with other methods using breast implants, a fibrous capsule will develop, which the patient must be aware of and take the measures suggested by the surgeon to counteract its development. This method is a variation of the previous technique; uses the principle of gradual distension of tissues that will be used to cover the Breast Implant. The tissue expander is a device formed by a reservoir (“bag” or “sac”) that has an integrated valve through which saline solution is introduced weekly with the aim of increasing the volume of the reservoir and thus distending the overlying soft tissues. This is the most common method in Immediate Reconstruction. In the first surgical intervention, the expander is inserted and will be kept for a few months (2 to 3 months for the expansion and more than 3 months after the expansion) and in the subsequent intervention (second intervention) it will be removed and replaced by the implant. As in the previous method, one of the problems may be the development of symptomatic capsular contracture, in addition to implying additional surgical intervention and weekly follow-up in an Outpatient Clinic during expansion. The patient must be aware that this method is slow and involves several surgical interventions. Breast Reconstruction with Tissue Expansion has more complications than that performed only with the introduction of a Breast Implant. In addition to those that occur in this type of Reconstruction, those related to Tissue Expansion may also arise, but the result is usually rewarding. Musculocutaneous flaps are used to provide additional tissue for breast reconstruction in cases where there is a shortage of tissue and these are more complex techniques. The most commonly used flaps are the Latissimus dorsi and Rectus abdominis (T.R.A.M.). In rarer cases, Gluteus Maximus can be used. The Latissimuos dorsi Flap uses skin and muscle from the posterior side of the chest; may be useful when axillary filler is desired or a Radical Mastectomy has been performed in thin patients, with thin or irradiated skin and in patients with sensitive upper limb lymphatic drainage disorders. The most frequent complications are seroma in the donor area and partial (< 5%) or total necrosis of the flap. The scarring sequelae of the elongated dorsal donor area is not negligible. The Rectus Abdominis Flap (T.R.A.M. - transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous flap or Hartrampf Flap) uses skin, subcutaneous tissue and adipose tissue from the lower abdomen. This flap involves a very significant physical and emotional effort, which is why it should only be performed on motivated patients who are prepared for major surgery with a long convalescence period. In addition to the complications associated with the flaps, problems related to the weakness of the abdominal wall may occur, with the possible development of hernias or eventrations. There is also the possibility of using microsurgical techniques to perform breast reconstruction and using other flaps such as D.I.E.P. and S.G.A.P. Reconstruction of the Areola - Nipple Complex is an integral part of Breast Reconstruction and the objective is to reconstruct an Areola - Nipple Complex similar to that on the opposite side, both in terms of symmetry and in terms of color and texture. Reconstruction of the Areola-Nipple Complex should only be performed when breast symmetry is achieved; in general, it is performed 2 to 3 months after Breast Reconstruction. Nipple Reconstruction can be done at the expense of the opposite nipple or at the expense of local flaps. Areola reconstruction can be done with: Areola on the opposite side;/ Full skin graft from the inner thighs, armpits or scars;/ In general, it is necessary to tattoo the reconstructed Areola Complex - Nipple to obtain a similar tone to that of the opposite breast. In most cases, it is necessary to perform surgical techniques to achieve symmetry with the contralateral breast in order to achieve the best possible result. There are cases in which a mammoplasty is performed on a healthy breast, which could be an increase, a reduction or a mastopexy (lift) so that the result in terms of the size and shape of the breasts is as symmetrical as possible, always knowing that they will never be the same. Every year, 4500 new cases of breast cancer appear in Portugal, being the malignant lesion that most affects women. Mammography allows for early diagnosis. Although breast cancer screening is recommended from 50 to 69 years of age, there are cases diagnosed outside these ages. It can be a nervous moment when a woman feels a ""lump"" or ""bump"" in her breast. But not all lumps are breast cancer. Learn more about benign lumps.

Gastroesophageal reflux,"//What is it?// It is defined as the passage of gastric contents into the esophagus, in the absence of vomiting. When this becomes pathological and capable of producing symptoms and lesions in the esophagus, we begin to speak of gastroesophageal reflux disease. When the signs do not refer to the esophagus but to organs such as the oropharynx and lower respiratory tract, we are in the presence of extraesophageal reflux. Over time, inflammation of the esophagus can cause complications: Esophageal stricture - inflammation of the esophagus can cause scarring that causes the esophagus to tighten and make it difficult for food to pass through;/ Erosions and ulcers in the esophagus - acid can injure the lining of the esophagus and the presence of ulcers can cause pain, bleeding or difficulty in swallowing;/ Barrett's esophagus - after several years of exposure to acid, the lining of the esophagus can undergo a transformation, changing its appearance. This change, called Barrett's esophagus, carries a significant risk of developing esophageal cancer: about 1% per year;/ Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a very common condition, with 12% to 54% of people living in Western countries expected to experience reflux symptoms at some point in their lives. It often occurs in healthy adults without causing disease. However, when reflux causes symptoms and/or damage to the esophageal wall, we are in the presence of GERD. The reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus is a physiological process that occurs in practically everyone, several times a day, especially after meals, and asymptomatically. When it is symptomatic, it is associated with heartburn and/or acid regurgitation, interfering with patients' quality of life. It is a chronic condition, which requires prolonged maintenance treatment to prevent relapses and/or esophageal injuries. In most cases, it is a benign condition, easily controllable with therapy combined with general prevention measures. Some patients with more severe esophagitis may require more regular monitoring and appropriate medical or surgical treatment. It is important to note that, if not properly treated, gastroesophageal reflux causes erosive esophagitis which can, in some cases, develop into esophageal cancer. //Symptoms// Heartburn is its most frequent manifestation and corresponds to a burning sensation in the middle of the chest, which can radiate towards the neck and which generally appears less than an hour after meals and which can worsen when lying down or leaning forward. Regurgitation corresponds to the sensation that food is returned to the mouth, without the effort of vomiting. There may also be difficulty swallowing and chest pain behind the breastbone, which can be confused with heart problems. Other possible symptoms include coughing, shortness of breath, hoarseness, earache or gingivitis. Sometimes there may be iron deficiency anaemia or, more rarely, vomiting blood. In some cases, complications may arise, such as ulcers, strictures and the transformation of the oesophageal mucosa into an intestinal-type lining. //Causes// It results from an imbalance between the defense and aggression factors of the esophageal mucosa. The factors that attack it are some foods (tomato products, citrus juices, chocolate, caffeinated drinks), tobacco, alcohol, some medications (nitrates, estrogens, oral contraceptives, calcium channel blockers, alendronate), and the acidic contents of the stomach and bile, when bile reflux occurs. If there is a hiatus hernia, a situation in which a portion of the stomach passes through the diaphragm into the thoracic cavity, the lower esophageal sphincter may become dysfunctional, increasing reflux. In fact, these two clinical conditions are closely associated. Increased intra-abdominal pressure (tight clothing, pregnancy, coughing, obesity, sudden physical exercise, constipation) is another common cause. //Diagnosis// The diagnosis is based on an assessment of symptoms and clinical evaluation. Tests such as an upper digestive endoscopy, an X-ray of the esophagus, stomach and duodenum or a 24-hour measurement of esophageal pH may be requested. //Treatment// General measures are useful in treating the condition, such as eating small meals, avoiding certain foods (such as fats, chocolate, citrus fruits or tomato-based stews), as well as carbonated and caffeinated drinks, not eating in the two or three hours before going to bed, not smoking, losing weight, not wearing tight clothing and avoiding activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure immediately after meals. It is also worth raising the head of the bed by about 15 centimetres while sleeping. Medications are important because they allow us to control stomach acid secretion. These drugs belong to the proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole, pantoprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole and esomeprazole) and have shown high efficacy in relieving symptoms and healing mucosal lesions. In some cases, anti-reflux surgery may be indicated, performed via laparoscopy. //Prevention// Although it cannot be prevented, it is possible to avoid or minimize the symptoms associated with it. The general measures mentioned in the treatment are also very useful in preventing the typical complaints of reflux.

Reflux laryngopharyngeal,"//What is it?// Laryngopharyngeal reflux is a condition in which acid produced in the stomach flows back up through the esophagus into the throat, causing changes in the mucosa. Stomach acid can travel up the esophagus to the pharynx and larynx, causing chemical damage to the mucosa, which, unlike the esophagus, has no protection. Therefore, laryngopharyngeal reflux may be present without the classic symptoms and without any changes in the endoscopy exams usually performed. //Symptoms// This reflux laryngitis is manifested by hoarseness, a feeling of irritation or mucus in the throat, coughing and recurrent clearing of the throat. //Causes// This condition often starts after an upper respiratory infection. Mucosal inflammation is aggravated by contact with acid that comes from the stomach through the esophagus. The amount of acid that causes this mucosal irritation is small, which explains why many patients do not feel burning or heartburn. The individuals most likely to develop the pathology are those who have: insufficiency of the lower esophageal valve;/ digestion problems with slow emptying of the stomach;/ hiatal hernia;/ changes in esophageal contractility;/ Major risk factors include: Eating large amounts of food and being overweight;/ Excessive consumption of alcohol, soft drinks, and spicy and fatty foods;/ Smoke;/ Pregnancy;/ //Diagnosis// Laryngopharyngeal reflux is diagnosed by endoscopy, and other tests are sometimes necessary. It is a common but underdiagnosed disease that can cause symptoms for months or years before being identified. //Treatment// The treatment of laryngopharyngeal reflux involves changes in lifestyle and diet and pharmacological treatment. //Prevention// To avoid this situation, some measures must be taken: Avoid acidic, spicy and fatty foods;/ Avoid or moderate alcohol, tobacco; and drinks containing caffeine (tea, coffee, soft drinks);/ Avoid chocolate and menthol;/ Do not wear tight clothing;/ Avoid oysters;/ Maintain a healthy weight;/ Do not eat two hours before going to bed;/ Cleveland Clinic Medical NeWs Today Swallowing problems, reflux, coughing, and bad breath can be symptoms of Zenker's diverticulum. It is a rare condition, but it can affect anyone. Although it is not a disease, bad breath (or halitosis) may indicate that there is an unresolved health problem. And the problem may not even be the mouth. Usually caused by a virus, acute laryngitis is more common in winter and children between 3 months and 5 years of age are most affected.

Skin rejuvenation with co2 laser,"//What is it?// Fractional CO2 laser resurfacing is a technique used for skin rejuvenation. Guaranteed effectiveness in: treatment of superficial/medium wrinkles;/ facial blemish treatment;/ acne scar correction;/ treatment of other scars and stretch marks;/ //Procedure// The CO2 laser causes a rapid increase in tissue temperature, destroying the epidermis (correcting surface imperfections), and inducing collagen remodeling in the dermis (with consequent improvement in wrinkles and sagging skin). The fact that it is fractionated allows these effects to be obtained on the skin while maintaining micrometric “islands” of intact epidermis and dermis between the treated areas. This technological advancement enables an extremely fast full recovery after treatment (3-4 days) without compromising its effectiveness. For example, fractional CO2 laser resurfacing provides results comparable to those of a medium peel with TCA or glycolic acid, with recovery times around three times shorter. Analysis of the most recent studies suggests that periodic resurfacing with fractional CO2 laser, combined with other care such as sun protection, will prevent aging, avoiding the need to resort to surgical techniques such as facelifts in the long term. Fractional CO2 laser resurfacing is a relatively painless procedure performed under local anesthesia. //Post-treatment// In the immediate post-treatment period (3-4 days), moderate pain, swelling, erosions and scabs may occur, which can be reduced with medication. Transient brownish hyperpigmentation and persistent redness (up to 2-3 months) are less frequent complications. Infections and scarring are rare complications. To avoid the complications mentioned, resurfacing with fractional CO2 laser should be carried out during the winter and medical recommendations should always be followed (prophylaxis of infections with topical antibiotics and oral antivirals, sun protection, among others). //Advantages// There are other techniques that allow improving skin texture and/or collagen remodeling in the superficial dermis, alone or simultaneously. However, most of them do not provide an equally immediate and evident effect as that observed with fractional CO2 laser resurfacing, associated with a relatively quick recovery.

Eyelid and eyebrow rejuvenation,"//What is it?// The peri-ocular region is where many of the signs of aging are concentrated. Periocular wrinkles, excess skin and fat pockets on the upper eyelids, and dark circles and bags (puffiness) on the lower eyelids can give a permanently tired and aged appearance. Rejuvenation of the periocular area is perhaps one of the most beneficial procedures for improving the face as a whole. All techniques used, whether surgical or not, must be selected individually, according to the needs and desires of each patient. It is important that the assessment and correction of these changes are carried out by a specialist with experience and in-depth knowledge of the anatomy of this region, who can contribute to the recovery of a more youthful look in a way that is safe for vision. //Treatment// Examples of procedures used for rejuvenation of the peri-ocular area Upper and lower blepharoplasty: Cosmetic surgery of the upper and/or lower eyelids. The choice of technique is personalized and may include the removal of excess skin, removal or transposition of fat pads, and improvement of eyelid tone. Eyebrow lift: Several techniques are used to raise the eyebrows when they are drooping (which can occur with aging, after facial paralysis, etc.). The procedure selected depends on the desired correction and the patient's profile. Application of Botulinum Toxin: Application of botulinum toxin to improve dynamic wrinkles on the forehead and peri-ocular region  Myopia, astigmatism and hyperopia often lead to the use of glasses or contact lenses.

Magnetic resonance imaging,"//What is it?// Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a medical technology that uses a magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of the body. It constitutes a harmless imaging method that does not use ionizing radiation. MRI has the ability to show the body's organs and tissues in great detail, allowing the doctor to make an accurate diagnosis.  In general, MRI is an excellent diagnostic test for studying the brain, spine, joints and soft tissues of the limbs. It is also very useful for studying the heart, blood vessels and abdominal organs. //Methodology//  The examination is carried out with the person lying on a bed that enters a tunnel open at both ends, with the part of the body that will be examined inside the machine.  Throughout the examination, you can communicate with healthcare professionals via intercoms. Healthcare professionals will be attentive during the examination and can observe you through a window.  During image acquisition, the machine emits a noise, similar to hammering noise. Whenever the machine is acquiring images, it makes this noise. It is very important that you remain still, as body movements will affect the examination.  You may need to inject a small amount of contrast medium. In this case, you may feel a slight warm sensation in your arm.  An examination takes, on average, about 30 minutes and is painless, with some discomfort resulting from the position. It is essential that you remain calm and still, without making any movements that could hinder the examination. //Precautions// In the MRI room there is a magnetic field that can attract metallic objects and interfere with electronic devices such as pacemakers.  You should wear the suit provided to you and leave all your clothing and personal items in the changing room, which will be locked during the examination. You should not take anything with you when you enter the examination room. Remove any prosthetics you are wearing (e.g. hearing aids, dental prostheses or limb prostheses). Remove glasses, rings, hairpins or other personal items.  The Intrauterine Device (IUD) and the ""lead"" in teeth are not contraindications for the MRI exam, as well as objects made of gold or other precious metals.  If the examination is performed under anesthesia or after taking a tranquilizing medication, the patient will not be able to drive or use machines and must be accompanied.  There are no known risks to the fetus, but as a precaution, it is necessary to consider the need for an MRI scan during the first trimester of pregnancy. //Conditions// Cardiac pacemaker (or ""heart battery"") - is an electronic device that helps regularize the heart rhythm. A patient with a cardiac pacemaker cannot undergo an MRI exam.  Cardiac defibrillator - is an electronic device similar to a cardiac pacemaker, which delivers an electrical discharge when the heart begins to beat abnormally. Patients with a cardiac defibrillator cannot undergo an MRI examination.  Cranial aneurysm clips- these are small springs used to close an aneurysm that ruptures inside the brain. Some older clips are attracted to the magnetic field and patients with these types of clips cannot undergo MRI examination.  Neural or spinal stimulation system - these are electrodes implanted in the brain or spinal cord that, through small electrical discharges, aim to treat certain diseases, such as Parkinson's disease.  Cochlear implant or metal tubes in the ears - these are small devices implanted inside the ears that aim to improve hearing.  Insulin infusion pump- is a small electronic device used by diabetics to administer insulin automatically.  Vascular access port or catheter - these are devices that are used for the repeated administration of medications, used, for example, in patients undergoing chemotherapy, and that may contain metallic parts.  Filters, needles and other metal implants - are used, for example, to treat stenosis in the arteries of the heart.  Metal fragment in the eyes or body - these are fragments that can move and result in injury.  Surgical staples, clips or metallic sutures; plates, screws, rods or wires in the bones - if the surgery was performed more than 4 months ago, they do not constitute a contraindication.  Tattoos, makeup and medicated dressings - Some of the products used in tattoos and makeup contain metals that can irritate the skin during the test. Some medicated dressings can cause the same reaction and should be removed before the test.  Piercing and acupuncture needles - The jewelry used for piercings and acupuncture needles may be made of metal that is attracted to the magnetic field. //On the day of the exam// Children under 5 years of age may have to be sedated so that they cannot move during the exam.

Retinitis pigmentosa,"//What is it?// Retinitis pigmentosa (also known as retinitis pigmentosa) is a group of rare genetic disorders that affect the ability of the retina - the layer of light-sensitive cells (the photoreceptors) that ""lines"" the deep part of the eye - to process light. In these situations, the photoreceptors (the cones and rods) are no longer able to process light, resulting in the gradual loss of vision. Normally, in the initial phase, the rods are affected, causing loss of night and peripheral vision. As the disease progresses, the cones, the most central cells, are affected, causing loss of central vision and color perception. It is estimated that, worldwide, retinitis pigmentosa affects around one in every 40,000 people. //Symptoms// Symptoms of retinitis pigmentosa usually appear in childhood. The most common and initial ones are difficulty seeing at night (night vision) and the loss of peripheral vision (on the sides) due to rod degeneration. The loss of these photoreceptors later leads to degeneration of the cones, and in later stages of retinitis pigmentosa, patients tend to gradually narrow their field of vision, developing tunnel vision (which means the person cannot see to the side without turning the head). Photophobia - eye discomfort when exposed to very bright light - is another symptom associated with retinitis pigmentosa. The progression of the disease varies greatly from person to person, as there are several types of genetic mutations involved. Most patients with retinitis pigmentosa lose most of their vision in young adulthood and by the age of 40 are often considered blind. These symptoms can affect patients' lives, preventing them from performing tasks such as reading, driving, walking without support and even recognizing people and objects. //Causes// Retinitis pigmentosa is an inherited disease - that is, it is passed down from parents to children - that can cause changes in any of a list of 50 genes. These genes carry the instructions for producing proteins that are needed by the cells of the retina and, sometimes, they are severe and can prevent the gene from producing these proteins. Other possible mutations can lead to the production of a protein that is toxic to the cell or even proteins with anomalies that consequently do not function correctly. Regardless of the case, the result is damage to the photoreceptors of the retina. //Diagnosis// The first step in diagnosing retinitis pigmentosa is observing the retina. To do this, the doctor uses an instrument called an ophthalmoscope. A sign associated with retinitis pigmentosa is the presence of dark, abnormal pigment deposits in the retina. Other tests used in the diagnosis of this disease are: Electroretinogram, which measures the electrical activity of photoreceptor cells.;/ Visual field tests, to determine the degree of vision loss.;/ Genetic testing.;/ //Treatment// There are some strategies that can make life easier for people who have retinitis pigmentosa. For example, children with this disease may benefit from using instruments that allow them to maximize vision, such as lenses that increase central vision, expand the field of vision, and eliminate glare. There are also computer programs that read text aloud as well as portable flashlights that adjust to the light present in the location, allowing the person to see better. The use of a guide dog may be advised. Wearing sunglasses is also important, as it helps patients cope with light sensitivity and protects the eyes from harmful ultraviolet rays, which can accelerate vision loss.  There is no cure for retinitis pigmentosa, however, some options exist to slow the progression of the disease and even recover some vision: Acetazolamide: in more advanced stages, the area in the center of the retina may have edema (swell) and consequently reduce vision. This medication may be indicated to improve the quality of vision.;/ Vitamin A: this vitamin can slow the progression of the disease over the years, however, in very high quantities it can be toxic.;/ Retinal implant: in advanced stages of the disease, some patients may be candidates for a retinal implant that can partially restore vision.;/ Optogenetic therapy: currently (2021) a treatment is in the clinical testing phase that allowed a patient with retinitis pigmentosa to partially and gradually recover his vision. Optogenetic therapy consists of the intraocular injection of a compound that is combined with the use of specific glasses that use light to stimulate the retina.;/  //Ophthalmological surveillance// It is very important that patients maintain routine appointments with their doctor in order to assess the progression of the disease.

Rheumatism,"//What is it?// This definition includes numerous diseases with very different locations and characteristics, which affect the joint and muscle structures of the body. They are degenerative diseases, closely related to aging, and therefore their frequency has been increasing, given the increase in average life expectancy. Currently, more than 150 different types of rheumatic diseases are known. Available estimates indicate that, at any given time, around 2.7 million Portuguese people suffer from some type of rheumatic complaint, which is equivalent to 25.7% of the population. And 10% have the disease in a serious and disabling state. Women tend to be more affected, accounting for around 60% of all cases. Although they affect the elderly more, children can also have them. For example, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupuserythematosus or ankylosing spondylitis affect young people of working age. According to the Brazilian Society of Rheumatology, the notion of “suffering from rheumatism” is incorrect because all rheumatic diseases have a specific diagnosis and treatment. One can, however, find some elements common to these various pathologies: they are painful, sometimes throughout life, they limit functional capacity and they are “invisible”, in the sense that the pain, if there is no visible joint deformation, is generally not understood by people, not even by the patient's family. //Symptoms// The most common complaint of rheumatism is, without a doubt, pain. It tends to vary in its intensity, rhythm and location depending on the type of rheumatic disease, and these characteristics are relevant for diagnosis. For example, it is important to distinguish mechanical pain, which arises with effort on the diseased joint, from inflammatory pain, which is more intense upon waking. Other common symptoms are heat and swelling of the joints and the feeling of weakness or stiffness when performing minimal activities, such as buttoning a shirt or writing. Patients may also report severe fatigue, lack of energy, or a feeling of malaise. As they can affect other organs, the manifestations depend on the locations affected. The most common rheumatic disease is osteoarthritis, which affects both the cartilage and the bone in the joints, causing pain, stiffness and limited movement. Osteoarthritis becomes more common as people age, accounting for 80% of occurrences in people over 60 years of age, although only 20% present complaints. Other well-known diseases are rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, systemic lupus erythematosus, agout, polimyalgia rheumatica or astendinitis. //Causes// The causes vary depending on the different rheumatic diseases. In general, the most common are degenerative forms, in which the locomotor system gradually loses its original characteristics, as occurs in arthrosis and osteoporosis; inflammatory forms, such as rheumatoid arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis; infectious forms; immunological forms, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and scleroderma; and metabolic forms, such as gout. A genetic predisposition to the various forms of rheumatic diseases has also been identified. //Diagnosis// It can be difficult because the symptoms of rheumatism occur in many other pathologies. In general, the rheumatologist reviews the patient's medical history, observes the patient and orders a series of laboratory tests as well as imaging studies. Some of the most important tests are antinuclear antibodies, C-reactive protein, creatinine, sedimentation rate and rheumatoid factor. It may be worthwhile to examine the synovial fluid for inflammatory cells, bacteria or viruses. //Treatment// As a rule, there is no cure, with infectious forms being the exception. However, this does not mean that having a rheumatic disease implies a constant source of mandatory suffering. The available treatments allow, in many cases, the maintenance of a good quality of life. As there are dozens of different rheumatic diseases, their treatment varies from case to case. Currently, there are several effective medications to control or even cure some of these pathologies. The evaluation and diagnosis process must be carried out by a rheumatologist. Importantly, the sooner you go, the more likely you are to effectively control any of the rheumatic diseases. Available treatments include rest, exercise, an adequate diet, physiotherapy, hydrotherapy, medications, containment devices and, in some cases, surgery. It is often important to combine several treatments in the same case. The prescribed medications can be analgesics, anti-inflammatories, corticosteroids or biological medications, which act on the progression of the disease. //Prevention// It is important to protect the locomotor system, conserving energy, protecting the affected joints, not overloading them, performing exercises that improve mobility and, in general, staying active. Other aspects to consider are a balanced diet, weight control, adopting correct posture, and choosing suitable shoes and a mattress. According to the recommendations of the Portuguese Society of Rheumatology, the presence of pain, stiffness or swelling in a joint, for a period longer than 15 days, requires a visit to the doctor. In this way, an earlier diagnosis, more effective treatment and a less compromised quality of life are possible.

Rhinitis,"//What is it?// Rhinitis is one of the most common causes of nasal obstruction. It is caused by an inflammatory process in the nasal mucosa and consequently a reduction in the area through which air passes. It is a very common condition in the population. //Symptoms// The typical symptoms of rhinitis are: Frequent sneezing;/ Itchy nose or throat;/ Runny nose or runny nose;/ Nasal congestion or stuffy nose;/ These can be intermittent or persistent, and can range from mild to severe. Eye allergy or allergic conjunctivitis is often associated with allergic rhinitis. //Causes// Rhinitis may be associated with allergic or non-allergic factors. It may only appear during certain seasons of the year (seasonal), or remain throughout the year (perennial). Allergens such as dust mites, pollens, fungi, animal epithelia, latex, among others, are the most common cause of rhinitis. //Diagnosis// Among all allergic diseases, it is, without a doubt, the most common. However, its diagnosis is, in most cases, delayed because it is interpreted as a common infection (cold). In prolonged and uncontrolled situations, it can become complicated by sinusitis, nasal polyposis, otitis or bronchial asthma. //Treatment// Treatment of rhinitis depends on the type and underlying mechanism, namely whether the cause is allergic, infectious, occupational or hormonal. In allergic rhinitis, the use of oral or inhaled antihistamines, as well as intranasal corticosteroids, are useful and well-tolerated medications that effectively treat itching and mucus production, stabilizing allergic manifestations. Eye drops also reduce itching, redness, and swelling of the eyes, and are often used in conjunction with other medications. In more serious situations, the use of short-term oral corticosteroids allows good therapeutic results. If it is possible to identify which is the predominant allergen causing the complaints (e.g. pollen, dust mites, animal dander, etc.) it is recommended to proceed with specific immunotherapy which consists of the gradual desensitization of the immune system to the allergens that trigger the symptoms. providing prolonged relief. //Prevention// It usually has a genetic cause.

Rhinomanometry,
Rhinosinusitis,"//What is it?// Rhinosinusitis is the most correct term to designate the extension of the nasal infection to the cavities neighboring the nasal cavities, which are called sinuses. These cavities that communicate with the nose are four - the maxillary sinuses, which are two, the ethmoid sinuses, the frontal sinus and the sphenoid sinus. //Symptoms// It can manifest as nasal obstruction, anterior/posterior rhinorrhea, headaches, a feeling of heaviness in the head, disturbances in smell and taste, and nasosinusal polyposis. In this situation, there is a polypoid degeneration of the nasosinusal mucosa, leading to the filling of the ostiomeatal complex and nasal cavity with inflammatory-looking tissue, with polyps. //Causes// The most common causes include: Viral upper respiratory tract infections are the common precursors to bacterial sinus infections.;/ Respiratory allergy causes chronic inflammation of the nasal mucosa with edema and mucus production that facilitate sinus drainage and consequently create conditions for secondary infections.;/ Exposure to irritants and tobacco;/ Nasal polyposis associated or not with asthma and aspirin sensitivity;/ Certain medications and nasal constrictor abuse;/ Immunological alterations: cystic fibrosis, HIV;/ Hormonal changes such as in pregnancy;/ //Treatment// Its treatment is medical. In some situations, where it is associated with anatomical changes that cause obstruction of the drainage or ventilation ostia of these cavities, surgical correction of the anatomical defect is performed. Nasal surgery aims to provide adequate ventilation of the nasosinusal cavities and nasal cavity, reversing nasal obstruction and rhinosinusitis. At the same time, any defects in the nasal pyramid can be corrected: hump, saddle, lateral deviations of the pyramid or nasal valve insufficiency. //Prevention// Identifying and treating the underlying cause is the main way to prevent the disease. Monitoring in otorhinolaryngology and allergology is important for curing or improving this condition. The treatment of allergies, asthma and the prevention of allergens, as well as the prevention of respiratory infections is essential for improving this pathology. Likewise, tobacco, irritating inhalants and the abuse of nasal vasoconstrictors should be avoided.

Rhizarthrosis,"//What is it?// Trapeziometacarpal osteoarthritis (Rhizarthrosis) is more common in women over 40, but anyone can have it. It usually affects both thumbs. Osteoarthritis is a disease that causes inflammation, stiffness and destruction of the joints. In a normal joint, cartilage covers the ends of the bones, allowing them to move smoothly and without pain. The joint at the base of the thumb is formed by one of the carpal bones (trapezium) and the first of the three thumb bones (metacarpal). This joint (trapezium-metacarpal) allows the thumb to move and grip with the other fingers. In osteoarthritis, the cartilage layer deteriorates and the bones rub against each other. It often affects the joint at the base of the thumb, also called the trapezium-metacarpal joint. Trapeziometacarpal osteoarthritis (rhizarthrosis) slowly destroys the joint. The pain caused by this osteoarthritis can be very disabling for daily activities. Joint Destruction by Osteoarthritis The tops of the bones are covered with cartilage. This covering acts as a cushion, allowing the bones to move smoothly. Osteoarthritis destroys the cartilage and the bones start to move against each other when you move your thumb, making the joint inflamed and painful. Over time, the bones can collapse or dislocate, causing deformity and stiffness, preventing you from straightening your finger. //Symptoms// Rhizarthrosis causes pain at the point where the thumb connects to the wrist and worsens with effort, such as trying to unscrew the tightly closed lid of a jar or trying to turn a key stuck in a lock. Time can also worsen pain. The joint can become inflamed and over time become stiff or deformed. //Causes// Rhizarthrosis is the result of wear and tear of the joint. It occurs more frequently, and at a younger age, if there has been trauma with ligament damage or a fracture of the thumb. Repetitive pinching, twisting or rolling movements between the thumb and fingers can aggravate osteoarthritis. //Diagnosis// The diagnosis of this osteoarthritis is based on the symptoms and physical examination of the hand, confirmed with x-rays of the thumb, which will indicate the more or less advanced degree of the osteoarthritis. //Treatment// Non-surgical treatment If arthritis is diagnosed at an early stage of the disease, it may respond favorably to non-surgical treatment. Your doctor may place a splint to immobilize your thumb for 3 to 6 weeks. This limits movement and reduces inflammation. It may be associated with the oral intake of an anti-inflammatory drug, such as aspirin or gerarn. If symptoms do not improve, your doctor may suggest a joint injection of an anti-inflammatory drug, such as cortisone. If non-surgical treatment does not relieve pain and stiffness, or if the arthritis is already at a more advanced stage with joint destruction, your doctor may recommend that you consult a specialist in hand surgery to assess the indication for surgery and the technique. most correct for your case. Surgical Treatment If the hand surgery specialist recommends surgery, the diseased joint will be removed, usually by removing the base of the 1st metacarpal and the trapezius and the reconstruction is carried out with a prosthesis or a tendon graft taken from your forearm and wrist. . This type of surgery can be performed under general anesthesia (which involves 24 hours of hospitalization) or under local regional anesthesia of the branchial plexus, in which only the arm is anesthetized (which does not involve hospitalization). The Recovery Initially the hand has a relatively bulky bandage and a splint. After removing the stitches, you will only have a splint to immobilize your thumb for a total of 6 weeks, from the date of surgery. This splint will keep the thumb stable while healing occurs. Once the splint is removed, the surgeon will give you guidance on the movements to be made and will send you to a physiotherapist to help you with mobility, making the new joint more flexible and the muscles stronger and more elastic. It will take some time before you regain full use of your thumb. Once recovered, you will have little or no pain – as long as you don't overdo your thumb activities. Ensure that you continue to do the exercises prescribed by your surgeon or hand therapist to improve the activity of the new joint. Your thumb may never fully recover like a new finger, but you will be able to resume most of your daily activities with virtually no complaints. Having a cast on your arm or leg helps you recover from fractures and reduces pain. Know what to do in this situation.

Snoring or resonating,"//What is it?// It results from a sound caused by the vibration of the palate and the walls of the pharynx. Snoring is not only a nuisance from a marital and social point of view, but it can also be the initial phase of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), which leads many people to seek medical help. From simple snoring to syndrome, there are a variety of intermediate situations that must be evaluated and lead to specific diagnostic and treatment situations for each case. //Symptoms// It consists of the emission of noise during sleep, originating from the upper airways, caused by the vibration of the soft palate on the tongue during breathing. //Causes// There are several causes, such as the anatomy of the airways, the degree of obesity, alcohol intake or certain medications. Snoring is quite common in the general population, with it being estimated that more than half of adults suffer from it, especially men. //Diagnosis// In cases of severe snoring or suspected OSA, the patient should be referred to a specialist consultation, where the diagnosis is confirmed and treatment is planned. Some questions are asked about how easy it is to fall asleep in everyday situations. Through an objective examination, that is, the signs that the doctor looks for in the patient, it is possible to identify anatomical changes and plan a treatment. //Treatment// It depends on the diagnosis and includes medical and surgical treatments: Correction of basic conditions, i.e., respiratory allergy and chronic rhinosinusitis, with appropriate medication: antihistamines, intranasal corticosteroids.;/ Mandibular advancement dental appliances.;/ CPAP (Continuous Positive Air Pressure) is a device equipped with a nasal or nasal and mouth mask, which ensures a gentle continuous or modified positive air pressure through the nose to the throat whenever there is difficulty in inhaling air.;/ There are different types of surgical options: Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy.;/ Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty: indicated for moderate or severe obstructive sleep apnea and consists of removing mucous folds and redundant structures of the soft palate that cause respiratory obstruction.;/ Laser-assisted uvula palatoplasty (LAUP): A laser procedure that removes airway obstruction in cases of localized obstruction. It is performed under local anesthesia and is indicated in cases of mild obstructive sleep apnea.;/ Somnoplasty: A technique that uses radiofrequency energy to reduce excess tissue in the palate, uvula, and tongue. This treatment can also be used to relieve nasal obstruction.;/ Genioglossal, hyoid, or maxillomandibular advancement: Surgery for sleep apnea that positions the tongue forward to ensure patency of the retrolingual airway during sleep.;/ Hypoglossal nerve stimulation: This involves placing a device similar to a heart bypass that synchronizes tongue movement with breathing.

Rosacea,"//What is it?// It is a common chronic inflammatory skin condition that most often affects the face. Without treatment, it will get worse over time. It is often confused with acne, eczema or allergies. It appears to be most common among middle-aged women with fair skin. Although the causes are not fully understood and there is no cure, there are several ways to alleviate its symptoms. It is characterized by redness, dilated vessels and a sensation of heat in the central region of the face. As the disease progresses, swelling and pustules may appear. Sometimes it even reaches the eyes. At an initial stage, it appears for short periods but, over time, the situation tends to become permanent. It has a higher incidence in adults between 30 and 50 years old and is more common in women with fair skin. //Symptoms// Symptoms vary from patient to patient but most cases present these symptoms and signs: Flushing: redness is generally persistent and located in the central region of the face. There may be dilation of cutaneous vessels that become visible and are called telangiectasias.;/ Inflammatory rosacea: skin lesions can become large and hard like pimples, papules and pustules. These lesions are painful and often contain pus-filled exudate.;/ Thickening of the skin of the nose (rhinophyma): as the disease progresses, the skin lining the nose becomes thickened and deforms the nose, which becomes bulbous. This condition is more common in men.;/ Ocular rosacea: the eyelids may become red and swollen and the eyes may become dry and inflamed. It usually precedes the appearance of skin changes.;/ //Causes// Its cause is unknown, but factors that trigger or worsen the condition are known: hot environments, fireplaces, sunlight, cold and wind, hot drinks, alcoholic drinks and spices, as well as emotional factors. //Diagnosis// There is no specific clinical test for rosacea. Examination of the skin and the context of the appearance of the lesions, location, type of lesions, associated with the patient's clinical history, facilitate diagnosis. Early diagnosis and immediate treatment significantly reduce the risk of disease progression. //Treatment// There are several therapies available but their prescription depends on the severity of the disease. There is currently no cure. The skin of people with rosacea is extremely sensitive and care must be taken when selecting hygiene and cosmetic products. Regular application of sunscreen is also important. Pulsed light treatment (IPL) is the best solution in cases of redness and dilated vessels. When pustules are present, antimicrobial and antiparasitic therapies are often effective. Sometimes it is still necessary to resort to drugs with isotretinoin. //Prevention// Since its cause is not known, the condition cannot be prevented. The following triggers for rosacea should be avoided: Sun/wind exposure;/ Emotional stress;/ Hot/cold climate;/ Over exercise;/ Alcohol consumption;/ Hot baths or drinks;/ Medical News Today Mayo Clinic Cleveland Clinic Do you find yourself blushing constantly, but it’s not because you’re embarrassed or ashamed?

Rotator cuff rupture,"//What is it?// The rotator cuff is made up of four tendons that lie on the joint capsule, which surrounds the shoulder joint. These tendons are called: Subscapularis (in front), supraspinatus (top) and infraspinatus and small teres at the back. Through the action of the respective muscles, the tendons work together to control shoulder movement (see article on conflict syndrome). Rupture of the rotator cuff corresponds to a rupture in the insertion region of these tendons at the level of the head of the humerus. Due to external (trauma) and/or internal actions, these tendons undergo changes in their structure and quality. Thus, a fall can lead to a rupture of one of these tendons, but also the aging process of the tendon combined with daily efforts can wear the tendon so much that it causes a rupture. Also, a worn tendon, although not ruptured, can rupture more easily due to a low-energy trauma. Although these situations lead to ruptures, they have different characteristics and as such should be viewed differently. //Symptoms// Rotator cuff tears can occur in association with activities involving repeated overhead movements, as well as as part of the aging process. Clinically, patients may present with pain (typically nocturnal), loss of mobility and loss of strength in the affected upper limb. //Diagnosis// During the consultation, we sought to find out if there were any complaints about the shoulder, whether or not there was trauma and how intense it was, whether the complaints started immediately, what intensity and type of pain you have and how incapable you are of moving your shoulder. During medical observation we look for signs of muscle atrophy and decreased strength to be able to assess what we will find in complementary exams. Diagnosis can be made through Ultrasound and/or Magnetic Resonance Imaging. The X-ray must be performed simultaneously to assess the state of the joint, given its therapeutic implications. X-rays show bone changes and provide indirect signs of tendon injury, and are therefore an important examination. Ultrasound is the only examination that can show the action of tendons in movement, however its quality is highly dependent on the person performing it and does not provide information about the quality of the tendon and muscle. Computerized Axial Tomography (CT) is of very little interest in this pathology. Magnetic Resonance Imaging can show the size of the tear, its location, and the quality of the tendon and muscle, and is the most important examination in cases where a rotator cuff tear is suspected. //Treatment// In the initial phase, analgesics and anti-inflammatories may be prescribed, which, together with an appropriate physiotherapy plan, provide pain relief and improve joint function, although they do not treat the tendon rupture. If symptoms persist, surgical treatment is necessary, usually using minimally invasive techniques such as arthroscopy. When analyzing the situation, consultation with your doctor is essential. In conjunction with complementary exams, he is able to present you with the different types of treatment and advise which, in your case, has the greatest chance of reducing/ending your pain and improving your function in a lasting way. When the pain is very severe, preventing you from sleeping at night, for example, your doctor may recommend that you undergo an infiltration. In addition to reducing your pain, it also helps you understand whether your difficulty in making movements with your shoulder is largely due to pain or whether it is mainly due to tendon rupture. In ruptures that occur in tendons that are already diseased and in ruptures of part of the tendon's thickness or complete ruptures but of small dimensions (less than 1cm), physiotherapy can be a good solution. The objectives are, in the initial phase, to reduce pain and subsequently optimize the functioning of all the muscles and tendons of the shoulder girdle, to explore the possibility of mechanically balancing your shoulder and allowing a quality life. However, there are situations in which we know in advance, through statistical analysis of the patients treated, that physiotherapy is not the best solution. In a traumatic rupture of a good quality tendon, surgical option is the best. Nowadays, surgical repair of the rotator cuff is performed arthroscopically. In experienced hands, this technique made it possible to understand the characteristics of the rupture and, accordingly, choose the best and most stable way to repair it. This fact allows for earlier and safer physiotherapy and, according to several comparative studies, leads to better results even in tendons with less good quality. When the quality of the tendons and muscles prevents the rupture repair from leading to a good result, other options become necessary. In patients under 55 years of age, muscle transfers may be a good option. These are technically very complex surgeries that consist of placing a tendon in an anatomical position that allows it to have an action similar to that of the irreparable tendon. The results for supraspinatus and infraspinatus tears are good and consistent. The association of two tendon transfers gives less consistent results. In older patients and with massive ruptures, the solution most likely to reduce pain and provide function compatible with an independent and quality life is a special prosthesis (inverted) that allows the arm to be lifted without the cuff tendons. This is a solution that was designed for patients in the seventh decade of life, and the prosthesis was designed specifically to solve this problem. The vast majority of patients, although they do not have full mobility, have acquired comfort and autonomy that makes them very satisfied with the result. In summary, hood rupture is a multifaceted entity.

Ligament rupture,"//What is it?// A ligament tear is an injury usually resulting from trauma, in which the ligaments that join the bones of the body are completely torn. Ligaments are made up of collagen fibres, arranged parallel or closely intertwined with each other. They are malleable and flexible to allow freedom of movement, but they are strong, resistant and elastic (so they do not easily give in to the action of forces). Like tendons, they play a role in stabilising the skeleton during movement, and both can be injured. Ligaments tend to become more fragile with age, and tears become more common as we get older. //Symptoms// Ligament injuries are usually accompanied by pain at the site of the injury and difficulty in moving the affected limb. //Causes// Sports practice;/ Trauma (falls, blows);/ Muscle weakness due to a sedentary lifestyle;/ //Diagnosis// The diagnosis is based on clinical observation of the patient and imaging tests such as MRI of the affected area are often necessary. //Treatment// Ligamentoplasty is a surgical procedure that consists of reconstructing a stable joint using flaps from nearby ligaments. //Prevention// Risk factors must be avoided to prevent ligament rupture. To do this, it is necessary to practice sports in moderation, strengthen the muscles near the ligaments and have an active lifestyle, avoiding a sedentary lifestyle.

Patellar tendon rupture,"//What is it?// The patella tendon works together with the muscles on the front of the thigh, the quadriceps, to strengthen the leg.  Although anyone can injure this tendon, tears are more common in middle age or in athletes involved in running or jumping sports.  Ruptures of this tendon can be partial or complete. When a complete rupture occurs, the disability is very significant and requires reconstructive surgery. In these complete ruptures, it is impossible to extend the knee.  This tendon often ruptures at its insertion point in the kneecap and, when it ruptures, can fracture a small bone fragment. //Symptoms// Rupture of this tendon causes a “clicking” or tearing sensation followed by pain and swelling.  You can see a depression in the lower part of the kneecap, which corresponds to the place where the tendon ruptured.  It is common for a hematoma to develop and the knee may move towards the thigh as it is no longer anchored to the tibia.  It is not possible to straighten the knee and walking becomes very difficult due to the instability of this joint. //Causes// For trauma to rupture this tendon, significant force is required. This rupture can result from a fall with a direct impact on the front of the knee, a blow with a sharp instrument or a jump in which the knee is flexed and the foot lands violently on the ground.  If the tendon is weakened, due to tendinitis for example, the risk of rupture is greater.  This tendon may be weakened in some chronic diseases that interfere with blood flow to the tendon, such as chronic kidney disease, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus, diabetes, metabolic diseases or infections.  The use of corticosteroids and anabolic steroids can increase muscle mass but weakens both muscles and tendons.  Previous surgeries in the knee region increase the risk of ruptures. //Diagnosis// The clinical history is important to understand whether a trauma has occurred and its context and to rule out diseases that may weaken the patella tendon.  The medical examination allows the presence of a rupture to be assessed and identified.  An x-ray can reveal that the patella has moved from its position and an MRI allows you to accurately study the tendon. //Treatment// Treatment depends on the type and extent of the injury, the patient's activity level, and age.  Partial and minor tears are treated conservatively, using immobilization, keeping the knee straight, and using crutches to reduce the load on the knee. This immobilization may be necessary for 3 to 6 weeks.  Physiotherapy helps you regain strength and increase your range of motion.  Surgical treatment allows the tendon to be reinserted into the kneecap. When surgery is indicated, it must be performed early to prevent the formation of scar tissue and shortening of the tendon.  Recovery after surgery requires pain control with anti-inflammatories, ice and immobilization. After 2 to 4 weeks, the leg can support about 50% of the body weight and, after 4 to 6 weeks, it will be able to support the entire weight.  Physiotherapy will be essential in recovering strength and mobility.  Generally speaking, the complete recovery process takes about 6 to 12 months. //Prevention// Preventing these injuries involves sensible effort management. As soon as you feel pain in your knee while carrying out a sporting activity, you should stop and apply ice.  While the pain persists, it is important to avoid activities that put pressure on the patella tendon.  Having strong thigh muscles helps to cope with the stresses exerted on the patella tendon.  Finally, using proper techniques in each exercise is essential to prevent this and other injuries.
