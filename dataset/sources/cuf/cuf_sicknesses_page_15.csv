Elbow tendon rupture,"//What is it?// The biceps muscle is located in the anterior part of the arm and allows flexion of the elbow and rotation of the forearm. It also guarantees shoulder stability. Tendons connect muscles to bones. If the biceps tendon tears near the elbow, strength in the arm is lost and you cannot rotate your palm up and down. When this rupture occurs, the tendon does not regenerate or heal. As such, appropriate treatment is essential. These ruptures can be complete or partial. Complete ruptures are the most common. At an early stage, the other muscles in the arm may replace the function of the injured tendon. However, if the injury is not repaired, there will be a loss of strength in the arm of between 30 and 40%. This type of injury is rare, especially in women. //Symptoms// This type of rupture causes the muscle to rise towards the shoulder, creating a protrusion on the upper part of the forearm and a more depressed area close to the elbow, resulting from the absence of the tendon. It is common to see a bruise in the elbow region. The pain is intense at first but becomes less intense after a week or two. Swelling may also occur in the anterior region of the elbow, loss of strength when flexing and twisting. //Causes// The most common cause of this injury is sudden trauma when the elbow is forced into extension. Although more rarely, this tear can occur when the elbow is flexed while lifting a heavy load. When you try to lift a very heavy weight, your biceps and tendons try to keep your arms flexed, but the excessive weight forces your arms into an extended position. As you try to counteract this resistance, the pressure on your biceps increases and the tendon can rupture. The most common risk factors are male sex, age over 30 years, nicotine (affects tendon nutrition) and the use of corticosteroids (weaken muscles and tendons). Fighting and contact sports increase the risk of this type of injury. //Diagnosis// In most cases, a medical examination and clinical history allow a very accurate diagnosis. X-rays, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging allow an assessment of the type and severity of the rupture. //Treatment// As a general rule, all tendon ruptures benefit from the approach represented in English by the acronym RICE (rest, ice, compression, elevation), that is, rest, ice, compression and elevation of the affected limb. Conservative treatment can be considered for older, inactive patients or when there is an associated disease that increases the risk of surgery. In general, this decision must be carefully considered, because surgery performed later may not allow full recovery of arm function. This non-surgical treatment is more effective in the case of partial ruptures. In fact, it is important that the tendon is repaired within the first 2 to 3 weeks after the injury. After this time, the tendon and biceps begin to retract and fibrose. The surgery aims to reinsert the tendon. Complications from surgery are rare, affecting 6 to 9% of patients and result in a feeling of weakness or numbness in the forearm, growth of new bone at the site where the tendon was reinserted, causing limited movement and requiring new surgery, new rupture after complete healing. After surgery, a period of immobilization is important and, subsequently, physiotherapy will be necessary, with resistance exercises. As a rule, recovery from this type of injury takes 2 to 3 months, during which time the elbow must be spared all excessive strain. Some surgeons prefer not to operate because they consider that this type of tear does not significantly interfere with muscle function. For this reason, it is important that each case is properly analyzed in order to decide on the best solution. //Prevention// In the case of sports, preventing this type of injury involves correctly conditioning and preparing the muscles, improving their strength and flexibility, and warming up before starting each activity. In everyday life, it is important to measure the effort applied when lifting a heavy load, not exceeding the limits of individual resistance and strength. It is important to note that elbow tears can affect tendons and ligaments simultaneously. In fact, a hyperextension movement of the elbow can affect several ligaments and tears can also be partial or complete. As a rule, treatment involves rest, use of ice, immobilization, compression and the use of anti-inflammatory medication.

Shoulder tendon rupture,"//What is it?// Shoulder tendon injuries occur in several common sports, such as tennis or other racquet sports and swimming. The mechanism of tendon injury may result from a process of hypertrophy or inflammation that increases the volume of the muscle and tendon and affects their mobility or from a reduction in the available space in the joint related to the formation of bone spurs. Another possibility is that the weakness of a tendon increases joint instability, thus increasing the risk of injury. Of the various tendons that can be injured in the shoulder, the most important is the biceps tendon. This muscle is located in the anterior region of the arm and inserts into the elbow and shoulder. When a tear occurs in the shoulder, the strength in the arm is lost and it becomes impossible to flex it. The biceps muscle inserts into the shoulder via two tendons. The longer tendon is more prone to rupture, as it is more vulnerable along its path. Ruptures of the shorter tendon are very rare, and for this reason, in many cases it is still possible to use this muscle even with a complete rupture of the longer tendon. Depending on the extent of the rupture, treatment may be merely symptomatic or surgical. These tears can be partial or complete and can occur simultaneously with injury to other structures of the shoulder. Often, the process is gradual, with rupture occurring when trying to lift a heavy object. //Symptoms// A ruptured shoulder tendon causes sudden, intense pain in the upper arm, sometimes with an audible pop. A hematoma may form on the upper arm and extend to the elbow. There is a loss of strength in both the shoulder and elbow and it is difficult to rotate the palm up and down. The rupture of the tendon does not allow the maintenance of tension on the biceps muscle, forming a protrusion above the elbow, which is known as the “Popeye muscle”. //Causes// Tendon ruptures in the shoulder can occur from direct trauma or overuse. The trauma may be a fall onto an outstretched arm or an attempt to lift a very heavy object. Excessive use occurs progressively and is aggravated by age. There are some risk factors that need to be considered, such as age, activities that involve movements above the head, such as lifting weights, sports such as tennis and swimming, tobacco (affects the nutrition of the tendons) and use of corticosteroid medications (increase the weakness of the tendons). muscles and tendons). //Diagnosis// Medical observation allows the type of rupture to be assessed, and various tests are performed. The clinical history also helps to guide the diagnosis. Partial tears tend to be more difficult to diagnose. X-rays do not allow the tendons to be seen, but they can be useful in identifying other problems in the shoulder. Ultrasonography is also a test of interest in these cases. Magnetic resonance imaging allows images of the tendons to be obtained and enables the diagnosis of a partial or complete rupture. //Treatment// As noted, pain resulting from a rupture of the long biceps tendon improves over time. The lesser force or deformation of the arm may not be uncomfortable for older or less active patients. In these cases, treatment involves applying ice for 20-minute periods several times a day in order to reduce swelling and alleviate pain. It is best to never apply ice directly to the skin. Rest and the use of anti-inflammatories control pain and inflammation. A period of immobilization may be important. Physiotherapy helps restore flexibility and strength in the shoulder area. Surgery is rarely needed on a long tendon rupture. However, for athletes or professionals, surgery allows the tendon to be repaired and reinserted into the shoulder. Surgery is also useful for patients whose complaints do not improve with medical treatment. After surgery, the shoulder must be immobilized and a physiotherapy plan must be defined. //Prevention// Preventing overuse injuries is very important. This prevention is achieved through stretching and strength exercises and a proper warm-up program. Knowing the correct movements for each sport is essential in order to prevent shoulder injuries resulting from incorrect movements.

Meniscal tears,"//What is it?// Meniscus rupture is one of the most common knee problems and is generally a painful and debilitating injury. The menisci are two semilunar sheets of cartilage located between the articular surfaces of the femoral and tibial condyles. //Symptoms// Knee pain;/ Swelling;/ “Popping” sensation during injury;/ Difficulty bending and extending the leg;/ Tendency for the knee to become “stuck” or locked;/ At the beginning of the injury, the pain may be bearable but it tends to worsen over time, as the inflammation worsens. //Causes// Meniscus tears are common in sports such as football or volleyball, and are common after sudden rotational movements and changes in direction during running. These injuries present a considerable risk in older athletes as the meniscus weakens as age advances. //Diagnosis// To diagnose a meniscus tear, a medical examination of the affected area is performed, and imaging tests are often necessary: ​​X-rays, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging allow for a more detailed assessment of the injuries. //Treatment// Meniscectomy consists of the surgical repair of meniscal injuries or tears. The tear can also be sutured, depending on the injured area (whether it is vascularized or not) and the quality of the meniscus. This is an arthroscopic procedure. //Prevention// They are difficult to avoid, as they usually result from an accident. However, there are some precautions that can reduce the risk of a knee injury: Keep your thigh muscles strong with regular exercise;/ Do warm-up exercises before playing sports;/ Rest between workouts;/ Wear shoes that have sufficient support and fit your foot correctly;/ Maintain flexibility;/ Increase the intensity of your workouts progressively;/ WebMD Load more;/ Both cold and heat can be used to relieve pain. However, there are situations where one form of treatment is better than another. Find out what they are. Having a cast on your arm or leg helps you recover from fractures and reduces pain.

Hoarseness,"//What is it?// Hoarseness involves a change in the tone of the voice or dysphonia. It can indicate several pathologies: poor voice placement, laryngopharyngeal reflux, inflammatory processes, benign and malignant tumors, among others. Hoarseness can be classified as functional or organic. Functional hoarseness is due to a change in the voice itself, with no anatomical changes to the vocal cords. Organic hoarseness involves lesions in the vocal cords caused by cysts, nodules or laryngopharyngeal reflux. //Symptoms// Hoarseness or dysphonia is not a disease but a symptom that can be present in different pathologies. It is a general theme that defines the change in the quality and power of the voice. The voice becomes less clear, with a lower tone and less audible. Generally benign, it tends to normalize within a few days. If it persists for more than two weeks, a medical consultation is recommended. //Causes// Viral infection of the upper respiratory tract, common in colds;/ Excessive use of voice;/ Gastroesophageal reflux: presence of stomach acid that refluxes through the esophagus and irritates the vocal cords;/ Smoking and other chemical irritants;/ Allergies, thyroid gland diseases, neurological disorders, rheumatoid arthritis and vocal cord trauma;/ Other conditions that should be excluded:benign and malignant tumorsmucosal dysplasiapapillomatosislaryngeal dystonia;/ benign and malignant tumors;/ mucosal dysplasia;/ in papillomas;/ laryngeal dystonia;/ //Diagnosis// A complete history of hoarseness and the patient's general health is essential to characterize this condition and guide the diagnosis. Laryngoscopy is performed comfortably with a fiber optic device that incorporates a video camera that allows direct visualization of the larynx, vocal cords and neighboring structures involved in phonation. Laboratory tests, biopsy, X-ray or thyroid function tests may be requested depending on the clinical situation. //Treatment// It varies depending on the condition that causes it. It can be treated simply by resting your voice or by changing your vocal habits. Smoking cessation is a very important measure in the treatment of this condition. For all patients, it is recommended to avoid exposure to smoke and drink plenty of fluids. Surgery may be recommended if there are nodules, polyps or tumors in the larynx. //Prevention// Quit smoking;/ Avoid agents that dehydrate the body, such as alcohol or caffeine;/ Avoid second-hand smoke;/ Drink lots of water;/ Humidify the house;/ Be careful with your diet, avoiding spicy foods;/ Manage your vocal effort well;/ Cleveland Clinic Given the period we are living in and the request to stay at home, with our children collected and protected, we all have to play different roles.

Sacroileite,"//What is it?// Sacroiliitis is an inflammatory lesion of the sacroiliac joints, which correspond to the articular junction between the sacrum bone of the spine and the iliac bone of the pelvis, connecting the lower part of the spine with the pelvis. This type of injury can trigger debilitating low back pain in amateur and professional athletes. This joint is not very mobile and its main function is to transmit force from the lower extremities to the spine. Your injury is the most common cause of low back pain in skiers. //Symptoms// In sacroiliitis, a local inflammatory process characterized by pain may occur, which can extend from the lumbar region to the thighs and legs, with stiffness and decreased range of motion. This pain can involve the groin and even the feet and worsens with standing for long periods of time, an imbalance of weight supported by both legs, climbing stairs and running. When associated with rheumatic diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis, sacroiliitis can be associated with complications such as difficulty breathing, spinal deformities, lung infections and heart problems. //Causes// Sacroiliitis can occur for a variety of reasons, such as trauma, after spinal surgery, rheumatic diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis or osteoarthritis, or infectious processes. The cyclical overload on the lower limbs transmitted to the pelvic region during the practice of impact and long-lasting sports, such as long-distance running, can affect this joint. A sudden impact trauma, such as a car accident or a fall, is another cause of sacroiliitis. During pregnancy, the sacroiliac joint tends to relax and stretch, which creates overload. Being overweight also increases the risk of developing sacroiliitis. //Diagnosis// Sacroiliitis can be difficult to diagnose, as it can be confused with other causes of low back pain. Diagnosis is made through physical examination, the patient's clinical history and imaging tests such as simple X-ray, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. The images can reveal the presence of bone sclerosis of the sacrum and iliac bone, irregularities in the joint contours, bone erosions and, in more advanced degrees, pseudo joint enlargement and even total ankylosis (fusion of the sacroiliac joint). Other imaging methods can also contribute to obtaining the diagnosis, such as bone scintigraphy. //Treatment// In general, treatment is conservative and involves physiotherapeutic measures, the use of analgesics, muscle relaxants, regional muscle strengthening exercises to prevent relapses, as well as the use of anti-inflammatories and corticosteroids, in specific situations, or even surgery. The type of treatment will depend on the severity of the symptoms and the cause of the sacroiliitis. If there is an associated rheumatic disease, it will be important to prescribe specific medications to treat that disease. Rest is important as well as performing exercises that provide joint stability and muscle strength. Other possible treatments include corticosteroid injections into the affected joint, the use of radiofrequency to destroy the nerve that causes the pain, electrical stimulation to reduce pain and surgery, with fusion of the joint in order to reduce its mobility and to reduce pain. This procedure is rarely used in sacroiliitis. //Prevention// The presence of sacroiliitis is not a reason to prevent you from practicing sports. The important thing is to know which exercises are most appropriate and which should be avoided. A good warm-up for 5 to 10 minutes before practicing sports is essential to prevent sacroiliitis from worsening. This warm-up can be done on a treadmill, an elliptical, or just walking. Performing extension exercises strengthens and increases joint flexibility. Low-impact exercises put little pressure on the joint. Good examples are swimming, walking on a treadmill or elliptical trainer, and water aerobics. Regular exercise helps reduce pain and improves general health, contributing to weight maintenance, preventing osteoarthritis, cancer, heart disease and diabetes. One possibility is to do one of the suggested physical activities for 30 minutes a day, five days a week.

Measles,"//What is it?// Measles is one of the most contagious viral infections, it is transmitted when a person inhales microdroplets that are suspended in the air after being expelled by the cough of an infected individual. A person with measles is contagious two to four days before the rash appears and continues until it disappears. It is almost always a benign disease, although in some cases it can be serious or even fatal. Unvaccinated people who have never had contact with the virus have a high chance of contracting the disease. Given that its transmission is exclusively inter-human and the existence of an effective and safe vaccine, measles is a disease that can be eradicated, a fact that occurred on the American continent in 2002. The World Health Organization set 2007 as the target year for its elimination in Europe. In 2005 this target was changed to 2010 and the European Programme for the Elimination of Measles and Rubella and Prevention of Congenital Rubella was launched. Despite these efforts, the situation has worsened in recent years, with outbreaks occurring in most of the 29 European countries, totaling more than 32,000 cases in 2011. Currently, measles outbreaks typically occur in previously immunized adolescents and young adults, in children who have not been immunized, or in babies too young for the vaccine (less than 12 months of age). A woman who has had measles or who has been vaccinated passes this protection on to her child, and it lasts for almost the entire first year of life. After this time, susceptibility to the virus is high. However, the first infection protects the person for the rest of their life. //Symptoms// The incubation period for measles is eight to 13 days. Therefore, it is possible to be a carrier of the virus without knowing it. Contagion occurs approximately six days before and four days after the appearance of the first red patches on the skin. The initial symptoms are: Fever;/ Nasal congestion;/ Throat irritation;/ Dry cough;/ Redness of the eyes;/ After two to four days, tiny white spots (Koplik spots) appear in the mouth, which are not always detectable. After three to five days, measles causes a skin rash associated with mild itching, mainly on the ears and neck, with the appearance of irregular, flat, red surfaces that grow rapidly. After a day or two, this rash spreads to the trunk, arms, and legs, and begins to disappear from the face. At the peak of the disease, the patient feels very prostrate, the rash is extensive and the fever can exceed 40ºC. After three to five days, the temperature decreases, the symptoms ease, and the remaining spots disappear quickly. //Causes// It's Morbillivirus. Man is the only host of this virus, which is transmitted through the spread of droplets or through contact with secretions from the nose and throat of infected people (coughing and sneezing). Indirect transmission is difficult due to the low survival of the virus outside the host. In healthy, well-nourished children, measles is rarely serious. However, it can be complicated by bacterial infections, such as pneumonia (especially in babies), or a middle ear infection. Rarely, the number of platelets in the blood may decrease, resulting in bruising and bleeding. Brain infection (encephalitis) is a serious complication that occurs in about one in every 1,000 to 2,000 cases, causing high fever, seizures and coma, usually between two days and three weeks after the rash appears. This encephalitis can be brief, with recovery after about a week, but it can also cause brain damage or even death. //Diagnosis// The diagnosis of Measles is based on typical symptoms and the rash. No special tests are performed, except in cases of doubt, in which laboratory studies can be used. //Treatment// There are no specific medications to treat measles. The goal of treatment is to provide comfort and relief until symptoms disappear, which takes about two to three weeks. Therefore, it is important to control fever and muscle aches with acetaminophen, paracetamol or ibuprofen, rest, drink plenty of fluids, use a humidifier to relieve coughing and take vitamin A supplements. If a secondary bacterial infection develops, an antibiotic should be prescribed. //Prevention// The vaccine is one of the immunizations that are administered systematically in childhood, usually in conjunction with mumps and rubella. This is administered into the thigh muscle or upper arm. Currently, the first dose is recommended at 12 months and the second at five/six years, before compulsory schooling.

Sepsis,"//What is it?// Sepsis is an extreme immune response to an infection, which can lead to organ failure and even death. In other words, it is our body's toxic and hyperactive response to a serious infection. Our immune system usually fights bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites to control infections. When infections take hold in our body, we often need antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals or antiparasitics to fight the infectious disease. However, sometimes the immune system cannot control the invading organisms and a generalized infection develops. This is the beginning of sepsis. Thus, in a person with sepsis, when faced with a serious infection, the immune system fights against itself, which can cause fatal damage to the body's tissues and organs. According to data from the Directorate-General for Health, 22% of admissions to Intensive Care Units are due to sepsis, resulting in an overall hospital mortality rate of around 40%. Mortality from the most severe forms of sepsis, such as septic shock, is around 51%. //Symptoms// Sepsis is diagnosed through a set of signs and symptoms during a serious infection: Fever above 38ºC;/ Profuse sweating (perspiration);/ Increased heart rate;/ Increased respiratory rate - panting;/ Chills or prostration;/  Sepsis can progress to a more serious form of the disease, in which the symptoms are: State of mental confusion;/ Nausea and vomiting;/ Decreased/absent urine output;/ Pale or blotchy skin;/ Changes in liver function;/ Lower than normal blood pressure;/  The sooner treatment for sepsis begins, the greater the chance of a successful cure. //Causes// It is not yet fully understood why the immune system can respond differently to an infection. It is thought that it may have to do with certain factors related to the patient in question and also the organism causing the infection, which may originate from: Bacterial infections (most common);/ Fungal and parasitic infections;/ Viral infections;/  The pathogen can enter the body through a wound or infection that may initially go unnoticed because it does not cause many symptoms. The most common initial sites of infection are the lungs, brain and urinary tract, but it can also affect the skin and other organs. //Diagnosis// In the diagnosis of sepsis, clinical and laboratory criteria are used in conjunction with severity indices, such as the criteria for Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS): body temperature above 38ºC or below 36ºC, increased respiratory rate, more than 20 breaths/minute, increased heart rate, more than 90 heartbeats/minute or a significant increase or decrease in the number of leukocytes in the blood; and the SOFA index - Sequential Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment, an assessment tool that focuses on organ dysfunction: respiratory failure presented, number of platelets in the blood, bilirubin, creatinine, cardiovascular rate, Glasgow coma scale classification and urine output. Although it is essential to treat sepsis as quickly as possible, early diagnosis is challenging, as many of the symptoms, such as fever, for example, occur alongside many other illnesses. The doctor should therefore try to know the patient's history, including any recent infections, any symptoms, and laboratory tests needed to identify the disease. //Treatment// After diagnosis, treatment of sepsis is based on treating the original cause of the infection, using: Antibiotics, if the infection is bacterial;/ Intravenous fluids and oxygen to ensure blood flow to organs;/ Supportive ventilation or other means of assisted breathing, if necessary;/ Surgical removal of damaged tissue if necessary;/  Among the groups most at risk of sepsis during an infection are the elderly, chronically ill people, newborns, and people with weak or compromised immune systems. For the elderly, the treatments to be administered can also prevent pressure ulcers or deep vein thrombosis. In Portugal, the use of protocols such as Via Verde da Sepsis allows for more effective diagnosis and therapy, such as hemodynamic stabilization of patients in septic shock. In this severe stage of sepsis, pharmacological substances such as fluid therapy are used to control hypotension. //Prevention// Taking steps to prevent infections or treating them promptly if they arise can reduce your risk of getting sepsis. Preventing wounds or disinfecting them correctly if they occur, as well as washing your hands thoroughly and seeking immediate medical help if there are signs of a worsening infection. Early treatment of sepsis can be effective, but the disease can progress, becoming difficult to treat. Patients who have suffered from sepsis may also experience long-term effects on their health, such as tiredness and inability to perform different activities.

AIDS human immunodeficiency virus,"//What is it?// AIDS is a clinical condition resulting from HIV infection, of which two types are known: HIV 1 and HIV 2. It is a disease that is transmitted through blood and sexual contact - which is why anyone can be infected - in which HIV invades the blood cells responsible for defending the body against other infections and some tumors, compromising them. a. In a patient with greatly reduced defenses, even a simple infection can become fatal. The first cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) were reported in the 1980s and, currently, according to the World Health Organization, it is estimated that there are around 36.9 million people infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Regarding the national panorama, “by the end of 2017, 57,913 cases of HIV infection were cumulatively diagnosed in Portugal, of which 22,102 reached the AIDS stage” - HIV and AIDS Infection Report from the Reference and Epidemiological Surveillance Unit of the Department of Infectious Diseases from the National Institute of Health Doutor Ricardo Jorge, in collaboration with the National Program for HIV Infection and AIDS of the Directorate-General for Health. //Symptoms// HIV infection at the beginning is barely noticeable because the symptoms are mild and can be confused with the flu or a common virus. In around 30% of cases, a short, feverish period with no special characteristics occurs 10 to 15 days after infection, as if it were the flu. After infection, AIDS has a long period of silent evolution without causing the slightest disturbance or complaint. This is the period during which the virus takes hold, begins to invade and destroy lymphocytes (the cells responsible for our defences) and to multiply. During this phase, the body compensates for this loss of cells by increasing its production and trying to eliminate the virus. Its duration is very variable (on average 8 to 10 years) and depends on the intensity and severity of the infection, the body's defence capacity and the occurrence of other diseases that reduce the defence capacity. During this period, the patient is referred to as being a carrier of the virus or HIV-positive, since the tests carried out at this stage can identify its presence. Even without signs of illness, an HIV carrier can infect anyone with whom they have sexual contact. At the end of this long silent phase, the body's defenses collapse and all the complications that define AIDS appear: Infections caused by common microorganisms that are more serious here;/ Infections by rarer agents;/ Some types of cancer that, under normal conditions, would not be able to develop;/ //Causes// For HIV to develop and proliferate and thus cause disease, it must have access to the bloodstream, since outside, outside the cells, it is quickly destroyed. The main forms of transmission of this virus are as follows: Blood products and derivatives. This route is currently very rare because all blood donors undergo laboratory tests for this virus.;/ Use of contaminated needles. This scenario is impossible in healthcare facilities, where all needles are disposable, but it can occur in the context of drug addiction through the sharing of syringes and needles. Thanks to various information measures, this route of transmission has been substantially reduced.;/ Sexual contact. Any unprotected sexual relationship, heterosexual (the most common form of transmission in Portugal, which corresponds to around 60% of cases) or homosexual, can be a form of transmission of this virus.;/ Pregnancy. It is possible for an infected pregnant woman to transmit the virus to her children. Appropriate treatment during pregnancy significantly reduces this risk. Infection at the time of birth or during breastfeeding is much less likely.;/ //Diagnosis// The diagnosis is simple and is based on the analysis of saliva or blood where antibodies against HIV can be found. Generally, these tests are still negative in the first few weeks after infection. However, new tests have been developed that allow for faster diagnosis, in the first few days after infection, which is important, as the earlier the infection is detected, the more effective the treatment will be. In addition to confirming the presence of infection, laboratory tests are important in defining the progression of AIDS and selecting the best medications to treat it.  //Treatment// There is still no cure for AIDS. It is a virus with an enormous capacity for multiplication and which undergoes numerous mutations that make treatment difficult because they often make the virus resistant to current medications. The number of medications available to control this infection is currently very significant and, in most cases, it is possible to maintain a good quality of life for a long time. The effectiveness of the treatment depends on the early diagnosis and regular medical control that makes it possible to assess, at each moment, the maintenance of the response to the selected medications. //Prevention// There is still no effective vaccine against this virus. In prevention, risk groups should not be considered, but rather risk behaviors, and therefore, correct information and the use of common sense allow, in many cases, to keep this virus at bay. Prevention includes adopting measures such as: Condom use;/ Avoid direct contact with blood or blood products;/ Take the HIV test;/ AIDS Portugal, 2013 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, abril de 2012 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, agosto de 2012 National Institute of Health Dr. Ricardo Jorge National Program for HIV/AIDS Infection RSV infection can progress to bronchiolitis or pneumonia.

Syphilis,"//What is it?// Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. It initially manifests itself as small ulcers on the skin, located on the genitals, mouth or anus, but can remain without signs for a long time after infection, which makes it easier for sexual partners to spread the disease. Syphilis represents a public health problem, being a notifiable disease, which also causes restrictions on blood donation, due to the risk of contamination of donated blood. Syphilis has three phases, separated by variable periods of latency, and if left untreated it can cause serious complications in the heart, brain, eyes and other organs. However, if the diagnosis is made early in the infection, treatment is curative. In pregnant women, screening is essential, due to the risk of transmission to the baby, in the form of congenital syphilis, which can cause miscarriage, premature birth and serious illness at birth, including deafness, neurological changes and bone deformities in the baby.  //Stages and symptoms of syphilis// 1.After infection, the primary phase of syphilis is one of the most important for diagnosis. The first signs appear between one week and three months after contact with the bacteria and, sometimes, are not noticed by the person himself. Injuries or ulcers - sometimes just one - do not cause pain or discomfort and can be underestimated. If treatment is not given, after a few days or weeks the lesions disappear, giving a sense of false security: syphilis is still present, progresses to the secondary phase and can continue to be transmitted to other people. Laboratory diagnosis and treatment to eliminate the infection are always necessary, although there may be no visible lesions.  2. The secondary phase of syphilis appears between one and six months after the disappearance of the initial lesions. It is characterized by areas of irritation or rash that can appear on any part of the body, including the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. It can also be manifested by small pimples or warts in the mouth, genitals or anus, usually accompanied by other symptoms: Fever;;/ Fatigue and muscle pain;;/ Weight loss;;/ Headaches;;/ Hair loss;;/ Inflammation of the lymph nodes.;/  Secondary phase rashes may also not cause severe pain or discomfort, especially if there are no associated symptoms, and disappear after a few weeks. However, syphilis remains transmissible for up to two years or more after initial infection. Symptoms may appear and disappear several times over this period, making diagnosis and treatment essential. If treatment is not given, the disease enters a latent phase that can last for several years, reaching more than two decades.  3. Tertiary syphilis, which appears if the infection is not treated or is not eliminated by the immune system itself, progresses to more serious and, sometimes, irreversible symptoms and consequences. 20% or more of untreated patients progress to the tertiary phase. Once the bacteria settles in certain organs, if the infection reaches this level, its manifestations directly affect the affected organs. Thus, in addition to the treatment for tertiary syphilis being more complex, there may be serious sequelae, with slow progression: Neurological damage, dementia or cognitive problems;;/ Heart disease;;/ Motor difficulties and muscular problems;;/ Seizures or neurological disease;;/ Vision problems or blindness.;/  //Causes of syphilis// Sexual intercourse without the use of barrier protection methods, such as condoms, is the main way of transmitting syphilis vaginally, anally or orally. The infection can also arise through cuts in the skin or mucous membranes, through contact with skin lesions or genitals of infected patients, through blood with contaminated blood and transmission from mother to child during pregnancy or during childbirth. When a person with the disease has a small lesion caused by syphilis, contact between this affected area and their partner allows the bacteria to pass to a new organism, spreading through the bloodstream. After the initial stages, syphilis can remain dormant for decades, or slowly deteriorate the organs where the infection has taken hold. Blood contamination is another risk associated with bacterial infection, which is why blood donation is not allowed when there is a positive diagnosis, or suspended in the case of suspicion, until complete treatment or diagnostic tests are carried out.  //Diagnosis// Accompanied by research into each person's medical and sexual history, the doctor diagnoses syphilis based on laboratory analyzes (it does not depend on the existence of symptoms of the disease) that confirm infection with the bacteria Treponema pallidum. Blood tests are the most common method of diagnosing syphilis. There are also rapid blood tests that are used to rule out this disease and HIV infection, given that co-infection is frequent. Given the danger of contagion, anyone can and should be tested for syphilis after risky sexual activity, such as unprotected acts, or if they are suspected of having an infection. As the consequences for babies are serious, during pregnancy, screening for syphilis (and other diseases, STIs or not) is always carried out both at the beginning and at the end of pregnancy.  //Syphilis treatment// In the initial phase of the infection, syphilis is treated with antibiotics, particularly penicillin. The longer the infection progresses - especially in the tertiary phase - the longer antibiotic treatment should be continued. During treatment, the patient must abstain from sexual intercourse, and after this time there is also a period of abstinence prescribed by the doctor. Furthermore, as the contagious period is around two years, all sexual partners must be informed, so that they can also undergo tests, receive treatment if necessary, and inform other people in order to break the chain of transmission. Like other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), combating syphilis is a public health issue.  //Syphilis prevention// As there is no vaccine to prevent syphilis, reducing the risk of this and other STDs essentially involves taking extra care in sexual relations and avoiding risky behaviors. Sexually active people should always use condoms correctly and test themselves for the disease in case of suspicion or diagnostic information from a partner, in order to reduce the risk of contagion.

Bilateral upper thoracic sympathectomy,"//30-minute surgery ends excessive sweating and facial flushing// Thoracic sympathectomy is the only definitive treatment for hyperhidrosis, a disease that consists of an exaggerated and unnecessary increase in sweating and affects the hands, feet and armpits. It is estimated that around one and a half (1.5%) percent of the population suffers from this disease in Portugal. Many of the patients also suffer from pathological facial flushing, which is characterized by the uncontrolled and involuntary appearance of facial flushing, described by patients as an explosion of heat, with a negative impact on their professional activity and social relationships. The definitive treatment for hyperhidrosis and facial flushing is performed through bilateral upper thoracic sympathectomy, a simple surgery performed by videothoracoscopy, in a minimally invasive way, with a single incision less than 1 cm below the armpit, with ablation of the sympathetic nerve in cases of hyperhidrosis and with the new technique for treating facial flushing, Endoscopic ThoracicSympathectomy by Clamping (ETS-C), in which a titanium clip is applied to the sympathetic nerve. The surgery is performed in the operating room under general anesthesia, lasts less than 30 minutes and the patient can return to their daily and professional activities after two or three days.

Economy Class Syndrome,"//What is it?// Economy class syndrome describes the clinical situation of deep vein thrombosis that occurs during or after a long flight, with little space for movement of the lower limbs, causing a blood clot that obstructs a deep vein. The clot formed can partially or completely block blood flow in the vessels and most often occurs in the lower leg, thigh or pelvis. Less frequently, it can also occur in other areas such as the arm, brain, intestine, liver or kidney. //Symptoms// Symptoms may include swelling, pain and tenderness, and redness of the skin, usually on the legs. If a severe case of pulmonary embolism develops, shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain, feeling faint, rapid heartbeat, sweating and coughing may occur. //Causes// In air travel, factors other than prolonged immobility may be involved (but it has not been definitively proven that they are): reduced pressure in the cabin, lower oxygen levels in the plane and mild dehydration due to not drinking enough water. It must be emphasized that the vast majority of travelers do not experience any problems. //Diagnosis// In addition to examining the patient and their complaints and clinical history, additional diagnostic tests include: Venous ultrasound (shows blood flow in the veins and any blood clots);;/ Venography (contrast material is injected into the veins so that the clot can be seen on the X-ray).;/  Other tests include: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or magnetic resonance venography (MRV);;/ Computed tomography (CT).;/ The diagnosis of DVT in the abdomen or in the pelvis and lung can also be used. Following the investigation, blood tests may be necessary. //Treatment// Most of the time, medication is sufficient and includes anticoagulant drugs (which can prevent the clot from developing or getting worse). In severe cases, hospitalization is necessary. //Prevention// The risk of DVT caused by travel is small, however it is sensible to try to reduce it, particularly if you have a known risk factor. When traveling intercontinentally, particularly by plane, you should exercise your leg muscles regularly (every half hour), stretch and curl your toes and the foot itself while sitting; walk along the plane's aisle when the crew allows it; drink plenty of water (to avoid dehydration); do not drink too much alcohol; consider using elastic stockings; and some people at high risk may be advised to take hypocoagulant medication.

Stiff person syndrome,"//What is it?// Stiff person syndrome is an extremely rare autoimmune neurological condition - although its exact incidence is unknown, it is estimated to affect about one person in every million. Two of its most characteristic symptoms are muscle stiffness and muscle spasms associated with pain. There are different types of stiff person syndrome, defined based on their physical and clinical manifestations, but the most common is classic stiff person syndrome. This syndrome appears most frequently between the ages of 30 and 60, but cases have been recorded in both children and older adults. It can affect people of both sexes, although women have twice the risk of developing the syndrome compared to men. Stiff person syndrome is associated with other autoimmune diseases, such as: Celiac disease;/ Type 1 Diabetes;/ Pernicious anemia;/ Autoimmune thyroid disease;/ Vitiligo;/  //Symptoms of Stiff Person Syndrome// The severity of symptoms of stiff person syndrome varies from case to case and, although the most common age for symptoms to develop is between 30 and 40 years of age, they can appear at any stage of life. They can also develop over a period of months to years and in some people the symptoms remain unchanged for years. In addition, symptoms can slowly worsen over time, limiting the ability to perform daily routine activities. Stiff person syndrome has as its main symptoms muscular stiffness and repeated episodes of painful muscle spasms. Spasms can involve the entire body or just one region and occur without any defined cause or be triggered by situations/events such as: Unexpected or very loud noise;/ Physical contact;/ Temperature changes, such as cold environments;/ High stress situations;/  Muscle spasms can be so severe that they dislocate joints or cause bone fractures and/or last only a few seconds, minutes, or occasionally a few hours. Because muscle spasms can be unpredictable, some people with stiff person syndrome develop anxiety and agoraphobia (an extreme fear of, for example, leaving the house or going to places with lots of people). However, it is important to note that initial symptoms may include discomfort with associated pain, stiffness (which may come and go, gradually becoming constant) or pain, especially in the lower back or legs. In most cases, the first area of ​​the body to be affected by stiffness is the trunk (i.e. the abdomen, back and chest). As stiff person syndrome progresses, stiffness develops in the leg muscles and neurological stiffness, which is typically asymmetrical (i.e., more pronounced in one leg). Other possible symptoms of stiff person syndrome include: Posture changes;/ Mobility difficulties;/ Stress anxiety;/ Potential respiratory complications;/  //Causes// The exact causes of stiff person syndrome are not known, but the scientific community describes it as an autoimmune condition (that is, where the immune system attacks healthy cells for unknown reasons). Many people with stiff-person syndrome have been found to produce a type of antibody, glutamic acid decarboxylase, which plays a role in the production of a neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid, which helps control muscle movement. However, the exact role of this antibody in the development and progression of stiff-person syndrome is not yet understood, nor does its presence necessarily indicate disease. In addition, there are other types of antibodies that may be associated with stiff-person syndrome, such as the glycine receptor. Another scenario is that of having stiff-person syndrome but not having detectable antibodies that are already known. Research into potential antibodies is ongoing.  //Diagnosis// Because it is rare and involves symptoms similar to other diseases—such as tetanus, ankylosing spondylitis, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, fibromyalgia, anxiety, psychosomatic illness, and other autoimmune conditions—stiff person syndrome is difficult to diagnose. In fact, it takes an average of seven years to diagnose. There is no single test that allows diagnosing this condition and, therefore, in addition to asking questions about the symptoms and carrying out a physical and neurological examination, the attending physician may use several tests to confirm the diagnosis, such as: Blood tests to detect glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies, which are present in around 70-80% of people with this syndrome. Blood tests can also be used to detect other relevant antibodies as well as other signs that can confirm the diagnosis or exclude other diseases. However, it is important to take into account that the presence of high levels of these antibodies does not alone determine the diagnosis of stiff person syndrome.;/ Electromyography: is an exam that studies the electrical activity of muscles.;/ Lumbar puncture: consists of collecting cerebrospinal fluid to check for the presence of glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies.;/  //Treatment of stiff person syndrome// There is not yet a cure for stiff person syndrome, but treatment can help not only manage individual symptoms, but also slow the progression of this problem. If left untreated, stiff person syndrome can progress, causing difficulty in moving around and significantly impacting the performance of daily tasks. It can also lead to serious complications. The clinical team that monitors the patient is multidisciplinary and may include specialists such as neurologists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists and mental health specialists, such as clinical psychologists. The treatment of stiff person syndrome is symptomatic and has the main objective of promoting mobility and comfort. In some people, their symptoms stabilize with medication, which aims to help reduce stiffness and painful muscle spasms. Medications may include: Benzodiazepines: These are used to treat muscle stiffness and episodic spasms.;/ Muscle relaxants: These can help relieve muscle spasms.;/ Medications for neuropathic pain.;/ Anticonvulsants: medicines traditionally used in diseases with seizures and which can help with pain management.;/  Medications such as tricyclic antidepressants, opioids and serotonin reuptake inhibitors should be avoided.  Immunotherapy can also be a therapeutic option and consists of the use of medication or other interventions that target specific abnormalities in the functioning of the immune system. There is some evidence to show that intravenous treatment with immunoglobulin (natural antibodies that the immune system produces and which, for this therapy, are obtained from donors with healthy immune systems) can, in some cases, improve symptoms.  Other non-pharmacological therapies that may also be helpful: Physiotherapy;/ Stretching;/ Massage;/ Hydrotherapy;/ Heat therapy;/ Acupuncture;/ Yoga;/ Meditation;/  Additionally, psychotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy or medication may be prescribed to treat anxiety and depression. The prognosis of the disease varies from person to person based on a number of factors, including: Severity of symptoms;/ Speed ​​of disease progression;/ Treatment effectiveness;/  Over time, walking may become progressively more difficult and some patients may need the assistance of a cane, walker or wheelchair. There may also be a gradual increase in difficulty in performing daily tasks and an increased risk of falls. Starting treatment soon after the onset of symptoms is essential to prevent or slow the progression of stiff person syndrome and avoid long-term complications, improving patients' quality of life.  //Prevention// Stiff person syndrome is an autoimmune problem and there are no strategies to prevent its development.

Restless Leg Syndrome,"//What is it?// It is a chronic and progressive disease with a significant impact on patients' quality of life. It is not always well defined by patients who may refer to it as a feeling of discomfort in the legs, not painful, accompanied by an irresistible desire to move them. In some cases, complaints also affect the arms. There are two types of restless legs syndrome. The most common is primary, with no identifiable cause and probably with a genetic component. This tends to be chronic. Over time, symptoms worsen and occur more frequently. In milder cases, there may be long periods of asymptomatic time. The secondary type is caused by another disease or medical condition and some medications. Symptoms usually disappear when the patient recovers from the underlying illness or stops the medication that caused restless legs syndrome. The prevalence of this syndrome is not well known, with studies suggesting values ​​between 0.1% and 15.3%. This incidence tends to increase with age. The severity of the complaints and the speed of their progression appear to be greater when the disease first manifests itself later in life. It is more common in females and more common in pregnant women, especially in the last three months of pregnancy, generally improving or disappearing a few weeks after giving birth. In some cases, symptoms may persist. //Symptoms// Symptoms generally appear or worsen when the patient is at rest and tend to disappear with movement. This means that they worsen at night, especially when the patient lies down, and movements of the feet and fingers are also visible when the patient is sitting. This restlessness can be falsely interpreted as nervousness. Sometimes, this disorder can also be confused with certain rhythmic and repetitive movements that occur when the person is distracted or tense. These symptoms can cause difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep. Around 80% of people with this syndrome experience periodic limb movements during sleep that tend to occur every 20 to 30 seconds, causing awakenings that interrupt sleep and affect its quality. As a result, tiredness and drowsiness during the day, increased irritability, difficulty managing stress, symptoms of depression, and difficulty concentrating and remembering are common. Given the need to move the legs, tasks such as long journeys and leisure activities become almost impossible. Movements usually occur bilaterally, but may be predominant on one side. More rarely and in more serious situations, this complaint may appear in other parts of the body such as the hips, trunk, arms and face. //Causes// The most common causes are pregnancy, terminal renal failure and iron deficiency anemia - this deficit causes changes in dopamine synthesis with consequent changes in the functioning of neurons that use dopamine as a neurotransmitter. Other diseases associated with this syndrome are diabetes, Parkinson's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, magnesium deficiency, sleep apnea, thyroid disease, Sjögren's syndrome and celiac disease. On the other hand, there are aggravating factors, such as the consumption of alcohol, nicotine, coffee, and some medications (antiemetics, antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, antihistamines, among others). //Diagnosis// This syndrome is usually diagnosed only after several years of symptoms in middle-aged adults. Some of them already had symptoms since childhood that may have been interpreted as growing pains or hyperactivity. The diagnosis tends to be clinical and is based on a set of symptoms: an irresistible urge to move the legs, worsening with rest, temporary relief with movement and worsening in the late afternoon and early evening. However, there are additional tests that can help confirm the condition and rule out other conditions. Some laboratory tests may be requested, with particular emphasis on those that assess iron metabolism, which analyse fasting blood glucose, magnesium, urea and creatinine, and a pregnancy test. Sleep studies can detect abnormal and periodic movements of the limbs, which helps confirm the diagnosis, especially since this disease is usually accompanied by sleep disorders, as the patient has difficulty initiating sleep and/or maintaining a restful sleep. //Treatment// Treatment for this syndrome should be adjusted on a case-by-case basis, depending on the associated factors and the severity of the symptoms. Therapy should aim to alleviate its manifestations and improve the quality of life of people with this clinical condition. Good sleep hygiene (find the best time to sleep and wake up and try to maintain it every day), physical activity, massages and hot baths, avoiding stimulants such as caffeine, tobacco and alcohol as well as the use of medications that worsen symptoms are some important aspects of treatment. If there is an iron deficiency, it must be treated. In this case, it is important to combine vitamin C to improve absorption. There are several medications that can be useful in treating this disease. Its selection must always be made by the doctor, depending on each situation. Some of the drug classes of interest are dopaminergic agents, opioids, anticonvulsants, and benzodiazepines. //Prevention// It is a chronic condition that cannot be prevented and for which there is no cure. The treatments and general measures indicated help to minimize manifestations and increase asymptomatic periods. However, symptoms can worsen with age.

Angelman syndrome,"//What is it?// It is a neurological disorder characterized by mental retardation and behavioral changes. It is currently estimated that it affects one in every 15,000 to 20,000 children. //Symptoms// It manifests itself in the form of a vast set of physical and psychological characteristics, of which the following stand out: Delay in motor acquisition (sitting, walking);/ Difficulty walking with an unbalanced gait (legs spread apart and stretched out);/ Absence of speech;/ Lack of attention and hyperactivity;/ Affectionate nature with easy and frequent laughter;/ It sounds choppy and difficult;/ Reduction in the size of the head and flattening of its posterior portion, large mouth with protruding tongue, prominent chin, thin upper lip, separated teeth;/ Reduced skin pigmentation, with fair skin, fine blond hair and light eyes;/ Strabismus;/ Deviation in the spine (scoliosis);/ Epileptic seizures, especially absences;/ Throughout life, these patients become less excitable and sleep problems tend to improve, but intellectual deficits, speech difficulties and seizures tend to persist. Life expectancy is normal. //Causes// The cause of this syndrome is the absence or dysfunction of a gene, called UBE3A. In most cases, it is not inherited from the parents and the genetic abnormality that causes it occurs by chance. However, there are families with more than one affected member, which suggests that this disorder can be transmitted. In around 10% to 15% of situations, the cause is not known and may result from anomalies in other genes or chromosomes. //Diagnosis// Diagnosis is determined by genetics and medical and neurological examination. However, this syndrome can be confused with other disorders, such as childhood autism or cerebral palsy. Electroencephalogram, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging can provide some additional elements, but genetic studies are the most important, allowing in around 80% of cases to confirm the existence of a deficiency in one of the chromosomes 15. In the remaining 20%, it is based only on clinical data and other complementary exams, with the genetic study not being conclusive. An early and correct diagnosis allows us to anticipate the occurrence of some of the problems characteristic of this disease, such as sleep disorders and seizures, enabling better control. It also helps to define the most appropriate rehabilitation measures (physiotherapy, speech therapy, occupational therapy) for each case. Another advantage is that it provides guidance to parents regarding the risk of this syndrome recurring in the family. //Treatment// There is no cure, but some of the symptoms can be minimized. Epilepsy can be controlled through medication, and physiotherapy can stimulate the joints and prevent stiffness. Occupational therapy helps improve fine motor skills, and speech therapy can help improve vocal performance. //Prevention// It can, rarely, be transmitted hereditarily. For this reason, genetic counseling before pregnancy is important whenever there are cases in the family. Genetics Home Reference, National Institutes of Health, 2014 National Organization for Rare Disorders, 2012 Orphanet, 2011 Load more;/ It is important that holiday activities are stimulating, especially for hyperactive children, but also that they allow for closer family ties.

Asperger's syndrome,"//What is it?// Asperger syndrome is considered an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) with a milder expression. It is noteworthy that in the latest revision of the most accepted diagnostic manual for neurodevelopmental disorders (DSM-5, 2013), the designation Asperger syndrome disappeared as a diagnosis. However, the concept continues to make sense. Children with Asperger syndrome share the challenges in communication, social interaction and behavior that characterize ASD. However, they do not have significant language delays and show normal or even above-average cognitive levels in some areas. This syndrome is much more common than classic autism. While this affects about four in every 10,000 children, Asperger's syndrome affects 20 to 25 in every 10,000. In Portugal it is estimated that there are around 40 thousand people with this syndrome, which is more common in boys than in girls (around 10 to one). //Symptoms// The most typical manifestations of Asperger's syndrome are: Difficulty maintaining comfortable eye contact and using it dynamically in conjunction with other forms of communication;/ Challenges in decoding messages beyond explicit verbal content, in relation to tone of voice, second meanings, irony, humor, facial and body expression. These signals are fundamental clues to inferring other people's thoughts, feelings and intentions.;/ There may be little initiative in communication and/or communication may be too focused on topics of interest and one's own perspective, with little opportunity for others to participate. The person with this condition has difficulty assessing the other person's real interest in the conversation, which may become too long and boring for the listener; great importance may be given to details that are of no interest to most people.;/ There are frequent topics of marked interest, which dominate conversations or activities;/ Routine is appreciated and changes can cause anxiety and some instability in behavior.;/ Sensory sensitivities may exist, particularly in relation to noise, with discomfort with sounds that do not affect most other people;/ Some degree of motor incoordination is common, which affects dexterity and involvement in sport;/ It should be noted that the expression of Asperger's Syndrome in females takes on slightly different characteristics, such as: they have greater ease with eye contact, they use more specific adjustment strategies to mitigate/disguise discomfort in social situations, they have an easier time imitating socially acceptable behaviors and can take refuge in a fantasy world. Some girls prefer to get involved in games that are more active from a motor point of view and not so dependent on communication and language (more difficult), and can be considered “boys”. In both sexes, there is a higher prevalence of other neurodevelopmental conditions such as attention deficit, tic disorder, anxiety and depression, which need to be recognized and treated. Over time, the challenges faced by children and young people with Asperger Syndrome interfere with their relationships and integration with peers, the development of friendships and, later, their integration into the workplace. //Causes// The causes of Asperger's Syndrome are not specifically known, assuming the preponderance of genetic factors, already present at birth, as occurs in ASD in general. The genes that have been identified are involved in brain development, influencing the transmission of signals between neurons and the way information is processed. //Diagnosis// The diagnosis of Asperger's Syndrome is clinical, that is, it is based on the history and observation of the individual's behavior, using developmental assessments and structured interviews. It is important that this assessment is careful and carried out by professionals with experience in the area, otherwise it could produce excessive diagnoses in people who only have a few different behavioral traits (a certain “way”), but without enough symptoms or repercussions to receive a diagnosis. . //Treatment// Treatment for Asperger's Syndrome aims to help individuals and those around them to achieve better adjustment by developing social skills, understanding their own emotions and those of others, diversifying interests, coping better with change and managing anxiety and behaviors. The context and way in which the intervention program is organized depends on the profile and needs of the individual, as well as the resources available.

Subacromial impingement syndrome,
Guillain-Barre Syndrome,"//What is it?// Guillain-Barré syndrome is a rare autoimmune disease that can lead to damage to myelin, the insulating layer of nerves (demyelination), or, in peripheral nerves, to degeneration of axons - the part of the nerve responsible for conducting nerve impulses. As it is an autoimmune disease, the reason for its occurrence is not fully known. The main symptoms are tingling and lack of strength in the hands, feet and legs and, if this condition progresses, it can lead to paralysis of the muscles throughout the body and the inability to breathe. This means that Guillain-Barré syndrome is, in its most severe form, a hospital emergency and requires admission to the intensive care unit for treatment. Guillain-Barré Syndrome can affect anyone, of any age or gender, although it is more common in adults and the elderly than in children. It is estimated that it affects one in every 100,000 people per year, and although there is no cure, treatment of this syndrome offers full recovery for the majority of patients.  //Symptoms of Guillain-Barré syndrome// The symptoms of Guillain-Barré syndrome usually begin as mild, with a tingling sensation in the limbs - most commonly in the legs. The evolution of symptoms can take hours, days or weeks and in the most serious cases cause total paralysis of the muscles. Symptoms include: Tingling in the hands, feet, fingers, ankles and wrists.;/ Flaccid paralysis, that is, paralysis or muscle weakness and loss of muscle tone for no apparent reason.;/ Areflexia, that is, absence of reflexes.;/ Difficulty walking and climbing stairs or unsteadiness in the way you walk.;/ Difficulty performing facial movements, such as chewing and swallowing or speaking.;/ Inability to move the eyes or double vision.;/ Incontinence or problems controlling the bladder and bowel system.;/ Difficulty breathing.;/  The death of a small percentage of patients at an early stage of the disease is due to organ failure or dysautonomia, a situation in which there is a lack of control over the functions of vital organs (for example, heartbeat, temperature control, etc.). The causes of death in late stages of the disease's development usually arise following complications related to prolonged immobilization and bacterial infections.  //Causes// The cause is not fully known and is described as autoimmune. However, two-thirds of patients with this syndrome have had an infection (e.g. respiratory, gastrointestinal, Zika virus or COVID-19 virus) in the previous six weeks. In rare cases there is a relationship between the onset of the disease and taking a vaccine. In these cases, symptoms appear a few weeks after vaccination, however, evidence shows that it is more likely (within the rare prevalence of this syndrome) to develop this syndrome from flu than from flu vaccination.  //Diagnosis// Diagnosis depends mainly on clinical evaluation. Since the symptoms are similar to those of other diseases (such as botulism, polio, metabolic neuropathies, among others), tests can be performed to rule out infectious diseases and immune dysfunction (tests for hepatitis, HIV). Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is also important, as patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome have higher levels of protein and fewer white blood cells in this fluid than normal — this information may only become relevant in the ten days following the onset of symptoms. Electromyography is also a fundamental test in the diagnosis of Guillain-Barré syndrome, but may present normal results at an early stage. As the clinical picture progresses, electromyography should show slowing of nerve conduction and increased latency or even absence of responses. The suspected diagnosis of Guillain-Barré syndrome requires the patient to be hospitalized and undergo nerve conduction tests and electromyography (electrodiagnostics). In this examination it is found that the reflexes in the knees and, sometimes, in the arms cease to exist because the nerve signals that travel through the nerves are slow.  //Treatment of Guillain-Barré syndrome// There are effective treatments for Guillain-Barré syndrome, although full recovery may take some time. However, 80 to 85 percent of patients make a full recovery. Constant monitoring of the patient and support of vital functions are important and, as such, the patient is generally monitored in intensive care. The following can be used in treatment: Immunomodulation, i.e. administration of intravenous immunoglobulin. If performed early, it produces a beneficial effect up to one month after the onset of the disease. The presence of more immunoglobulin in the blood leads to a decrease in the immune system's aggression towards the nervous system. The advantage of immunomodulation, in relation to plasmapheresis, is that it is easier to apply, being a less invasive procedure.;/ Plasmapheresis, or the separation of the liquid and solid components of the blood to replace the liquid component of the blood. This treatment is usually chosen when the administration of immunoglobulin has not been effective. Removing and replacing the plasma slows the progression of the disease, reduces the length of hospital stay, the mortality rate and the possibility of permanent paralysis.;/  Once the patient is stabilised, physiotherapy plays an important role in strengthening the muscles, preventing or minimising after-effects. Even during hospitalisation, physical therapy work is carried out by doctors and the physiotherapy team, which involves, for example, changing the posture and position of the limbs and moving the joints manually, to avoid major after-effects. Recovery after hospitalisation allows the patient to regain quality of life after the illness.  //Prevention// As the cause of Guillain-Barré syndrome is not completely known, there is no prevention, but it is important to emphasize that, with the first symptoms, it is essential to consult a doctor, so that the disease does not progress to a serious condition.

Raynaud's syndrome,"//What is it?// Called Raynaud's syndrome or Raynaud's disease, it especially affects the capillaries in the fingers and toes. This pathology is manifested by vasospasm, in response to cold or stressful situations: the capillaries narrow and the circulation of blood or oxygen in these areas decreases. As a result, the fingers, or other affected areas, turn white and can then evolve into a bluish hue. These episodes are reversible, taking, on average, around 15 minutes for the blood vessels to dilate again and blood circulation to be reestablished. It is possible to distinguish between two types of Raynaud's syndrome depending on whether or not there is a disease, condition or lifestyle that causes Raynaud's syndrome.  Most of these cases are diagnosed in childhood or adolescence and the episodes are not serious, as they do not cause damage to the capillaries or the skin in the affected area. When the patient has high blood pressure, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease or diabetes, the episodes of vasospasm may be aggravated.  It is rarer and most cases are diagnosed after the age of 30. It is linked to autoimmune or vascular occlusive diseases. Secondary Raynaud's is characterized by episodes of vasospasm of greater intensity, painful and capable of causing ischemic injuries, that is, problems arising from blood and oxygen deprivation in that area (skin ulcers and gangrene, which can result, in extreme cases, in amputation). digital).  //Symptoms of Raynaud's syndrome// Vasospasm episodes are triggered by cold or stressful situations. The body's natural response to cold is increased vasoconstriction as a strategy to conserve heat in the body. However, during an episode of vasospasm, vasoconstriction in the toes, hands, and sometimes the nose, ears, lips, and tongue is extreme, causing: Change in skin color: As blood circulation stops and resumes, the affected area may turn white, blue, and pink. Some people only go through one or two of these stages and not all three.;/ Cold and numb skin: when a certain area of ​​the body does not receive blood or oxygen in ideal quantities, it becomes cold and has little sensitivity. Some people describe this situation by saying that this area of ​​the body has “fallen asleep”.;/ Tingling: when blood circulation and oxygen supply resume, some stinging sensations are felt on the skin, a kind of tingling sensation.;/ Skin ulcers or gangrene: in the most severe cases (associated with secondary Raynaud's), long and severe episodes may occur, which are probably painful. Skin lesions, ulcers and even the death of some tissues may occur, causing gangrene.;/  //Causes// Primary Raynaud's syndrome is not linked to any specific cause. Cases show that it affects mostly women and people with a family history of Raynaud's syndrome. The condition is also more common in people who live in cold climates. Secondary Raynaud's syndrome is linked to diseases, conditions or the patient's lifestyle. Some of the factors are: Autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, overlap syndrome, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, Sjögren's syndrome, undifferentiated connective tissue disease and vasculitis, CREST syndrome, mixed connective tissue disease).;/ Occlusive vascular diseases (arteriosclerosis, atheroembolism, thromboangiitis obliterans).;/ Other diseases such as polycythemia, paraproteinemia and cryoglobulinemia, carpal tunnel syndrome.;/ Use of certain medications or drugs (beta blockers, bleomycin, cisplatin, cyclosporine, nicotine, vinblastine, amphetamines, cocaine).;/ Vibrations such as those caused by the use of pneumatic hammers.;/ Vascular trauma or frostbite.;/  In both cases, episodes of vasospasm can be triggered by: Exposure to cold weather or strong air conditioning.;/ Contact with the inside of a freezer or with cold or icy objects.;/ Anxiety stress.;/  //Diagnosis// In addition to the effects reported during episodes of vasospasm and the patient's history, some tests are necessary to confirm the diagnosis of Raynaud's syndrome and to distinguish between primary and secondary Raynaud's. The most commonly used tests for diagnosis are: Nailfold capillaroscopy: essential for diagnosis and for distinguishing between the two types of Raynaud's syndrome. It is a non-invasive imaging technique that observes microcirculation and microvascular patterns.;/ Blood tests: to detect the presence of autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases or others (through the counting of anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), inflammatory markers (VS - and CRP).;/  If there is a suspicion that a blood vessel may be blocked, a Doppler ultrasound may be necessary after the patient has been exposed to cold.  //Treatment of Raynaud's syndrome// In relation to primary Raynaud's, treatment first involves identifying the situations that trigger the episodes and avoiding them. In the case of secondary Raynaud's, this is also a fundamental strategy, helping to reduce the severity of outbreaks. Some strategies are essential such as: Use of warm gloves and socks.;/ Avoid sudden changes in temperature.;/ Stop smoking (which narrows blood vessels) and avoid medications such as nasal decongestants, amphetamines or ergotamine.;/  However, to improve the quality of life of some patients with both types of Raynaud's, medications may be necessary, such as: Calcium channel blockers.;/ Serotonin antagonists.;/ Prostaglandins (in severe cases).;/ Nitroglycerin ointments to treat skin lesions.;/  When none of the previous treatments have any effect, sympathectomy may be suggested, a surgery that blocks some nerve connections close to the most affected capillaries. As a consequence, the nervous system does not emit stimuli for the capillaries to contract further. This surgery may not be permanent, but it will alleviate symptoms for at least one to two years. It is worth mentioning that, for the relief of secondary Raynaud's syndrome, the treatment of the condition or disease to which it is linked contributes.  //Prevention// It is not possible to prevent Raynaud's syndrome, but it is possible to understand what triggers episodes of vasospasm and avoid them. This is, in fact, the first treatment indicated for primary Raynaud's patients. Cleveland Clinic, March 2023 MSD Manual, March 2023 Mayo Clinic, March 2023 NHS, March 2023 Brazilian Society of Internal Medicine, March 2023 Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is the most common type of arthritis in children.

Carpal canal syndrome,"//What is it?// There is a space on the front of the wrist known as the carpal tunnel where the median nerve and nine tendons pass from the forearm into the hand. Carpal tunnel syndrome occurs when increased pressure within the tunnel causes compression of the nerve, which is very sensitive. When the compression is high enough, it causes changes in nerve function, which can lead to numbness, paresthesias, and pain in the hand and fingers. //Symptoms// Symptoms are usually pain, numbness, tingling or a combination of the three in one or both hands. Numbness and tingling affect the thumb, index finger, middle finger and part of the ring finger in most situations. The signs usually appear at night, but can appear during daily activities, such as driving or reading a newspaper. Patients notice that they have decreased grip strength and may drop objects from their hands. In the most severe cases, sensitivity may be completely absent and the muscles at the base of the thumb may be atrophied (thenar eminence atrophy). //Causes// Usually the cause is unknown. Edema of the tendon sheath, known as tenosynovitis, can increase pressure within the canal. Bone dislocations, fractures, and arthritis can narrow it, but they are not as common. Fluid retention during pregnancy can in some cases cause edema in the canal, which normally disappears after birth. Some diseases such as hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes and kidney failure may be associated with this syndrome. //Diagnosis// A detailed history of the type of hand activity, any previous trauma, and previous symptoms are important. An x-ray may be ordered to check for other causes, such as arthritis or an underlying fracture. In some cases laboratory studies may be necessary if there is a suspicion of an associated disease. An electromyogram is usually performed to confirm the diagnosis and exclude any compression of the median nerve at a level other than the wrist, such as the forearm, shoulder, or cervical spine. //Treatment// Elimination of symptoms can sometimes be achieved without surgery. Changing activities to reduce repetitive, strenuous use of the hand or keeping the wrist in a neutral position can help reduce swelling within the canal, creating more space for the nerve. Wearing a splint at night can reduce complaints that prevent sleep. Anti-inflammatory medications, either taken orally or injected directly, can reduce swelling and pressure. When symptoms are very severe or do not improve, surgery may be necessary to widen the carpal tunnel. The objectives of this intervention are to increase the space within the canal and reduce pressure on the nerve. After surgery, the painful sensation around the scar may persist for a few weeks or months. The numbness and tingling may disappear quickly, but it may take some time for wrist and hand mobility to return to normal. Symptoms may, in some cases, return and resuming heavy or repetitive work may be a cause of recurrence. //Prevention// The condition can be caused by so many different activities that prevention can be challenging. Changes in your workstation—such as correct posture and proper hand and wrist positioning—can help reduce some risk factors. Other preventive methods include: Sleep and work with your wrists straight;/ Keep your wrists straight when using tools;/ Avoid flexing and extending your wrists repeatedly.;/ Decrease repetitive pressure with the wrist in a flexed position;/ Rest frequently from repetitive activities;/ Perform warm-up and stretching exercises before and after physical activities;/ Appropriately monitor and treat medical conditions related to carpal tunnel syndrome;/ Medical News Today Load more;/ There are few children who decide to wash their hands of their own free will.

Sindrome do colon irritavel,"//What is it?// It is a disorder of the digestive tract that causes a wide range of chronic or recurrent digestive symptoms (abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, feeling of gas and abdominal distension) in the absence of a detectable organic cause. Its designation is due to the fact that, in these patients, the muscular tissue of the intestine is more sensitive and reacts more intensely to habitual stimuli, such as food and stress. This dysfunction can cause delay or acceleration in bowel movement and, consequently, changes in the frequency, shape or consistency of feces. There are four subtypes of this dysfunction, based on the consistency of the stool: irritable colon with constipation, irritable colon with diarrhea, mixed forms and unclassifiable forms. Irritable bowel syndrome is commonly known as ""nervous colitis"", ""spastic colitis"", ""irritable colon"" or ""functional bowel disease"". In developed countries, it is estimated that approximately 10% to 20% of the population suffers from this disease. Women are affected twice as often as men and it can occur before the age of 45. //Symptoms// The most common manifestations are abdominal pain or discomfort, associated with diarrhea, constipation or both. As a rule, abdominal pain or discomfort must be associated with two of the following three symptoms: starting with bowel movements that occur more or less frequently than usual; begin with the presence of less consistent and more watery stools or, on the contrary, stools that are harder than usual; and improve with evacuation. Irritable bowel syndrome can also cause diarrhea, with a feeling of urgency to defecate; constipation; a feeling of incomplete evacuation; the presence of mucus in the stool and flatulence (elimination of gas). Abdominal pain is often triggered by eating and relieves after defecation or passing gas. The pain is usually located in the lower abdomen. Distension and a feeling of abdominal gas may also occur. Patients often experience several of these symptoms for long periods of time. Symptoms can be worsened by stress and anxiety. The presence of blood in the stool, weight loss or fever should raise the suspicion of a diagnosis other than irritable bowel syndrome. //Causes// Its origin is not fully understood. It is believed that it may be the result of a combination of physical and psychological problems. Some of the possible causes are changes in the signaling between the brain and the intestine, leading to changes in bowel habits, pain and discomfort; changes in gastrointestinal motility, causing diarrhea, constipation or intestinal spasms; intestinal hypersensitivity, with increased reactivity to distension caused by gas or feces; psychological problems such as anxiety, depression, panic attacks, post-traumatic stress, history of sexual abuse; bacterial gastroenteritis; excessive bacterial proliferation in the small intestine that produces gas, diarrhea and weight loss; changes in neurotransmitter levels; genetic factors; sensitivity to certain foods, such as those rich in carbohydrates, spicy foods, coffee and alcohol. //Diagnosis// It is based on the presence of abdominal pain or discomfort starting more than 6 months ago, in the absence of another disease or injury that could explain this pain. The study of feces, blood tests, colonoscopy, are some of the tests that may be necessary. Colonoscopy is important after age 50 for colon cancer screening. //Treatment// There is no cure but symptoms can be alleviated through a combination of dietary changes, medication, use of probiotics and treatment of associated psychological problems. Foods that are low in fat and rich in carbohydrates, such as pasta, rice, cereals, fruits and vegetables, should be preferred. Foods that tend to worsen symptoms should be avoided, such as foods rich in fat, dairy products, coffee, alcohol, artificial sweeteners, beans and cabbage. Fiber can reduce constipation but increase gas formation, so it must be introduced in a controlled manner. Within medications, the alternatives depend on the symptoms and can be fiber supplements, laxatives, antidiarrheals (loperamide), antispasmodics or antidepressants. Sometimes antibiotics can be helpful, especially in cases where the presence of bacterial flora overgrowth in the small intestine is demonstrated. Probiotics are live microorganisms, generally bacteria, similar to those that normally exist in the intestine. Their administration tends to improve the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. Addressing psychological problems is an essential aspect of controlling this syndrome. Reducing stress, resting and exercising can help reduce the frequency and severity of symptoms, positively influencing the disease. The improvement or resolution of your symptoms is a slow process, which can last six months or more. Therefore, patience is essential and the role of the doctor-patient relationship is fundamental in order to prevent frustration or abandonment of treatment. //Prevention// Prevention involves dietary control, adopting healthy lifestyle practices and avoiding all factors that can trigger crises. Knowing the disease well and knowing how to identify what makes it worse is the best way to prevent its symptoms. Physical exercise and stress control are two equally very important aspects.

Polycystic ovary syndrome,"//What is it?// It is one of the most common endocrinological disorders, affecting approximately 6% of the female population of reproductive age. It is an important syndrome because it affects a large number of women of childbearing age. Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have a hormonal imbalance that interferes with normal reproductive processes. The first changes appear at puberty and manifest as menstrual changes and hormonal variations. This condition is often associated with infertility, a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases and a higher prevalence of endometrial cancer at an early age. //Symptoms// The most characteristic symptoms are irregular menstrual cycles, excess body hair, hair loss usually in the temporal region, acne, obesity, high blood pressure and changes in glucose metabolism. It is still the most common cause of infertility and may be associated with an increased cardiovascular risk in the case of obesity, high blood pressure and altered glucose metabolism. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) occurs when at least two of the following criteria are present: Oligomenorrhea, amenorrhea or anovulation;/ Hyperandrogenia or hyperandrogynym;/ Polycystic ovaries identified by imaging tests;/ //Causes// The pathophysiology or cause is not yet well understood, with genetic and hormonal factors involved that can be aggravated by lifestyle. It is known that there is a disorder in the ovaries, adrenal glands, skin and adipose tissue, and in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. //Diagnosis// Most cases can be diagnosed with a thorough evaluation of medical history and symptoms, as well as a physical examination. It may still be necessary to use blood tests to measure the levels of various hormones. Pelvic ultrasound can confirm the diagnosis. //Treatment// Treatment options should be analyzed on a case-by-case basis, according to the patient's symptoms. Many of them are more aesthetic than therapeutic, since polycystic ovary syndrome has no cure. Although some manifestations can be treated as isolated diseases (acne, for example), it is not recommended to take this specific medication, as it does not act on the origin of PCOS, having only a superficial effect. The most common forms of treatment are: Regular physical exercise;/ Weight loss diet or specific diet for diabetics;/ Use of specific contraceptive pill for PCOS;/ Use of oral hypoglycemic agents or other drugs that are indicated for the metabolic clinical condition in question;/ Use of specific drugs to limit excess testosterone or the action of existing testosterone;/ Use of menstrual stimulants;/ Psychotherapy to manage stress and reduce anxiety caused by bodily changes;/ //Prevention// There is no known prevention for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). However, through proper nutrition and weight control, many women with this syndrome can avoid developing diabetes and cardiovascular problems.

Metabolic syndrome,"//What is it?// Metabolic syndrome is the coexistence, in the same patient, of an increased waist circumference (greater than 94 centimeters for men, and greater than 80 centimeters for women) and the following two pathological situations: changes in fasting blood glucose or diabetes, high blood pressure and dyslipidemia (altered triglycerides and/or HDL). Patients with metabolic syndrome have a 3.5 times greater risk of death from cardiovascular diseases, such as myocardial infarction and stroke. //Symptoms// Central, visceral, abdominal obesity greater than 94 centimeters for men, and greater than 80 centimeters for women;/ Fasting blood glucose levels of 100mg/dl or higher;/ Blood pressure of 130/85 mm/Hg or higher;/ Blood triglyceride levels of 150mg/dl or higher;/ High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels of 40 mg/dL or less for men and 50 mg/dL or less for women;/ //Causes// In addition to a genetic predisposition, abdominal obesity and a sedentary lifestyle are the main causes of this syndrome. Research has identified excess abdominal fat as a common factor in most of these cases. This, in turn, causes a change in the hormonal state characterized by insulin resistance, which contributes to the onset of hypertension, cholesterol changes and diabetes. //Diagnosis// It is currently possible to recognize insulin resistance before its consequences occur and reverse it with appropriate measures and timely intervention. An early diagnosis with changes in lifestyle, control of metabolic changes and possible medication intervention makes it possible to avoid or delay the appearance of complications of this condition and increase the average life expectancy of these patients. //Treatment// Metabolic syndrome is characterized by the presence of a set of risk factors that include accumulation of abdominal fat, high blood pressure and high levels of glucose (sugar) and cholesterol in the blood. Together, these risk factors greatly increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The treatment aims precisely to control the different changes that are part of the condition, to prevent progression to more serious forms of the disease. //Prevention// Lifestyle changes are highly recommended in preventing metabolic syndrome: Exercise 30 to 60 minutes, five days a week;/ Eat a healthy diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products, and avoid saturated fats, cholesterol, and salt.;/ Lose weight if you are overweight;/ Quit smoking;/ Maintain regular medical check-ups.

Post-thrombotic syndrome of the lower limbs,"//What is it?// It consists of a set of changes that can occur, in the long term, after a deep vein thrombosis (occlusion of a deep vein by a thrombus). It is a frequent and sometimes disabling consequence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). This is a potentially debilitating condition for which patients seek medical advice. This condition develops in 20% to 50% of patients with DVT, even when anticoagulant therapy is used to treat it. Manifestations range from mild to more serious clinical signs, such as chronic leg pain that limits daily activities or the ability to work. //Symptoms// Increased volume of the affected limb. After the acute phase of deep vein thrombosis, the edema usually regresses only partially;/ Feeling of tiredness and heaviness in the legs, worsening at the end of the day;;/ Appearance of varicose veins;/ Dark pigmentation of the skin in the ankle region and other skin manifestations (such as eczema and fibrosis) that gradually make it more fragile and susceptible to infections and trauma;/ Ulceration of the skin in the ankle region (with or without infection). Healing of these ulcers is generally slow and depends on patient adherence to prescribed treatments.;/ //Causes// After appropriate treatment, the thrombus usually recanalizes. However, in many cases, after-effects remain, which in a later stage gradually lead to changes resulting from increased return pressure of venous blood from the lower limbs. It should also be noted that the higher the level of thrombosis, the more severe the symptoms. //Diagnosis// There is no standard biomarker, imaging or physiological test that establishes its diagnosis. The presence of symptoms and signs typical of a previous deep vein thrombosis is an important element in the clinical history. Post-thrombotic syndrome usually manifests within three to six months after DVT, but can occur up to two years or more. //Treatment// Treatment options vary depending on the severity of the condition. Treatment usually includes elevation of the affected limb, exercise, and compression therapy or compression stockings. Doctors may also prescribe blood thinners to prevent more clots from forming in the veins, and medications to control pain. Changing lifestyle by increasing physical exercise and reducing weight has proven beneficial in the recovery of these patients. The importance of therapy prescribed in the acute phase of deep vein thrombosis must be emphasized because signs of secondary chronic venous disease may take years to appear, giving the false sensation that the disease has stabilized. //Prevention// Daily use of a suitable compression stocking, which should always be put on when getting up and taken off when going to bed;/ Intermittent leg rest by placing the legs on a surface elevated at approximately 30 degrees;/ Placing the foot of the bed higher than the head (for venous drainage at night);/ Avoid wearing tight clothing;/ Avoid standing still for long periods of time.;/ Avoid excessive body weight;/ Proper hygiene, hydration and skin protection;/ In case of a skin ulcer, you should immediately consult a doctor;/ National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine Healthline Load more;/ Sonovein ecotherapy is a non-invasive treatment for varicose veins.

Synechia two small lips,"//What is it?// Synechiae (or adhesion) of the labia minora is a common situation (2-5%) in female children before puberty (especially between 3 months and 6 years), in which the labia minora fuse with each other (around the external opening of the vagina), forming a narrow shiny membrane, which is thought to be due to the low levels of estrogen typical of this age, local inflammation or contact with irritating substances. Its severity or extent is highly variable, from almost complete fusion, although a small hole always remains that allows urine to pass through, to milder cases in which only fusion occurs over 30-50% of the total length of the labia minora. . //Symptoms// This is a generally asymptomatic situation, which does not usually cause any urological or gynecological problem, and is almost always detected during routine observation by the attending physician or by the parents themselves (most frequently when changing the diaper). Very rarely urinary infections, local irritation or urine leakage (related to the retention of small amounts of urine that are trapped inside the labia minora and expelled after the child urinates normally) may occur. However, it has no implications on the future life of girls, as it does not affect sexual development or normal fertility. Several other pathologies must, however, be excluded when a change in the external genitalia is observed (for example, an imperforate hymen). //Treatment// Treatment, if indicated, should be conservative (local creams – lubricating or containing estrogens – or detachment made with anesthetic ointment), as even untreated cases usually resolve spontaneously during puberty, probably in relation to the increase in estrogen levels. Furthermore, the separation of the labia minora can be painful and recur (reappear) several times until the age of the first menstruation.

Sinusitis,"//What is sinusitis?// Sinusitis is a general term commonly used to describe inflammation or infection in one or more sinuses (four groups), which can be caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi or as a consequence of an allergic reaction. The paranasal sinuses are airy cavities, lined with a mucous membrane identical to that of the nasal cavities, which exist in the bones of the face. Called frontal, ethmoidal, sphenoidal and maxillary, depending on location, the paranasal sinuses surround the nose and communicate with the nasal cavities through small holes. These cavities produce mucus drained from the nose, which has a protective function of the airways. When inflammation occurs, as is the case with sinusitis, the sinuses become blocked due to the accumulation of mucus that causes infection and pain. Sinusitis is a very common disease that significantly affects the quality of life, as well as the professional and social performance of those affected. A study conducted in Coimbra and published in 2012 identified a prevalence of sinusitis of 27%. More recent data indicate a prevalence in Europe of between 10% and 30%, and 15% in the United States. On the other hand, the anatomical and functional proximity between the nasal cavities and the sinuses means that acute sinusitis is frequently associated with rhinitis, and is generally followed by this inflammation, as is the case with allergic rhinitis. Between 53% and 70% of patients with rhinitis develop sinusitis, and 56% of patients with sinusitis suffer from rhinitis symptoms. Rhinosinusitis can become chronic, being one of the most common chronic diseases in the world - it is estimated that 10.9% of Europeans suffer from this condition. Asthma is another inflammatory disease that is often associated with sinusitis and rhinitis, and episodes of one can trigger the others.  //Causes of sinusitis// Sinusitis can be caused by factors that prevent the drainage of nasal secretions, allowing them to accumulate, resulting in inflammation. Respiratory allergies are a common cause of sinusitis, but there are other factors that can trigger this problem.  Allergens such as pollen, house dust, dust mites and animal dander often cause sinusitis attacks, which, although temporary, can occur throughout the year. It is a form of sinusitis most identified by symptoms of itching in the nose, eyes and throat.  A cold or flu, caused by a virus, when causing a respiratory tract infection, can cause sinusitis, contributing to the general symptoms of the disease. Sinusitis can also have a bacterial cause, either alone or in conjunction with a viral infection, especially when nasal symptoms associated with a cold do not improve after ten days.  It can be allergic, a consequence of an allergy to certain types of fungi - just reduced contact with the allergen - or invasive, the latter being the most serious. Invasive fungal sinusitis is characterized by an aggressive infection by the fungus and often occurs in situations where the immune system is compromised.  //Types of sinusitis according to duration// Sinusitis can be defined and described depending on the causes, but also the duration and frequency with which it occurs.  These are isolated episodes of sinusitis, often with a viral cause, as in the case of a cold, or bacterial. It can also be allergic, after intense contact with an allergen or irritating substance, such as pollution or chemical substances. Dental infections and abscesses can also cause this type of sinusitis. Symptoms of acute sinusitis may persist for two to four weeks.  Subacute sinusitis occurs when symptoms last for up to 12 weeks, and specific treatment for the cause, using antibiotics, is required.  It is called chronic sinusitis when its duration exceeds 12 weeks, and can occur both in people with chronic allergies and in isolated situations, such as, for example, a bacterial infection, prolonged contact with irritating substances or due to air pollution.  When acute sinusitis occurs at least four times a year, disappearing quickly and returning after ten days or more, it is called recurrent sinusitis. It can originate from any of the previous causes, and is also potentiated by anatomical factors of the nose, allergic rhinitis, exposure to pollution and irritants, or even medical conditions that affect the immune system or respiratory tract.  //Risk factors for sinusitis// In addition to the most common causes, such as allergies or respiratory infections, there are several situations that increase the risk of sinusitis: Cold and humid weather conditions;;/ Nose trauma;;/ Presence of nasal polyps;;/ Sudden pressure changes associated with flying or diving;;/ Atmospheric pollution (car, industrial or secondhand tobacco smoke);;/ My hygiene is good;;/ Deviations of the nasal septum;;/ Diseases that cause immune system disorders;;/ Excessive use of nasal decongestants;;/ Tobacco use.;/  Swimming, despite being normally beneficial in the case of respiratory diseases, can, however, in susceptible people, increase the risk of developing sinusitis, mainly due to the presence of chlorine in the water.  //Sinusitis symptoms// The list of symptoms is long, and their combination or severity often depends on the duration and cause of the sinusitis. In most situations, sinusitis disappears with treatment, but in subacute or chronic cases, symptoms can persist for a long time. Pain in the face is usually more intense in cases of acute sinusitis. Symptoms of sinusitis may include: Nasal congestion;;/ Rhinorrhea (discharge of secretions from the nose);;/ Cough;;/ Swelling and pain in the nose and nasal passages;;/ Itchy nose, eyes and throat;;/ Reduced sense of smell and taste;;/ Bad breath;;/ Fever;;/ Fatigue;;/ Weakness;;/ Headaches;;/ Pressure in the ears.;/ It is common to feel yellow or greenish mucus draining, which may also go down the throat. Many patients report pain or a feeling of pressure in the face, cheekbones, nose or between the eyes, and headaches are also common.  //Sinusitis in children// With their respiratory system, facial and paranasal sinuses still developing, children often suffer from nasal infections and sinusitis, whether allergic or infectious. The greatest difficulty in releasing nasal secretions increases infections caused by viruses or bacteria, in addition to contact with all types of objects or with other children, dirt, as well as the act of frequently putting your hands in your mouth. Sinusitis in children can also be caused by the use of a pacifier or by using a bottle while lying down. Acute, unilateral sinusitis in young children should raise suspicion of a foreign object stuck in the nostril and is a reason for urgent medical observation. Sinusitis symptoms in children are similar to those in adults, although less intense in most cases. A more common symptom in children is irritability, mainly due to the fact that they do not know how to deal with the problem. As the symptoms are common to flu or colds, as well as other possible infections in children, diagnosing childhood sinusitis is often complex.  //Diagnosis of sinusitis// The diagnosis of acute sinusitis in children or adults is essentially made through a clinical evaluation, when the presence of purulent nasal secretion, nasal obstruction and a sensation of pressure or pain in the face is verified. Medical confirmation, especially when symptoms persist for a few weeks, can be completed with nasal endoscopy, computed tomography or x-ray. In children, exams that use radiation are avoided, unless there are severe symptoms, signs of risk or severity or that may indicate another type of disease. If the symptoms are chronic, without signs of severity and persist after three months even with treatment, or the sinusitis is recurrent, it will be necessary to consult an otorhinolaryngologist, as it may be chronic sinusitis. The exams make it possible to accurately check the condition of the sinuses, revealing the presence of other possible causes, such as injuries, polyps or severe deviations of the nasal septum.  //Sinusitis treatment// The treatment of sinusitis depends on its cause and usually requires a multifaceted approach, taking into account the patient's general condition, treatments already carried out, lifestyle and coexisting diseases. The objectives of therapy for sinusitis are to control and cure the infection, reverse the obstruction of the drainage holes of the paranasal cavities, reduce the risk of progression to a chronic situation and prevent more serious complications. Treatment generally includes decongestants and painkillers, and saline nasal sprays are also helpful. Antibiotics may be used, but are not the preferred treatment in most cases. A recent Portuguese study found that two-thirds of patients with acute rhinosinusitis can be cured in less than two weeks without the need for antibiotics. When sinus obstruction cannot be treated with drugs and nasal lavage, due to the presence of polyps, excess tissue, bone or a deviated nasal septum, surgery may be necessary. Patients undergoing surgery clearly improve the frequency and intensity of symptoms, making it easier for them to breathe. In general, surgical treatment is carried out under general anesthesia and endoscopic control, exclusively through the nasal cavities, without leaving any external scar, and with minimal discomfort for the patient.  //Sinusitis prevention// To avoid sinusitis, especially due to allergies or a cold, it is important to use oral and/or nasal decongestants. If nasal sprays are used, it should be for short periods of time. The act of blowing your nose must be gentle, to avoid secretions rising instead of falling, as well as injuries to the sinuses. It is also advisable to drink fluids frequently in order to keep nasal secretions more fluid. In the presence of allergies, an immunoallergology consultation is important to detect which substances trigger them, and so that appropriate treatments can be instituted. On the other hand, with sinusitis often associated with the flu, seasonal flu vaccines can also increase immunity, indirectly helping to prevent the emergence or progression of sinus infections. Other ways to prevent sinusitis include avoiding prolonged presence in places with high air pollution; do not put your fingers or foreign objects in your nose (be careful in the case of children); avoid air that is too cold and humid, or too dry; blow your nose regularly; and try to do a nasal wash to clear the nose. Air travel can also cause or worsen sinusitis, so it's a good idea to ensure good nasal hygiene before traveling. For some patients with sinusitis, thermal treatments have good results, and it is important to consult your doctor beforehand.  //Difference between sinusitis and allergic rhinitis// Sinusitis is sometimes confused with allergic rhinitis because they share some symptoms, such as nasal congestion. However, these are different problems. Allergic rhinitis is directly linked to the effect of allergens on the nose, being an inflammation of the mucosa due to exposure to substances such as dust, mold or pollen - in case of allergy. On the other hand, allergic arinitis may precede sinusitis when the severity of the symptoms caused by the allergic reaction causes a nasal obstruction, which progresses to an infection in the sinuses. As allergic rhinitis is a chronic disease, when it is diagnosed, it is common for the attending physician to make recommendations in order to prevent an allergic reaction from becoming sinusitis.

Sleep-walking,"//What is it?// It belongs to the category of sleeping disorders. It is thought that walking while sleeping is synonymous with sleepwalking, which is a mistake, as this situation can have different causes, with equally different treatments. It is a well-defined disease, more common in boys, with a familial tendency and, although it can occur at any age, it generally begins around the age of five/six and disappears in adolescence. It is more common in children with sleep apnea and in those who wet the bed at night. Night terrors are also associated with sleepwalking. As a rule, it occurs one hour after the onset of sleep and does not repeat itself during the same night. The sleepwalker rarely remembers what happened: he walks around the house in an orderly but unconscious manner, which can cause accidents, such as falling down stairs or out of a window, breaking objects, among others. In general, there is no aggression, but it can occur if the sleepwalker is contradicted. It can be caused by some medications and can be aggravated by alcohol consumption, drugs, excessive exercise, fever or sleep deprivation. It is estimated that around 10% to 20% of children have at least one episode of sleepwalking, but the prevalence of the disorder is much lower, probably between 1% and 5%. In adults, its incidence is 1% to 7%. The onset or persistence of this condition in adulthood is common and, as a rule, is not associated with any psychiatric problem. //Symptoms// Often sleepwalkers sit and look as if they are awake but are, in fact, asleep. They can get up and walk or perform more complex activities, such as moving furniture, going to the bathroom, dressing or undressing. Episodes may last for a few seconds or minutes or be longer. In most cases they don't last more than ten minutes. If left undisturbed, the person will fall back asleep, which may happen in their own bed or somewhere else. Some of the signs that characterize this disease are confused or disoriented behavior upon waking, a blank stare, opening the eyes during sleep, no memory of what happened upon waking, aggressive behavior when the episode is interrupted by others, or talking during sleep with incoherent speech. //Causes// The normal sleep cycle has several phases and sleepwalking tends to occur in deep sleep, right at the beginning. Its causes are not known but fatigue, lack of sleep and anxiety can be triggering factors. Hormonal changes that occur during adolescence, menstruation and pregnancy can also be factors to take into account. Magnesium deficiency is another possible cause. In adults, sleepwalking can be caused by the consumption of alcohol, sedatives or other medications, such as antihistamines and antiarrhythmics, and occurs in patients with epilepsy or other mental disorders. In elderly people, sleepwalking can indicate the presence of an organic brain disease. //Diagnosis// In general, no special tests are necessary. If episodes are frequent, it may be important to carry out a more detailed evaluation to rule out other diseases, such as epilepsy. There are also tests that allow the analysis of sleep rhythms and patterns, which can help characterize this condition. //Treatment// It is common to think that it is dangerous to wake a sleepwalker, but this is not true, although there may be a period of confusion or disorientation after waking up. Another mistake is to assume that the sleepwalker cannot hurt himself during the episode, which in fact can happen. As a rule, no treatment is necessary for sleepwalking. Safety measures to prevent accidents are important, such as moving electrical objects and furniture away, blocking access to stairs, etc. In some cases, sedatives may be useful to reduce the number of episodes. In others, hypnosis appears to be beneficial. //Prevention// It is essential to avoid the consumption of alcohol or other substances that affect the central nervous system; and maintain good levels of rest in order to prevent insomnia and reduce stress and anxiety, factors that can worsen this disorder. National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine, Maio 2011 National Sleep Foundation, Fev. 2007 Filipa Serrão et al., Sleep quality and depression: symptomatic relationships in schoolchildren, Psico-USF, v. 12, no. 2, p. 257-268, Jul./Dec. 2007 Teresa Paiva, In search of Lost Sleep, Abril, 2013 Load more;/ Staying at home can have an effect on children's mood and sleep, affecting their well-being.

Excessive sleepiness,"//What is it?// Excessive sleepiness or hypersomnia, corresponds to a greater tendency to sleep, involuntarily falling asleep even when it is inappropriate to do so (at work, during meals or during a conversation). These repetitive episodes of daytime drowsiness or prolonged nighttime sleep are different from those resulting from normal tiredness. It is estimated that this condition affects 2% to 5% of the population, negatively impacting school activities, work, family and social relationships, and increasing the risk of accidents. On the other hand, it is associated with neuropsychological and cognitive changes. It is generally first recognized in adolescence or young adulthood. Excessive drowsiness and sleep disorders are quite common situations, with an important impact on societies. For example, in the United States of America, it was determined that in the 1990s around 200,000 car accidents were caused by falling asleep at the wheel and of these, around a third were fatal. According to some studies, it is estimated that 40% of people may occasionally experience these symptoms. //Symptoms// Patients report difficulty waking up after a long sleep and may feel disoriented. There is a compulsive need to sleep, and patients fall asleep involuntarily at work, during a meal or during a conversation. Anxiety, irritability, lack of energy, difficulty concentrating and speaking, loss of appetite, hallucinations and memory problems may occur. They also tend to lose the ability to function in family, social settings and at work. //Causes// The most common causes are chronic sleep deprivation, obstructive sleep apnea and hypopnea syndrome, narcolepsy, restless legs syndrome, circadian rhythm disorders, use of some drugs and/or pharmaceuticals and alcohol abuse. Suddenly stopping a medication may be another possible cause.  Some cases have no known origin and in others there appears to be a genetic predisposition. It can also result from a physical problem, such as a tumor, head trauma, or damage to the central nervous system. Multiple sclerosis, depression, encephalitis, epilepsy, and obesity can contribute to this disorder. //Diagnosis// There are some procedures that can be used to investigate excessive sleepiness, such as clinical evaluation or the creation of a sleep diary. Laboratory and imaging studies, such as computed tomography, polysomnography or electroencephalogram, may also be useful. //Treatment// Your treatment depends on the underlying cause. In many situations, good sleep hygiene, which allows you to recover your quantity and quality, is sufficient. In other cases, it may be important to control weight, avoid the consumption of alcohol or sedatives, and treat other diseases that may contribute to this condition. Treatment of sleep apnea, when present, is very effective. There are some medications that may be helpful, such as stimulants or antidepressants. The selection of the most appropriate therapy should always be made by a doctor. //Prevention// There is no known prevention for this condition. It is important to emphasize that, although excessive drowsiness in itself is not serious, it can be associated with serious consequences, such as accidents. As a rule, crises tend to recur throughout life, with the exception of cases in which there is a well-identified cause that can be removed.

heart murmur,"//What is it?// A heart murmur is a sound resulting from the circulation of blood in the heart or blood vessels. Blood in motion, even without encountering any obstruction, generates sounds. However, when there is some change in the heart or vessels (namely in the valves that separate the upper cavities - atria - from the lower cavities - ventricles - or when there is communication between the right and left sides of the heart) murmurs may appear, with greater or lesser severity. //Symptoms// The vast majority of murmurs do not have any type of manifestation, that is, they are asymptomatic, and are only detected during child health monitoring consultations, through auscultation with a stethoscope. In rare cases, murmurs can be caused by more serious heart conditions. In some cases, the diagnosis may occur during pregnancy. In others, the baby may be pale, tired when breastfeeding, have blue nails and lips (cyanosis), or have poor weight and length gains. In extreme cases, a murmur may be heard even without the help of a stethoscope. //Diagnosis// The vast majority of murmurs are designated as “innocent” murmurs: they exist but are not associated with the disease, they can be heard better when the child has a fever and they tend to disappear with age. As mentioned previously, the murmur is almost always diagnosed through auscultation. The pediatrician or attending physician will assess the need to refer the child to a heart specialist - a pediatric cardiologist, who, when he sees fit, performs cardiac ultrasound with color Doppler for diagnosis and assessment of heart complications. //Treatment// Fortunately, 99 out of every 100 children with a heart murmur have an innocent murmur and no treatment is necessary. A murmur in a healthy child is just that, another sign of health. The child exudes energy, jumps all day, runs around with joy, only stops to sleep, and has a heart murmur. In the remaining 1%, after diagnosis and evaluation in cardiology, medication and possibly surgery may be necessary, with less or more urgency, depending on each case.

Deafness,"//What is it?// Deafness means any limitation in hearing capacity. It is one of the symptoms that can affect all ages, sexes, races and has enormous repercussions from the point of view of language and communication. It is usually divided into two types: transmission hearing loss and sensorineural hearing loss. In terms of degree, it can vary between mild, moderate, severe and profound. In transmission hearing loss, there is no good propagation of sound from the outside to the inner ear, while in sensorineural hearing loss, the cause is at the level of the inner ear, the auditory nerve and the brain. In some cases, deafness involves both types. //Symptoms// Decreased or altered hearing produces a reduction in the perception of sounds and makes it difficult to understand words. This obstacle increases with the type and degree of hearing loss. At preschool age, it is known that the child should be able to say their first words between 15 and 18 months. If this does not happen, she should be observed by a specialist doctor to find out what is causing the speech delay. The most common cause of deafness in children aged between two and five years is serous otitis. This disease prevents the transmission of sound from the outside to the inner ear, predisposes to acute infections and can progress to more complicated chronic otitis. //Causes// There are several diseases during pregnancy that can affect the development of the baby's ears. Among these, the most common, both nationally and internationally, is cytomegalovirus infection. It goes unnoticed most of the time and the pregnant woman does not present any symptoms or only has complaints of the flu. In any case, deafness at birth must be detected as early as possible so that there is adequate monitoring during the child's development. There are other types of situations, although rare, that can cause it, ranging from genetic causes to ear malformations. In other cases there are blockages at the entrance to the ear: cerumen (wax), foreign bodies (common in children) or otitis externa (skin infection at the entrance to the ear – common especially at beaches and swimming pools). Easily diagnosed by otoscopy, the removal of cerumen and foreign bodies can be done in consultation and external otitis treated with drops and/or antibiotics. Chronic ear infections can appear at any age. The degree of deafness will depend on the severity of the disease. Pus can often come out of the ear and lead to serious complications such as paralysis of the facial nerve (responsible for facial movements), meningitis or other intracranial conditions. Chronic otitis should be monitored in an Otorhinolaryngology consultation as early as possible in order to avoid worsening. Osteospongiosis is a cause of deafness that mainly affects the third and fourth decades of life and predominantly affects females. In about half of the cases there is a genetic factor, so there are often other situations in the family, especially in women. It results from a change in bone metabolism located in the joint between the stapes (one of the ossicles that transmits sound) and the oval window (internal membrane that communicates into the ear) which causes transmission deafness. Osteospongiosis, in some cases, can improve with surgical intervention. When there is progressive deafness, especially unilateral, we may have an acoustic neuroma. It is a benign tumor but can grow locally and must be monitored and controlled. Several other situations can cause deafness, from a simple cold, ear trauma, stroke, changes in blood pressure (air travel, diving), use of certain medications, among others. Hearing loss can be sudden or progressive and have various causes. In short, deafness can be congenital or acquired. The term congenital deafness implies that hearing loss is present at birth. It may include hereditary forms or forms of deafness due to other factors present in utero or at the time of birth. Hereditary forms appear to be involved in more than 50% of cases of congenital deafness. There are some genetic syndromes in which deafness is a known feature, such as Down syndrome, Usher syndrome, Treacher Collins syndrome, Crouzon syndrome and Alport syndrome. Other causes of congenital deafness that are not hereditary in nature include prenatal infections, illnesses, toxins consumed by the mother during pregnancy, or other conditions that occur at the time of birth or in the immediate peri-partum period. For example: Intrauterine infections including rubella, cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex;/ Complications associated with the blood Rh factor;/ Prematurity;/ Maternal diabetes;/ Toxemia during pregnancy;/ Anoxia;/ Acquired deafness is deafness that appears after birth, at any time in life, resulting from various situations, including: Middle ear infections;/ Meningitis;/ Encephalitis;/ Measles;/ chicken pox;/ Mumps;/ Influenza/ gripe;/ Otosclerose;/ Meniere's disease;/ Drugs that damage the structures of the auditory system (ototoxic);/ Exposure to high noise levels;/ Acoustic neuroma;/ Head or ear injuries;/  Aging – presbycusis – particularly involves degeneration of the inner ear, although it can also involve other parts of the auditory system. Hearing loss is progressive, preferentially affecting the higher frequencies. //Diagnosis// Deafness must be confirmed and characterized by tests that are requested according to the patient's age and clinical situation: otoacoustic emissions, evoked potentials, audiometry, impedance testing, among others. //Treatment// As age advances, some quality of hearing is lost and depending on its severity, it may be necessary to use a hearing aid to be able to carry out daily activities. Depending on the pathology in question (otitis media with effusion, chronic otitis media, otosclerosis, exostoses), a type of surgical intervention is indicated: myringocentesis with placement of transtympanic tubes, tympanoplasty, open or closed technical tympanomastoidectomy, exostoses and otosclerosis surgery. In specific cases of deafness, it may be necessary to use specific equipment that allows for better hearing. This is the case with osteo-integrated implants and cochlear implants. //Prevention// Hearing problems that occur at birth or hearing impairments due to illness or accidents are subject to possible prevention in each situation, namely vaccination against maternal and child infections, improved peripartum care and treatment of otitis in children. Some measures are important to reduce the risk of hearing loss throughout life: minimize exposure to noise and high-intensity sounds;/ control blood pressure levels and blood fat and sugar levels, factors that contribute to premature aging of the body;/ Avoid taking substances and/or medications that are toxic to the ear;/ Ensure regular hearing screening that can early rule out changes that can be corrected;/ Medical News Today Load more;/ Knowing the main signs associated with hearing loss is the best way to detect it early and consult a specialist.

Childhood deafness,"//What is it?// A significant number of children have hearing problems of varying degrees and types, and the situation is usually suspected within the family or at school. Hearing loss in children is often a temporary problem that can be easily resolved with medical treatment and/or minor surgery. However, it can always be a more serious situation, such as permanent sensorineural deafness, which requires a special teaching support program and early intervention in cognitive rehabilitation. Regarding childhood deafness, we can immediately distinguish two distinct groups: congenital forms and acquired forms. The term congenital deafness implies that hearing loss is present at birth. It may include hereditary forms or forms of deafness due to other factors present in utero (prenatally) or at the time of birth. Hereditary forms appear to be involved in more than 50% of cases of congenital deafness. Genetic transmission can be autosomal dominant (when one of the parents, usually with deafness, carries the dominant gene and passes it on to the child in 50% of cases), autosomal recessive (where both parents do not manifest any deafness, but transmit a recessive gene, with this probability of transmission being 25%) and X-linked (in which the mother carries a recessive gene on the X sex chromosome and passes it on to her descendants, manifesting itself only in male descendants). Acquired deafness is deafness that appears after birth, at any time in life, resulting from various clinical situations. //Symptoms// At preschool age, it is known that the child should be able to say their first words between 15 and 18 months. If this does not happen, she should be observed by a specialist doctor to find out whether it is deafness that is causing the speech delay. The most frequent cause of hearing loss in children aged between two and five years is serous aotitis. This disease prevents the transmission of sound from the outside to the inner ear, predisposes to acute infections and can progress to more complicated chronic otitis. //Causes// There are some genetic syndromes in which deafness is a known feature. For example, Down syndrome (anomaly in a gene), Usher syndrome (autosomal recessive), Treacher Collins syndrome (autosomal dominant), Crouzon syndrome (autosomal dominant) and Alport syndrome (X-linked). Other causes of congenital deafness, which are not hereditary in nature, include prenatal infections, illnesses, toxins consumed by the mother during pregnancy, or other conditions that occur at the time of birth or in the immediate peri-partum period. These situations usually cause sensorineural deafness. Among them are: Intrauterine infections including rubella, cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex;/ Complications associated with the Rh factor of blood;/ Prematurity;/ Maternal diabetes;/ Toxemia during pregnancy;/ Anoxia;/ Acquired deafness is that which appears after birth, at any time in life, resulting from various clinical situations, including: Middle ear infections;/ Ototoxic drugs (which damage the auditory system);/ Meningitis;/ Encephalitis;/ Measles;/ chicken pox;/ Mumps;/ Influenza/gripe;/ Head trauma;/ Noise exposure;/ //Diagnosis// Hearing problems can affect the language learning process in the first years of life and subsequently the acquisition of knowledge and academic performance, fundamental aspects of a child's development. The diagnosis of this type of pathology is made with the help of complementary screening and diagnostic tests, always depending on the clinical situation and the child's age, with emphasis on otoacoustic emissions, auditory evoked potentials (ERA), tympanograms, research on stapedic reflexes and audiograms. In the case of newborns, the most used test is the study of otoacoustic emissions, as it allows the baby's hearing to be assessed, from the first hours of life, in a painless, quick and comfortable way. //Treatment// Depending on the pathology in question and age, a type of intervention is indicated, which can even be surgical. In specific cases, there may be a need to use equipment that allows better hearing, such as osseointegrated implants and cochlear implants. //Prevention// The World Health Organization estimates that around 60% of childhood deafness is preventable.;/ An important part of this condition in children results from common infections such as measles, mumps, rubella, meningitis and ear infections (otitis).;/ Vaccination and regular health care, as well as improving hygiene conditions, can prevent the vast majority of these diseases.;/ Improving perinatal care, particularly during birth, by reducing and treating complications such as suffocation, jaundice and low birth weight, reduces the risk of deafness in the child.;/ It is also important to identify and avoid medications and drugs that are toxic to the ear that may be taken by the mother.;/ Medical News Today World Health Organization Early detection of hearing problems can minimize the consequences for a child's development.

Smoking,"//What is it?// Smoking is the physical and psychological dependence on nicotine, a toxic substance present in tobacco that reduces blood flow to tissues and the central nervous system. However, this is just one of the 4,000 toxic and irritating substances present in cigarettes, 70 of which are carcinogenic, such as: Radioactive substances such as Polonium 210 and Carbon 14;/ Heavy metals, such as lead and cadmium, which are concentrated in the liver, kidneys and lungs;/ Carbon monoxide: takes the place of oxygen, causing intoxication of the body;/ Tar, highly carcinogenic;/  In Europe, smoking is responsible for one million and 200 thousand deaths every year and the trend is for it to reach two million, predicts the World Health Organization. In Portugal, between 20 and 26 percent of the population smokes, in a proportion of three and a half men for every woman, and around 11,800 Portuguese people die each year as a result of this habit. Smoking is harmful to health, reducing its quality and duration. It is also a risk factor for the onset of several diseases. This habit not only affects active smokers, but also those who are indirectly exposed to tobacco smoke (passive smokers). //Consequences// Although tobacco consumption is already a very old habit, it was only recently that the harms of smoking began to be known. On average, smokers live ten years less than non-smokers. This happens because the substances present in tobacco harm some important organs while weakening our body in the face of various diseases. Thus, smoking is responsible for: 25 to 30% of cancers, including those of the upper respiratory tract (lip, tongue, mouth, pharynx and larynx);/ 80% of cases of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;/ 90% of lung cancer cases;/ 20% of deaths from coronary heart disease;/ Furthermore, cardiovascular diseases are 2-4 times more common in smokers. Therefore, quitting smoking is the most effective way to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, peripheral arterial disease and stroke. //Treatment// Smoking, being an addiction, is treatable. There are a few steps that can help you do this: Set a date to stop smoking, within a maximum period of 15 days.;/ Before that date, prepare yourself. Make, for example, a list of the reasons that lead you to abandon this habit (and keep it with you at all times) and practice short periods of abstinence.;/ Identify why, when and how many cigarettes you smoke. Of these, how many do you smoke just out of boredom?;/ Tell your closest people about your decision; you will feel more supported.;/ It is normal for the first few days or even weeks to feel anxious, restless or irritable and have difficulty sleeping. But remember: these symptoms are temporary and many people have already overcome them.;/ Adopt a healthy diet to avoid weight gain.;/ Avoid places with smokers and objects that resemble tobacco, such as ashtrays and lighters.;/ Exercise: it helps control anxiety and keep you in shape.;/ If you relapse, don't give up: set a new date to quit smoking and start the process again.;/ Going to a smoking consultation can also help you take this step. It is carried out by a multidisciplinary team, which can be made up of professionals in the areas of pulmonology, nutrition and psychology, depending on the needs of each individual.  //What happens to your body if you quit smoking, after…//  20 minutes Blood pressure and pulse rate normalize.  8 hours Nicotine and carbon monoxide levels in the blood decrease by 50% and oxygen levels rise to normal values.  2 dias Blood pressure stabilizes and taste improves.  3 dias The bronchi relax, breathing becomes easier and the skin becomes more luminous.  2-12 weeks Circulation improves significantly and walking becomes less tiring.  6-9 months Gradual increase in general well-being, with more vitality.  5 years The risk of mouth and esophageal cancer is reduced by half.  10 years The risk of lung cancer is 50% lower than that of a smoker.  15 years The risk of cardiovascular disease is similar to that of a non-smoker (same sex and age). Paulista Cardiology Foundation, April 2019 National Health Service, April 2019 In addition to traditional cigarettes, there are now new products with or without tobacco. Understand the differences and how they can all be harmful to your health. Because prevention also involves information, Encarnação Teixeira, CUF Oncologia pulmonologist, answers questions about lung cancer.

CT scan,"//What is it?// Computed Tomography, also called CT or CT scan, is an imaging technology that uses special X-ray equipment to obtain a volume of data from the body that is then processed by a computer to obtain images of the body's internal organs.  A CT scan is particularly useful for showing organs and tissues, such as the liver or kidneys, with greater clarity and detail than a conventional x-ray. It is often possible to make a definitive diagnosis using a tomography exam, and it is not necessary to carry out other diagnostic tests.  Computed tomography is a non-invasive diagnostic method and can be used to study the heart and arteries, lungs, abdominal organs such as the liver, spleen, pancreas, kidneys, bladder and intestine, skull and brain, the face, the sinuses, ears and neck, spine, pelvis, limbs and joints.  Through this examination, a radiologist or neuroradiologist can discover the causes of symptoms, allowing faster and more effective treatment and often eliminating the need for other, more aggressive and painful diagnostic methods. //Methodology//  The exam is performed with the person lying on a table, which can be raised or lowered as necessary. The table slowly moves into the machine, where an X-ray generator rotates around the patient to produce the images.  During the exam, healthcare professionals will be in contact with you and can see you through a window. The exam lasts about 10 minutes and is painless.  The contrast product used in the computed tomography examination can be administered orally, intravenously or rectally, and helps to enhance the visibility of some tissues or blood vessels, thus obtaining a better diagnosis.  Some pelvic exams require the injection of liquid contrast into the rectum immediately before the exam begins. If intravenous contrast is required, you may experience some transient reactions that are usually mild, such as warmth in your arm or a metallic taste in your throat. //Preparation// Preparation depends on the type of exam to be performed. The type of preparation required will be indicated at the time of booking. For exams that require more complex preparation, you will receive a phone call the day before the exam so that you can receive better support during the preparation for it.  For most examinations of the spine, joints, sinuses, and jaw, no special preparation is necessary.  During chest, skull and neck exams, you should not eat at least 4 hours before the exam, but if you are administering any type of medication, you can normally do so with water.  For most abdominal and pelvic exams, you must not eat for at least 4 hours before the exam and drink a special liquid to opacify the intestine, about 30 minutes before the exam. In these cases, you will be asked to come to the office early.  On the day of the exam, you must arrive 15 minutes before the scheduled time to open your file. For exams with oral contrast, you must arrive approximately 45 minutes before.  After the exam, you can go about your normal life.  If you are diabetic and take oral medication, you may need to change it after the test. //Precautions// Tomography uses X-rays to obtain images. X-rays are radiation of the same type as sunlight, but with more energy. As a rule, the dose of radiation received by a person during a computed tomography exam is equivalent to the same dose he or she receives during 3 years from the natural environment.  In order to limit as much as possible the potential risks of radiation, which are in any case very small, specific precautions are taken in the case of children and young people.  People with asthma or allergies who need medical treatment must take premedication the day before the exam.  Diabetic patients and people with kidney disease may require special care, which will be explained before the examination.  If in the days prior to the CT scan you have had an examination using barium contrast (for example, in the stomach or intestine), it may be necessary to carry out additional preparation, which will be indicated to you on the day the examination is scheduled.  Children under 5 years of age may need to be sedated so that they cannot move during the exam.  Due to radiation, pregnant women should avoid having a CT scan. Women of childbearing age should always inform their healthcare providers if they are or suspect they are pregnant. //Exam// On the day of the exam you must bring with you: Examination request issued by your doctor;;/ Previous diagnostic tests;;/ Most recent blood tests;;/ Health system card (SNS, insurance or health subsystem).;/ Check out the full range of CT (Computed Tomography) scans offered by the CUF Network here Load more;/ Colonoscopy is a minimally invasive procedure that allows you to identify and treat intestinal lesions. Two gastroenterologists explain its importance. Quick and safe, upper digestive endoscopy is an examination that facilitates diagnoses, but also allows the treatment of various diseases in a minimally invasive way.

Tachycardia,"//What is it?// Heart rhythm is controlled by electrical signals that are sent throughout the tissues of the heart. When these signals are produced abnormally, tachycardia can occur. This is a faster than normal heart rate. There are different types, with different severity and treatment. In some cases, it may not cause any symptoms. In others, it can significantly alter the functioning of the heart, increasing the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiac arrest or death. //Symptoms// When the heart contracts too quickly, it is unable to pump blood effectively around the body, depriving the tissues of oxygen. The symptoms of tachycardia result from this reduction in oxygen supply and may include dizziness, difficulty breathing, feeling of palpitations, chest pain or fainting (syncope). In some situations, there are no signs and the disease is detected in a routine consultation or on an electrocardiogram. In addition to these manifestations, it can also be associated with the formation of clots that can cause a stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure or even sudden death. //Causes// It results from an alteration in the electrical impulses that control the rhythm of contraction of the heart muscle. This can be caused by several factors, such as damage to the heart tissue resulting from heart disease, a congenital defect in the heart's electrical pathways or even anemia. Other factors that can also cause tachycardia are physical exercise, sudden stress, high blood pressure, smoking, fever, excessive alcohol or caffeinated drinks, the use of drugs such as cocaine, thyroid disease or even as a side effect of some medications. Sometimes, its cause remains unknown. Age is a risk factor, as is a family history of tachycardia or heart disease. //Diagnosis// Diagnosis requires a complete clinical examination and a set of tests that identify the type of tachycardia and its origin. They include: Electrocardiogram;/ Holter (24-hour electrocardiogram recording);/ Electrophysiological examinations;/ Tilt test, or others, depending on each case;/ //Treatment// Treatment involves reducing heart rate, preventing future episodes and minimizing complications. During an episode, it can be corrected by performing the following procedures: Vagal maneuvers, such as coughing, leaning forward or putting ice on the face. If these are not effective, intravenous medication may be necessary, which should be administered in a hospital setting. There are also oral medications for the treatment of tachycardia;;/ Another alternative is electrical cardioversion, in which an electrical shock is applied to the chest with the aim of restoring heart rhythm;;/ Preventing new episodes can be done through the use of medication, the ablation of an anomalous electrical pathway in the heart using a catheter, or the placement of a pacemaker or defibrillator under the skin. This equipment detects the heart rhythm and can correct it;;/ Surgery may be necessary in some cases to remove abnormal electrical tissue;;/ Another important aspect is the prevention of blood clots, which can be achieved by using anticoagulants;;/ It is also worth highlighting the importance of controlling all underlying diseases, such as heart disease or hyperthyroidism, which may be the basis of tachycardia.;/ //Prevention// The most effective way to prevent tachycardia is to reduce the risk of developing heart disease. If it already exists, it must be properly monitored and treated. For this prevention, it is essential to practice physical exercise regularly, adopt a healthy diet and maintain an adequate weight. It is also essential to have good control of blood pressure and cholesterol and sugar levels, not smoking, drinking alcohol in moderation, not consuming drugs or medicines without a prescription, limiting caffeine, controlling stress and having a medical consultation. routine regularly. Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, Maio de 2014 The American Heart Association, Outubro de 2014 Harvard Health Guide, 2014 1 in 6 Portuguese people may have heart failure without knowing it. The prevalence increases with age, but lifestyle helps reduce risk factors. Cancer treatment can cause adverse cardiac effects. Monitoring patients in Cardiology is essential to prevent cardiovascular disease. At the age of 47, Joana Rodrigues was diagnosed with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy.
