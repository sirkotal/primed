Abcesso pulmonar,"//What is it?// These are cavities that originate in the lung, with an accumulation of dead lung tissue and fluid inside. As a rule, a lung abscess corresponds to a concavity measuring one centimeter or more in diameter. They are caused by bacteria and are more common on the right side. Before the existence of antibiotics, lung abscess was a devastating disease, with a mortality rate of about a third. This situation has evolved favorably and, currently, both the mortality rate and the prognosis are much more favorable, with around 90% of patients cured through the use of medical treatment. The frequency of lung abscesses in the general population is not known. It is known that they are more common in the elderly, due to the higher prevalence of periodontal disease and higher risk of aspiration. One of the main risk factors appears to be related to immunosuppression and bronchial obstructive disease, in which cases mortality rates can reach 75%. Lung abscesses can be classified based on their duration: those lasting less than four to six weeks are considered acute, while chronic abscesses last longer. They can be single or multiple, primary and secondary, with the former being related to infectious processes, aspiration or pneumonia, and the latter being caused by pre-existing conditions, namely obstructive disease, bronchiectasis (dilation of the bronchi) or immunosuppression, among other causes. //Symptoms// The clinical picture varies, depending on the patient's history, the severity and extent of the pathology and the microorganism involved. Patients with lung abscesses caused by anaerobic bacterial agents present discrete symptoms that may evolve over weeks or months, and usually have associated gum disease. These signs may resemble those of pulmonary tuberculosis. The main signs are fever at the end of the day, with an axillary temperature of 37° - 37.5°C, night sweats, a cough that is initially dry and then productive, difficulty breathing, chest pain, loss of appetite and weight loss. The sputum usually has a foul smell and an unpleasant taste. Blood in the sputum and pleurisy may appear if the abscess ruptures into the bronchi or the pleural cavity. Medical evaluation and auscultation provide important information that allows a better understanding of the clinical picture. Complications result from rupture into the pleural space causing empyema, pulmonary fibrosis, trapped lung, respiratory failure, bronchopleural or cutaneous-pleural fistula, and spread of infection via the bloodstream. In patients with empyema associated with lung abscess, drainage with prolonged antibiotic treatment is often essential. //Causes// It results from the passage of bacteria from the oral cavity to the lung tissue. These patients are particularly prone to aspiration pneumonia and often have periodontal disease, particularly gingivitis. The most frequent cause is anaerobic bacteria in the oral cavity. Other infectious, aerobic agents can also cause them, although less frequently. They tend to be more aggressive infections, associated with bacterial pneumonia, requiring urgent therapy, with the cavity appearing as the process of necrosis of the lung tissue develops. These include Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophylus influenzae, Streptococcus (pneumonia), Klebsiella, among others. The most vulnerable patients are those with dental or gum disease, epilepsy or alcoholism, and the risk is related to the greater possibility of aspiration of contents from the oropharynx, due to altered state of consciousness. Among the risk groups, it is worth mentioning those with alterations in the gastroesophageal junction, structural alterations of the pharynx and esophagus, reflux disease, difficulty swallowing due to neurological injury, bronchial obstruction due to tumor or foreign body, poor dental and oral hygiene, individuals unable to protect their airways, cases of coma with loss of consciousness, general anesthesia or sedation. Other situations are related to septic embolizations to the lung, caused by the existence of bacteremia (presence of bacteria in the blood) or endocarditis of the tricuspid valve. //Diagnosis// In addition to the medical assessment, a detailed analytical study must be carried out, with a blood count and inflammatory parameters being essential. Sputum collection must be performed before starting antibiotic treatment, including a sensitivity test. Blood collection for microbial culture can play an important role in identifying the cause of the clinical picture. X-rays are also useful. The typical radiographic image of a lung abscess is that of a cavity with irregular contours with an air-fluid level inside. Computerized tomography allows for better anatomical definition of the lesions. To obtain sterile material, the contents of the abscess can also be aspirated by transtracheal or transthoracic needle puncture, pleural fluid culture or blood cultures. Finally, bronchoscopy is performed when bronchial obstruction due to carcinoma or inhalation of a foreign body is suspected. //Treatment// The main problem in its  treatment is the growing presence of antibiotic resistance. Given the high risk of recurrence with shorter therapeutic regimens, the medication should last on average four to six weeks and should be continued until the radiological image is resolved or until the lesion is reduced to a small, stable lesion. Antibiotics should initially be administered intravenously and then orally. Surgical intervention is rarely necessary, limited to cases of poor response to medical therapy, neoplasms or congenital malformations. //Prevention// Early recognition and treatment of respiratory infections are essential to prevent their progression to lung abscess. Good oral hygiene is also important. Patients with gastroesophageal disorders should be instructed to avoid aspiration of gastric contents by sleeping with the head of the bed elevated and not overfilling the stomach before going to sleep.

Acidente isquemico transitorio ait,"//What is it?// A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a temporary, short-lived blockage—usually lasting less than five minutes—of blood flow to the brain or spinal cord. If it is caused by a clot, the clot causing the blockage usually dissolves on its own, or ""breaks loose."" Often nicknamed the ""mini stroke"" or ""stroke principle"", the fact that it causes no permanent damage means it is often ignored. However, TIA is actually a warning and can often precede a future cerebrovascular accident (CVA) - possibly in the following hours or days - and should be taken seriously and as an opportunity to take action to prevent it. Similar to a stroke, TIA can affect speech, vision, or movement in certain parts of the body.  //Symptoms of transient ischemic attack// Different areas of the brain are associated with different tasks and therefore the symptoms manifested in case of a transient ischemic attack (TIA) will depend on the area of ​​the brain that is affected. Some signs and symptoms of TIA include the sudden onset of: Weakness, numbness or paralysis in the face, arm or leg usually on one side of the body;/ Aphasia, slurred speech or difficulty understanding others;/ Loss of vision in one or both eyes or double vision;/ Dizziness or loss of balance or coordination;/ Severe headache with no apparent cause;/  A TIA usually lasts only a few minutes and most signs and symptoms disappear within an hour, but rarely it can last up to 24 hours. It is possible to have more than one repeat TIA, and recurring signs and symptoms may be similar or different depending on the area of ​​the brain affected.  Attention! When experiencing TIA symptoms, it is important to seek help immediately and contact an emergency medical service. Immediate medical evaluation can help prevent a possible stroke.  //Causes// The causes of a transient ischemic attack (TIA) are the same as those of an ischemic stroke (the most common type of stroke), in which a clot - usually due to atherosclerosis, the buildup of plaque in the arteries - blocks the blood supply to a certain area of ​​the brain. Unlike what happens in an ischemic stroke, in TIA this blockage is shorter and does not cause permanent damage. Anyone can have a TIA, however, there are some factors that can increase this risk. TIA risk factors are divided into those that can be controlled and/or modified and those that cannot.  Modifiable habits and lifestyle: Smoking: Smoking increases the risk of blood clots, increases blood pressure and promotes atherosclerosis.;/ High blood pressure: The risk of stroke is higher when levels are above 140/90 mmHg. However, ideal values ​​vary from person to person and should be determined by the attending physician.;/ High cholesterol.;/ Sedentary lifestyle.;/ Poor diet.;/ Excess weight: obesity, especially excess weight in the abdominal region, increases the risk of stroke in both sexes.;/ Excessive intake of alcoholic beverages.;/ Use of illicit drugs, especially cocaine, is associated with an increased risk of stroke and TIA.;/ Cardiovascular disease, such as heart failure, heart defects, heart infection, or arrhythmias.;/ Carotid stenosis.;/ Peripheral arterial disease.;/ Diabetes.;/ High levels of homocysteine: high levels of this amino acid in our blood can harm arteries and increase their susceptibility to clots.;/  Although the following risk factors cannot be modified, knowing them can serve as motivation to act on those that can be controlled: Age: the risk increases with age, especially after age 55.;/ Family history: the risk is higher when someone in the family has had a stroke or TIA.;/ Sex: overall, women have a higher risk of stroke.;/ Previous TIA: having had one or more TIA in the past increases the risk of having a stroke.;/ Sickle cell disease: In this disease, stroke is a common complication.;/  //Diagnosis// If a transient ischemic attack (TIA) occurs, it is important to undergo an immediate assessment in an emergency department in order to determine the best treatment. To determine the cause of the TIA and assess the risk of stroke, in addition to the physical and neurological examination, which may include tests of vision, eye movement, speech, strength, reflexes and the sensory system, blood pressure and cholesterol levels, among others, the doctor may also prescribe an urgent computed tomography (CT) scan of the skull or, alternatively, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in people with suspected TIA or stroke. In people with TIA, stroke or early spontaneous recovery, immediate diagnostic evaluation is recommended, which should include urgent vascular imaging (e.g. ultrasound, CT angiography or MR angiography).  //Treatment of transient ischemic attack// Once the cause of the transient ischemic attack (TIA) has been determined, the goal of treatment includes treating the underlying cause and preventing stroke. The type of treatment adopted depends on the cause of the TIA, and may vary between medication, surgery and angioplasty: Medications: There are several medications that can reduce the likelihood of stroke after a TIA, which are chosen taking into account factors such as location, severity, cause and type, and usually include antiplatelet medications and anticoagulants.;/ Surgery: when the blockage is moderate to severe, surgical procedures may be indicated, such as carotid endarterectomy (surgery that removes fatty deposits present in the carotid arteries of the neck).;/ Angioplasty: in some cases, this procedure can be done on the carotid artery. An instrument similar to a balloon is used to inflate and ""open"" the clogged artery, allowing a stent to be placed (a small hollow tube that keeps the blood vessel open).;/  //Prevention// To prevent transient ischemic attack (TIA), some measures that can be put into practice are: Make regular appointments with your doctor.;/ No smoking.;/ Limit fat consumption (especially saturated and trans).;/ Do not consume excess salt.;/ Include fruits and vegetables in your diet. These foods contain nutrients such as potassium, folic acid and antioxidants, which can protect against both TIA and stroke.;/ Practicing regular physical exercise: this is one of the strategies that allow you to reduce blood pressure values ​​without resorting to medication. Getting 30 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity most days can help reduce your risk of TIA.;/ Limit alcohol consumption: at most, it should be consumed in moderation - no more than one drink per day for women and two for men - but ideally it should not be part of your habits.;/ Maintain a healthy weight, as being overweight contributes to other risk factors such as high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.;/ Do not take drugs.;/ Keep diseases such as diabetes under control through diet, physical exercise, adequate weight and, when necessary, medication.;/ American Stroke Association, February 2022 Harvard Health Publishing, February 2022 Mayo Clinic, February 2022 Brazilian Society of Neurology, August 2022 Load more;/ Although there are risk factors common to both men and women, women have a higher risk of suffering a stroke than men. Find out why. Stroke can be a serious condition with a high risk of causing disability or being fatal. Fortunately, some of the risk factors can be controlled and treated.

Acne,"//What is it?// Acne is probably the most common skin condition, affecting between 85 and 100% of the population at some point in their lives. However, the age groups most affected are between 10 and 24 years old. This is a very common (and almost universal) problem during adolescence. Although it is not serious, it has a significant psychological impact, given the age of the young people affected. This impact is generally short-term, but it must be monitored, as there is a risk of it becoming serious, accompanied by a decrease in self-esteem that can lead to social withdrawal or depression. In a study carried out in Portugal, a prevalence of acne of 82.4% was found in young people aged 10 to 12 years, with a predominance of males. Of these young people, only 44% were undergoing some type of treatment. In another Portuguese study, acne was observed in 42.1% of young people under the age of 15, in 55.8% of those aged 15-29, in 9.2% of those aged 30-40 and in 2.1% of people over 40. It is important, however, not to forget that acne does not only affect teenagers: many women aged 30, 40, 50 or older can suffer from acne and even newborns can suffer from this clinical condition. Acne is a skin condition in which hair follicles have excess oil and dead skin cells. The most affected areas are the face, neck, chest, back and shoulders, as these are the areas where there is a greater concentration of sebaceous follicles. Acne lesions tend to heal slowly and often disappear in other places and appear in other places. //Symptoms// The most common forms of manifestation are non-inflammatory lesions, the common comedones, whiteheads or blackheads, which result from the filling of hair follicles with fat, cells and bacteria. Inflammatory lesions correspond to papules, which are more prominent, red and painful, given the presence of infection in the hair follicle. In more serious cases of acne, larger lesions form, which are uncomfortable and can lead to permanent scars, such as: Pustules;/ Nodules;/ Cysts;/ //Causes// Acne results from an excess production of oil, the accumulation of dead skin cells that irritate the hair follicles, and the accumulation of bacteria in the midst of this oil and dead cells. There are factors that can aggravate acne, such as: Male hormones;/ Hormonal changes during pregnancy or related to the use of oral contraceptives;/ Some medications (corticoids, androgens, lithium);/ Foods rich in carbohydrates, which increase blood sugar levels;/ Hormonal changes are common in adolescence, in girls and women two to seven days before their period and in pregnancy. Contrary to popular belief, fatty foods, chocolate or poorly cleaned skin are not important factors in the development of acne. In fact, excessive cleansing of the skin with irritants can aggravate acne, and gentle cleansing is enough to remove excess oil and dead cells. Skin contact with oily substances or some cosmetics, family history, skin friction from cell phones, helmets, ornaments are also factors to be considered. Stress does not cause acne, but when the condition is present, stress can make it worse. //Diagnosis// Acne is diagnosed by a dermatologist, as there are other skin conditions that can mimic this condition. Once the diagnosis is made, the doctor will determine the severity of the condition and, based on this, determine the best treatment. //Treatment// There is a myth that acne is not worth treating and that it should run its course. However, if left untreated, acne can lead to unsightly or even disfiguring scars, which are, in themselves, difficult to treat. This evolution will be rarer the earlier treatment is started. This is often very effective and allows for an improvement in self-esteem. Acne treatment is based on reducing oil production, accelerating skin cell renewal, controlling infection and reducing infection. In general, treatment must be prolonged, with results not being visible before four to eight weeks of treatment. Treatments can be local or oral. Oral medications should not be used during pregnancy, especially in the first trimester. Some examples of therapeutic options include: Lotions that reduce oil production, destroy bacteria and promote the elimination of dead skin cells.;/ Medications, many of which are based on vitamin A-derived formulations, stimulate skin cell renewal. Isotretinoin is a useful medication for more severe forms of acne, but should be used under close medical supervision. Antibiotics are important in eliminating bacteria that accumulate on the skin.;/ Oral contraceptives.;/ Laser or phototherapy treatment.;/ Skin exfoliation or microabrasion.;/ Use of collagen filling in the most affected areas.;/ The treatment for each case of acne should be decided by the dermatologist. Many of the available medications can have side effects and, therefore, it is important to define the most appropriate treatment for each case. //Prevention// Wash problem areas with a gentle solution that helps control acne.;/ Avoid substances that can irritate the skin, as well as skin contact with hair, objects, sweat and fat.;/ Never squeeze skin lesions to avoid scarring or infection.;/ Sun exposure should be controlled and some of the medications used to treat acne can make the skin more sensitive to the sun.;/ Be moderate when using makeup, which can irritate the skin and, if used, should be removed at bedtime.;/ Do not wear clothes that are too tight.;/  //The role of diet// Diet is an important aspect to consider. In general, sugar intake seems to have an impact on the development of acne. The most recent data suggests that specialized nutritional monitoring specific to each case is important.

Acromegalia,"//What is it?// Acromegaly has an incidence of three new cases per million inhabitants annually and results from the excessive production of growth hormone in adults. In 90% of cases it is caused by a pituitary adenoma. //Symptoms// Acromegaly manifests itself through an increase in the soft parts of the hands and feet (which usually leads to the patient having to increase, for example, the size they wear). Other symptoms are: degenerative joint changes (arthrosis);/ carpal tunnel syndrome;/ thick and oily skin;/ voice changes;/ snoring (snoring);/ In addition to changes in muscle strength, bone changes, and common bone deformities, the impact of the disease differs between men and women. In women, changes in the menstrual cycle may also appear and in men, sexual changes such as impotence may appear. About 17% of the population is believed to have small pituitary adenomas that generally do not produce excess growth hormone or cause symptoms. //Causes// The overproduction of growth hormone associated with acromegaly is usually the result of a tumor. The most common type is a pituitary adenoma, a benign neoplasm that causes the production of too much growth hormone. These tumors are not malignant, but they can cause problems due to their size and location in the surrounding brain tissue, such as headaches and vision problems. Other rare causes of acromegaly: tumors in the lungs, adrenal glands or pancreas, implying overproduction of GH. //Diagnosis// Signs and symptoms appear slowly and diagnosis may take time. However, an early sign of acromegaly may be excessive growth of the hands and feet, prominence of the chin and eyebrow area. There are tests that can confirm the presence of this pathology, such as the analysis of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), a hormone produced in the liver, usually elevated in people with acromegaly. Other pituitary hormones can also be measured, as well as the oral glucose tolerance test. Brain MRI may be important in determining the location and size of the tumor. //Treatment// It depends on the location of the adenoma, the person's age and other concomitant diseases. Treatment aims to reduce excess hormone production and improve symptoms. Acromegaly can sometimes be treated with medication alone; the most commonly used drugs include somatostatin analogues, dopamine agonists and growth hormone receptor antagonists (which aim to stop the secretion or action of growth hormone). Surgery may be needed to remove the tumour, which stops the overproduction of growth hormone and relieves pressure on the surrounding tissue. Sometimes surgery may not be indicated because the tumour is difficult to access within the brain. Radiation therapy may be useful, either as a stand-alone therapy or combined with surgery, to remove tumor cells; radiation therapy may also be used in conjunction with medications to reduce growth hormone levels. The combination of medical and/or surgical treatments in possible association with radiotherapy may be indicated. //Prevention// Acromegaly cannot be prevented. Early diagnosis and treatment is the most effective way to treat or manage it.

Acufenos,"//What are they?// Also called tinnitus or tinnitus, tinnitus corresponds to the perception of a sound, in the ear or head, unilaterally or bilaterally, without the existence of an external stimulus. They can originate from any part of the auditory system and are a very common symptom that can affect people of any age or gender. However, they occur more frequently in men. It is important to emphasize that they are a symptom and not a disease. The type and intensity of the sound varies from person to person. It can be constant, intermittent or pulsating. It is estimated that they affect about one in five individuals. Although they are a cause of discomfort, they rarely indicate a serious condition and, although they can worsen with age, in most cases they are treatable. //Symptoms// They correspond to an unpleasant sensation of sound in the absence of a sound stimulus. They can be bells, horns, clicks, among others. These phantom sounds can vary in intensity and can occur in one or both ears. In some cases, their volume is so loud that it interferes with the ability to concentrate or hear real sounds. They can also be always present or be intermittent. They have the ability to be subjective, when they are heard only by the patient, or objective, when the doctor can also hear them. This type is rarer and can result from vascular anomalies, changes in the ear bones or muscle contractions. It is important to emphasize that these conditions significantly affect patients' quality of life, causing fatigue, stress, changes in sleep and concentration, memory problems, depression, anxiety or irritability. Treating these conditions, even without reducing tinnitus, will help the patient feel better. //Causes// They can be associated with various conditions, such as hearing loss, dizziness, earwax build-up, certain medications (antibiotics, diuretics, antidepressants, aspirin), infections, ear or head trauma, cardiovascular or ear diseases and exposure to noise. In many cases, the exact origin cannot be identified. One of the most common is damage to the inner ear. Age-related hearing loss, especially after age 60, is also a common cause. Exposure to noise is important in the professional context and also occurs in association with the use of headphones to listen to music. In these cases, the tinnitus may be short-lived, as happens after a concert, or be more prolonged, indicating a more serious situation. They may also appear associated with Ménière's disease, temporomaxillary joint or vascular changes, such as atherosclerosis or high blood pressure, and tumor lesions. Tobacco is also a risk factor for its development. //Diagnosis// The medical examination is very important and should include the ears, head and neck, in order to try to detect its cause. This typically includes an audiogram, movement assessment and imaging studies (CT or MRI). In many cases, its origin is not detected and it is important to define the best strategy to minimize its impact on the patients' lives. //Treatment// Treatment will vary depending on its cause and therefore different reasons have different approaches. Most of the approaches used use medications or therapy called TRT (Tinnitus Retraining Therapy). In this technique, a portable device is programmed to mask the specific frequencies of each patient's tinnitus. Over time, this method allows the patient to get used to their tinnitus, becoming less focused on them. Removing ear wax can help reduce symptoms. And whenever there are vascular changes, they must be treated. It is also important to review all ongoing medication, because, as mentioned, some therapies may be the cause. Noise suppression using so-called ""white noise"" can be very useful. There are electronic devices that emit it and, at the same time, can produce relaxing sounds (rain, sea), which are quite effective. Using a fan, dehumidifier or air conditioning in the bedroom at night also generates white noise that can help suppress it, allowing for a more restful sleep. Medications do not treat tinnitus but can minimize the severity of symptoms. In this context, antidepressants or some sedatives may be relevant. //Prevention// Prevention involves avoiding frequent noisy places. If this is not possible, it is essential to use adequate hearing protection. It is also important to avoid drinking coffee, black tea, chocolate or other substances that contain caffeine and reduce the consumption of tobacco and alcoholic beverages. Blood pressure must be controlled. Finally, when using headphones to listen to music, you should keep the volume at a level that is not too high. Portuguese Association of Audiologists, 2014 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, Fev. 2013 American Academy of Otolaryngology, 2014 Listening to music too loudly can damage your ears, but the type of headphones and time spent using them can also affect your hearing. Find out how. The answer is no. Using cotton swabs can push wax into the ear canal, and there is a risk of injury. Know what to do alternatively. Hearing is one of the main pillars in human communication. But we only realize its importance when, for some reason, we feel that we have lost it.

Acupuntura medica,"//What is it?// Medical acupuncture is a diagnosis and treatment method used in some clinical situations, which allows the correction of some changes and an improvement in global organic functioning. These corrections are made through the introduction of small needles in certain anatomical locations, promoting the restoration of physiology in the body through local, segmental and supra-segmental effects.  Western medicine, from a scientific point of view, explains the effects of acupuncture through the stimulation and release of endogenous substances, endorphins, neurotransmitters and hormones that will shape the central and autonomic nervous system, promoting balance in the body without the administration of any chemical substance. .  After the anamnesis, which consists of asking different questions related to aspects of the patient's life and clinical observation, a diagnosis is reached and only then treatment is started. This can be multimodal (using one or more synergistic techniques) and will be initiated according to a strategy previously defined, for the correct management of the set of medical and complementary contributions.  The clinical effectiveness of acupuncture, demonstrated in dozens of studies, led the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the US government's medical research center, to recognize acupuncture, which originated in traditional Chinese medicine, as a powerful ally of Western medicine.  In Europe, particularly in Germany, studies involving a large number of patients have confirmed the effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of musculoskeletal pathologies, such as hip and knee osteoarthritis, low back pain, chronic shoulder pain and in other situations such as tension headaches and dysmenorrhoea (menstrual pain).  Acupuncture is also recommended for the treatment or relief of organic functional symptoms such as intractable hiccups, nausea and vomiting of various types, including pregnancy and chemotherapy.  The World Health Organization presents a list of various indications. //Added value// What is the advantage of seeking a doctor with expertise in Medical Acupuncture? The doctor is the only professional who has the scientific knowledge, such as anatomy, physiology, biochemistry and pathology, to make the correct diagnosis, and can request and interpret additional tests. He or she has the ability to advise on the most appropriate therapy for each clinical situation, which may or may not be acupuncture, and to treat any complications that may arise. One of the serious problems that can occur when acupuncture is not practiced by doctors is the delay in the diagnosis and treatment of various pathologies, which require other types of treatments, and for which acupuncture is not indicated, which can create increased risks. It is up to the doctor to decide which situations are likely to be treated with acupuncture. This is a therapeutic technique that should be integrated and combined with conventional therapies, such as medication, surgery or other types of treatments and should not be seen as alternative medicine, but rather as complementary. In Portugal, medical acupuncture is practiced by specialists certified (competence) by the Medical Association. //Who is it for?// Acupuncture can be used as an alternative to some treatments or when drugs are contraindicated, such as during pregnancy (use of only some points), allergies, kidney and heart failure. Acupuncture and acupressure can be used at any age, particularly in Pediatrics. Acupuncture is less effective in patients taking certain medications, so it is necessary to de-medicate at an early stage before starting treatment. //Facts and Curiosities// Acupuncture aims to restore the body as a whole, by inducing regenerative processes, normalizing altered functions, strengthening the immune system and controlling pain. It is an ancient technique, showing benefits in individuals with gastrointestinal, respiratory, muscular, urological, endocrinological, psychological, neurological, gynecological, dermatological problems, in reducing emotional tension, weaning from smoking and drugs with psychoactive action.  Anti-inflammatory and analgesic function of acupuncture;/ Experiments on rats have shown that acupuncture can even triple the effects of a natural compound known for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic functions. Researchers at the University of Rochester in the USA observed that tissues close to the needles had up to 24 times more adenosine, suggesting that the imperceptible piercing of the skin may trigger both the accumulation of the substance in more external tissues of the skin, as well as signaling to the brain to create endorphins against pain and neurotransmitters and natural hormones, both with regulatory action.  Stimulation techniques in acupuncture;/ According to Easterners, the energy meridians that run through the body are affected by ""perverse"" energies, which affect the organism in general. Although it may seem like mysticism, Western tradition itself considers that winds, bacteria, viruses, injuries, traumas, anxieties, cold or heat constitute a large part of the ""perverse"" energies. Stimulation of acupuncture points can be done using fingers (acupressure), laser and other techniques. The important thing is that energy flows are resumed and the body's energy is balanced. Other techniques are also used, the best known being moxibustion (application of heat to certain points or meridians), auriculotherapy and electroacupuncture. The direction of the needles, the time and the form of stimulation may vary depending on the treatment. It is common to use a ""guide"" to insert the needles. This is a small disposable plastic tube inside which the needle is located. Light pressure of the tip of the ""guide"" on the skin helps to reduce the sensation of the needle entering, but experienced acupuncturists often choose to insert the needle in a quick movement without the guide to the indicated depth.

Afasia,"//What is it?// Aphasia is an acquired communication disorder that interferes with the ability to process language, without affecting intelligence. It impairs speech and understanding of other people and, in many cases, also compromises reading and writing. The most common cause is a stroke (about 25% to 40% of people with a stroke have this disorder). Other common causes include head injuries, brain tumors, or neurological problems. Therefore, in aphasia, as a result of a brain injury, one or more parts of language use stop working properly. It is one of the most disabling consequences of a stroke, making it difficult for the patient and their family to adapt to this situation. It requires dramatic changes at a professional, social and economic level, and generates communication difficulties and sometimes serious emotional disturbances. On the other hand, it has a strong impact on the notion of identity, self-esteem and interpersonal and social relationships, generating depression, physical limitations and isolation. It can also be associated with difficulties in daily actions, in observing the surroundings, in concentration, in taking the initiative to speak, in memory and can cause an inability to do two things simultaneously. No two people suffer from aphasia in the same way. Its severity and extent depend, among other things, on the location and magnitude of the brain injury, previous language skills and the individual's personality. Some people can understand language but have trouble finding the right words or constructing sentences. Others tend to talk a lot, but what they say is difficult to understand. This condition affects around one million Americans and is more common than Parkinson's disease, cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy. More than 100,000 Americans acquire this disorder each year. It is a very common disorder in elderly people but can occur at any age, regardless of gender or race. Its identification is very important because it tends to be a factor of social and family isolation, given the communication difficulties it causes. As many professions require language and speech skills, aphasia can hinder the full performance of work. People with mild and moderate pathology are able to return to work, but their functions or occupations may be adapted. In Portugal there is no data on its incidence but it is estimated that around 50% of survivors of a stroke have communication difficulties. //Symptoms// Some people have difficulty speaking, while others have difficulty following a conversation. In some cases, it is very light and is not noticeable on first contact. In others, it can be very severe, affecting speaking, writing, reading and understanding. The specific symptoms are very varied, but what all individuals with aphasia have in common are communication difficulties. People with this disorder may have difficulty remembering words and names, but their intelligence is basically intact. Aphasia is not like Alzheimer's disease because, in this case, the difficulty lies in the ability to access ideas and thoughts and not in the elaboration of the idea or thought itself. However, because many people with aphasia have difficulty communicating, they are often mistaken for being mentally ill. Many individuals with this disorder also have paralysis or weakness of the right upper and lower limbs because aphasia results from damage to the left side of the brain, which controls movement on the right side of the body. Loss of visual field, lack of knowledge of how to perform simple sequences of actions (such as getting dressed, eating, drinking or swallowing), memory problems, difficulty controlling emotions and epilepsy may also occur. //Causes// It develops as a result of brain injury, such as a stroke, trauma, or brain tumor. In the brain there are several areas with different functions. For most people, the areas responsible for language are located on the left side of the brain. When this part is  affected, aphasia appears. //Diagnosis// It is essentially done through four tests: speech analysis, naming objects by visual confrontation, repetition of words and understanding of simple commands. In addition to diagnosis, it is essential to identify the brain injury, which can be achieved by magnetic resonance imaging. //Treatment// The goal of treatment is to make communication functional. Many people with aphasia have been hospitalized for some time. This happens after the brain injury has occurred. After being discharged from the hospital, many individuals still need access to therapeutic resources. It's not always clear who to turn to. Treatment is almost always carried out by speech therapists (speech therapists). In principle, anyone suffering from this disorder is eligible for speech therapy. Its duration depends, among other things, on the recovery time from aphasia. Due to this condition, the way in which the aphasic person understands the world or the way in which he or she expresses himself or herself undergoes a change. By making the best possible use of the patient's remaining communication skills, it is still possible to communicate with him or her. A person with severe aphasia often understands only the most important words of a sentence. Often those around him or her think that both have understood each other, but a negative reaction from the patient shows that this is not the case. For communication to be effective, it is important to allow time. Sitting comfortably and maintaining eye contact is very helpful. Speak slowly and in short sentences, emphasizing the most important words in each sentence. Help the person with aphasia to express themselves when they have difficulty. This can be done by pointing to an object, making gestures, drawing pictures or writing something about what is being said. If symptoms last more than two to three months after the brain injury, a full recovery may be less likely. However, it is important to know that many individuals continue to improve even after years or decades. This evolution is part of a slow process that involves both the individual and the family, and it is important to develop compensatory communication strategies. //Prevention// Since the most common cause of aphasia is a stroke, prevention involves measures that minimize the risk of its occurrence: regular physical exercise; a balanced diet, low in salt and fat, and rich in fruit and vegetables; avoiding tobacco; moderate alcohol intake; controlling weight and blood pressure; and treating associated diseases such as diabetes and excess cholesterol. International Aphasia Association, 2013 National Aphasia Association, 2012 Gabriela Leal et al., Assessment of aphasia by the Family Physician, Rev Port Clin Geral 2005;21:359-64 American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2013 Prosopagnosia consists of the inability to recognize other people's faces, including friends. Find out more about this neurological change. Although there are risk factors common to both men and women, women have a higher risk of suffering a stroke than men. Find out why. Stroke can be a serious condition with a high risk of causing disability or being fatal. Fortunately, some of the risk factors can be controlled and treated.

Alcoolismo,"//What is it?// The concept of alcoholism encompasses the entirety of problems caused by alcohol, in the individual, on the physical and psychological planes, in disturbances in family, professional and social life, and also in their economic, legal and moral implications. In Portugal, despite the latest available data indicating a slight decrease at a national level, its per capita intake remains quite high. On the other hand, there has been growing consumption among young people and women and significant changes that worsen risk situations. This topic has been a recurring theme in the media and has led to changes in legislation in order to try to control this problem. Portugal consistently appears among the largest consumers of alcoholic beverages at European and global level. In a recent study, estimates were found in the country over 15 years of age, of 58 thousand alcoholic patients (alcohol dependence syndrome), that is, around 7% of the population, and 750 thousand excessive drinkers (alcohol abuse syndrome). alcohol), which is equivalent to 9.4% of the national population. In the Portuguese school population, it is estimated that the prevalence of alcohol-related problems is between 10% and 20% in university students. Regarding high school, with an average age of 16, between 18% and 20% would have gotten drunk at least once. It is also estimated that excessive consumption occurs in around 10% of women and 20% of men. It is also known to be related to 50% of deaths in car accidents, 50% of homicides and 25% of suicides. Alcohol is currently a legal and commercialized drug in Portugal, and is part of the eating habits of a large majority of the population. In addition, it is often associated with numerous forms of relationships, both private and public, of a ritual, celebratory, recreational nature, and is part of the lifestyle or even the identity of many social groups. //Symptoms// The symptoms of alcoholism are very diverse and include the inability to reduce alcohol consumption, the feeling of an enormous need to consume it, the development of tolerance, which requires greater consumption to obtain the same effect, drinking in isolation or in secret, a physical sensation of withdrawal (nausea, sweating, tremors), memory lapses, creation of rituals, consuming alcohol at set times with a feeling of frustration if this is not possible, irritability, to feel good or to feel “normal”, to deal with legal, financial, personal and professional problems, accompanied by a loss of interest in other activities that are usually enjoyable. Alcohol causes nervous system depression, although in some people the initial reaction is stimulation. Reduces inhibitions, affects thoughts, emotions and the ability to judge and decide. It also interferes with speech and muscle coordination and, in excessive doses, can induce a coma or cause death. On the other hand, alcohol dependence is often associated with dependence on other substances. As a consequence of the loss of all the aforementioned capabilities, the risk of car and domestic accidents increases, performance at work and school is reduced, and the likelihood of committing violent crimes increases. It also worsens the possibility of medical complications such as liver disease (hepatitis, cirrhosis, cancer), digestive problems (gastritis, ulcers); malabsorption, pancreatitis; heart problems (high blood pressure, myocardial infarction, stroke); complications in diabetic patients; changes in sexual function; vision difficulties; osteoporosis; neurological implications; decrease in defenses; congenital anomalies in case of consumption during pregnancy; and increased risk for several forms of cancer. //Causes// Alcoholism is influenced by genetic, psychological, social and environmental factors that affect the body's response and behavior to this type of drink. The addiction process occurs gradually. Alcohol, over time, alters the normal balance between the chemical substances that exist in the brain associated with the sensation of pleasure, ability to evaluate and control the body. This fact makes it consume itself to recover good sensations or to ward off negative ones. Some risk factors for the development of alcoholism: Regular consumption over time, which generates physical dependence.;/ Age: the earlier you start, the greater the risk of developing dependence.;/ Family history: the risk is higher when there are close family members who are alcoholics.;/ Depression and other mental health problems, such as anxiety or bipolar disorder.;/ Social and cultural factors: having friends or close people who drink regularly increases the risk of drinking and becoming dependent. Media messages about the association between drinking and social status may be an important factor in some cases.;/ Mixing medications and alcohol: Some drugs interact with alcohol, which can increase or decrease therapeutic effects.;/ //Diagnosis// It is important for the person to become aware that they are consuming more alcohol than normal and that they should seek help. Diagnosis therefore involves a thorough interview with the attending physician, an assessment of daily consumption and a series of tests to assess the extent of the disease. There are several resources that are important in identifying problems associated with alcohol, such as clinical tests, abdominal ultrasound, liver biopsy and others, and it is up to the physician to select the most appropriate ones in each case. //Treatment// The treatment of alcoholism is complex and must encompass biological and psychosocial aspects, as well as the family, professional and social environment in which the patient lives. As for organic problems, in the initial phase the damage caused may be reversible. This period can take some time and basically involves complete abstinence from consuming alcoholic beverages. Medication may also be prescribed to help combat the symptoms caused by dependence or withdrawal. In the more advanced stages, the damage may be irreversible (liver cirrhosis). Despite this, treating the complications may contribute to a significant improvement in quality of life. //Prevention// The only truly foolproof way to prevent this would be to simply not drink alcohol. But what really matters is moderation. During social events, you should drink less than is considered reasonable, and it is also important not to mix different drinks. It is important to evaluate the group of friends and people close to you because excessive alcohol consumption is often encouraged by third parties. Playing sports, reading, meditating, going to the theater and cinema can be good alternatives to help release stress and prevent the need to escape to alcoholic beverages. It is also worth noting that “anti-hangover” medications do not protect against the harmful effects of alcohol.

Alergia alimentar,"//What is it?// Food allergy is a pathology whose prevalence and severity have increased in recent years. Milk, eggs and fish are the foods most frequently involved; less frequently, wheat, peanuts, nuts, shellfish and fresh fruits appear. An allergy to a certain food can lead to the appearance of symptoms within minutes of ingesting it. These reactions can affect the skin and mucous membranes (hives and angioedema are the most common), the respiratory tract (rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma), the intestine (vomiting, diarrhoea) and the cardiovascular system (anaphylactic shock, which is less common but more serious).  //Symptoms// Accidental ingestion may occur despite all precautions taken to avoid the drug. Treatment for these reactions depends on the symptoms that arise. Antihistamines are used when mild symptoms such as itchy nose or eyes, sneezing or hives appear. Corticosteroids are used when more generalized skin symptoms or respiratory difficulties occur. In selected cases, the prescription of adrenaline may be indicated. //Diagnosis// The diagnosis of food allergy is based on the clinical history and complementary diagnostic tests, including skin prick tests and specific IGE measurement, and is confirmed by the oral provocation test with the suspected food. Skin prick tests are a quick, safe and effective diagnostic tool that has virtually no adverse effects when performed by specialists. However, when there is a history of severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), it is recommended that skin tests be performed in a day hospital, which is done regularly at our Allergy Center. The oral food challenge test (OPT) is the reference method for diagnosing food allergy. These tests are also indicated for the periodic assessment of the acquisition of tolerance to food or for determining the patient's tolerance threshold. It should always be performed in a hospital setting and by specialized teams experienced in these procedures. The patient must be previously informed about the reason, method and risks of the OPT and must sign their informed consent. The protocol used depends on the clinical history, but increasing doses of the suspected food are usually administered orally at regular intervals (usually 15 to 30 minutes), until a total dose corresponding to the amount ingested in a meal is reached. The test is suspended if a reaction occurs. //Treatment// Once the diagnosis of food allergy has been confirmed, traditional treatment consists of total avoidance of the food(s) and treatment of allergic reactions that may result from accidental or inadvertent ingestion of the food involved. Food allergy in childhood is often temporary, so it is important to regularly schedule PPOs to assess tolerance. However, severe and long-lasting forms of food allergy are increasingly common, when the likelihood of the disease resolving naturally is lower. In severe forms, the risk of a potentially fatal allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) is a reality, there is a risk of hidden food allergens being present, the recommended avoidance diet is difficult to follow and may become incompatible with an adequate quality of life. In these cases, tolerance induction emerges as an innovative form of food allergy treatment. This is a therapeutic strategy that must be used judiciously, always under the supervision of experienced immunoallergologists, in different centers, in order to guarantee the safety of the procedure. This treatment should only be considered when there is availability and understanding of the objectives of the procedure, whether by the patient or their family members. Tolerance induction is achieved by ingesting increasing doses of food until a target dose or maximum tolerated dose is reached. All dose increases take place in a day hospital, in sessions lasting up to 8 hours, under permanent medical supervision. The schedule of hospital visits will be scheduled according to the clinical evolution and availability of the patient/family. This treatment must always be carried out in accordance with the instructions of the medical team. The aim is to allow the allergy sufferer to reach tolerance to the food in question, maintaining its effect over time, which is subject to regular intake in accordance with medical advice. The patient and their family members/caregivers, in the case of the child, will be able to count on the availability of the medical team to clarify any doubts that may arise during the treatment.

Food, medicines or dust and mites can cause allergic reactions. There are several allergy tests that can be performed whenever there is a suspicion.

Alergias,"//What is it?// Allergies are exaggerated responses of the body after contact with the environment around it, and are more frequent when there is a family tendency, that is, a genetic risk for their occurrence. In other words, “allergies are an excess of defenses”, as opposed to other clinical situations in which there is a lack of defenses. In addition to genetics, many risk factors related to the lifestyle of Western societies – sedentary lifestyle, change in diet, obesity, pollution inside and outside buildings, exposure to allergens, excessive consumption of medications, particularly antibiotics – are some of the important attributes significant increase in the almost explosive expression that has occurred in allergic diseases in recent decades. In Europe, these illnesses chronically affect more than a third of the population and Portugal is no exception. Immunoallergology or Allergology bases its activity on health promotion, preventing, at various levels, situations that affect the quality of life of populations, from asthma to rhinitis, from urticaria to eczema, from food allergies to medication. //Symptoms// Allergic diseases are very common but their severity varies. While it is well known that asthma can have a fatal outcome, insect bites, taking medication or eating food are not usually recognized or valued as being responsible for very serious conditions. In some allergic patients, contact with allergens, even in minimal quantities, can be very disturbing: Unrecognized ingestion of food allergens, hidden in other foods (for example, milk mixed with fruit juices or even alcoholic beverages – “milk liqueur”), can put your life at risk.;/ Accidents related to taking medication should be reported to the healthcare team and well known to you and your family and friends.;/ Reactions related to insect bites, especially if very serious, should be reported quickly to the attending physician, which is often not done. And the situation can represent a permanent risk to life.;/  //Insect allergy// When to suspect an insect allergy? Many species of insects can cause allergic reactions, most often local, such as mosquitoes, midges, flies, fleas and bedbugs. However, in some patients allergic to the venom of Hymenoptera – bees and wasps – their stings can trigger very serious systemic reactions. Insect stings usually only cause a local reaction, with pain, itching, redness and swelling, resulting from the injection of the toxic components of the venom. In cases of severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), symptoms usually appear a few minutes after the sting and have varying degrees of severity, from skin reactions (hives, angioedema), digestive symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain), respiratory symptoms (wheezing, stridor, shortness of breath), cardiovascular symptoms (tachycardia, dizziness, confusion, feeling faint), to anaphylactic shock (cardiopulmonary comparison). The risk is usually greater in bee stings than in wasp stings. Patients with a history of systemic reactions should carry an emergency kit with adrenaline for self-administration. They should also be referred to an Immunoallergology Centre for assessment and possible indication for an anti-allergy vaccine with venom extract in a hospital environment.  //Food Allergy// When to suspect a food allergy? When symptoms appear, immediately or close to ingestion of a food, and less frequently after contact or inhalation of cooking vapors.;/ When identical symptoms recur after eating the same food, or related foods.;/ When the following signs appear, either alone or in combination, close to eating a food:;/ Skin and mucous membranes - itchy red spots or bumps on the skin (hives), swelling; itchy mouth; Digestive: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps; Respiratory: sneezing, itchy or watery eyes, coughing, wheezing, difficulty breathing.;/ Severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), which may involve several organs such as the skin, respiratory and digestive systems and/or cardiovascular symptoms, resulting in a sudden drop in blood pressure, sweating, paleness, palpitations and loss of consciousness.;/ After intense physical exercise, an allergic reaction that can range from hives to a severe allergic reaction.;/ Itching in the mouth, with or without swelling of the lips and/or tongue, immediately after eating plant foods, such as fresh fruits – oral allergy syndrome.;/ Redness and itching of the skin – contact urticaria.;/ In children, presence of moderate to severe eczema, particularly in the first years of life.;/ When they occur, particularly in children, frequent digestive symptoms such as refusal to eat, vomiting, diarrhea, poor weight gain or blood in the stool.;/ If you have been diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis.;/ Patients with a history of severe allergic reactions should carry an emergency kit with adrenaline for self-administration in cases of accidental ingestion of the food(s) to which they are allergic. It is recommended that patients with food allergies be evaluated at Immunoallergology Centers with experience in this area, mainly due to the particularities inherent in the diagnosis of food allergies according to the age of the patient – ​​particularly in children – due to the complexity of some situations involving cross-reactivity reactions between food groups, and due to the possibility that in more serious situations specific oral tolerance induction procedures may have to be carried out (cow's milk or eggs, for example).  //Latex allergy// When to suspect a latex allergy? Latex (rubber) is used in many products, including medical equipment (gloves, catheters, catheters, masks, drains, probes, tourniquets, among others) and everyday equipment (condoms, balls, balloons, caps, toys, pacifiers, teats, etc.). Symptoms of latex allergy can range from a local allergic reaction (contact urticaria), rhinitis (sneezing, itchy nose, runny nose), conjunctivitis (itching, redness, watery eyes), asthma (dyspnea, wheezing and coughing), to episodes of severe allergic reaction or anaphylactic shock. You should suspect a latex allergy when: An allergic reaction occurs in a child or adult who has undergone multiple surgeries (e.g. spina bifida and other congenital malformations) or has had professional exposure to latex (e.g. healthcare professionals, veterinarians, hairdressers, etc.);;/ Immediate symptoms after contact with latex gloves, condoms or other products containing latex (direct contact and/or inhalation of latex allergen particles);;/ Reactions during medical or surgical procedures, such as dental treatments, gynecological examinations, or intraoperative interventions;;/ Reactions with foods with cross-reactivity described with latex (latex-fruit syndrome).;/ Patients with a history of severe allergic reactions should carry an emergency kit with adrenaline for self-administration in cases of accidental exposure to latex and/or foods with cross-reactivity with latex to which they are allergic. These patients should be referred to an Immunoallergology Center for evaluation and possible indication for immunotherapy (anti-allergy vaccine) with latex extract in a hospital setting.  //Drug allergy// When to suspect a drug allergy? When the following symptoms (alone or in combination) occur close to the administration of a certain medication: most frequently, involvement of the skin and mucous membranes, with itchy red spots or papules (urticaria, rash), swelling (angioedema) or itchy skin; less frequently, digestive complaints, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea or abdominal cramps; eye and/or respiratory complaints, itchy or watery eyes, sneezing, coughing, wheezing or difficulty breathing; or even cardiovascular symptoms, resulting in a sudden drop in blood pressure (hypotension), with dizziness, palpitations, feeling faint or even shock and loss of consciousness.;/ When a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) occurs immediately or shortly after the administration of a certain drug. The most relevant reactions occur, in most cases, within the first 30 minutes to one hour after administration.;/ In the case of proven drug allergy, patients must carry information about the substances involved, the type of reaction and therapeutic alternatives. Do not forget that the drug in question can exist in many different forms. Due to the complexity of the diagnosis, it is recommended that these individuals be evaluated at Immunoallergology Centers, with experience in the area. //Diagnosis// Correct and timely recognition of these mild to very serious clinical conditions allows for the design of measures for diagnosis and treatment, offering dietary and medicinal alternatives and structuring emergency action if very serious symptoms occur. However, for diagnosis to be possible, it is important that the attending physicians and affected citizens, adults or children, pregnant women or the elderly, are referred to an Immunoallergology specialist. //Treatment// There are several medications that can be divided into three groups: Symptomatic medications to relieve complaints, including antihistamines to control allergy symptoms in the nose, eyes or skin, and bronchodilators to treat asthma complaints.;/ Preventative, anti-inflammatory medications that help combat allergies and prevent the appearance of symptoms.;/ Anti-allergy vaccines. They are a specific treatment, targeted at the allergen involved, which are highly effective as long as they are administered correctly and under strict supervision by a doctor specializing in Immunoallergology. It is a method that aims to modify the evolution of allergic disease. For example, in patients with pollen rhinitis who are at increased risk of developing asthma, vaccines may prevent this development.;/ Allergic diseases, when they are chronic, formally have no cure. Therefore, the main objective is to obtain control and thus allow an adequate quality of life. We are talking about anti-allergy vaccines or tolerance induction protocols for medicines or foods, which experts have the capacity to apply according to strict indications. In any case, an allergic patient can go decades without feeling any allergy symptoms, and this is less likely to happen the more controlled the allergy is. //Prevention// The treatment that allows control is divided into several approaches, but is based, first, on a correct diagnosis. The fundamental pillars in controlling the disease are: Educate the patient and his/her family;;/ Avoid aggravating factors;;/ Treat acute episodes or crises, using drugs that relieve bronchial obstruction;;/ Plan preventive or control treatment through allergy vaccines.;/  //Avoid indoor allergens// House dust mites represent the main cause of allergies in the Brazilian population. The recommended measures to avoid exposure to yourself and other contaminants are: Maintain adequate ventilation and aeration;;/ Avoid carpets and rugs, replacing them with linoleum, mosaic or varnished wood floors;;/ Use new mattresses, less than a year old;;/ Place anti-mite covers on mattresses and pillows;;/ Use cotton sheets and synthetic duvets;;/ Wash bedding and plastic covers with water at temperatures above 50ºC;;/ Remove stuffed animals or objects that accumulate dust (e.g. books) from the room;;/ Use a vacuum cleaner with a high-efficiency filter (HEPA);;/ Control relative humidity below 50%;;/ In patients allergic to fungi, environmental control measures are similar. For those allergic to domestic animals - cats, dogs, rabbits, hamsters, among others - it will be necessary to remove them from the house.  //Avoid allergens from the external environment// Pollens are the most important allergens in the external environment. For patients allergic to this element, whose usual season is spring, some measures may be useful: Know the region's pollen bulletin (available on the website of the Portuguese Society of Allergology and Clinical Immunology - www.spaic.pt);;/ Plan work trips or vacations choosing times of year and places free from the pollens to which you are allergic;;/ Avoid going to the countryside during periods of high pollen concentration, especially in the morning;;/ Keep the windows closed during the day at home, opting to ventilate at dusk;;/ Wear sunglasses;;/ Traveling by car with the windows closed, and motorcyclists must wear a full-face helmet.;/  //Avoid tobacco smoke, both active and passive// Tobacco smoke increases the risk of developing asthma and other allergic diseases, and in children with this condition, the risk of serious attacks increases, which can lead to hospitalization. Parents of minors with asthma should be aware that if they smoke or allow others to smoke around their children (at home, in the car...) they are seriously harming their children's health, significantly increasing the severity of the disease. It is important to remember that children cannot express their discomfort verbally, and that coughing is usually their only form of expression. Load more;/ Good management of allergic rhinitis is essential to keep the disease under control, reduce symptoms and maintain quality of life. Learn how to do it here. Spring has arrived and pollen is in the air, much to the dismay of allergy sufferers. The good news for those allergic to pollen is that there are ways to prevent discomfort. Airing the house only at the end of the day or wearing sunglasses outside are just two of the many strategies you can adopt to prevent an allergy attack.

Alopecia,"//What is it?// Alopecia is a natural condition in which hair gradually becomes thinner with age. More hair follicles enter the resting phase, and the remaining hairs become shorter and fewer in number. Alopecia means less hair on the head, while defluvius means more hair loss. One can exist without the other and vice versa. Hair loss can have a variety of causes, with androgenetic alopecia being the most common. It focuses mainly on the upper part of the scalp, sparing the back and side areas (which is due to different hormonal receptors in these areas). //Symptoms// Signs of hair loss and thinning vary between men, women and children. However, at any age, signs appear when you start to notice more hair on your brush when combing or more hair falling out when washing your hair. //Causes// There are two types: androgenetic alopecia (common baldness) and telogen defluvium. In androgenetic alopecia, men typically lose their hair when three factors interact: genetics, age, and hormones. While hormone levels change with aging, genetic factors also play a role in this process, which contributes to the gradual shrinkage of hair follicles. Hair grows progressively shorter and thinner until it stops growing. In women, genetics appears to be a significant factor, with women inheriting the gene from either parent. It tends to be more common as women get older and reach middle age, although it can start earlier. It often develops after menopause, when hormonal changes can also be a contributing factor, and is manifested by a generalized decrease in follicles across the scalp, but especially at the crown. Telogen defluvium is related to the hair cycle (more or less three years) after which it falls out and is replaced by another. In this context, there is a change in this cycle. Seasonality (autumn), childbirth, stress, tiredness, surgery or an illness may contribute to this. The triggering phenomenon precedes hair loss by three or four months. As for seasonality, it appears to be mediated by variation in sunlight. The pituitary gland detects this change and varies the levels of prolactin, melatonin and other hormones that act on receptors that condition the cycle of each follicle. Hair that falls out due to telogen defluvius can be completely recovered as what happens is just a hair cycle disorder: many hairs fall out, but others are born. Recovery of full volume may take up to a year. //Diagnosis// If hair loss persists at a level higher than usual, you should consult a dermatologist to rule out the presence of a disease. Most pathologies that affect hair do so in two main ways: Due to interference in the hair cycle. If an external factor (stress, childbirth, unbalanced diet, medications or surgeries) causes a large number of hairs to simultaneously enter the phase of the cycle in which they come loose, this will result in greater hair loss when combing and washing and, depending on Due to the intensity and duration of the phenomenon, there may be less hair on the scalp.;/ Injury to the part of the follicle where the pluripotent cells capable of regenerating it exist, which occurs in the presence of a series of inflammatory diseases that affect the scalp but also in common baldness. In this case, the inflammation, associated with genetic factors, leads to the death of hair cells, making them increasingly thinner until they disappear.;/ //Treatment// Alopecia is a concern for most people and can negatively affect self-image. There are three levels of intervention: Medical/Topical:There is currently no doubt that the most effective topical product is minoxidil. Doctors also prescribe appropriate shampoo.;/ Medical/Systemic: The administration of Finasteride (tablets) orally, in order to block the action of the male hormone on the hair follicle, constitutes, in many cases, a good adjuvant. The combination of multivitamins/trace elements (orally) is common in the treatment of alopecia, although its usefulness is not obvious, except in cases where there is a lack of a nutrient.;/ Surgical: This involves hair transplants. The first ones were performed half a century ago. The technique has evolved a lot and for the past ten years, Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT) has been performed. In this procedure, hair is removed from donor areas, usually in the form of a thin strip of skin or follicle by follicle. The hair is then cut in a microscopically controlled manner and micro holes are made in the area where the aim is to improve hair density. Finally, the follicles are inserted into each hole. The transplanted hair falls out between the first and second month. It grows back between the third and fourth month, with a natural appearance. A careful clinical history is essential before proceeding with this procedure. Diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and bleeding dyscrasias must be under control. The procedure lasts on average four to five hours, after which the patient goes home. Common adverse effects include swelling of the eyelids that occurs between the second and fourth day after the transplant and micro-crusts that are visible at the site of each implanted follicle (for 15 days). With the current technique, it is possible to perform sessions of more than 1,500 implanted hairs. It is important to adapt expectations to reality. One session greatly improves the appearance but does not provide the volume of a normal head of hair. The result is better the thicker the hair and the denser the donor area. In women, the technique is slightly different, as there are usually no completely depopulated areas, so reinforcing two or three centimeters anteriorly can have a great effect. In men with androgenetic alopecia, three sessions are expected during their lifetime: one for anterior reinforcement, another for posterior reinforcement, and one that joins both areas. There is an average of four years between sessions. On the other hand, this technique also allows the correction of scars caused by hair diseases, trauma, tumors or radiotherapy.;/ //Prevention// You must maintain a healthy lifestyle and, above all, have a balanced diet.

Alopecia cicatricial,"//What is it?// Cicatricial alopecia is nothing more than the final stage of aggression or disease in which normal skin is replaced by areas of scarring, making it impossible to regenerate the follicle, and permanently losing hair. We classify it as Primary or Secondary. Primary, when a skin disease directly affects the hair follicle. These are usually inflammatory diseases that destroy the reservoir of pluripotent cells existing in the superficial part of the follicle. Secondary, when an aggression – trauma, surgery, radiotherapy, infection, acne – causes an area of ​​scarring that leads to irreversible alopecia.  //Symptoms// Diseases that cause primary cicatricial alopecia are not very common. Among Caucasians, the most common is lichen planopilaris (LPP). In the most common form, it causes small patches of hair or a retreat from the previous hairline, increasing the length of the forehead.  This last form is called frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA) and is more common in postmenopausal women. It is treated with corticosteroids and, sometimes, finasteride. Much rarer and exclusive to Caucasians, erosive pustulosis of the scalp, which causes erosions, scales and crusts and responds to cream corticosteroids. In black people, the most common type is traction alopecia. It is caused by the physical aggression caused by the tension caused by braiding hair and mainly affects the frontotemporal area. The key is to stop the aggression and in the very early stages minoxidil can help. Central centrifugal alopecia is exclusive to black people, in which the area of ​​alopecia spreads from the inside out (it responds poorly to any treatment). Acne keloidalis nucae is also almost exclusive to black people, characterized by inflammation of follicles and scars in the nape area. Folliculitis decalvans (FD) can occur in both white and black people and is characterized by groups of hair in tufts, crusts, pus spots and an area of ​​alopecia (usually a single area that spreads). It is treated with topical antibiotics – clindamycin, erythromycin – and systemic antibiotics – minocycline, rifampicin, clindamycin, etc. Less common, and occurring in both races, benign cutaneous lupus erythematosus (called discoid) also causes scarring alopecia. The best medication to control it is hydroxychloroquine. //Diagnosis// As each disease is treated differently, it is important to know exactly what it is. The diagnosis can be aided by dermoscopy (viewing the skin in magnification) and confirmed by histological examination of the biopsy specimen. The inflammatory cells are lymphocytes in the case of LPP or Lupus and neutrophils in the case of FD. In the final stage, histology cannot determine the disease, only that it is cicatricial alopecia. //Treatment// These diseases present a challenge in both diagnosis and treatment and should be referred to dermatologists with experience in treating them. The first objective is to stop the disease. In a second phase, and with the disease clinically non-evolving, transplantation trials can be carried out (10 or 20 implants). If they survive after a year, it is permissible to try to repopulate the area of ​​cicatricial alopecia through hair transplantation (see hair transplantation). The same can be done for scars from trauma, surgery, radiotherapy, infection or acne (in this case for scars in the beard area).  Why it happens, to what extent it is normal and how to prevent it.

Alta miopia,"//What is it?// Myopia is a refractive error frequently found in the population, in which the image is blurred into the distance. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), high myopia is considered to be present when the refractive error exceeds 5 (five) diopters. It is estimated that myopia and high myopia affect 27% and 2.8% of the world's population, with a tendency to increase. The WHO estimates that, by 2050, myopia and high myopia will affect, respectively, 52% and 10% of the world population.  High myopia is associated with complications, which include, among others: Myopic macular degeneration;/ Retinal detachment;/ Macular hole;/ Myopic schisis (separation of the macular retinal layers);/ Glaucoma;/ Cataract;/ Strabismus;/  High myopia, alone or associated with one of these pathologies, can lead to serious and irreversible visual loss. //Symptoms// A myopic individual can see clearly up close, but has difficulty seeing far away. High myopia is often diagnosed during adolescence; it can lead to poor vision that is not corrected by glasses, due to atrophy of the layer of the eye responsible for receiving light stimuli, which translates into areas of lower definition in the visual field.  Patients with high myopia should undergo regular eye exams to check for eye damage as, in many cases, symptoms are not evident. It is, however, advisable to carry out frequent self-monitoring in order to identify some of the complications early.  Symptoms that should lead a highly myopic person to seek ophthalmological examination are: Visualization of flashes of light (photopsias);/ Visualization of floaters (myodesopsias);/ Sudden loss of visual acuity;/ Sudden image distortion;/  These symptoms may be associated with a retinal detachment or choroidal neovascularization and require targeted therapy. //Causes// The origin of high myopia is still not fully understood. A genetic predisposition is recognized and it is more common in individuals of Asian descent. It can be part of other diseases, such as congenital glaucoma, premature retinopathy, Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, among others. The importance of the environment in which the individual lives has become increasingly relevant in the development of this pathology. //Treatment// Refractive error can be corrected through the use of glasses, contact lenses or refractive surgery. Complications of high myopia may require intraocular injections, laser therapy, or intraocular surgery. Myopia, astigmatism and hyperopia often lead to the use of glasses or contact lenses. LASIK surgery can restore good vision. For many children, spending more time at home has meant spending more time in front of screens. Learn how to protect your child's eyes. A myopic person has poor vision at a distance, but near-sightedness is not affected. Find out what this refractive error consists of and what the symptoms of myopia are.

Alteracoes do desejo sexual,"//What is it?// This is a situation that naturally affects men's quality of life, more in some than others, but which often causes marital or relational conflicts as it negatively interferes with sexuality. In this context, this decrease in sexual desire can accompany other symptoms that affect a couple's sexual life, such as erectile dysfunction or ejaculatory changes, which is why a correct diagnosis is essential for the treatment to be as successful as possible.  //Symptoms// It is important to keep in mind that around 20 to 30% of men after the age of 45 have symptoms related to low testosterone levels. Some studies show that low testosterone levels may be associated with an increased risk of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Effective treatment can be effective and restore normal sexual function, improving mood and energy. Changes in libido occur in most cases with weak or absent erections, fatigue, depression, anhedonia (inability to feel pleasure in various daily activities) and increased abdominal fat.  //Causes// Changes in male sexual desire can have several causes, some of which are organic in origin, and may first be the symptom, while others are psychological in origin and can affect all age groups. All of these conditions must be diagnosed in order to be treated in a specific way.  The main cause in men over 50 years of age is male hypogonadism, defined as a clinical syndrome caused by a deficiency of the male hormone (testosterone) and which can also negatively affect multiple organic functions. This hypogonadism can originate from testicular diseases (called primary), pituitary or hypothalamus diseases located in the brain (called secondary) and also related to age (late-onset hypogonadism, which is a mixed situation of the previous two). The main causes of hypogonadism in this age group are the use of certain medications and late-onset hypogonadism, which have different treatments. Since this hormonal deficiency causes not only changes in the sexual sphere but also significant organic changes, such as anemia, loss of bone mass, increased visceral fat, sleep disorders and even fatigue, irritability or depression, it is important to diagnose and treat it in the context of men's health, and hormone replacement therapy may be indicated to improve the patient's physical condition and prevent or treat these metabolic changes.  On the other hand, psychological causes also play an important role. The national reality shows that more than 10% of Portuguese men have a lack of sexual interest. The most implicated factors are fatigue and professional demands. However, in some cases, it is because they are anxious, depressed or bored, they feel insecure, they have low levels of confidence in their erectile function or there are conflicts in the marital relationship, especially when they last a long time. The most surprising thing is that men between 30 and 39 are the most affected. And the main reasons for the lack of sexual interest in this age group are the routine of relationships and the change in the couple's role, and parenthood, for example, tends to influence the couple's relationship. //Treatment// For these situations, psychological support is recommended, rather than drug therapies, with professionals specialized in this area, after ruling out organic medical causes.  Endoscopic vaporization - Rezum - is an innovative technique that uses thermal energy released by water vapor to treat Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia. Urological problems are the main reason that men make an appointment. Discover four of the diseases that a urologist can treat.

Alveolite dentaria,"//What is it?// Dental alveolitis is one of the most common complications that can occur after tooth extraction. It is classified as dry alveolitis or suppurative alveolitis. Suppurative alveolitis appears when an infection forms in the tooth socket. Dry socket occurs when the blood clot fails to form or is accidentally removed or dislodged. The blood clot is important to protect the tooth socket, that is, the bone and surrounding tissues that are exposed after tooth removal. Furthermore, it will also be the basis for healing and the growth of new bones and soft tissues.  //Symptoms of dry socket// The pain inherent to dental alveolitis usually begins one to three days after tooth extraction and can last about five to six days. Symptoms vary and include: Severe pain at the extraction site;/ Bad breath (halitosis);/ Unpleasant taste in the mouth;/ Radiation of pain to the ear, eye, temple or neck;/  //Causes// Only 1% to 5% of patients develop dry socket after tooth extraction, with 30% of cases being associated with the extraction of lower wisdom teeth. The reason for its appearance is unclear, however, possible causes include the type and quantity of bacteria present in the oral cavity and possible trauma to the affected area, either during surgery or afterwards, for example, accidentally touching the clot with a toothbrush.  There are also some risk factors that can increase the likelihood of developing dental alveolitis: Being a smoker and/or chewing tobacco;/ Pre-existing infection in the area treated;/ Practicing poor oral hygiene;/ Not following the recommended care after surgery;/ Rinse your mouth intensely;/ Prolonged tooth extraction surgery;/ Using birth control pills or taking estrogen replacement therapy;/ Have ever had dental alveolitis;/  The type and number of teeth extracted may be a risk factor, given that dental alveolitis is more common after the removal of wisdom teeth or other molars and in single tooth extractions.  //Diagnosis// If the patient has symptoms compatible with alveolitis, he/she should consult a dentist to confirm the diagnosis. This is usually done only through a visual examination. An X-ray may be necessary to confirm that no tooth fragments have been left behind and to rule out the possibility of osteomyelitis (bone infection).  //Treatment of dental alveolitis// Dry socket is a temporary condition that can be treated quickly with proper care. The main focus of treatment is pain management. To help reduce symptoms, the tooth socket can be washed with a saline solution, alveolar curettage can be performed to clean the affected area and it can be filled with medicated products to relieve pain and promote proper tissue healing. The dentist may also prescribe painkillers, anti-inflammatories or antibiotics depending on the signs and symptoms presented. At home, the patient must maintain proper oral hygiene, complemented by rinsing with a 0.12% Chlorhexidine-based mouthwash for the time recommended by the dentist and applying ice or cold compresses to reduce pain and discomfort.  //Prevention// Some measures, before and after surgery, can help reduce the likelihood of developing dental alveolitis.

Alzheimer,"//What is it?// Alzheimer's disease is a neurological disorder that causes progressive memory loss and cognitive decline. It is currently the most common type of dementia, accounting for 60% to 80% of cases in the United States: in 2013, 6.8 million people were diagnosed with dementia, of which five million were classified as Alzheimer's. By 2050, numbers are expected to double. Alzheimer's disease, which has an insidious onset and slow progression, first and predominantly affects episodic memory, with the patient beginning to have difficulty remembering recent fragments of their life (where they place objects, messages, what they ate the day before, what day of the month it is). //Symptoms// Memory loss is slowly joined by other characteristic symptoms: Difficulty recognizing people;/ Poorer, choppy speech looking for words;/ Orientation in spaces becomes increasingly difficult;/ Over time, the first changes in behavior also begin to appear, with visual hallucinations and delusional activity being frequent (the patient thinking they are being robbed or being chased), resulting in agitation and aggression.;/ This set of difficulties increases until it is enough for the person to no longer live independently, having to be helped with tasks previously carried out naturally, such as cooking, dressing, washing, dealing with appliances or money. //Causes// Like other types of dementia, Alzheimer's is a neurodegenerative disease, which means there is a progressive loss of brain cells over time: brain tissue has fewer and fewer nerve cells and the connections between them are lost. //Diagnosis// Neurological examination is typically normal in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, as are imaging tests which, if not also normal, show only atrophy of the hippocampus, an anatomical formations in the inner part of the cerebral hemispheres that play a fundamental role in the consolidation and recall of new memories. In more advanced stages, patients often develop signs of Parkinson's (slowness and rigidity) and tests show atrophy of the entire brain. //Treatment// There is no known cure for Alzheimer's disease, as brain cell death cannot be reversed. However, there are therapeutic interventions that improve patients' lives and make dementia easier to manage, including: the control of other concomitant pathologies;/ to occupational therapy;/ involvement in support groups and services;/ drug therapy: drugs that can reduce symptoms and help improve patients' quality of life - cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, tacrine) and memantine.;/ Supportive care in daily activities becomes more important as the person is less able to live independently. //Prevention// There are risk factors that cannot be prevented, such as aging, a family history of Alzheimer's, and genetics. However, there are some factors that can help prevent the disease: regular physical activity;/ the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases (especially blood pressure control);/ prevention and treatment of diabetes, obesity, smoking;/ In general, eating a varied, healthy diet and staying mentally and socially active can reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease.

Ambliopia,"//What is it?// Amblyopia (""lazy eye"") consists of decreased vision in one eye, or less frequently in both eyes, due to problems that interfere with normal visual development during childhood. Generally, the amblyopic eye has no apparent changes, however its vision is lower than normal. It is a situation that affects around 5% of children and although it originates in childhood, if not diagnosed and treated early, low vision remains into adulthood.  Why does it arise? The structure of the visual system is fully formed at birth. However, visual function is very poor. Its development occurs at the brain level, depending on the proper functioning of the eyes, as adequate visual stimulation is necessary for the brain to ""learn to see"". Amblyopia arises because the brain does not ""recognize"" the less clear image that is captured and sent by one of the eyes, and by ""favoring"" the other eye with better vision it can ""block"" the images sent by the worse one, making it amblyopic ( ""lazy""). The period of childhood in which vision evolves at the brain level is called the critical period. The duration of this period varies for different aspects of visual function, and can last up to approximately eight years of age. However, in cases such as some congenital cataracts, the critical period can end very early in the first months of life. Therefore, depending on the situations, there are time limits beyond which, even if these are corrected, no further improvements in vision will be achieved. //Symptoms// Family members and educators should suspect that there may be causes of amblyopia (“lazy eye”) if the child: squints his eyes to try to see better;;/ brings objects too close to the face;;/ does not adequately identify distant family members;;/ averts one eye.;/ It should be noted that a young child who has amblyopia may not reveal any symptoms. When seeing clearly from one eye, this situation may go unnoticed, only revealing itself when your vision is evaluated in a medical consultation. //Causes// The main causes are:  Refractive errors: if the child has hyperopia, astigmatism, myopia or anisometropia (“difference in graduation between the eyes”), the image that reaches the brain is not clear and it “chooses” the eye with better vision.;/ Strabismus: if the eyes are not “aligned”, the child’s brain, which has a great capacity for adaptation, suppresses (“blocks”) the image of one of the eyes to avoid “seeing double”. Over time, this leads to amblyopia in the “shifting” eye.;/ Cataracts, ptosis (“drooping eyelid”), retinal diseases: prevent the eye from “capturing” and sending a clear image to the brain;/ //Treatment// To treat amblyopia, it is essential to correct the cause. This may consist of:  Use of prescription glasses to correct refractive errors, the most common being hyperopia.;/ Occlusion: It consists of covering the dominant eye (“the eye that sees better”) with a specific bandage, for a period of time that will depend on the degree of amblyopia and the age of the child. This method, by allowing more intense stimulation of the amblyopic eye (“lazy eye”), is what offers better and faster results. There are other methods of penalizing the dominant eye, such as the use of eye drops that dilate the pupils or the prescription of glasses with a filter on the lens of the eye that “seees better.” ”, causing blurred vision and thus forcing the amblyopic eye to see.;/ Early surgery for congenital cataracts.;/ Surgery to correct eyelid ptosis.;/ //Prevention// All children should undergo an ophthalmological examination before the age of three. Early diagnosis of amblyopia and its cause is essential for appropriate treatment that can allow recovery, preventing amblyopia from persisting into adulthood. The pediatric ophthalmologist, through observation and the examinations performed during the consultation, assesses whether amblyopia is present. Even in very young or uncooperative children, it is often possible to identify risk factors for amblyopia and correct it in most cases when diagnosed early. Prolonged exposure to television, cell phone and computer screens can have negative effects on your eyes. Find out what to do to take care of your eyes. Amblyopia or ""lazy eye"" is a problem that affects children and can cause poor vision and compromise quality of life if left untreated. Do you take a break every 20 minutes from the computer? And a regular eye check-up? These are some of the bad habits that harm your vision and that you should correct.

Amigdalite,"//What is it?// Tonsillitis is a generally acute, but can also be chronic, inflammation of the palatine tonsils caused by bacteria or viruses. These, like adenoids, are lymphoid tissues that, when in good condition, help prevent infections. A sore throat (clinically known as odynophagia) is a common symptom. It can indicate an inflammatory process in the oropharynx, i.e. the tonsils or the pharynx. In the first case, we are dealing with tonsillitis. In the second, it is acute pharyngitis.  //Symptoms// Tonsillitis manifests itself through: Sore throat;/ Fever (varying degree);/ Difficulty swallowing;/ Earache (reflex);/ General malaise;/ The most common symptoms of hypertrophy of the palatine tonsils and adenoids are: Mouth breathing;/ Roncopathy;/ Breathing stops during sleep (sleep apneas);/ Swallowing difficulties;/ Nasal voice;/ //Causes// It is a generally acute, but can also be chronic, inflammation of the tonsils, caused by bacteria (usually streptococci) or viruses. //Diagnosis// When observing the mouth, redness appears in the throat with or without white spots (pus). The symptoms of tonsillitis can be common to other serious illnesses and should be observed and treated by a doctor. //Treatment// Treatment for acute tonsillitis depends on: Age, general health conditions and background;/ Extent of infection;/ Type of infection;/ Patient tolerance to medications and medical procedures;/ Evolution of infection;/ Treatment may be medical (with medication) or surgical, depending on the cause, extent, recurrence or severity of the symptoms. Antibiotics may be useful but not always necessary if the cause is a virus. Chronic tonsillitis is an inflammation characterized by tonsillar hypertrophy with marked crypts, sometimes with pus, hyperemia and a foul odor; medical therapy is generally not very effective and surgical intervention should be considered. Surgery is also indicated when there is a high number of tonsillitis cases, tonsillar hypertrophy leading to obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, suspected neoplasia or a history of complications. There are different techniques for tonsillectomy, the most common being cold dissection, electrocautery, laser, radiofrequency ablation. //Prevention// To reduce your risk of developing tonsillitis, you should: Wash your hands frequently, especially before touching your nose or mouth;/ Avoid sharing food, drinks or utensils with someone who is sick;/ Replace your toothbrush regularly;/ Cleveland Clinic Load more;/ The tonsils are part of the immune system and are the body's first line of protection.

Anafilaxia,"//What is it?// Anaphylaxis is a severe and life-threatening allergic response that can cause edema (swelling), hives, a sudden drop in blood pressure, shortness of breath, difficulty swallowing, loss of consciousness, or even death if not treated immediately. It can occur in any adult or child after being exposed to a substance to which they are allergic, so early diagnosis of allergies in childhood is important. //Symptoms// Pruritus (itching);/ Urticaria;/ Swelling of the lips, tongue, eyelids or other areas of the body;/ Cough;/ Difficulty breathing or wheezing;/ Nausea and vomiting;/ Abdominal cramps and diarrhea;/ //Causes// In children, the most common causes of anaphylaxis are related to foods, such as cow's milk, eggs, peanuts, nuts (walnuts, hazelnuts, almonds), shellfish, fish and wheat. Other possible causes include medications, such as anti-inflammatories and antibiotics, cold or insect stings (bees and wasps). //Diagnosis// If severe allergic symptoms occur, you should call the helpline or go immediately to an emergency room, where adrenaline should be administered in addition to other treatments. If a child has ever had an anaphylactic reaction, it is mandatory to inform school staff about severe allergies, so that they can help avoid them or initiate the necessary treatment. The child must be observed by an immunoallergologist to determine the exact cause of anaphylaxis and correct guidance, particularly indicating the use of devices for self-administration of adrenaline. //Treatment// In the presence of an acute anaphylactic reaction, the only effective treatment is an injection of adrenaline, which acts quickly, reversing the symptoms of anaphylaxis, and can be administered by the patient or by healthcare professionals. As this is a medical emergency, the patient must be treated immediately in the Emergency Department where life support and resuscitation care will be provided. In the hospital, in addition to adrenaline, treatment may include intravenous fluids and medications to maintain heart and circulatory system function, antihistamines and corticosteroids. //Prevention// People with allergies are most susceptible to developing anaphylaxis. However, it is not always possible to prevent it, as reactions to a previously unknown substance may occur. Once an allergic reaction has been identified, a record of the trigger should be kept to avoid it in the future (e.g., the name of the antibiotic or food). Since it is not always possible to avoid the allergen, people who have suffered an anaphylactic reaction should always carry an injection of adrenaline and an allergy identification card or bracelet. Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening emergency that requires immediate medical attention.

Anemia,"//What is it?// The World Health Organization estimates that around 25% of the world's population may have some type of anemia, although there is no concrete data on the number of cases in Portugal. Anemia is a clinical condition that results from a decrease in the number of red blood cells in the blood or the hemoglobin content in the blood to values ​​below those considered normal. There are three basic types of cells in our blood: red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. All of these cells are formed in the bone marrow, which is located inside the bones. White blood cells help fight infections and platelets are essential for clotting. Red blood cells contain hemoglobin, which transports oxygen from the lungs to the entire body and, conversely, transports carbon dioxide from the tissues to be eliminated by the lungs. In anemia, red blood cells are no longer able to deliver oxygen to the body effectively. In order for red blood cells and hemoglobin to be produced, the body needs iron, vitamin B12, folates and other nutrients that it obtains through the diet. //Symptoms// In the initial stages, anemia tends to go unnoticed, being confused with fatigue. In more advanced stages, fatigue is associated with: Generalized lack of strength;/ Pallor;/ Headaches;/ Irritability;/ Sleep changes;/ Dizziness;/ Difficulty concentrating;/ Depression;/ Low blood pressure;/ Rapid heart rate;/ Rapid breathing with a feeling of oppression;/ Fainting;/ Brittle nails;/ Loss of appetite;/ Cold extremities;/ If anemia progresses without treatment, it will tend to worsen other health problems, such as heart failure, by placing additional effort on the heart. //Causes// The causes of anemia are very variable and this disease occurs whenever the human body does not have the red blood cells necessary for its normal functioning, either due to reduced production in the bone marrow, excessive loss or destruction. Some factors that can favor the onset of anemia are:  1. Iron deficiency It is the most common cause of anemia and can result from losses due to bleeding, as occurs in gastritis associated with the use of anti-inflammatories, in stomach and duodenal ulcers or in cancerous lesions of the digestive tract. Anemia can also be a consequence of an increased need for iron, resulting, for example, from pregnancy or periods of rapid growth, such as preschool age and adolescence. An unbalanced diet low in iron is another common cause of iron deficiency, as occurs, for example, in vegetarian diets. A lack of vitamin B12 and folic acid can also cause anemia.  2. Chronic illnesses Cancer, HIV/AIDS infection, rheumatoid arthritis, kidney failure are some chronic diseases that interfere with the production of red blood cells and cause chronic anemia. If the bone marrow stops producing cells, we will also have anemia, something that can happen in lymphomas, some types of infection or after using some drugs.  3. Bowel diseases They can affect nutrient absorption, increasing the likelihood of developing anemia.  4. Intense physical activity Very intense physical activity, such as running, may be associated with anemia due to the destruction of red blood cells caused by repeated impact.  5. Heredity Some forms of anemia can be hereditary, such as sickle cell anemia (insufficient number of red blood cells capable of transporting the necessary amount of oxygen throughout the body).  6. Other factors Menstruation, pregnancy, alcoholism and the use of certain medications are other factors to consider. //Diagnosis// The diagnosis of anemia is made by combining data from medical observation with the results of laboratory tests, which include those that assess the levels and characteristics of red blood cells, hemoglobin and iron in the blood. Depending on the results of these tests, additional tests may be necessary to identify the cause of the anemia, which may affect, for example, the digestive system or kidneys, among others. Sometimes, a myelogram (bone marrow collection) is necessary to identify the cause of anemia. //Treatment// Treatment for anemia depends on its causes and involves restoring normal levels of hemoglobin and red blood cells. When blood tests confirm that anemia is caused by iron deficiency, treatment will involve administering iron supplements, either orally or by injection. The same applies to vitamin B12 deficiency, which can be corrected by administering injectable supplements. Adopting a balanced diet can, in many cases, reverse the process that caused anemia. If anemia is caused by blood loss, it is essential to identify the source of the loss and treat it. In more severe anemia, it may even be necessary to resort to blood transfusions. //Prevention// To prevent anemia, it is essential to adopt a balanced and healthy diet, including meat, fish, fruits and green leafy vegetables. Vitamin C, found in citrus fruits, kiwifruit and broccoli, also plays an important role in iron absorption. In the phases of life when there is a greater need for iron (pregnancy, breastfeeding, childhood and adolescence), dietary intake may not be sufficient and it will be important to take iron supplements, according to medical recommendations.

Aneurisma cerebral,"//What is it?// A cerebral aneurysm corresponds to an area of ​​weakness in the wall of an intracranial blood vessel that tends to dilate, becoming filled with blood. In general, aneurysms form in the area where the arteries bifurcate, as this is the most fragile area of ​​their structure. This dilation can put pressure on nerves or other adjacent brain structures. Alternatively, it can rupture, causing hemorrhage that will compress neighboring structures. When brain aneurysms are small, they rarely bleed or cause other problems. It is estimated that around 5% of the population has a cerebral aneurysm, with an annual rupture rate of around 2%. The incidence of aneurysm rupture is about 10 in every 100,000 people per year. Brain aneurysms can occur at any age, but are more common in adults (30-60 years of age) than in children and are also more common in females. //Symptoms// Most brain aneurysms are not associated with symptoms until they enlarge or rupture. Indications result from compression of adjacent structures and may include pain above and around the eyes, tingling sensations, weakness or paralysis in a on the sides of the face, dilated pupils, changes in vision, photophobia. When bleeding occurs, the main symptom is a sudden and extremely severe headache, associated with double vision, nausea, vomiting, stiff neck and loss of consciousness. Sometimes episodes of milder headaches occur in the days before the rupture. //Causes// Cerebral aneurysms can be congenital, resulting from a weakness in the arterial wall. They are more common in people with other genetic problems, such as connective tissue pathologies, polycystic kidney disease, and circulatory diseases such as arteriovenous malformations. Other possible causes include trauma, high blood pressure, infections, tumors, atherosclerosis, smoking, and alcohol and drug abuse, such as cocaine. There is no consensus on the role of oral contraceptives in the formation of aneurysms. //Diagnosis// Most brain aneurysms go unnoticed due to the absence of symptoms. They are often detected by chance after a brain scan requested for another reason. Cerebral angiography allows them to be visualized and located with high precision. Computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are very useful exams in the evaluation of these cases and can be combined with the administration of a contrast agent to obtain more detailed information. //Treatment// In the case of small cerebral aneurysms, regular monitoring is sufficient. Treatment, when necessary, should be individualized according to the type, size and location, and the clinical characteristics of the patient. Surgery: in general, surgical treatment may consist of a clipping process, which involves interrupting blood flow in the aneurysm by placing a metal clip. This procedure may or may not be accompanied by a bypass.;/ Embolization: an alternative to surgery is embolization, in which a catheter is inserted through the femoral artery and guided by angiography to the aneurysm, allowing the placement of a platinum material in the form of a spiral that will fill it, blocking circulation and triggering blood clotting.;/ Medication: anticonvulsants and painkillers may be helpful in relieving symptoms.;/ In addition to treating the brain aneurysm itself, it is important to treat other underlying medical conditions, such as high blood pressure. The main complications of a ruptured brain aneurysm are stroke, permanent brain damage or death. Hydrocephalus with cerebral compression or vasospasm phenomena in other areas of the brain with consequent reduction in blood flow may also occur. //Prevention// A brain aneurysm cannot be prevented, but once diagnosed, it is possible to interfere with its progression by controlling blood pressure, not smoking and not consuming cocaine or other stimulants. The use of aspirin or other medications that thin the blood should be assessed on a case-by-case basis, as well as the use of oral contraceptives.

Aneurisma da aorta,"//What is it?// The aorta is the largest artery in the body, being responsible for transporting oxygen from the heart to the entire body. The part of the aorta that passes through the chest is called the thoracic aorta and the part that passes through the abdomen is called the abdominal aorta. An aortic aneurysm corresponds to an abnormal enlargement of the aortic wall and can occur anywhere along its path. Depending on their shape, they can be called fusiform (more elongated) or saccular (sack-shaped, smaller than fusiform). The  abdominal aorta is the most common site of arterial aneurysm. It is defined as a focal dilation, involving all vascular layers, with a diameter greater than or equal to three centimeters. Most occur in the segment of the aorta located below the kidneys. They are four to five times more common in males and their incidence increases with age, being rare before the age of 60. Mortality associated with its rupture is around 80%. When aneurysms are detected before this catastrophic event and reveal dimensions in which surgical correction is indicated, the mortality associated with this procedure is around 5%, and, as such, it is important to consider the benefit of early detection through performing screening actions. //Symptoms// The majority remain asymptomatic until they rupture. Therefore, they are either discovered by chance during a medical consultation or in complementary diagnostic tests, or they are never detected and the patient ends up dying for any other reason, before their rupture. More rarely, they can manifest themselves in the form of chronic abdominal pain, or through thromboembolic complications, and symptomatic patients are at greater risk of rupture. When this occurs, it often manifests as lower back pain, with or without abdominal pain, hypotension and the presence of a pulsating abdominal mass. Rapid progression to shock may occur, associated with high mortality. Symptoms secondary to the rupture may simulate an acute myocardial infarction, renal colic, pancreatitis, biliary colic, among other situations. In the case of a thoracic aortic aneurysm, the most common signs are pain in the jaw, neck or chest, coughing and difficulty breathing. //Causes// Smoking, atherosclerosis, high blood pressure and a family history of abdominal aneurysm are among the main risk factors for the formation of an aneurysm. However, approximately 95% of aortic aneurysms are caused by atherosclerosis, which causes a narrowing of the aortic wall. Other associated causes are: The muscular layer of the aorta wall may present congenital weakness, which facilitates the formation of an aneurysm;;/ Arterial hypertension, by increasing the force exerted by the blood on the aortic wall, contributes to the formation of aneurysms;;/ Trauma is another possible cause.;/ //Diagnosis// Early diagnosis is very important to ensure appropriate treatment. To achieve this, there must be a high level of suspicion so that the appropriate additional tests can be selected for each situation. In this case, the symptoms may simulate very different clinical conditions and, as such, the diagnosis is more complex. For this pathology, the recommended tests are chest X-rays and ultrasound, as well as abdominal computed tomography with intravenous contrast. //Treatment// Treatment depends on the size of the aneurysm. For small, asymptomatic aneurysms, regular monitoring may be sufficient, in addition to treating all risk factors present. For larger aneurysms, it is important to assess the best treatment. Surgery is one option and may involve different techniques depending on the characteristics of the aneurysm. //Prevention// Prevention involves adopting a diet low in cholesterol and saturated fats, in order to reduce the risk of atherosclerosis. It is also important to prevent, detect and treat high blood pressure. Whenever there is a family history or risk factors, it is also important to have a periodic ultrasound scan.

Aneurisma da aorta abdominal,"//What is it?// The term aneurysm comes from Greek and means dilation and is used whenever there is an irreversible increase in the normal diameter of the arteries. It is characterized by a more or less voluminous, pulsatile swelling with expansion, that is, with a variation in diameter synchronous with the arterial pulsation. Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a relatively common disease, being called as such whenever the dilation is greater than three centimeters. It results from a structural weakness of the arterial wall, namely the tunica media, the most common cause of which is atherosclerosis. In these situations, the rule has a focal distribution, with preferential locations in the infrarenal abdominal aorta and the popliteal and subclavian arteries. It is more frequent after the age of 65, more common in males and its prevalence is higher in patients with coronary or peripheral arterial occlusive disease and in those with peripheral aneurysms. If the prevalence in the Portuguese population is similar to that in other European countries, it could be assumed that there could be around 500 new cases per year, with a tendency to increase, as a result of the progressive aging of the population. Its clinical importance essentially derives from the irreversibility of arterial dilation and its progressive nature, which can lead to rupture, a fatal situation if not treated surgically, and associated with high mortality - 80% in the best published series, which contrasts with a minimal surgical risk. (less than 4%) - when treated on a scheduled basis. //Symptoms// It is mostly asymptomatic, rarely causes pain and, in a third of cases, its first clinical manifestation may be rupture. This complication appears to be more frequently associated with aortic aneurysms larger than five centimeters in diameter. The presence of pain, spontaneous or on palpation, is an unfavorable symptom, which may be associated with its expansion and/or parietal fissure phenomena without frank rupture. Sometimes it can cause arterial embolization with acute or chronic ischemia, a consequence of the fragmentation of the intra-saccular thrombus. Early diagnosis by abdominal ultrasound is essential, in order to enable effective treatment, in the best possible clinical conditions, reducing risks and, thus, contributing to reducing mortality associated with both the pathology and its correction. //Causes// Risk factors for abdominal aortic aneurysm include: male gender, age over 60, trauma, circulatory system problems, atherosclerosis, smoking, high blood pressure and genetic predisposition. //Diagnosis// Most are diagnosed during a routine checkup or on an X-ray taken for another health problem. Once an aneurysm is suspected, the following imaging tests may be used to determine its size, location, and treatment options: Abdominal ultrasound;/ Computed tomography;/ Magnetic resonance imaging;/ Angiograma;/ //Treatment// The usual treatment is surgical and its objective is to exclude it from the circulation, ensuring its continuity through the interposition of an arterial graft. The results are good, long-lasting, with an increasingly lower surgical risk, thanks to developments in anaesthesia and post-operative intensive care. The development of new endoprostheses (name of the grafts used), which are placed by retrograde arterial catheterisation, under radiological control, and released in order to exclude the aneurysmal sac from the circulation through two small incisions in the groin, has led to the development of effective endografts, with a durability of five years compared to conventional surgery. Both traditional surgical repair and endovascular repair have advantages and disadvantages, so the therapeutic indication must be adapted to the specific clinical situation of each patient. //Prevention// Prevention of cardiovascular disease in general includes a balanced diet, rich in fruit, vegetables and whole grains and low in fat. It is essential to practice regular physical exercise and stop smoking, in addition to controlling blood pressure, cholesterol or diabetes. Speak to your attending physician and monitor your health status during your routine appointment.

Angina de peito,"//What is it?// It is the medical name for chest pain or discomfort resulting from coronary disease, in which the heart muscle does not receive the blood it needs. The cause for this reduction in flow is almost always a narrowing or blockage of one or more of the coronary arteries. It does not correspond to a disease but to a set of symptoms resulting from poor irrigation of the heart. Angina pectoris is, therefore, a cardiovascular pathology, more common in elderly people. Around 20% of men and 12% of women over the age of 65 show some signs of cardiovascular disease. In 2009, there were 23 hospitalizations in Portugal for every 100 thousand inhabitants. Angina pectoris may precede the occurrence of a myocardial infarction. In fact, around 18% of heart attacks initially manifest themselves in this way. As an expression of coronary disease, it appears more frequently in women than in men. //Symptoms// Silent episodes may occur, i.e. without any type of clinical manifestation and which are only detected on an electrocardiogram. This type is more common in the early hours of the day and is seen, among others, in diabetic patients or those with a high resistance to pain. It generally causes sensations of pressure, discomfort, tightness or even pain in the central region of the chest, although these sensations can be referred to the neck, lower jaw, shoulder, arm or back. This variety of locations makes diagnosis more difficult. Since the symptoms result from reduced blood flow to the heart, they tend to occur during exertion, such as walking on steep terrain or climbing stairs. At rest, these symptoms gradually decrease in intensity. Stress can also trigger angina attacks. Other factors include eating, exposure to cold and fever. Attacks usually last between one and five minutes and are relieved by rest or by taking nitroglycerin under the tongue. When they last only a few seconds, they do not usually correspond to angina episodes. //Causes// Atherosclerosis is one of the most common causes of narrowing of the coronary arteries. When this narrowing is at least 50%, angina pectoris occurs whenever exertion increases the oxygen needs of the heart muscle. If this narrowing is greater than 90%, angina can occur even at rest. As such, all factors that aggravate atherosclerosis increase the risk of this problem: tobacco, diabetes, high blood pressure, hypercholesterolemia or obesity. Angina pectoris can occur even without narrowing of the coronary arteries and result from their spasm, caused by various mechanisms, such as reduced magnesium levels or smoking. In the presence of severe anemia, the blood's ability to transport oxygen is compromised and can also trigger angina pectoris. Patients with congenital heart problems, such as scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus, polyarteritis nodosa, Kawasaki disease, among others, are at higher risk. //Diagnosis// The diagnosis is based on the patient's clinical history, his observation and the performance of a series of tests, among which the following stand out: electrocardiogram with exercise test, continuous recording of the electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, coronary angiography, angiography and studies with isotopes. For each case, the cardiologist will define which tests are most appropriate. //Treatment// Generally speaking, an attack of angina pectoris is relieved by rest. The use of nitrate-based medications is important because it relaxes the coronary arteries and improves blood flow to the heart. Treatment should include measures that prevent the progression of coronary artery disease or help to reverse it. As such, this treatment should focus on all the risk factors already mentioned, such as blood pressure, cholesterol and smoking, among others. In milder forms, the approach involves this control and the use of some medications. The most commonly used drugs reduce poor irrigation and improve symptoms and fall into the following categories: beta-blockers, nitrates, calcium antagonists and antiplatelet agents. The first three act on the heart and arteries; the latter aims to reduce the risk of clots forming in the artery walls. In more severe cases, hospitalization and the use of more complex therapeutic measures are necessary. In these cases, coronary bypass surgery improves circulation and blood supply to the heart muscle. Another option is coronary angioplasty, which seeks to reduce the degree of obstruction in the affected coronary arteries. //Prevention// This prevention involves controlling all the risk factors already mentioned. Healthy lifestyle practices, physical exercise, controlling weight, blood pressure and cholesterol, avoiding tobacco and alcohol consumption, and regular medical appointments are some good examples of what can and should be done to keep the heart healthy. Taking a small dose of aspirin daily can help prevent blood clots and may be recommended for people at risk of developing angina. However, its use necessarily depends on a medical recommendation, as, like any treatment, it can be associated with complications.

Angiografia,"//What is it?// Diagnostic examination designed to visualize the circulation of a specific location in the body, with the purpose of identifying potential changes or lesions that explain a clinical condition and offering potential therapeutic solutions.  Blood vessels are not visible in conventional exams and, therefore, it is necessary to administer a contrast substance or a dye that allows them to be visualized. //Advantages and benefits// In addition to allowing the evaluation of the circulation pattern of a given organ, this examination also has the advantage of being dynamic (if the images are obtained as the substance is administered, it is possible to evaluate the speed of circulation, its distribution pattern, its symmetry and all this information can be extremely relevant).  Some of the organs most frequently studied by angiography are the retina, heart and brain.  This examination can also be combined with others, such as magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography, and in this way, the images of the circulation are integrated with the images of the organ itself, allowing even more diagnostic elements to be obtained.  In some cases, the time at which the angiography is performed can be used to institute therapeutic measures, such as angioplasty (dilation of a narrowed blood vessel), removal of a clot or placement of a mesh inside the vessel to keep it open and functioning. //Methodology//  Angiography is generally performed in a hospital setting but does not require hospitalization, although in some cases it is recommended to spend a night in the hospital.  The procedure takes between 30 minutes and 2 hours and is performed under local anesthesia or sedation. In the case of children or in more complex cases, general anesthesia may be necessary.  In this method, a very thin, flexible tube is inserted into an artery, usually in the groin, and is gradually directed towards the areas to be examined. This movement is controlled by a radiologist.  Once the area to be studied is located, a contrast substance is injected and a series of radiographic images are taken.  In the case of angiography performed in Ophthalmology, the dye is introduced into a vein in the arm and injected slowly. During this injection, photographs of previously dilated eyes are taken. There is no need to use radiation here.  For each type of angiography and depending on the clinical characteristics of each patient, preparation for this examination must always be adjusted. //Indications//  In the scope of Ophthalmology, angiography allows the evaluation of diseases such as macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy.  Other diseases where angiography is important are strokes, myocardial infarctions, gangrene and organ failure. //Care to be taken//  It may be necessary to stop taking some medications before the angiography, such as aspirin or other medications that interfere with blood clotting, in order to reduce the risk of complications. This should be stopped between 72 hours before the exam and 24 hours after it.  The remaining medication can be continued.  Angiography is a safe and painless procedure, with a reduced risk of complications.  Bruising may form at the injection site and it is important to assess the likelihood of an allergic reaction to the injected substance.  More rarely, bleeding or bruising at the injection site, local infection or a mild allergic reaction may occur. These various problems are usually easily controllable and treatable.  Even more rarely, angiography may be associated with a risk of kidney injury, myocardial infarction, stroke, severe allergic reaction or death.  In any case, the benefits of angiography far outweigh its potential risks.

Anorexia nervosa,"//What is it?// Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by a distortion of body image, with an extreme fear of obesity and the inability to maintain a minimum normal weight within 15% of ideal body weight. Patients with this pathology have the perception that they are fat, when in reality they are extremely thin. To become thin, they resort to restrictive diets that result in weight loss below 85% of what would be expected, or body mass index (BMI) values ​​below 17.5 kg/m2 with an impact on the physical level, and there may be complaints of constipation, abdominal pain, amenorrhea, weakness and intolerance to cold. At a psychological level, symptoms such as sadness, low self-esteem, self-criticism, social isolation, irritability, anxiety and insomnia are common. At a behavioral level, it is quite common for there to be situations of hiding food, faking meals and a refusal or excessive concern about eating in public. Typically, these patients deny their condition, jeopardizing access to treatment. In around 95% of cases, anorexia nervosa affects females. It usually begins in adolescence, sometimes earlier, and more rarely in adulthood. It mainly affects people from middle and high socioeconomic classes. In Western society, the number of individuals with this disorder is increasing. In Portugal, a prevalence of anorexia nervosa is estimated to be in the order of 0.3% to 0.4%, with 90% occurring in females. Although this prevalence is not very high, partial forms of the disease occur in around 12.6% of adolescents, around 7% have body image disorders and 38% with normal weight report a desire to lose weight. These numbers, all referring to Portugal, deserve special attention. The disease can be mild and transient or severe and long-lasting, being fatal in 10% to 20% of cases. Anorexia nervosa is the eating disorder with the highest mortality rate, which is why early access to specialized treatment is crucial. //Symptoms// Many of the women who later develop anorexia nervosa are meticulous and compulsive, ambitious for success and professional achievement.  //Body image concerns// The first signs are a growing concern about diet and body weight, even if they are already thin, as is the case with most people with anorexia nervosa. Worry and anxiety intensify as they lose weight. Even when faced with extreme thinness, the person insists that they are obese, denies having any problems, does not complain about the lack of appetite or weight loss and, in general, resists treatment. As such, she does not go to the doctor until her family members force her to.  //Obsessive food control// Although anorexia means no appetite, people with anorexia nervosa are hungry and preoccupied with eating, studying diets and counting calories. About 50% of people with anorexia nervosa eat excessive amounts of food and then vomit or take laxatives or diuretics. The other half simply restrict the amount of food they eat. Most also exercise excessively to control their weight.  //Hormonal changes// Women stop menstruating, sometimes before they have lost much weight. A loss of sexual interest is common. There is also a slow heart rate, low blood pressure, low body temperature, swelling of the tissues due to fluid build-up, and thin, soft hair or, conversely, excessive hair growth on the face and body. Depression is common in anorexia nervosa and various types of hormonal changes occur.  //Other consequences (in case of severe malnutrition)// When malnutrition becomes severe, all major organs are affected. The most dangerous problems are those related to the heart, with sodium, potassium and chlorine. The heart becomes weak and expels less blood. The person may become dehydrated and tend to faint. The blood may acidify and blood potassium levels may fall. Vomiting and taking laxatives and diuretics tend to make the situation worse. Sudden death can occur due to the appearance of abnormal heart rhythms. //Causes// Its cause is unknown, but social pressure appears to be a decisive factor. There are also genetic indicators involved. The desire to be thin is very common in Western society and obesity is considered unattractive. Even children are aware of these attitudes and a large number of teenagers follow diets to control their weight. In fact, anorexia nervosa is related to the process of globalization and the spread of standards in modern societies regarding beauty.  //Illness// The list of diseases that can reduce appetite is vast, highlighting the following: alcoholism, hepatitis, Crohn's Addison's Disease, pneumonia, HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases, depression, anxiety, cancer, renal or heart failure, tuberculosis and ulcerative colitis.  //Medication// Several medications can cause anorexia, such as antidepressants, opiates, amphetamines, some antidiabetics, the sudden suspension of appetite-stimulating drugs and corticosteroids.  //Other factors// With regard to anorexia as a loss of appetite, its resolution and treatment are directly dependent on the cause and, as such, it will be the diagnosis and correction of the factor that caused it that will be the key to its control. //Diagnosis// There is no specific diagnosis for anorexia nervosa. It is done based on a marked weight loss and characteristic psychological symptoms. The typical patient is a teenage girl who has lost at least 15% of her body weight, fears obesity, has stopped menstruating, denies being sick, and appears healthy. //Treatment// Anorexia nervosa requires psychological and physical monitoring, carried out by endocrinologists and nutritionists. It is essential to involve the whole family in the process. It is possible to recover from this pathology. It is estimated that around half of people do it, many others have periods of recovery and relapses and a minority maintain a chronic form, but it is difficult to predict the evolution of each case. Treatment is generally carried out in two phases: the first is the restoration of normal body weight; the second is psychotherapy, often supplemented with drugs.  //Weight recovery// When weight loss has been rapid or intense (e.g. more than 25% below ideal weight) weight regain is crucial and initial treatment is usually carried out in a hospital. Rarely, the patient is fed intravenously or through a tube placed in the nose that reaches the stomach.  //Psychotherapy// When the nutritional status is acceptable, long-term treatment begins, which must be carried out by specialists in appetite changes and which may include individual, group and family psychotherapy, as well as drugs. According to several studies, the intervention Psychological treatment demonstrates effectiveness in the majority of patients who recover their symptoms in full or in part. Through psychological intervention in anorexia nervosa, the patient will seek to return to a healthy weight, reaching motivational levels that help them to cooperate in achieving healthy eating patterns and adhering to treatment. Associated with weight gain, the aim is also to modify a set of maladaptive thoughts, attitudes and emotions related to eating behavior, causing an improvement in self-esteem and self-image and an improvement in interpersonal functioning. After the patient improves, the intervention will have as its central objective the prevention of possible factors that could generate a relapse. Family support is a key factor in the effectiveness of the intervention. //Prevention// The best prevention of anorexia nervosa involves early identification of the first signs of this disorder and prompt correction. Loss of self-esteem, dissatisfaction with appearance, and changes in eating habits are reasons to address this issue. Support, attention, and dialogue are, in this case, good tools that should be explored.

Anosmia,"//What is it?// The sense of smell has a huge responsibility in the quality of life, not only in the perception of the smell of food and the environment, but also in its role in alerting to various dangers such as smoke, gas or spoiled food. Anosmia is the total or partial loss of smell, anosmia or hyposmia respectively, with potential risk to life associated with the lack of perception of dangerous situations such as a gas leak, the smell of smoke or burning, in addition to the lack of awareness of the odor of spoiled food. //Symptoms// The most obvious sign of anosmia is the loss of smell. //Causes// The most frequent ones can be grouped into: Diseases of the nasal mucosa in which anosmia results from temporary or permanent irritation or even its destruction. Examples of these situations include sinusitis, allergic or other rhinitis, the common cold or flu;;/ Obstructive diseases of the nasal cavities that group together all clinical situations that cause obstruction to the passage of air that carries odors, such as polyps, deviated septum and benign or malignant tumors;;/ Neurological injuries in which any part of the olfactory pathway, from receptors to the brain, is damaged or destroyed. This group includes Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, aging, brain tumors, traumatic brain injuries and several medications that have, as a side effect, changes in smell.;/ //Diagnosis// Consult an otorhinolaryngologist (ENT) if you notice a persistent loss of smell that cannot be attributed to a cold or allergy. The ENT specialist is essential in the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of clinical situations related to changes in smell, observing the nasal mucosa and possibly requesting additional diagnostic tests, investigating for example the existence of polyps or an infection responsible for anosmia. //Treatment// Options include medication, surgery, and any therapy needed to resolve an underlying condition. Your doctor may recommend surgery if you have nasal polyps, a deviated septum, or other structural problems. Medications, such as steroids and antihistamines, may also be prescribed to calm any inflammation resulting from an allergy or respiratory infection. //Prevention// It is important to regularly and correctly humidify the nasal passages, avoid exposure to smoke or other pollutants and only apply vasoconstrictive substances (common nose drops) on medical advice and for a short period of time.

Ansiedade,"//What is it?// Anxiety is a normal emotion, experienced by people in their daily lives, and characterized by feelings of tension, worry, insecurity, normally accompanied by physical changes such as increased blood pressure and heart rate, sweating, dry mouth, tremors and dizziness. Despite this normative character, when anxiety persists in certain contexts, negatively interferes with the ability to carry out daily activities and causes significant physical and/or emotional suffering, we are faced with an anxiety pathology. This is an important and common problem. In terms of medication, between 2004 and 2009, there was a 25.3% increase in the consumption of anxiolytics, hypnotics, sedatives and antidepressants. These data are confirmed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), where Portugal is above the average of the countries in that entity in the consumption of anxiolytics. However, there are few studies that present results relating to the Brazilian reality. Some point to rates of around 50% of primary healthcare users showing symptoms of depression/anxiety. Evidence shows a higher prevalence of depressive and anxiety disorders among women. In Portugal, there is little evidence of this trend, although some recent studies suggest that women are more susceptible to this type of disorder. Under normal conditions, anxiety can be useful, as it helps to identify dangerous situations and allows for better preparation to face them. When well controlled, it acts mainly as a stimulant. In excess, it causes unnecessary suffering. There are different forms of anxiety, each with different symptoms, the main ones being the following: obsessive compulsive disorder;/ post-traumatic stress;/ panic;/ agoraphobia, generalized, social or separation anxiety;/  //Relationship between anxiety and depression// Anxiety is part of the clinical picture of depression and is variably associated with mood changes and depressive states. It can, therefore, be stated that patients with this pathology also suffer from anxiety, more or less pronounced. Likewise, most people whose anxiety manifests itself to a high degree can progress to a depressive state. The simultaneous presence of depression and anxiety is very striking, implying a greater severity of symptoms. Studies carried out in Portugal recorded a strong correlation between depression, anxiety and stress. //Anxiety Symptoms// The most common symptoms are feelings of apprehension or worry, helplessness, fear or panic. These are often associated with physical manifestations such as increased heart rate and breathing, sweating, tremors, feelings of fatigue, among others. Different types of anxiety present specific signs: Panic attacks can begin suddenly, causing very strong physical symptoms, almost like suffocation. In agoraphobia, anxiety occurs in environments where the patient feels trapped.;/ Social phobias happen in circumstances of social or public exposure.;/ In obsessive-compulsive disorder, persistent thoughts and an uncontrollable desire to repeat, for no apparent reason and without purpose, a certain act arise.;/ In post-traumatic stress, the patient feels that he or she is reliving a traumatic experience, reporting very intense emotional and physical reactions.;/ //Causes// In some cases, anxiety may have an obvious cause. However, in others it seems to have no apparent origin. When this happens, the fact that the patient is unable to identify the cause tends to make it worse. Therefore, one of the important aspects of treatment is identifying the factors that trigger it. There is evidence that there may be a genetic basis for anxiety. The occurrence of stressful experiences and the inability to cope with them is another important issue. The consumption of alcohol, drugs, tea, coffee, tobacco and some medications can also be associated with anxiety attacks. In general, life problems usually trigger anxiety, and in acute cases, anguish. In addition, personal difficulties in integrating into society, and internal conflicts in the affective, emotional and sexual domains can lead to anxiety symptoms. Anxiety can be associated with: Specific Phobias Specific phobias are characterized by marked, irrational fear or anxiety about a specific object or context. These feared objects or contexts are usually avoided or faced with intense fear and anxiety. Among specific phobias there are some subtypes: animal (spiders, dogs, …);/ natural environment (water, storms, …);/ blood-injections (wounds, needles, …);/ situational (airplanes, elevators, closed spaces, …);/  Phobia Social Social Anxiety Disorder is characterized by persistent and excessive fear and anxiety in contexts of exposure to the scrutiny of others. In these contexts, fear of embarrassment, humiliation and rejection is common, which leads to the avoidance of social interaction situations, significant levels of suffering and a considerable impact on different areas of life.  Panic Disorder It is an anxiety disorder characterized by the unexpected onset of recurrent panic attacks and persistent concern about the possibility of subsequent panic attacks. A panic attack is an abrupt period of intense fear and discomfort that reaches its peak within minutes. Experiencing one has as its main consequence the development of maladaptive behaviors, often related to the need to avoid further episodes. Panic Disorder sometimes occurs in comorbidity with Agoraphobia (fear or exaggerated anxiety in contexts in which the person believes that escape or getting help may be impossible, very difficult or embarrassing, should a panic attack occur).  Generalized Anxiety Disorder Generalized Anxiety Disorder is characterized by persistent, excessive and disproportionate anxiety and worry about various aspects of life that are seen as difficult to control. There can be several manifestations of this type of condition: agitation and nervousness;/ easy fatigue;/ concentration difficulties;/ irritability;/ muscle tension;/ insomnia;/ //Diagnosis// Diagnosis can be quite difficult. A medical examination is essential to rule out the presence of a real physical illness that is the basis for the symptoms. Confirmation of the condition depends on the presence of the internationally defined anxiety criteria. //Treatment// We must not forget that anxiety is a universal phenomenon, which is part of life. Often, small changes in daily life or habits can reduce or even eliminate anxious reactions. It can be helpful to adopt simple daily habits that help reduce anxiety. Examples include relaxation and meditation techniques, good time management and organization, or regular and effective communication with others (both at work and at home). Getting a good night's sleep is also very important. Sometimes it may be necessary to use medications, which should always be prescribed by a doctor. This type of treatment is usually long-term and must be carefully monitored. In some cases, drug use can be complemented with psychiatric support. Self-medication should always be avoided. //Prevention// There are some strategies that can help prevent anxiety attacks and alleviate symptoms: Relaxation techniques: for example, the deep diaphragmatic breathing technique helps to reduce heart rate, blood pressure and deal with stress, allowing you to reach a calming state of relaxation. Other techniques such as guided imagery (imagining a relaxing garden or your favorite beach) are easy-to-use techniques that are within everyone's reach and contribute to stress relief.;/ Mindfulness, meditation and yoga: increase the capacity for self-control and self-knowledge, reducing stress associated with anxiety attacks and a greater capacity to appreciate what brings happiness and well-being.;/ Exercise, a healthy diet and rest: these should always be part of your daily life, but they are particularly important for those who suffer from anxiety. Exercise reduces stress-related hormones and promotes overall health and well-being. Foods containing caffeine or alcohol should be avoided in your daily diet, and foods rich in omega-3 should be preferred. Lack of rest and restful sleep also promote stress.;/ Self-knowledge - learning to identify what causes anxiety attacks is the most effective way to avoid them. Analyze your day-to-day life and record in a diary what causes you anxiety. Share your concerns with friends and family and seek help from health professionals to learn how to deal with anxiety.;/ Fernandes, C.

Apendicite,"//What is it?// Appendicitis is an inflammation of the inner lining of the appendix, a small structure located in the first part of the large intestine, on the right side of the abdomen. It is a relatively common process that is accompanied by very diverse and sometimes misleading manifestations that simulate other clinical conditions, which implies a delay in diagnosis. Appendicitis occurs most frequently between the ages of 10 and 30, with a slight predominance in males and can have a mortality rate of 0.25%. Acute appendicitis is the main cause of urgent abdominal surgery in pediatric age. If left untreated, it can be associated with several complications, such as perforation of the appendix or septicemia (generalized infection). //Symptoms// In appendicitis, the most common condition is the presence of loss of appetite, abdominal pain around the navel followed by nausea. The pain tends to move to the lower right region of the abdomen and is accompanied by vomiting. This condition is present in around 50% of cases. Diarrhea or constipation may also occur. In the initial stages, fever is not present. Symptoms usually last less than 48 hours but can be more extensive in older people or when perforation occurs. However, appendicitis can simulate other diseases such as a urinary tract infection, renal colic, gastritis or a gynecological problem. //Causes// Appendicitis is caused by obstruction of the appendix, causing inflammation, congestion, insufficient arterial blood supply with consequent necrosis and potential perforation. This obstruction may be associated with inflammatory bowel disease, infections, tuberculosis, parasites, foreign bodies, neoplasms or the formation of fecaliths (accumulation of fecal material). //Diagnosis// Diagnosis is not based solely on a sign, symptom or examination. Since appendicitis is a potentially serious disease, it is essential that this identification is correct in order to avoid unnecessary surgery and other complications. A medical examination, as always, is very important. In this case, since appendicitis can simulate several pathologies, this study is even more relevant. Blood and urine tests, an MRI, CT scan and ultrasound are often used. As some results can take time, sometimes the diagnosis requires exploratory surgery, especially in cases where there is a strong suspicion and there is a risk of perforation. //Treatment// Surgery (appendectomy) remains the only curative treatment. The ideal time for intervention depends on the stage of the disease and sometimes it may be necessary to wait. For example, if there is an abscess, it will be important to pre-treat it with intravenous antibiotics and only then proceed with the operation. //Prevention// There are studies that suggest that the risk of appendicitis is lower in countries with diets richer in fiber. One possible reason is its effect on the stool, making it softer and thus making it more difficult for the appendix to become obstructed. Fiber is found in foods such as cereals, bread, rice, pasta, root vegetables such as carrots, and fruit. Medscape Reference, October 2012 Ebell, M. H. Diagnosis of Appendicitis: Part I.

Aplicacao de plasma rico em fatores de crescimento,"//What is it?// Platelets are cells in our blood system. Growth factors are proteins contained in platelets, involved in the regulation of various organic processes, namely, inflammation, coagulation, healing, cell differentiation and proliferation. //Applications// Since these proteins regulate the above-mentioned mechanisms, their use is indicated in pathological processes in which it is necessary to stimulate the healing process, cell proliferation and regeneration, and to control the inflammatory process. They can therefore be applied in situations such as: muscle and muscle-tendon tears;/ ligament ruptures;;/ joint pathology with repetitive episodes of inflammation;;/ joint pathology with cartilaginous and osteocartilaginous defects (recent and chronic injuries-arthrosis);;/ delayed consolidation or non-consolidation of fractures.;/ //Obtaining and administering// They are obtained from a patient's own blood collection. This blood is subsequently prepared by centrifugation in order to obtain the fraction containing platelets. These are subjected to a chemical process with the aim of achieving a plasma rich in growth factors. This plasma is then administered by a simple injection into the location where the pathology to be treated is located (for example, infiltrate in the knee). This procedure can be performed on an outpatient basis or in the surgical center, as an adjuvant to the surgery performed. //Associated risks// The growth factors are obtained from the patient's own blood, so there is no risk of disease transmission through this route. The entire technique is carried out in strict compliance with aseptic measures, in order to minimize the risk of infection. //Possible complications// inflammation of the application area;/ injury to superficial vessels and nerves;/ transient infiltrated joint inflammation;/ joint infection;/ About us;/ Events;/ Clients and Companions;/ News;/ CUF Academic Center;/ Partnerships;/ Contacts;/ Frequently Asked Questions;/ Join us;/ Virtual Visit;/ English version;/ My CUF;/ Access Solutions and Health Plans;/ Facebook;/ Facebook Instagram;/ Instagram LinkedInCreated with Sketch.;/ LinkedIn Youtube;/ Youtube award4;/ award4 certification1;/ certification1 certification2;/ certification2 certification3;/ certification3 Complaints and compliments;/ Complaints and compliments Privacy and Cookies Policy;/ Terms and Conditions;/ Whistleblower Channel;/ © CUF 2024 All rights reserved Home;/ Health A-Z: Diseases, Symptoms and Treatments;/"
Apneia do sono,"//What is it?// Sleep apnea syndrome can often begin with snoring, with 90% of those who suffer from this syndrome snoring. Snoring is the result of a sound caused by the vibration of the palate and the walls of the pharynx. Snoring is not only a nuisance from a marital and social point of view, but can also be the initial phase of sleep apnea syndrome, with 90% of those who suffer from this syndrome snoring. Habitual annoying snoring is often the beginning of an illness with long-term health consequences. About 80% of people who snore have obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). This syndrome affects between 9% and 24% of the adult population, men over 40 years of age, postmenopausal women and children (2%). It is estimated that one million Portuguese people suffer from this pathology. Which is still responsible for more than 100,000 traffic accidents per year, due to patients falling asleep at the wheel. //Symptoms// Sleep apnea is a sleep-related respiratory disorder, more serious than simple snoring, and consists of the cessation of respiratory flow during sleep for more than 10 seconds and more than five times per hour due to collapse of the upper airway. Its direct consequence is a change in the sleep pattern, in which there is an inability to reach the deep phases, those that allow physical and mental rest. This way, the patient does not feel restored in the morning. You may feel drowsy during the day, whether at work, driving or doing other simple daily activities. You may also have a headache, irritability and mood changes. In the most serious situations, there may be intellectual deterioration, attention, memory and reasoning as well as sexual impotence. Incorrect oxygenation of the blood that occurs at night leads to serious problems such as increased cardiac work, high blood pressure, cardiac arrhythmias, a greater risk of acute myocardial infarction and hormonal changes. //Causes// Most people with sleep apnea syndrome have changes in the pharynx, with obstruction of the airway at some level between the epiglottis and the nasal cavities, often associated with excessive weight gain and other risk factors. Fatigue, drowsiness, decreased libido and a higher incidence of cardiovascular problems are situations frequently associated with this clinical condition. //Diagnosis// Doctors have a set of tools at their disposal to help diagnose and treat sleep apnea, such as complementary endoscopic exams, nocturnal sleep polygraphic studies and, if necessary, surgery to treat snoring. In the case of intense snoring or suspected sleep apnea, the patient should be referred to a specialist consultation, where the diagnosis is confirmed and treatment is planned. Some questions are asked about how easy it is to fall asleep in everyday situations. Through an objective examination, it is possible to identify anatomical changes and plan a treatment. When OSA is suspected, a polysomnographic sleep study should be performed, an examination that evaluates several parameters, allowing the diagnosis to be confirmed. //Treatment// There are currently a number of treatment options for sleep apnea syndrome, although the first step should always be to correct risk factors such as obesity, drinking alcohol at night, smoking, gastroesophageal reflux, taking certain medications and sleeping on your back. The most standard medical treatment involves wearing a device at night that increases pressure in the upper airways, thereby preventing apnea. This has the advantage of being effective in almost all patients, but it can be uncomfortable and must be worn permanently. Surgical treatments are diverse and must be adapted to the changes found in the patient, particularly nasal, pharyngeal and palatal, tongue and craniofacial anomalies. They have the advantage of correcting the problem without the permanent use of devices. They can be minimally invasive, such as radiofrequency or laser intervention, or, if necessary, more traditional, such as nasal, palatal and base of the tongue surgery. //Prevention// Some risk factors can be avoided, such as smoking and the use of muscle relaxant drugs, alcohol or sedatives. 80% of the population with this disease is underdiagnosed. Learn about the role of Dentistry in screening and treating sleep-disordered breathing. There are several doubts about snoring, as well as misconceptions.

Aquablacao,"//What is it?// Aquablation is the latest treatment for Benign Prostate Hyperplasia (BPH), based on a high-pressure water jet with millimeter precision. It manages to destroy the prostate tissue that compresses the urethra, completely relieving the patient's obstructive symptoms caused by BPH, preserving sexual function, namely ejaculation, as well as urinary continence.  //Advantages and Benefits// For years, to solve this problem, classical, endoscopic, laparoscopic, laser and excision surgery techniques were used, with good results. However, in all these methods, among other aspects, some form of thermal energy is used, which ends up causing changes in sexual function, in addition to the need for a few days of hospitalization.  //Methodology// The surgical procedure is controlled and performed by an ultrasound-guided robotic system - Aquabeam®. The surgeon controls the entire procedure through ultrasound and the visual image of the cystoscopy in real time, planning the treatment in a personalized way and delimiting the prostate tissue to be removed by the robot, in an automated way. The assessment of all prostate tissue to be removed is initially carried out by the surgeon. Once the information is transmitted, the removal of the prostate tissue is then carried out with the support of a robotic arm. Aquablation (Aquablation) is a quick and very safe procedure. At the end, the patient has a catheter in the bladder, which is removed the following day, and is discharged after 24 hours of hospitalization. //Indications// The ideal cases are prostates with volumes greater than 40 grams to very large volumes and with medium lobes.  //Care to be taken// It is advisable to avoid exertion in the first week after the operation. If you are taking anticoagulants, you should stop a few days before the procedure, always with the advice of your doctor. 0% incontinence and preservation of sexual function are two advantages of aquablation.

Arritmias,"//What are they?// Heart rhythm disorders (arrhythmias) occur when the heart's electrical impulses that coordinate the heartbeat are not sent properly, causing the heart to beat too fast (tachycardia), too slow (bradycardia) or irregularly. The heart is a muscular organ with four chambers designed to work continuously and efficiently throughout life. The muscular walls of each chamber contract in a precise sequence and, during each beat, expel the largest quantity of blood with the least possible effort. These contractions of the heart's muscular fibers are controlled by electrical discharges that travel through the heart following different trajectories at a specific speed. The resting heart rate is 60 to 100 beats per minute. Many young adults have lower heart rates, especially if they are in good physical condition. Variations in these frequencies are normal and can result from exercise, inactivity, pain, anxiety, among other causes. Only when the rhythm is inappropriately fast or slow, or when electrical impulses follow anomalous pathways, is the heart considered to have an abnormal rhythm (arrhythmia). Furthermore, this condition is often harmless, in the sense that everyone can experience irregular heartbeats occasionally. However, arrhythmias can be uncomfortable and sometimes life-threatening. During a change in heart rhythm, the heart may not be able to pump enough blood to the body, which can cause damage to the brain, heart, and other organs. The majority affect individuals over 60 years of age, given the presence of heart disease and other health problems that can be associated with arrhythmias. Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia and affects around 1% of people under 55 years of age. This type increases in frequency throughout life, especially between the ages of 65 and 80. Considering the high mortality rate from cerebrovascular accident (CVA) in Portugal and assuming that atrial fibrillation accounts for 15% of ischemic strokes, it is understood that it is important to control this arrhythmia as a way of preventing the occurrence of stroke. //Symptoms// Some types of arrhythmias cause few or no symptoms, but can cause problems. Others never cause any major problems, but do cause symptoms. When arrhythmias affect the heart's ability to pump blood, they can cause nausea, dizziness, and fainting. Those that cause these symptoms require immediate attention. Other possible symptoms include palpitations, chest pain, and difficulty breathing. It is important to see a doctor if these symptoms appear suddenly or occur frequently. //Causes// An arrhythmia can occur when the electrical signals that control the heartbeat are delayed or blocked or if a structure in the heart stops producing electrical signals. Each type has its own cause. Mild symptoms may arise due to excessive alcohol or tobacco consumption, stress or exercise. Hyperactivity, thyroid disease, and some medications, especially those used to treat lung disease and hypertension, can also change heart rate and rhythm. Cocaine and amphetamines, some over-the-counter medications, and caffeine may also be responsible for arrhythmias. Its most frequent cause is heart disease, especially coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, high blood pressure, valve malfunction and heart failure. Some congenital heart pathologies also cause them. Diabetes, obesity and sleep apnea may also be involved in this type of change. An electric shock can be the trigger for an arrhythmia. However, sometimes they arise without a detectable cause. //Diagnosis// Description of symptoms almost always makes it possible to make a provisional diagnosis and determine their severity. Additional tests are usually needed to determine exactly the nature of the disease. The most important are: electrocardiogram; a portable monitor (Holter) that allows recording for 24 hours; echocardiogram; invasive electrophysiological studies, in which a catheter is introduced intravenously into the heart; and coronary angiography. //Treatment// Drug administration is very useful in case of intolerable symptoms or when they pose a risk. There is no single medicine that cures all arrhythmias in everyone. Sometimes you need to try several treatments until you find one that suits you. Antiarrhythmic drugs can also produce side effects and worsen or even cause arrhythmias. Artificial pacemakers, electronic devices that act in place of a natural pacemaker, program themselves to imitate the heart's normal sequence. They are generally implanted under the skin of the chest and have cables that reach the heart. These units currently last between eight and 10 years. Sometimes, an electrical shock to the heart can stop an abnormal rhythm and restore it to normal. This is called cardioversion, electroversion, or defibrillation. Some types of arrhythmias can be corrected through surgery or other invasive procedures. For example, arrhythmias caused by coronary artery disease can be controlled through angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery. After an initial evaluation, your doctor will determine the right treatment for each patient. //Prevention// Since many arrhythmias are associated with heart disease, it is important to keep the heart healthy through a balanced diet, regular exercise, controlling blood pressure and cholesterol, not smoking and reducing alcohol and coffee consumption. Controlling anxiety and stress is also very important.
