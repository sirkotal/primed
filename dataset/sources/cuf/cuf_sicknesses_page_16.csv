Tendinitis,"//What is it?// Tendonitis is the inflammation of the tendons that move the wrist and fingers. A tendon is the dense but flexible structure through which the muscle attaches to the bone, allowing movement of the joints. When the muscle and tendon are subject to excessive stress, for example during repetitive tasks, an inflammatory process occurs in the tendon and its sheath, causing pain, which is initially associated with the execution of the task. As the activity continues, the condition worsens and the pain becomes present even at rest and can even disturb sleep. Tendinitis is one of the most common disorders among professional athletes, whatever the location, such as the thigh, knee, ankle, shoulder or wrist. In general, tendonitis results from an overload process, but the occurrence of repeated microtraumas or a single, more intense trauma can trigger the process. //Symptoms// In the initial phase, there is localized pain in the tendon involved, which is accentuated in movements against resistance, that is, in situations in which the muscle or muscles in question and their respective tendons are forced. When examined, the patient presents localized pain and limited movement. Tendonitis tends to develop in four phases, depending on the complaints presented: in the first phase, the pain appears after sporting activity; in the second, the pain appears at the beginning of the sporting activity, disappears after the warm-up period and may reappear with fatigue; in the third, the pain is constant, at rest and during exercise; in the fourth phase, the tendon ruptures. Palpation of the tendon causes pain, making it thicker and losing its clear outline. The lack of effective treatment determines the evolution of tendonitis and leads to chronicity and subsequent rupture of the tendon. //Causes// Hypermusculation is one of the most common risk factors. Tendons are solid, elastic and resistant structures. Their resistance is generally equal to the initial strength of the muscle multiplied by four; however, when weight training is performed, muscle strength can increase two or three times, thus reducing the tendon's safety margin, giving rise to inflammation as the first response and, if the situation persists, rupture. Chronic infectious foci, such as active cavities or tonsillitis that have not healed properly, are another risk factor. The bloodstream, when passing through a source of infection, collects and transports the toxins created and deposits them in an already inflamed area, facilitating the progression to chronic tendonitis. A diet rich in animal proteins causes an increase in uric acid and purines, which are not always completely eliminated in the urine. The excess can be deposited in overloaded areas, crystallizing and causing tendonitis. Most cases result from prolonged overuse with tendon deterioration but no associated inflammation, which is why some physicians prefer the term “tendinopathy.” This distinction is important because tendon inflammation (tendinitis) is treated differently than tendon deterioration (tendinopathy). Tendinitis generally responds quickly to treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs, whereas tendinopathies require longer-term treatment focused on improving tendon strength and rebuilding the surrounding tissue. The most common causes of tendinitis in an athlete are acute trauma in which a tendon is forced beyond its normal range of motion, causing pain, swelling and inflammation. For tendinopathies, the most common cause is chronic overuse with repeated strain and trauma to soft tissues without sufficient time for adequate healing. Tendon injuries are common in athletes who are just starting their activity and who overexert themselves without adequate rest. As such, it is important to start sports slowly and increase the intensity of your training gradually. Warming up is essential and should never be neglected. Another possible cause is the use of incorrect sports techniques or the use of inappropriate training material. //Diagnosis// The diagnosis of tendonitis is based on the athlete's complaints and changes found in the physical examination, complementary diagnostic methods, such as simple radiography and, mainly, Magnetic Resonance Imaging. This exam radically changed the evaluation of patients with sports injuries, with rare situations in which the doctor, after an initial assessment, can dispense, initially and during recovery, with the information that MRI offers. Ultrasonography allows you to study the path of the tendon and evaluate the accumulation of fluid, an indirect sign of tendon injury. //Treatment// Treatment for tendonitis is usually non-surgical, focusing on identifying the cause of the injury in order to prevent it, if possible, with rest, ice and anti-inflammatories. Physiotherapy plays a fundamental role. As a rule, the absence of physical activity is not prolonged. When a tendon injury occurs, it is important to stop activity and rest. Rest, associated with the use of ice, compression maneuvers and elevation of the affected limb allow for a reduction in inflammation and pain, allowing recovery from tendinitis in a few days or weeks. Tendinopathies take between two and six months to recover. If you don't stop the activity that caused the problem, tendinopathy will tend to become chronic. Whenever pain persists for more than a few days, despite the aforementioned treatment measures, it is important to consult a doctor so that the affected tendon can be rehabilitated. Physiotherapy uses techniques such as ultrasound, massage and strength and flexibility exercises to restore the tendon to its initial characteristics. The use of infiltrations with platelet concentrates (Growth Factors) around the tendon can accelerate its regeneration. Surgery should not be performed before three months of medical treatment and physiotherapy. When necessary, athenosynovitis is the surgical procedure in which inflammatory tissues of the hand and wrist that do not respond to medical treatment are removed. //Prevention// The prevention of tendonitis should follow the following strategies: Avoid excessive efforts and inadequate load for prolonged periods;/ Vary your exercises to avoid repeated muscle pain.;/ Practice warming up and stretching beforehand;/ Use appropriate equipment;/ American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 2013 Jeffrey R.

Rotator cuff tendonitis,"//What is it?// The rotator cuff corresponds to a set of four tendons, which covers the head of the humerus, and together with the deltoid muscle, controls the rotation and elevation movements of the shoulder. Rotator cuff tendinitis corresponds to inflammation of these tendons, and is the most common cause of shoulder pain. It can be seen in conjunction with bursitis (inflammation of the lubrication pocket between the rotator cuff tendons and the scapula) and/or calcification of the tendons (calcifying tendonitis). It is often associated with repeated overhead movements of a professional, sporting or recreational nature. //Symptoms// Shoulder cuff tendonitis is associated with pain, typically at night, in the upper and anterior part of the shoulder, which may radiate to the arm. Symptoms are often aggravated by the need to perform movements with the arms above the head or by placing the arms posteriorly in relation to the body (such as when putting on a seatbelt or fastening a bra). //Diagnosis// Clinical suspicion of the diagnosis is confirmed by physical examination, through provocative tests or resistance tests. X-rays allow the assessment of the condition of the joint and identification of calcium deposits. Ultrasound and/or Magnetic Resonance Imaging are necessary to characterize the inflammation and exclude tendon rupture. //Treatment// Treatment is carried out by modifying activities that are associated with increased pain in the patient, prescribing anti-inflammatories and complementing this with physiotherapy programs. In cases refractory to treatment, and in a selected manner, infiltrations with corticosteroids or growth factors may be used as a complement. The duration of treatment will be shorter and its effectiveness greater the sooner the patient begins medical treatment. Surgical treatment, performed through shoulder arthroscopy, should only be used exceptionally in individuals in whom previous therapeutic measures have failed.

Achilles tendinopathy,"//What is it?// The Achilles tendon is the strongest tendon in the human body, capable of supporting up to 12.5 times the body weight. It is located at the back of the ankle and connects the calf muscles to the heel bone. When the calf muscles contract, they cause the Achilles tendon to pull the foot downward. Therefore, the muscle and tendon “work” every time you take a step to propel your body upward and forward. This tendon is mainly composed of collagen fibers, with a more vulnerable area located between 2 and 6 cm in the heel, concentrating stress in this area, and this being the most frequent site of rupture. In the region where it inserts into the heel, this tendon is protected by a bursa (cushion) between the bone and the calcaneus and is also covered by a structure that nourishes the tendon (paratenon). Achilles tendon injuries occur more frequently in men, mainly in the 30-50 age group, in those who practice regular physical exercise, mainly related to sudden changes in speed, but also in occasional athletes and in people without any sporting activity. In approximately 25% of cases, the initial diagnosis is not obtained and, when there is an injury on one side, the chance of injury on the other side is 20% to 30%. Achilles tendinopathy can occur outside the insertion zone, in the middle region of the tendon, or at the insertion zone of the tendon in the heel. //Symptoms// This injury is manifested by pain when palpating or touching the tendon. This pain appears gradually over days or months and worsens during physical activity, improving with rest. The pain is more intense in activities such as climbing stairs or inclined ramps or when increasing speed while running. There may be a crepitus in the tendon when the foot moves and a feeling of stiffness when taking the first steps in the morning (e.g. when getting out of bed) or after periods of rest. Sometimes swelling is visible in the tendon area. A thickening of the tendon or the presence of a bone spur may be noticeable. In general, ankle mobility is limited, especially in flexion movements. Prolonged tendinopathy can weaken the tendon, increasing the risk of rupture, which is associated with an audible clicking sound and often requires surgery. //Causes// This injury usually does not result from a specific trauma but rather from repeated stress placed on the tendon, which happens when the body's resistance limits are exceeded or when there is a sudden increase in training intensity. The most common causes for this injury are changes in the position of the foot, such as the lowering of the inner region of the foot during gait or walking, which increases the demand on the Achilles tendon; muscle shortening in the calves, which results in a decrease in the foot's ability to move; the use of inappropriate or uncomfortable footwear for sports; sudden changes in training routines or sporting activity, with exercises that place a lot of tension on the tendon, such as explosive running or repetitive jumping. The presence of bone spurs, which correspond to an excessive growth of bone at the site of the Achilles tendon insertion, can cause friction on the tendon and damage it. As we age, the structure of this tendon weakens, increasing the risk of injury. As already mentioned, middle-aged men are more susceptible to this injury. The presence of “flat feet” or obesity increases the tension on the Achilles tendon. Diabetes, high blood pressure and the use of antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones are also risk factors for this type of injury. //Diagnosis// In addition to the clinical examination, radiography allows the identification of tendon calcifications or changes in adjacent bones. MRI is not essential but is useful in planning surgery. Ultrasound can also be important in evaluating soft tissues. //Treatment// In the early stages, ice is helpful. Generally, ice should be applied for 20-minute periods. Anti-inflammatory medications can help control pain and swelling. Corticosteroid injections into the tendon are rarely indicated because they increase the risk of rupture. In some cases, it may be advisable to place a device inside the shoe to raise the heel, reducing tension on the tendon. This option may be suitable in the initial stages, but it is not a long-term solution. Rest is essential and all activities that put strain on the tendon should be avoided. Low-impact sports such as cycling or swimming are possible and allow you to maintain physical activity. There are specific exercises that help strengthen the calves and reduce tension on the Achilles tendon and will be prescribed whenever the doctor deems them appropriate. Even if treatment is started early, pain may last for 3 months or more. If treatment is started later, results may not appear until 6 months later. Physiotherapy is an integral part of treatment, as is the use of appropriate footwear that reduces the strain on the tendon. If these measures are not effective or if the pain does not improve after 6 months, surgery may be indicated. The type of surgery will depend on the location of the injury and its severity. Complications are rare. In general, recovery is good, with physiotherapy being important in the following months. //Prevention// It is possible to reduce the risk of this injury occurring by taking the following measures: Gradual start of any physical activity, with progressive increase in the duration and intensity of the training Activities that put a lot of strain on the tendons, such as running on an incline, should be avoided. Whenever pain occurs, immediately stop the activity that caused the pain. Wear appropriate footwear for each sport and foot shape. Perform daily Achilles tendon stretching exercises, in the morning and before and after physical activity. Maintaining adequate levels of calf muscle strength helps the Achilles tendon better withstand the stress associated with exercise. It is useful to carry out different activities, alternating high-impact sports such as running and jumping with reduced-impact activities such as cycling and swimming.

Quadricipital tendinopathy,"//What is it?// Quadriceps tendinopathy is characterized by injury and inflammation of the quadriceps tendon at its insertion into the knee, causing pain in the upper region of the knee. This muscle extends from the pelvic region and femur to the kneecap and is responsible for extending the leg and controlling flexion during weight-bearing activities such as lifting a weight. It is particularly active in sprinting or in activities involving jumping or kicking. During quadriceps contraction, tension is exerted on the tendon and if this tension is excessive, through repeated or excessive activities, tendon injury occurs and inflammation ensues. Although it can occur at any age, it is more common in older athletes. //Symptoms// This injury manifests itself as pain that gradually develops in the front of the knee, above the kneecap. In less severe cases, there may be only discomfort or stiffness in the knee that increases with rest after activities that require repeated contractions of the quadriceps muscle. Sometimes there is a burning or hot sensation. In some cases, this pain may improve with activity in the early stages of the injury. Swelling may be visible in the knee and there may be a feeling of weakness when trying to run or do leg curls. Knee stiffness is common when a patient first gets up in the morning or after a long period of inactivity, and also during and after exercise. //Causes// This injury most often occurs following prolonged or repetitive activities that place strain on the tendon and in sports that involve frequent acceleration and deceleration or repeated jumping, such as basketball. Other sports involved are football, volleyball and running sports. Quadriceps tendinopathy can occur at any age. A fall or a direct blow can generate a very intense force that the quadriceps tendon cannot withstand. There are other factors that increase the predisposition to this injury: joint stiffness, very contracted muscles, inadequate or excessive training, incomplete warm-up, muscular weakness of the quadriceps and glutes, instability of the pelvic region, inadequate posture and incorrect footwear. //Diagnosis// As usual, the diagnosis is based on a medical examination and tests such as ultrasound, radiography and magnetic resonance imaging. //Treatment// Most cases respond well to physical therapy. It is essential to stop activities that increase pain until it disappears. Activities such as running (especially on inclined or uneven surfaces), jumping or kicking should be minimized. This rest provides an opportunity for tissue healing and regeneration. After symptoms disappear, these activities can be gradually resumed. If symptoms are ignored, it may develop into a chronic injury, with slower healing, longer disability and a greater risk of relapse. This chronic process is called tendinosis, in which there is no inflammation but rather degeneration and/or formation of scar tissue. These chronic processes are more common in athletes aged between 30 and 50 years. The “rest, ice, compression and elevation” regimen is beneficial in the first 72 hours, when there are still signs of inflammation. Anti-inflammatories are equally important at this stage. Ice should not be applied for consecutive periods longer than 20 minutes, so as not to induce reflex vasodilation. In chronic forms, with tendinosis, heat can be useful to stimulate blood circulation and accelerate healing. Physiotherapy, with massage or other techniques, speeds recovery and improves muscle flexibility and function in these cases. In the final stages of this process, a program will be implemented to return to previous activity levels. With proper treatment, mild cases can recover fully within a few weeks. In more severe cases, recovery can take months. Surgery is rarely necessary and is indicated when other treatments fail. Surgery allows damaged tissue to be removed and the tendon to be repaired. When performed using the arthroscopy technique, recovery is quick. After surgery, an appropriate rehabilitation program will be implemented. //Prevention// Preventing injuries to this tendon involves avoiding running on very hard surfaces, avoiding climbing or jumping, stretching your knees before and after exercise, as well as adequately warming up before exercising.

tendinous,"//What is it?// Tendinosis is a degenerative process of the collagen in a tendon as a response to chronic overuse. When this overuse is sustained without giving the tendon time to rest and heal, tendinosis occurs. Even small movements, such as clicking a computer mouse, can cause tendinosis if performed repeatedly. In sports, tendons can suffer different types of injuries, such as traumatic ruptures, indirect trauma related to vascularization, associated inflammatory disease and age or microtraumatic overload injuries. In fact, tendinopathies are very common and are one of the most reported injuries both in the workplace and in sports. //Symptoms// In fact, tendinopathy translates into the presence of pain, sensitivity to touch, swelling and limited movement in the affected region. Often, a tendon injury initially presents an inflammation component that is followed by the degeneration process. As such, the two entities may, in some cases, be interconnected.  //Causes// Tendinosis can result from long hours of activities, such as sports, using computers or musical instruments, or other manual activities. There are several risk factors for tendon injuries, such as alignment deficiencies, differences in limb lengths, muscle imbalances, hypermobility or muscle stiffness, training errors, both in intensity and technique, fatigue, the surface and the type of footwear and equipment.  //Treatment// For tendinosis, treatment started at an early stage allows recovery in 6 to 10 weeks. In the chronic phase, treatment can last from 3 to 9 months. Some studies suggest that tendons take about 100 days to produce new collagen, so shorter treatments will not be effective. Treatment for tendinosis includes rest, adjustments to posture at work and during sports, use of appropriate support for the affected tendon, continued movement of the involved muscle, combined with stretching to prevent muscle retraction and stimulate healing, use of ice for 15-20 minutes several times a day with intervals of at least 45 minutes, stretching exercises performed slowly to stimulate collagen production, and massage sessions to stimulate circulation and cellular activity. Correct nutrition, including vitamin C, manganese and zinc, is important for collagen production. Vitamin B6 and vitamin E also contribute to tendon health. Anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroid injections can accelerate the degenerative process and make the tendon more susceptible to new injuries, with a higher risk of rupture and, as such, should not be used to treat tendinosis. Surgery should be used as a last resort, to remove affected tissue in the case of tendinosis. However, it does not stimulate collagen synthesis and its success rate varies between 75% and 85%. //Prevention// Since tendinosis causes changes in tissues that make them more susceptible to further injury, it is important to pay special attention to the affected tendon even after treatment is complete. Massages, stretching and proper warming up before training are examples of useful strategies for preventing new injuries and maintaining healthy tissues.

De Quervain's tenosynovite,"//What is it?// De Quervain's tenosynovitis is an inflammation of the tendons that pass from the wrist to the thumb, associated with inflammation of the protective sheath that covers this tendon. In this case, the inflamed tendons serve to extend the thumb and pass through a tunnel (1st extensor compartment) which, if occupied by inflammatory tissue, causes pain when the finger is moved. In most cases the cause is unknown and can affect people of all ages. It is common for women to experience it in the 4th to 6th week after giving birth, probably due to hormonal changes or fluid retention during pregnancy. This disease is the most common overuse disorder and involves the wrist joint. It is very common in people who use their hand with a firm grip associated with a deviation of the wrist to the side of the ulna bone, as in tennis. //Symptoms// Pain in the wrist when moving the hand and thumb, especially when squeezing or twisting the hand forcefully. A painful swelling may form on the radial edge of the wrist (thumb side). Thumb and wrist movements that involve holding something become difficult and painful. When you try to move your thumb, there is a sensation of intermittent, “shooting” movement. If the condition is not treated, the pain can progress to the rest of the thumb and forearm and there may be progressive limitation of movement due to the inability of the tendons to slide in the tunnel. //Causes// As mentioned, repeated use of the wrist is the most common cause of this clinical condition. Every time you hold something in your hand, two tendons in your wrist and thumb are used. These tendons usually slide through a small tunnel. If a movement is repeated several times a day, the sheath surrounding these tendons can become irritated, causing a thickening that restricts movement. Activities such as gardening and racquet sports may be behind them and tend to aggravate this condition. Canoeing, golf and bowling can also cause this injury. Other possible causes are a direct injury to the wrist or tendon with formation of scar tissue that prevents movement of the tendons or the presence of an inflammatory arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis. It is more common between 30 and 50 years of age, more common in females and can be associated with pregnancy. The very act of holding the baby several times a day can cause this condition. //Diagnosis// The diagnosis is clinical, that is, based on the symptoms and clinical examination of the patient and can be confirmed with ultrasound. Diagnosis is based on a medical examination, and there are specific maneuvers that guide the diagnosis. As a rule, imaging studies are not necessary to diagnose this condition. //Treatment// Initial treatment consists of using a splint to prevent movement of the thumb and anti-inflammatories. Your doctor may suggest infiltrating the tunnel with corticosteroids, which may improve the condition. The surgery, which consists of opening the tunnel (1st extensor compartment) to release the tendons, has excellent results. Treatment is generally successful when started early, although the pain may return if the activity that caused the condition cannot be stopped. If treatment is started early, improvement can be expected within 4 to 6 weeks. If this disorder appears during pregnancy, it will tend to improve towards the end of pregnancy or breastfeeding. The use of anti-inflammatories and ice allows adequate control of pain and swelling. In some cases, corticosteroid injections into the tendon sheath may be necessary. When treatment is started within the first six months, most people improve with these injections, and often only one injection is needed. Immobilizing the thumb and wrist allows for better recovery. In more severe cases, surgery may be necessary. This allows the sheath to be opened, relieving pressure on the tendon. Physiotherapy will allow you to recover strength and mobility in your wrist joint. //Prevention// It is important to avoid repetitive movements and modify gestures to reduce pressure on the wrist. Breaks should be taken throughout a repetitive activity.

Stenosing tenosynovitis,"//What is it?// Stenosing tenosynovitis involves the tendons and pulleys of the flexor tendons of the fingers. The tendons work like long ropes from the muscles in the forearm and passing through a tunnel, with a bone base and a roof of fibrous tissue, until they reach the fingers. Inside the tunnel, the tendons are wrapped in a film that allows them to slide easily inside the sheath and pulleys. More common in adults and diabetics, stenosing tenosynovitis - commonly known as spring finger or trigger finger - occurs when the tendon develops a nodule or edema of the surrounding layer. When the tendon swells, it increases in volume, and has to rub against the entrance of the tunnel (flexor tendon sheath), which causes pain, snapping and a feeling of being trapped in the finger. When the tendon rubs against the sheath, more inflammation and more edema occur. This causes a vicious cycle between the trigger, inflammation and edema, which in some cases leads to a blockage, making it impossible to bend or straighten the affected finger. //Symptoms// Trigger finger may begin as mild discomfort felt at the base of the finger. A thickening may be felt in this area. When the finger starts to become blocked and cause snapping or triggering, the problem may appear in the interphalangeal joint next to the finger. At the beginning of the disease, snapping is sporadic, becoming increasingly frequent as the inflammation of the tendon progresses, which can cause a blockage in the ability to stretch it. //Causes// The causes of trigger finger are not fully understood. Trauma to the palm of the hand can cause irritation of the flexor tendons. Some diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, gout and diabetes are associated with the appearance of trigger finger. //Diagnosis// Diagnosis is made by taking the patient's history and examining the hand. Normally this disease causes pain in the palm of the hand or at the base of the thumb as well as the finger sticking out or the finger being trapped in a bent position. //Treatment// The goal of trigger finger treatment is to eliminate the snapping or entrapment and allow full movement of the finger without pain or discomfort. Swelling around the flexor tendon and sheath should be reduced to allow the tendon to glide smoothly. Using a splint or taking oral or injected anti-inflammatory drugs around the tendon may be indicated to reduce swelling. Treatment may also involve changing activities to reduce direct trauma. Surgical treatment is recommended in more advanced disease or in the failure of previous treatments and consists of sectioning part of the affected tendon sheath and releasing the tendon adhesions. Active mobilization of the finger generally begins in the immediate postoperative period and normal use of the finger may resume as soon as the absence of complaints permits. //Prevention// Most of the measures to prevent stenosing tenosynovitis are common good practices: Avoid repetitive movements, particularly with your fingers, hands and arms. When these are unavoidable, you should take regular breaks.;/ Do exercises appropriate to strengthen the affected area;/ Before practicing sports, always warm up;/ Have a correct working position and an ergonomic chair;/ Tenosynovitis Load more;/ Rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, spondyloarthropathies...

Stye,"//What is it?// The eyelids play a very important role in protecting the eye, acting as a mechanical barrier against external aggressions and being responsible for the secretion of tears, which have essential functions in lubricating, disinfecting and protecting the eyes. They are made up of several glands that produce the mucous and fatty components of tears. Sometimes, these glands can become inflamed. A stye corresponds to a palpable, painful, reddish abscess that occurs acutely on one of the eyelids as a result of infection of one or more glands that are located on its edge or in its thickness. The most frequently involved microorganism is a bacterium of the genus Staphylococcus. Depending on their location and the glands involved, styes can be classified as external, which is more common, or internal. Sties are quite common in the general population, especially in patients with chronic blepharitis. Relapses are equally frequent, especially if there is simultaneously untreated conjunctivitis or blepharitis. //Symptoms// The external stye initially appears with complaints of pain, redness and sensitivity on the eyelid margin, followed by the formation of a small rounded mass. The patient may report tearing, photophobia and foreign body sensation. The eyelid tends to be swollen, either localized or more diffuse. Over time, a yellow dot appears in the center of the small mass. In general, styes drain spontaneously after three to four days, with pus discharge and pain relief. The internal one also causes pain, redness and swelling that tend to be more localized. On the inside of the eyelid it is possible to see a small elevation or a yellowish area that can develop into an abscess. If it is large, it may interfere with vision. //Causes// It results from a bacterial infection. As such, poor eye hygiene coupled with poor hand washing allows the transfer of bacteria. Chronic inflammation of the eyelids (chronic blepharitis) is an important risk factor, as are seborrheic dermatitis and rosacea. Other causes are lack of care when wearing contact lenses, not removing makeup at bedtime and using old or expired cosmetics. //Diagnosis// The diagnosis of a stye is clinical and is carried out by an ophthalmologist during a consultation. //Treatment// It is important to emphasize that you should never squeeze a stye. This maneuver can worsen the situation by allowing the infected material to spread. It is recommended to apply warm compresses for 10 to 15 minutes, two to four times a day, in order to liquefy the secretions and facilitate drainage through the gland opening. In some cases, it may be necessary to use an antibiotic ointment. In more resistant cases, a small incision is made to drain the stye. In internal forms, the infection is deeper and, therefore, the local application of antibiotics must be complemented with the same medication orally. //Prevention// Preventing styes involves good hand hygiene, the appropriate use of contact lenses and cosmetics, and the treatment of chronic inflammation of the eyelids. Manual Merck Online, 2014 Drug Information Center, Technical Data Sheet, 64 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, June 2012 Myopia, astigmatism and hyperopia often lead to the use of glasses or contact lenses.

Percutaneous thermoablation of thyroid nodules,"//What is a Thyroid Nodule?// Thyroid nodular pathology is extremely common in the world population, estimated to be present in approximately 75% of the adult population, and is more prevalent in women. Approximately 5% of nodules grow so significantly that they are detected by palpation.  //How is the diagnosis made?// Ultrasound evaluation determines which nodules require biopsy based on risk stratification and size, with less than 5% being malignant. The vast majority of nodules are benign and do not cause symptoms. However, there is a significant number of nodules that, due to their location and/or growth, cause symptoms, whether compressive (especially difficulty swallowing, foreign body sensation and hoarseness) or aesthetic (“lump in the neck”).  //What treatments are there?// Conventional Treatment In the case of symptomatic benign nodules, the conventional treatment is surgery (total thyroidectomy or hemithyroidectomy). With the development of surgical techniques, these procedures have become less invasive, however they require hospitalization, general anesthesia, are not free of complications, leave scars and in most cases require the patient to take medication to replace thyroid function.  Percutaneous Thermoablation A minimally invasive technique, Percutaneous Thermoablation, was developed to treat these nodules. In this treatment, using ultrasound control, a thermoablation antenna (“special needle”) is placed through the skin, which will treat the lesion using thermal methods such as microwaves (“burn” the lesion), resulting in a significant reduction in its volume. . With the use of Thermoablation, a reduction in volume of more than 50% is expected up to 6 months and can even be close to 80% at 12-24 months.  This is an outpatient procedure that takes approximately 30 minutes. There is no need for general anesthesia, leaving the person awake, but medication is provided so that it is practically painless. Approximately 1 hour after the procedure, the patient can be discharged home, without significant restrictions, and can return to active life the following day.  //What are the main advantages of Percutaneous Thermoablation?// The main advantages are: Improves, or completely resolves, aesthetic and compressive symptoms;/ Does not cause hypothyroidism (does not require subsequent medication);/ Does not leave a valuable scar;/ Technique performed on an outpatient basis (without hospitalization) with local anesthesia;/ Discharge home shortly after the procedure; you can resume your normal life after the intervention.;/ Complication rates much lower than those of surgery.;/  //Criteria for treatment with Percutaneous Thermoablation// Single or dominant benign nodule causing aesthetic symptoms (externally visible or palpable nodule);/ Single or dominant benign nodule causing compressive symptoms (difficulty swallowing, change in voice, or foreign body sensation);/ Benign nodule proven to be progressively growing (avoiding future symptoms);/  //Where can I carry out this procedure within the CUF network?// This procedure is available at CUF Tejo, Porto, Santarém and Trindade Hospitals. If you have doubts about this procedure or think that your case is suitable for this treatment, you can speak to your doctor or, alternatively, schedule an Interventional Radiology consultation at the Hospitals in the CUF network that perform this technique.

Thyroid and adrenal glands,"//What is the pituitary gland?// The hypophysis (also known as the pituitary gland) can be considered the “mother gland” of the endocrine system as its function is to control the functioning of the other endocrine glands. It is located in a bony recess called the sella turcica, located behind and above the nasal pyramid, at the base of the brain. It produces several hormones, namely: growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), thyroid stimulator (TSH), corticotropin (ACTH), gonad stimulators (LH and FSH), melanocyte stimulator (MSH), antidiuretic (ADH) and oxytocin. There are several causes that can lead to pituitary gland malfunction, such as: traumas;/ infectious, infiltrative, tumoral diseases;/ birth defects;/ This malfunction can manifest itself in the form of both a deficiency and an excess of certain hormones, resulting in various pathologies. //Thyroid// The thyroid is a gland located at the base of the neck, just below the Adam's apple. It is shaped like a butterfly and consists of two lobes - right and left - joined by a central portion called the isthmus. Each lobe is about four centimeters long and one to two centimeters wide. Its function is to produce, store and release into the bloodstream thyroid hormones – triiodothyronine (T3) and tetraiodothyronine (thyroxine or T4) – which are essential for life: they contribute to the regulation of body temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, intestinal function, weight control, cholesterol levels, muscle strength, memory, mood states, among others. If the thyroid produces too little hormone, the body reduces its activity (hypothyroidism). If it produces too much, its activity increases (hyperthyroidism). Thyroid diseases include pathologies as common as nodules (3% to 7% of the adult population), hypo- and hyperthyroidism (2% to 4% of the adult population) and also subclinical dysfunctions, which have a prevalence greater than 10% in adults over 50 years. In Portugal, one in 10 individuals has thyroid disease. The current surgical indication for these benign disorders is reinforced by their aesthetic importance, as they mostly affect young women. Most malignant thyroid neoplasms, despite having a longer survival rate than most cancers (around 80% at 20 years), are emotionally burdensome and require a specific and rapid approach.  //Thyroid and pregnancy// Thyroid diseases are more common in women of childbearing age, which is why thyroid dysfunction is common during pregnancy and, if not identified and treated, puts maternal and fetal health at risk. Pregnancy is associated with adaptive and reversible changes in thyroid function, which can generate doubts in the interpretation of laboratory tests. Universal screening for all pregnant women is still controversial, but there is consensus to do so when there is: History of thyroid dysfunction, prior cervical surgery or irradiation;/ Elevated anti-thyroid antibodies;/ Type 1 diabetes mellitus or other autoimmune diseases;/ History of miscarriage or premature birth;/ Treatment with amiodorone, lithium or recent iodinated contrast administration;/ Infertility;/ Staying in an area with iodine deficiency;/ There must be joint work between the Endocrinology and Obstetrics departments so that all pregnant women with this pathology receive differentiated and priority care.  //What is parathyroid?// The parathyroid glands are four or more glands located on the posterior surface of the thyroid. They secrete parathyroid hormone (PTH), the main hormone in the regulation of calcium in the blood. Sometimes, ectopic and even intrathyroid parathyroid glands occur. The main function of the parathyroid glands is to maintain calcium levels at appropriate levels for the normal functioning of the nervous and muscular systems. //Adrenal glands// The adrenal glands are two endocrine glands surrounded by a fibrous capsule, located above the kidneys. They are responsible for: release of hormones in response to stress (cortisol, adrenaline and noradrenaline);/ metabolism of proteins, fats and glucose (cortisol);/ androgen production;/ kidney function and regulation of plasma electrolytes (through aldosterone secretion);/ The release of ACTH (corticotropin) by the adenohypophysis stimulates the secretion of cortisol. Aldosterone is stimulated by the levels of angiotensin II and potassium in the blood. The most frequently treated cases are adrenal nodules, but there are also rare pathologies such as Addison's disease and congenital adrenal hyperplasia, among others. Did you know that one in ten Portuguese people may have thyroid disease? Inês Sapinho, endocrinologist, and Maria Olímpia Cid, general surgeon, talk about treatments. Hypoparathyroidism is a rare condition that results from a lack of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and is manifested by low levels of calcium in the blood. They affect around 10% of Portuguese people and, worldwide, 300 million people. We are talking about thyroid diseases, which can have the most diverse manifestations.

Dizziness,"//What are they?// This is a term used to describe various symptoms, including weakness, imbalance, dizziness, dizziness or a feeling of fainting. In the case of vertigo, the patient may feel that they or the environment they are in is spinning or moving. Dizziness is one of the most common reasons for a doctor's visit, although it rarely reflects a serious illness. //Symptoms// Its most common manifestations are a false sensation of movement or rotation (vertigo), the perception of fainting, loss of balance or instability, a heavy head or a floating state. These symptoms can be caused by multiple medical conditions that interfere with signals coming from the brain. Dizziness increases the risk of falls and accidents that can be fatal. On the other hand, if the underlying disease is not properly treated and diagnosed, other complications may occur in the long term. //Causes// The sensations associated with dizziness, the identification of the factors that trigger it and its duration provide some clues about its possible causes. Vertigo results from a sudden or temporary change in the activity of structures located in the inner ear or brain. These mechanisms detect movements and changes in head position. If the patient is sitting or walking, the vertigo tends to worsen. When they are accentuated, they can be associated with nausea, vomiting and imbalance. The most common causes are inflammation of the inner ear, Ménière's disease, migraine, acoustic nerve tumors or, more rarely, a stroke, cerebral hemorrhage or multiple sclerosis. The feeling of dizziness or weakness without loss of consciousness may be associated with nausea and paleness and may result from low blood pressure or heart disease (cardiopathy, arrhythmia, among others). Loss of balance corresponds to the instability felt during walking and can result from changes in the inner ear, vision disorders, damage to the nerves in the lower limbs, joint, muscular or neurological changes, or medications such as antiepileptics, sedatives and tranquilizers. There are other sensations that are more difficult to describe and that can fall under the definition of dizziness. Their origins are diverse and can include changes in the inner ear, medication, anxiety, anemia, hypoglycemia, ear infections, dehydration or excess heat. Being over 65 years old and having a history of dizziness are risk factors to be considered. //Diagnosis// Diagnosis begins with medical observation, and there are several auxiliary means that can be useful. Magnetic resonance imaging can be important, as well as a neurological, ophthalmological and otorhinolaryngological evaluation. //Treatment// Treatment depends on the cause and associated symptoms. It may involve performing maneuvers that affect the position of the head, controlling inner ear diseases, and addressing Ménière's disease, migraines or anxiety. Given the various causes of the condition, treatment must be individualized and often multidisciplinary. //Prevention// It is not possible to prevent them. The important thing is to identify their cause early and treat them when they occur. Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, Setembro de 2012NHS Choices, 2014 U.S. National Library of Medicine, Abril de 2013 Different from simple dizziness, vertigo can be a symptom of various illnesses and require medical advice. Discover some of the causes of vertigo. Vestibular neuritis is an inflammation of the vestibular nerve after an episode of acute vertigo, which can maintain the sensation of imbalance for weeks.

Whooping cough,"//What is it?// Whooping cough (also known as pertussis or whooping cough) is a highly contagious respiratory disease (of the trachea and bronchi) caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. The disease is spread through respiratory droplets that the infected person expels when coughing or sneezing. It can also occur through contact with objects contaminated with a patient's secretions. In 2018, there were more than 151,000 cases of this acute infectious disease worldwide. Pertussis is most dangerous for babies and is a significant cause of illness and death in this age group. //Symptoms// The incubation period for whooping cough is 7-10 days, but can range from 5-21 days. The symptoms of whooping cough are usually mild and similar to those of a cold: Runny nose;/ Nasal congestion;/ Watery and red eyes;/ Fever;/ Cough;/  Whooping cough progresses in phases. The first is the catarrhal phase (lasting 1-2 weeks), in which the following occurs: Inflammation and runny nose;/ Non-productive cough;/ Low fever;/  In the second phase - the paroxysmal phase, which lasts for 2-6 weeks - the cough worsens, is more frequent at night and can worsen with crying (in the case of children) and eating. It can be accompanied by cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin and lips) and swelling of the tongue. In addition, the patient may produce a characteristic noise of the disease when breathing in and the cough can even cause vomiting. During the convalescence phase (2-6 weeks), the cough progressively decreases in intensity and frequency. The noise produced when inhaling and vomiting also disappear. However, whooping cough does not appear equally in all patients. There are people who do not develop noise when breathing. There are cases where a persistent cough is the only sign that a teenager or adult may be infected. Babies, on the other hand, may not have a cough, but may only have difficulty breathing or even suddenly stop breathing. Vaccinated children, adolescents and young adults may have only mild symptoms, such as a persistent cough. Patients with whooping cough are most contagious until about 3 weeks after the cough appears. It is a good idea to consult your doctor if you have prolonged coughing attacks and experience symptoms such as: Vomiting;/ Red or blue coloration of the face;/ Difficulty breathing;/ Breathing noise when inhaling;/  //Possible complications// Complications associated with whooping cough are often side effects of persistent coughing, such as: Broken or sore ribs;/ Abdominal hernias;/ Rupture of blood vessels in the skin or eyes;/  Pneumonia is a relatively common complication, while seizures and neurological disease rarely occur.  In babies—especially before 6 months of age—complications of whooping cough can be more serious, including: Pneumonia;/ Slower breathing or respiratory arrest;/ Dehydration or weight loss due to difficulties in eating;/ Dizziness;/ Neurological damage;/ //Causes// Whooping cough is caused by the bacteria Bordetella pertussis. Transmission occurs when an infected person sneezes or coughs, expelling microbes into the air. These droplets can then be inhaled by other people, infecting them. //Diagnosis// Diagnosing whooping cough in the early stages can be difficult because the signs and symptoms are very similar to those of other respiratory illnesses, such as colds, flu and bronchitis. In most cases, the diagnosis is made through clinical observation. However, tests may be done to help confirm the diagnosis, such as: Collection of nasopharyngeal exudate;/ Blood tests;/ Chest X-ray;/ //Treatment// In older children and adults, pertussis treatment is usually done at home and includes taking antibiotics. Because babies are at higher risk of complications, they are more likely to need hospital treatment. If your child is unable to take in liquids or food, intravenous fluids may need to be administered. Your child may also be isolated from other people to prevent transmission of the disease. Family members who have been exposed to the infection may need to take prophylactic antibiotic treatment. Cough relief is difficult. Over-the-counter cough medicines have little effect on whooping cough and are not recommended. Always follow your doctor's instructions.  //What you can do at home// In addition to the prescribed medical treatment for whooping cough, there are some measures you can take at home: Rest, preferably in a dark, cool and quiet room.;/ Increase fluid intake: water, juice and soup are good options to stay well hydrated. Be aware of possible signs of dehydration in children, such as dry lips, crying without tears and urinating infrequently.;/ Eat lighter meals. This is important to prevent vomiting associated with coughing.;/ Air out the house, keeping the interior free of irritants that could aggravate the cough, such as tobacco smoke or fireplace smoke.;/ Practice proper respiratory etiquette by covering your face whenever you cough. It is also important to wash your hands frequently and wear a mask around other people.;/ //Prevention// The best way to prevent whooping cough is through vaccination. The pertussis vaccine is free and is included in the National Immunization Program (PNV), and must be administered in five doses at 2, 4, 6, 18 months and 5 years of age. Pregnant women should also be vaccinated between 20 and 36 weeks of gestation, ideally up to 32 weeks. The combined vaccine against pertussis, tetanus and diphtheria is also included in the PNV.  There are also preventive medications against whooping cough, which can be prescribed by your doctor for some specific groups that have been exposed to the disease: Health professionals;/ Pregnant women;/ Babies under 12 months;/ Patients with a health condition that increases the risk of serious illness or complications, such as immunosuppression or asthma;/ Living with someone who has whooping cough;/ Living with someone who is at increased risk of developing a serious illness or complications from pertussis;/ Mayo Clinic, janeiro 2021 World Health Organization, January 2021 SNS 24, janeiro 2021 Whooping cough has returned and again poses a threat, especially to babies. It is essential to vaccinate pregnant women between 20 and 36 weeks of gestation. It can be scary to see that you have spit or coughed up blood, but it may not be serious and there are several possible reasons. The answer is ""yes"". Although infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus confers some immunity, no one is 100% protected and reinfection with COVID-19 can occur.

Botulinum toxin botox,"//What is it?// Botulinum toxin, or Botox, is a purified substance derived from bacteria that blocks muscle signals. By injecting small amounts into specific facial muscles, nerve impulses are blocked and skin wrinkling is temporarily reduced. Botulinum toxin, or Botox, has several uses in medicine. In dermocosmetics, it is used in injectable form for the temporary treatment of expression lines. This injection is used to reduce or eliminate forehead wrinkles, folds around the eyes and bags in the neck. The toxin blocks nerve impulses, temporarily paralyzing the muscles that cause wrinkles, giving the skin a smoother and more renewed appearance. Studies show its effectiveness in relieving migraines, excessive sweating and muscle spasms in the neck and eyes.  //What areas can be treated with botulinum toxin?// These are usually the vertical wrinkles between the eyebrows and at the base of the nose, the “crow's feet” around the eyes, the horizontal lines on the forehead and the muscular bands on the neck. //Treatment// The dermatologist first takes a patient's medical history, including any medications they are taking. The treatment then involves injecting small amounts of botulinum toxin, or Botox, directly into the facial muscles to relax them. A very fine needle, which is well tolerated by the skin, is used for just a few minutes, and there is no long recovery period. //Results// The effect is felt three to seven days after treatment. The improvement in wrinkles lasts between three and four months. The effect then gradually disappears and muscle action is restored. At this point, botulinum toxin, or Botox, can be injected again to maintain the results. //Adverse effects// They are minimal, temporary and typically related to the injection site. Bruising, headache and partial drooping of an eyelid may occur. All effects are mild, reversible and self-limiting. //Other applications// Hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating) of the armpits, hands or feet can be treated with injections of very diluted botulic toxin. This therapy leads to weakening of the sweat-producing glands for months. When excessive perspiration returns, administration of the toxin may be repeated. Cleveland Clinic Changes in facial growth during pre-adolescence can lead to problems with the jaws, which are “out of place”, and lead to orthognathic surgery.

Toxoplasmosis,"//What is it?// Toxoplasmosis is an infection caused by a parasite, Toxoplasma gondii. Sexual reproduction of this parasite occurs only in the cells that line the intestine of cats. Thus, the parasite's eggs are found in the feces of these felines. Toxoplasmosis is one of the most common parasitic diseases in cats, with a worldwide prevalence of between 5.5% and 97.4%. This parasite infects almost a third of the world's population, although its prevalence in industrialized countries has been decreasing over the last 30 years, with an incidence in individuals aged between 15 and 45 years ranging from 10% to 50%. In the United States, it is estimated that there are around 60 million people infected by this parasite. In Portugal, some data point to an infection prevalence of around 60% in the population over 30 years of age. //Symptoms// Congenital toxoplasmosis can be asymptomatic or present severe and rapidly fatal symptoms. When signs do occur, the most common are inflammation of the eyes, severe jaundice, easy bruising, seizures, large or small head and mental retardation. Very mild signs may appear shortly after birth, but generally they only appear months or years later. Acquired toxoplasmosis rarely produces symptoms and is generally diagnosed when a blood test reveals the presence of antibodies against the parasite. In fact, in healthy people, this infection does not cause signs because the immune system prevents the parasite from causing the disease. In milder cases, it can simulate infectious mononucleosis, with swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck and armpits, which are generally not sensitive to touch, a feeling of malaise, muscle pain and a low, fluctuating fever that can last for weeks or months. Mild anemia, low blood pressure, low white blood cell count, increased lymphocyte count and abnormal liver function test results may also occur. In most cases, people infected with toxoplasmosis only have painless enlargement of the lymph nodes in the neck. In chronic forms, eye inflammation may occur, which can be serious if not treated properly. Acute disseminated toxoplasmosis can produce a rash, high fever, chills, and exhaustion. In some cases, the infection can cause inflammation of the brain and the membranes that cover it, the liver, lungs or heart. In a patient with immunodeficiency, as occurs in infection with the HIV/AIDS virus, toxoplasmosis tends to be generalized, with brain inflammation (encephalitis), seizures, tremors, headache, confusion or coma. //Causes// Transmission of toxoplasmosis can occur when eating raw or undercooked foods that contain the inactive form (cyst) of the parasite or after contact with land containing cat feces with eggs. If a pregnant woman becomes infected, the infection can be transmitted to the fetus through the placenta from there and can result in miscarriage or the occurrence of congenital toxoplasmosis. //Diagnosis// Its diagnosis is almost always laboratory-based, through blood tests that demonstrate the presence of antibodies against the parasite. In some cases, computerized axial tomography or brain magnetic resonance imaging may be necessary. //Treatment// In most healthy people, recovery from toxoplasmosis occurs without the need for treatment. When necessary, a set of medications such as spiramycin, sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine are administered, often in combination. In AIDS patients, toxoplasmosis is so common that therapy must be continued indefinitely. Treatment during pregnancy is debatable because medications can be toxic to the fetus. As such, it is important to evaluate each case individually. //Prevention// Preventing toxoplasmosis involves several steps: Cook food thoroughly;;/ Freeze food thoroughly before preparing it;;/ Peel and/or wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly;;/ Wash your hands and all kitchen utensils thoroughly when preparing food;;/ Do not drink untreated water;;/ Wear gloves in gardening activities or activities that involve contact with the soil and wash your hands at the end of these tasks (this precaution in regular hand washing should be passed on to children as a general principle).;/ In relation to cats, whenever possible, litter boxes should be kept outside the house and/or covered, they should be cleaned daily and the cats should be fed with specific foods already sold or with well-cooked food. In the case of pregnant women, it is even more important not to come into contact with the litter box and, if necessary, to do so by wearing gloves and washing your hands immediately afterwards. During this period, cats must be kept indoors to avoid contamination in the open air.

Meniscus transplant,"//What is it?// In some cases, after surgery in which all or a significant part of the meniscus is removed, the pressure exerted on the knee cartilage increases and can cause pain and limited joint function. Post-meniscectomy syndrome, as it is called, represents a state of joint decompensation before osteoarthritis, due to a lack of meniscal tissue. Meniscus transplantation is a knee reconstructive surgery technique, indicated in cases of post-meniscectomy syndrome, in which a “new” meniscus is placed, coming from a human tissue bank (similar to what occurs in transplants of other organs). . The main objective of this surgery is to treat pain and improve the function of the affected knee in activities of daily living. Practicing sports should be seen as a secondary objective in this context. The ideal candidate is someone who has had a meniscus removed, has pain and functional limitations related to the compartment without the meniscus, is under 50 years of age, has no or limited cartilage damage, no deviations from the mechanical axis and has a stable knee. However, knees with deviations from the axis and/or instability that can be corrected surgically can also undergo meniscus transplantation. Individuals with inflammatory joint disease, active infections, obesity, decreased immunity, children or those with established knee osteoarthritis are not candidates for this procedure.  //Surgical Technique// The meniscus transplant technique is performed by arthroscopy, using an imaging camera and specific instruments. In addition to the 2 or 3 small incisions made during arthroscopy, other additional incisions may be necessary to correctly fix the meniscus. We use menisci from a human tissue bank, through the Southern Histocompatibility Center (national authority for transplantation), ensuring conservation conditions using cryopreservation techniques and carrying out screening tests for potentially contagious diseases. //Complications// The main cause of meniscus transplant failure is its rupture, just like an original meniscus. Possible complications include infection, neurovascular injury, joint stiffness and progression of osteoarthritis. The risk of transmission of infectious diseases is very low, given the process of preparing the meniscal tissue, and its occurrence is estimated at 0.000001% (1 case in 1 million patients operated on).  The confinement and changes in sports practice had consequences. Nuno Oliveira and Pedro Pessoa, CUF Orthopedists, share the most common complaints.

Delusional disorder,"//What is it?// Delusional disorder (previously known as paranoid personality disorder) is a rare mental illness, part of the psychosis group, in which the person is unable to distinguish what is real from what is just a figment of their imagination. Delusions are the dominant symptom and can be of two types: Bizarre: beliefs in irrational and impossible things. For example, feeling controlled by an outside force.;/ Non-bizarre: delusions about things that could happen in real life. For example, thinking that you are being followed, that you have been poisoned, or that your neighbors are planning to murder you.;/  People with delusional disorder believe in their delusions even when presented with irrefutable evidence that they do not reflect reality. These delusions are confused with real life and may not be true at all, or they may be exaggerations that are not compatible with reality. Typically, delusional disorder appears for the first time in adulthood or old age.  There are several types of delusional disorder, which can be classified according to the theme on which the delusions are based: Erotomania: in this type of delusion, the patient believes that another person - often someone famous or well-known - is in love with them. This belief may lead you to try to contact that person (for example, through calls or messages) or even start stalking them.;/ Grandiosity: the person has an exaggerated sense of value, power, knowledge and even identity, which can lead them to think they have a great talent or have made a great discovery.;/ Jealousy: as the name suggests, in this type of delusion the person believes that their spouse is not faithful to them, based on erroneous interpretations they make about the available evidence.;/ Persecution: the person believes that there is some type of plan against them and that someone may be spying on them and harming them. In this type of delusion, the person often repeatedly reports to the authorities.;/ Somatization: the person believes they have some type of physical deformity or medical problem.;/ Mixed: occurs when the patient presents two or more types of delirium.;/  //Symptoms// At first glance, the behavior of a person suffering from delusional disorder does not reveal the disease, as they do not act in an obviously strange way. The exception may occur when their delusions cause problems and affect certain areas of their life. This is the case, for example, when the patient believes that their partner is being unfaithful, even though this betrayal is not real. Some of the possible symptoms of delusional disorder are: Non-bizarre delusions, the most obvious symptom.;/ Hallucinations (which consist of seeing, hearing and feeling things that are not real) related to delirium.;/ Bad mood, irritability and anger.;/ Suspicion and lack of trust can lead to feelings of fear, anger, and betrayal. In addition, the person may become hypervigilant, have difficulty forgiving, or even adopt a defensive attitude.;/ To hold a grudge for a long time.;/ Taking/interpreting innocent comments or events as a threat.;/  For a person to be diagnosed with delusional disorder, their symptoms must persist for a month or more.  //Causes// The exact cause of delusional disorder is not yet known, as is the case with many other types of psychotic disorders. Research is ongoing to try to discover what factors may be causing it, and so far it is known that the following may play a role: Genetics: Delusional disorder is more common in people who have a family history of this illness or schizophrenia, which suggests that there may be some genetic influence. In addition, it is believed that, as with other mental disorders, the tendency to develop delusional disorder can be passed from parents to children.;/ Biological: the way in which certain changes in certain areas of the brain may be involved in the development of delusional disorder is the subject of study by the scientific community. Research carried out to date has shown that an imbalance of neurotransmitters (substances that allow nerve cells to communicate with each other) can lead to the emergence of symptoms.;/ Environmental/psychological: Some evidence suggests that it may be triggered by stress, alcohol abuse, and drug abuse. People who tend to isolate themselves from others also appear to be more vulnerable to developing delusional disorder.;/  //Diagnosis// In the presence of symptoms, the first steps in diagnosing delusional disorder are collecting a clinical history and performing a physical examination. There are no specific tests that can detect this disease, but some tests can be performed - such as X-rays and blood tests - to rule out other health problems. The patient should be monitored by a mental health specialist, such as a psychologist or psychiatrist. Based on the reported symptoms and behavioral observation, this health professional may be able to diagnose delusional disorder, and criteria must be met, such as having had non-bizarre delusions for at least one month and not having symptoms characteristic of other psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia. In addition, the impact on the patient's life is also taken into account - delusional disorder, except for the delusions and their respective effects, may be compatible with their usual activities. In these patients, manic or depressive episodes may occur, which are usually brief when compared to the delusions.  //Treatment of delusional disorder// Treating delusional disorder can be challenging for healthcare professionals as patients often do not realize they have a problem and therefore do not seek help. This is a typically chronic disease, but with appropriate treatment it is possible to alleviate its symptoms. While some people make a full recovery, others experience periods of delirium interspersed with periods of remission (absence of symptoms). Treatment for delusional disorder usually involves two approaches—psychotherapy and medication—and a good doctor-patient relationship is essential to its success. One of the goals of a long-term treatment plan is to shift the patient's attention away from the delusion and toward more constructive and rewarding thinking. However, this goal can be difficult to achieve. Psychotherapy is essential in the treatment of delusional disorder, allowing the patient to find a safe environment to discuss their symptoms while encouraging them to adopt healthier and more functional behaviors. In addition, you can learn to manage your symptoms, as well as identify signs that you may be experiencing a relapse and develop a plan to prevent it. Pharmacological treatment may consist of different types of antipsychotics, tranquilizers and antidepressants. People with severe symptoms or who pose a risk to themselves or others may need to be hospitalized until their illness stabilizes.  //Prevention// There are no known strategies for preventing delusional disorder. Early diagnosis and treatment can help reduce the impact this disease can have on the personal, family and social lives of sick people and their family and friends.

Psychotic Transtorno,"//What is it?// Psychotic disorder refers to a set of serious mental health problems in which the patient has a distorted perception of reality or interprets it in a different way than those around them. These types of symptoms, when they are more severe and disabling, require therapy and strict clinical surveillance in order to allow the patient to live their daily lives with symptoms under control.  This group of mental illnesses can affect some abilities associated not only with reasoning but also with perceptions: Understanding reality;/ Proper/appropriate behavior;/ Good value judgments;/ Clear reasoning;/ Emotional response;/ Effective communication;/  Different people are affected in different ways: while some sufferers live with psychotic disorder most of the time, others only have a few episodes throughout their lives. It is also possible to have a single episode of psychotic disorder and not have it again.  There are several types of psychotic disorder, some examples being: Schizophrenia;/ Bipolar disorder;/ Paraphrenia;/ Schizoaffective disorder;/ Substance-induced psychotic disorder, such as drugs;/ Psychotic disorder caused by another health problem that affects brain function, such as brain injuries or brain tumors;/  Psychotic disorders - which, as a rule, appear in late adolescence or in the 20s/30s and tend to affect both sexes equally - can be treated, generally including severe cases.  //Symptoms of psychotic disorder// Psychotic disorder can have several associated symptoms, but there are two that are most important: hallucinations and delusions.  As the name suggests, hallucinations are false perceptions, that is, things that the person is experiencing, but which are not real. Hallucinations can involve the various senses, and may include situations such as: seeing things that do not exist or that are not in front of you, such as religious figures, animals or objects that move differently than normal; hear voices; smell smells; feel flavors; or feel something touching your skin. Although hallucinations are a figment of the patient's imagination, they can seem very real to him.  While hallucinations are false perceptions of reality, delusions are false beliefs. That is, believing in things that are not real, such as thinking that there is someone or something conspiring against you or even that you are receiving secret messages from television. In addition, the person may also have delusions about themselves, thinking that they are someone very important (for example, rich and powerful) or that they can resurrect other people or control time. The sufferer may continue to believe these delusions even when confronted with evidence that they do not reflect reality. For these people, the delusions “are” real and are frightening, making them feel threatened or insecure.   Especially in combination, delusions and hallucinations can cause great distress in the patient, as well as behavioral changes. In addition to delusions and hallucinations, there are other possible symptoms of psychotic disorder, such as: Acting cold and distant, unable to express emotions;/ Disorganized or incoherent speech;/ Abnormal behavior;/ Confused reasoning;/ Loss of interest in personal hygiene;/ Loss of interest in usual leisure or family activities;/ Problems at school, at work or in relationships;/ Changes in mood level or other mood-related symptoms, such as depression or mania;/ Slower or abnormal movements;/  People suffering from a psychotic disorder do not all present the same set of symptoms and, even within a given patient, symptoms can vary over time. These illnesses can have a major impact on the life of the sufferer, who may feel tired, overwhelmed, anxious, scared, threatened or even confused. In addition, they may see their experience being devalued by others - because they are not real beliefs or perceptions - which can cause feelings of incomprehension and frustration.  //Causes// Some problems/situations identified as potentially causing psychosis are: Physical health problems, such as stroke, brain tumor, and brain infection;/ Traumatic experience;/ Drastic change in family or work life;/ Stress;/ Alcohol and drug use;/ Adverse effects of medications;/  Additionally, people who suffer from certain types of psychotic disorders (such as schizophrenia) may have problems in the areas of the brain responsible for functions such as reasoning, motivation, and perception. In some situations, it is possible to associate psychosis with a specific mental pathology, such as severe depression, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Since several cases of psychotic disorder are recorded in some families, it is possible that this disorder is, in part, hereditary. The exact cause of the psychotic episode can influence how often it occurs and how long it lasts.  //Diagnosis// Taking a medical and psychiatric history and a physical examination are the basis for diagnosing psychotic disorder. In addition, the attending physician may prescribe some tests to rule out other diseases or causes of the problem, such as blood tests and imaging tests such as magnetic resonance imaging, to obtain images of the brain. When no physical cause is identified that could explain the psychotic episodes, the attending physician may refer the patient to a psychiatrist, who will use other specific diagnostic methods, thus determining whether the person has some type of psychotic disorder.  //Treatment of psychotic disorder// It is possible to treat psychotic disorder and most patients recover well with treatment and follow-up. The therapeutic plan always depends on the cause of the psychotic disorder and may include: Medication: consists mainly of antipsychotic drugs, effective in controlling symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions and even reasoning problems. While some patients take antipsychotics throughout their lives, in others it may be possible to reduce the dosage and even stop taking them when symptoms improve. As a general rule, the medication is given in the lowest possible dose for each case, with the aim of minimizing its adverse effects.;/ Psychotherapy;/  In more severe cases of the illness, where the patient may pose a danger to themselves or others or where they are unable to care for themselves due to the illness, hospitalization may be necessary.  //Prevention// There are no strategies that can help prevent psychotic disorders. However, it is important to take into account that the sooner treatment is started, the better. This is the best way to minimize the impact that the disease can have on the patient's life. People who are at high risk of developing psychotic disorders - for example, those with a family history of these problems - should avoid using drugs (such as marijuana) and alcohol. These measures can help prevent these mental health problems.

Thyroid treatment with radiofrequency,"//What is it?// Radiofrequency treatment is a less invasive procedure that reduces the size of benign thyroid nodules without the need for surgery. The percentage of people with palpable thyroid nodules represents approximately 5% of the population. Ultrasound can detect thyroid nodules in approximately 40% of adults. The vast majority (approximately 90%) of these nodules are benign. However, some nodules can cause neck discomfort or aesthetic deformity in the neck. Until a few years ago, the only effective therapy for these situations would be surgery (which involves removing at least the affected side of the thyroid). However, the surgery requires general anesthesia, requires hospitalization and leaves a visible scar on the neck, in addition to the possibility of some complications, such as hoarseness. Removing half of the thyroid may also require thyroid hormone replacement, with this replacement being mandatory whenever the entire thyroid is removed. Interest in less invasive techniques that can significantly reduce the size of benign nodules without the need for surgery has increased in recent years. Radiofrequency is currently the most studied and practiced of these minimally invasive techniques. //Advantages and Benefits// As it is a non-invasive and relatively simple procedure, it is performed using only local anesthesia, under ultrasound control and without the need for hospitalization. Radiofrequency is the least invasive technique with the most published results and which consistently achieves the greatest reduction in nodular volume. //Indications// This procedure is indicated for benign thyroid nodules, so it requires that a cytology test be performed beforehand, with a benign result for the nodule to be treated. //Methodology// The technique consists of inserting a special needle (connected to a radiofrequency generator) into the nodule, and destroying it through the thermal action of the radiofrequency. The treated nodules will then undergo a progressive reduction in volume over the following months and years. These reductions generally reach 70% of nodular volume and sometimes more. This volume reduction makes it possible, in most cases, to effectively eliminate compressive symptoms and/or aesthetic deformity caused by natural nodules. //Complications// Although simple and minimally invasive, this procedure can cause some local complications, generally temporary, namely local pain.

Dental treatments,"//Microscopic Endodontics// Endodontics corresponds to the area of ​​Dentistry that encompasses the treatment of dental pulp. The dental pulp is an organ made up of nerves and blood vessels, which are found inside the tooth, and is commonly called the ""nerve"". When this tissue is affected, for example by a fracture or tooth decay, an inflammatory state occurs which can involve pain when cold. If this aggression continues, without the tooth being treated, the inflammatory state becomes so advanced that the dental pulp loses its ability to defend and recover. Faced with this irreversible state, normally accompanied by intense and prolonged pain when cold, hot, or even spontaneous, it becomes necessary to completely remove the dental pulp, that is, to carry out endodontic treatment. //Aesthetics// Aesthetic treatments promote a clear improvement in your smile, image and self-confidence. From changing the color of your teeth (tooth whitening) to changing their shape (crowns and veneers), there are countless alternatives. 1. Teeth Whitening 2. Facets 3. Crowns 4. Tooth fractures  1. Teeth Whitening It consists of changing the color of the teeth, making them whiter. This dental treatment does not wear down or weaken the teeth. A gel is applied to the surface of the teeth that will whiten them. It can be done in two ways: in the office or at home (but always with proper guidance). The final results are equivalent, the only difference being the speed at which the desired color is obtained.  2. Facets Veneers consist of changing the shape and/or color by applying a thin ceramic or composite sheet to the tooth. This treatment involves minimal wear on the visible surface of the tooth (0.3 to 0.7 mm) which allows the transition between the tooth and the veneer to be hidden. They also allow for the closure of unsightly spaces between teeth (diastema). 3. Crowns Crowns on natural teeth Crowns are recommended in cases where it is necessary to provide greater resistance and durability to damaged teeth, improve the aesthetics, shape or alignment of the teeth in the dental arch. They involve greater wear of around 1 mm around the entire tooth. They are made of pure ceramic in order to obtain an optimal final aesthetic result. Crowns on implants A crown can also be placed over a dental implant, restoring the shape and structure of the missing natural tooth.    //Oral Hygiene// Nowadays, with the new preventive paradigm in Oral Health and the generalization of dental implants, the specialty of Oral Hygiene has come to occupy a prominent place in Oral Health, far beyond simple scaling, commonly known as ""teeth cleaning"". Oral hygienists therefore have a preventive, educational and habit-modulating role suited to each patient's condition, supporting the dentist in the treatment of diseases such as gingivitis and periodontitis (the most prevalent diseases in the Western world) or even halitosis (bad breath). Its function becomes decisive in rehabilitations with dental implants, since the bacterial plaque that is deposited deep in the gingival tissues is one of the main reasons for the failure of implants. Brushing and flossing instructions are two very important components of an oral hygiene consultation. What is done at an oral hygiene consultation? This consultation involves screening for tooth decay, gum disease and diagnosing other problems that may arise. Tartar and plaque are removed through scaling and root planing, as well as polishing and sandblasting with sodium bicarbonate particles to eliminate surface stains. In the case of children, fissure sealants are also applied. Other products and techniques used include the application of high-concentration fluoride, products that reduce tooth sensitivity, whitening and maintenance of implant-supported restorations. Regular visits to the Oral Hygiene consultation are a determining factor in maintaining your teeth and smile.  //Pediatric dentistry// A pediatric dentistry consultation is a consultation aimed at children, with the aim of screening for any problems related to the child's oral health. From the time the first tooth erupts, it is advisable to have the first consultation so that parents are informed of all alternatives for maintaining the child's oral health, oral hygiene and habits that may in some way cause changes to the child's dental arch. Care at an early age positively prepares the child for future treatments that may be necessary. It is also intended for patients who due to age, intellectual immaturity or any type of disability that decreases the ability to cooperate. These patients can be treated using alternative resources, such as conscious sedation or general anesthesia. Conscious sedation is an anesthesia technique that allows the child to cooperate with the dentist as fear and anxiety are greatly reduced without ever losing consciousness. General anesthesia is an anesthetic technique that eliminates pain, muscle paralysis, reflexes, amnesia and, most importantly, unconsciousness. General anesthesia makes the patient unable to feel and/or react to any stimulus in the environment, allowing any type of treatment to be performed without the need for the child's cooperation. We brush our teeth every day, but that doesn't mean we've mastered the technique. Learn about some oral hygiene mistakes and how to correct them. Careful oral hygiene is never an easy task when it comes to children.

Trochanteritis,"//What is trochanteritis?// Trochanteritis is a painful condition located on the outer side of the hip, radiating down the lower limb, which is why it can be confused with sciatica. This condition is also known as trochanteric bursitis or greater trochanter pain syndrome. This condition results from inflammation of a bursa, which corresponds to a gelatinous sac-shaped structure that contains fluid. There are bursae in several joints, the most important being those located in the shoulder, elbow, hip, knee and heel. Bursae act as cushions between bones and surrounding tissues, reducing the friction that occurs between muscles and bones when muscles contract. The greater trochanter is a protrusion located in the upper portion of the femur where muscles essential for the functioning of the hip joint are inserted. This greater trochanter has a bursa that can become inflamed, causing this condition. Trochanteritis can result from causes other than inflammation of the trochanteric bursa. It can originate in the tendons or neighboring muscles (gluteus medius and gluteus minor, among others) and can have many different causes, the most common being mechanical overload. It is a disease that affects women about four times more often than men. There are approximately 1.8 cases/1,000 per year and it is a condition that affects between 17.6% and 35% of adults, depending on the population studied. //Symptoms of trochanteritis// The most common symptoms of trochanteritis are pain on the outer side of the hip, running down the thigh. In the early stages, the pain is more acute, localized and intense, and later becomes more diffuse. The pain of trochanteritis is aggravated by movement and when pressure is exerted on the hip. This pain tends to be worse at night, when the patient lies on the affected hip, and when the patient tries to get up from a chair after sitting for a while. It may also be worse after long walks or climbing stairs. //Causes of trochanteritis// Trochanteritis can affect anyone, but it is more common in women and in middle-aged or older people. It is less common in young people and men. The most common risk factors are overuse injuries from repetitive motions, such as running, climbing stairs, cycling, or standing for long periods of time. With regard to sporting activities, running is what is most associated with this condition, especially when new exercise regimens are introduced. A fall onto the hip, hitting the hip against a raised surface, or lying on one side of the body for a long time can also cause trochanteritis. Spinal injuries (scoliosis, lumbar spine arthritis), an asymmetry in the length between the two legs, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, previous surgeries (hip replacement), bone spurs or calcium deposits that form within the tendons that insert into the greater trochanter are other possible causes of trochanteritis. //Diagnosis of trochanteritis// A medical examination can identify the painful area in the hip region. Difficulty sleeping on the affected side is an important diagnostic element. Radiographic studies and Magnetic Resonance Imaging allow for a more accurate diagnosis. //Treatment of trochanteritis// Treatment for trochanteritis generally involves changing physical activity (in cases where the injury is associated with repetitive and excessive activity), using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, local ice and exercises to improve the condition of the muscles and tendons. Physiotherapy, with local treatments, is very effective, although there is not much scientific evidence regarding its usefulness in these cases. It is really important to avoid activities that aggravate symptoms. Using a cane for a week or more can be very helpful. Anti-inflammatories can cause several side effects, which is why they should be used after medical prescription and under proper monitoring. It may be necessary to complement this treatment with an injection into the bursa of local anesthetic and corticosteroid (infiltration). If the first injection does not work, it can be repeated once or twice, every few weeks. In cases that do not improve with conservative treatment, after about 2 to 4 months, surgical treatment may be indicated. However, surgical treatment is rarely used. The surgery involves removing the bursa. This removal affects the hip and it can function normally without the bursa. This type of surgery can be performed through arthroscopy, which consists of creating two small incisions and is, therefore, less invasive, less painful and allows for faster recovery. After surgery, a rehabilitation period is important, generally short, using a cane or crutches. //Trochanteritis prevention// This prevention of trochanteritis involves identifying the behaviors and activities that increase inflammation, so that they can be avoided. Adequate warm-up with thigh muscle extension is essential before beginning physical activity that affects the hip. When cycling, it is important not to adjust the seat to a position that is too high. Repetitive movements that put strain on the hips are particularly important. You should not remain seated for long periods of time or always lie on the same side. When you need to bend over, you should bend your knees instead of your back or hips. Losing excess weight is important. If there is asymmetry between the two legs, appropriate footwear should be used to correct this difference. It is also helpful to maintain the strength and flexibility of all the muscles in the hip region.

Venous thrombosis,"//What is it?// Venous thrombosis, or phlebitis, is characterized by the presence of a large clot attached to the inner wall of a vein (thrombus). In addition to blocking venous circulation in the affected vein, the clot can break free and cause an embolism in a major organ such as the lungs or brain, hence the importance of diagnosis and treatment as soon as possible. Most cases occur in the lower leg, thigh or pelvis, although they can also occur in other areas of the body, including the arm, brain, intestine, liver or kidney. In the acute phase, the main complications are pulmonary embolism and venous gangrene, which can lead to limb amputation and high mortality. In the late phase, the most frequent complication is post-thrombotic syndrome, which can be characterized by pigmented dermatitis mainly on the leg, lipodermosclerosis, edema predominantly in the evening, varicose veins of the lower limbs and active or healed ulcers. This condition, which affects millions of people, is responsible for significant mortality (over 10% in hospital settings). //Symptoms// Most patients do not have symptoms that indicate it. However, if these develop, they set in suddenly, the most common being pain, edema, sensation of heaviness, change in the color and temperature of the limb and partial functional incapacity. //Causes// Some risk factors that can lead to the development of thrombosis are: advanced age, pregnancy, use of oral contraceptives, obesity, varicose veins in the lower limbs, neoplasia, trauma and hypercoagulable states. In the presence of these signs, it may be necessary to carry out a genetic study. //Diagnosis// The most commonly used diagnostic test for confirmation and location of thrombosis is Doppler echocardiography or venous angiodynogram (as it has high sensitivity, specificity and is non-invasive). Sometimes, it may be necessary to perform phlebography which, despite being more specific, is an invasive exam with administration of contrast. //Treatment// In the initial phase, treatment of thrombosis may require rest with postural drainage of the affected limb or walking with appropriate elastic stockings, anticoagulation with low molecular weight or unfractionated heparin, or possibly fibrinolysis, with surgery rarely being necessary. Currently, it is possible to treat the vast majority of patients on an outpatient basis, with hospitalization only being necessary in very specific situations. Maintenance of oral hypocoagulation (often warfarin and for at least six months) under INR laboratory control is currently the current practice that may be changed with the progressive introduction of new oral antithrombotic medications.

Tuberculosis,"//What is it?// It is caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis, also known as Koch's Bacillus. This infection is transmitted from person to person by air and, therefore, only people with pulmonary or laryngeal tuberculosis are contagious. Every time one of these patients coughs, sneezes or talks they release small droplets that carry Koch's bacillus. It remains one of the world's biggest public health problems. Even today, more people die from tuberculosis than from any other curable infectious disease. For these reasons, the World Health Organization declared this disease a medical emergency. It is estimated that nine million new cases arise per year and, of these, 1.8 million end up dying. These numbers are particularly shocking if we consider that we are facing a curable disease, whose treatment is accessible and cheap. In Europe there are around 500,000 people with tuberculosis, around a thousand people fall ill every day and around 40,000 die each year. In Portugal, 2,480 cases of tuberculosis were declared in 2012, which represents a reduction of 6.1% compared to 2011. The success of treatment in pulmonary tuberculosis has been falling, reaching values ​​below 85% since 2010. Although it can affect anyone, it mainly affects the most vulnerable, the elderly and children, the marginalized and prisoners. Despite the existence of treatment, resistance often arises and is increasing in the European region. As such, there has been a gradual reduction in therapeutic success. It is now possible to diagnose tuberculosis and test resistance to some drugs in just over an hour and a half, but these tests are not yet available in all countries. //Symptoms// In the vast majority of cases, it manifests itself in the lungs, since the initial contact of the bacillus with the body is made through inhalation. However, other organs can be affected, such as the ganglia, meninges, pericardium, bones, kidneys, skin or intestines. These forms of tuberculosis are, as a rule, not contagious. This disease usually has a discreet clinical presentation, progressing without the patient noticing over days, weeks or even months. The most common complaints are tiredness, lack of appetite, weight loss, night sweats and low fever (37.5ºC) at the end of the day. There may be other symptoms depending on the organs involved. In the case of pulmonary tuberculosis, the most common is a cough, either dry or with phlegm, which may contain blood. Symptoms are more severe, more difficult to diagnose and treat in patients with lower immune defenses. //Causes// Inhaling air with bacilli that will reach and deposit in the lungs. From that moment on, either the body's defenses manage to eliminate them and no disease occurs or the bacteria overcome these barriers and the infection sets in.  There are also situations in which the bacillus is not eliminated, but is kept inactive for years or even for life. These individuals are healthy and not contagious, but they have a 10% chance of becoming ill at some point in their lives, with this risk being greatest in the two years following the infection (latent tuberculosis). The droplets containing the bacillus are invisible to the naked eye and can remain suspended in the air for several hours, particularly if the individual is in an unventilated place. The likelihood of becoming infected depends on the number of infectious droplets in the air, the time and location of exposure, and the susceptibility of the person exposed to that environment. As tuberculosis is a disease transmitted by inhalation, it is necessary to avoid unprotected close respiratory contact with people who have tuberculosis in the contagious phase, especially if they are not taking medication. If this is not possible, you should try to ensure that the contact sites are ventilated and exposed to sunlight, as the bacillus is very sensitive to ultraviolet rays. In non-ventilated places, the use of a mask is mandatory. Normally, if the patient takes the medication as prescribed by the doctor, after the first 15 days the risk of contagion begins to reduce. //Diagnosis// There are two types of screening tests for tuberculosis: the Mantoux tuberculin skin test and the blood test. In the first case, a small amount of a substance called tuberculin is injected under the skin of the forearm. After two to three days, an assessment is made and, if there is a skin reaction with redness and a papule that is measured, it is considered that the person has had contact with the tuberculosis bacillus. Additional blood tests are needed to determine whether the individual has latent tuberculosis or ongoing disease. To determine whether an infection is active or whether the lungs are infected, sputum and lung fluid tests, X-rays and chest computed tomography are performed. //Treatment// With medication administered orally (tablets, capsules or syrup). The minimum duration of therapy is six months, varying depending on the organ involved, progression or severity of the disease, and may be longer than one year. Correct treatment allows a cure in more than 95% of cases. It is essential to strictly adhere to the medication in order to avoid the development of resistance. Most cases are treated on an outpatient basis, without the need for hospitalization. This is justified in cases of more serious illness or for patients without the social/psychological conditions to avoid contagion or maintain compliance with the prescribed medication. //Prevention// It is important to track close contacts of patients with tuberculosis (mainly pulmonary or upper airways). In addition to enabling the detection of new cases, it also allows diagnosing latent cases and treating them. The BCG (bacillus Calmette-Guérin) vaccine is useful in preventing severe and disseminated forms of the disease in children, although it does not prevent infection or even the development of the disease. All newborns should be vaccinated. Revaccination throughout life does not increase the level of protection and is therefore not recommended. Northern Regional Health Administration, I.P.

Pituitary tumors,"//What is it?// Pituitary adenomas are benign tumors that originate in the cells of the anterior portion of this gland. They can be functional (produce one or more hormones) or non-functional. These constitute 30% of cases. Most pituitary tumors are benign and are abnormal cell proliferations that produce hormones (functional tumors) and, as they grow, can compress neighboring structures. They are usually treated with surgery or radiation and drugs to control the effects of excessive hormone production. //Symptoms// Although these are benign conditions and often do not produce hormones, pituitary tumors can cause symptoms due to compression (headaches, changes in vision) or due to loss of production of normal pituitary hormones (which can cause anything from infertility to fatigue). Functioning adenomas cause specific clinical symptoms, depending on their size, location and the hormone they produce. They may or may not be associated with symptoms of compression. //Causes// The exact cause of the development of this type of tumor is still under debate. Some conditions can increase the likelihood of its occurrence: Carney complex (a rare genetic disorder that causes benign tumors);/ Familial isolated pituitary adenomas (FIPA), an uncommon condition that causes the body to grow larger than normal;/ Isolated familial acromegaly;/ McCune-Albright syndrome (defined by the clinical triad of fibrous dysplasia of bone, café-au-lait spots on the skin, and precocious puberty);/ Multiple endocrine neoplasia, type I and type IV (MEN1, MEN4) which can cause tumors in the glands;/ //Diagnosis// The patient's clinical history and physical examination guide the diagnosis, which requires additional studies using different diagnostic methods: Ophthalmological examinations to detect changes due to direct compression of the eye structures;/ Neurological examination to assess the nervous system;/ Blood and urine tests, namely measurement of the various hormones secreted by or dependent on the pituitary gland;/ CT scan or MRI to identify the tumor;/ //Treatment// Many do not require treatment. The type of tumor, its size and relationship with neighboring structures, and its hormonal behavior, as well as the patient's general health, determine the therapeutic options. Drugs are usually the first line of treatment. For malignant tumors or those with great activity and size, doctors usually resort to surgery and radiation. Radiotherapy destroys the adenoma with high-frequency X-rays. It is useful when surgery cannot remove it completely or if there are recurrences that do not improve with medication. //Prevention// Pituitary tumors are not associated with a known external risk factor. As a result, there is currently no way to prevent them. American Cancer Society WebMD Load more;/ When migraines are short but recurrent and intense, it can be a cluster headache.

Orbital tumors,"//What is it?// Orbital tumors correspond to anomalous lesions, which can be benign or malignant, located in the space around the eyeball, which also houses the optic nerve, muscles, lacrimal gland and fat. Early identification is essential for timely diagnosis and treatment. Types An orbital tumor is not necessarily a malignant lesion. Most cases are benign, grow slowly and may go unnoticed for several years. In children, dermoid cysts and infantile hemangiomas are more common, benign lesions that result from early developmental changes. Although malignant tumors are rare in this age group, the observation of a more prominent eye and/or swelling of the eyelids should prompt immediate investigation. In adults, some signs may indicate the growth of an anomalous mass at the orbital level, and should be promptly investigated: the observation of a more prominent eye, strabismus of recent onset, sudden drooping of the upper eyelid, which may or may not be accompanied by loss of vision. Not being specific to a particular diagnosis, these manifestations can occur in the context of other diseases such as thyroid orbitopathy, non-specific primary inflammations or secondary inflammations to systemic diseases, among others. A thorough ophthalmological examination, complemented when necessary with other complementary exams, will allow the differential diagnosis between non-neoplastic or neoplastic lesions, and within these between benign and malignant lesions. //Symptoms// They depend on the characteristics and location of the tumor. Progressive prominence of the eyeball, double vision, drooping of the upper eyelid or reduced visual acuity may be noted.  //Treatment// It depends on the type of injury. Definitive diagnosis will usually require biopsy of part or all of the lesion, which in the latter case may be curative. Other treatments may be indicated and are decided on a case-by-case basis.

Tumors of the eyelids,"//What is it?// An eyelid tumor is the growth of an abnormal lesion that may be benign or malignant. It is essential that this distinction is made early, through a detailed examination by a specialist with experience in the area, who will be able to indicate the most appropriate type and treatment. Genetic factors, sun exposure and smoking are known risk factors for the development of eyelid tumors. Not all tumors are malignant.  They are often benign lesions, with slow growth, the most common being papillomas, cysts, seborrheic keratosis, xanthelasmas, molluscum contagiosum, etc. There are, however, more serious tumors that, if not treated in a timely manner, can compromise other adjacent structures and even metastasize to more distant locations. Basal cell carcinoma is the most common malignant tumor of the eyelid, accounting for approximately 90% of all malignant lesions. It is more common on the lower eyelid and in light-skinned individuals with a history of sun exposure. Although it grows gradually over months or years, and its metastasis is very rare, it is a locally invasive tumor, and early diagnosis and treatment are important. Other malignant lesions that can develop in this region are squamous cell carcinomas, sebaceous carcinomas or melanomas. These are more aggressive tumors that can generate distant metastases, which can be life-threatening. //Symptoms// Eyelid tumors (benign or malignant) manifest themselves in a variable way, and may be elevated or flat lesions, pigmented or not. Some characteristics that may raise the suspicion that the lesion is malignant are rapid growth, distortion of the eyelid margin, change in the texture and appearance of the skin, loss of eyelashes, the appearance of a central ulcer that can bleed and does not heal, a lump persistent or a chalasium (also known as a stye) that does not improve. The presence of any of these changes should prompt observation by a specialist for adequate diagnosis and treatment. //Treatment// It depends on the type of tumor. A benign lesion can be monitored or removed, a tumor with suspicious characteristics must be analyzed through biopsy with removal of all or part of the tumor and subsequent reconstruction. A precise technique and detailed knowledge of the local anatomy will allow the defect resulting from the removal of a tumor to be resolved, with a good functional and aesthetic result. In certain situations, additional treatments may be indicated, which are decided on a case-by-case basis. Myopia, astigmatism and hyperopia often lead to the use of glasses or contact lenses.

Gastric ulcer,"//What is it?// A gastric ulcer, or stomach ulcer, is a lesion that occurs in the lining (mucosa) of the stomach. It can also appear in the duodenum or esophagus. It is a very common problem, with one of the most common causes being the consumption of anti-inflammatories. In fact, acetylsalicylic acid and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are among the most prescribed medications worldwide. In Portugal, around 800 thousand people take these medications daily. It is estimated that the risk of gastrointestinal complications associated with their consumption is four to five times greater than that of the population that does not consume them, and is even higher in the elderly and/or individuals with a history of ulcers. There are few studies in Portugal on gastrointestinal complications associated with the consumption of anti-inflammatories, but in the United States, it is estimated that around 20 million Americans suffer from ulcers at least once throughout their lives. //Symptoms// The most common complaints of gastric ulcers are abdominal pain described as a burning sensation that occurs two to three hours after eating. The pain tends to be worse when the stomach is empty and can occur at night. It improves with the use of antacids and with food intake. Patients with this pathology also report difficulty in digestion, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite and weight. In more serious cases, in which the ulcer progresses and perforates the stomach wall, the pain is much more intense, accompanied by abdominal rigidity and blood loss in vomit or feces. These situations constitute medical emergencies and require immediate hospital care. //Causes// The stomach walls are normally protected from the effects of the acid normally present in this organ and which is essential for the digestive process. If this protection is affected, a stomach ulcer can form. One of the most common causes is Helicobacter pylori infection, which weakens the stomach's protective barrier. It is estimated that this bacteria causes around 20% of gastric ulcer cases. Prolonged use of anti-inflammatory drugs also affects the defenses of the stomach wall and is a very common cause of ulcers. Some people are more susceptible to the effects of these medications on the stomach. Antiplatelet agents can also cause this condition. Alcohol abuse and radiotherapy can also be associated with gastric ulcers. There are risk factors for its development, such as family history, advanced age, chronic pain due to prolonged use of anti-inflammatories, diabetes, tobacco, coffee and chronic stress. However, there is some controversy regarding the role of stress in ulcers, and there is no consensus on its responsibility in this disease. //Diagnosis// The diagnosis of gastric ulcer is based on medical examination and complementary tests such as endoscopy. During the procedure, it is customary to collect small fragments of tissue for other examinations. This collection is called a biopsy. There are specific tests to detect Helicobacter pylori infection. One of them is the breath test, which is very simple and reliable. //Treatment// Treatment involves eliminating the cause, controlling the injury and its potential complications, and preventing new episodes. There are medications indicated for relieving complaints associated with ulcers and medications capable of eliminating Helicobacter pylori infection. Surgery may be necessary in more complicated cases and changes in lifestyle and diet are important to relieve symptoms and prevent future ulcers. The most commonly used medications are antacids, which relieve the pain associated with this disease but do not treat it, proton pump inhibitors and H2 receptor inhibitors, which reduce acid production, some antibiotics are also effective in eliminating the Helicobacter pylori. It is often necessary to combine several of these medications to achieve good results. Diet is important in the recovery and prevention of gastric ulcers. It should include foods rich in fiber, such as fruits and vegetables. Apples, onions, garlic and tea can help inhibit the growth of Helicobacter pylori. Spicy foods tend to aggravate ulcer symptoms and should be avoided. Tobacco, alcohol, coffee (even decaffeinated) and carbonated drinks should be reduced because they increase the production of acid in the stomach. Physical exercise is also a good component of the treatment and prevention of gastric ulcers and many other diseases. Finally, it is important to learn how to manage stress.  //What is the prognosis for gastric ulcer?// In general, with proper treatment, most ulcers heal within six to eight months. However, relapses can occur, especially if Helicobacter pylori is not eliminated. Complications, such as bleeding, perforation or intestinal obstruction, are rare but potentially very dangerous. Bleeding occurs in approximately 15% of patients with ulcers. Intestinal obstruction results from scars that form in inflamed areas and can cause tightness that prevents the passage of food. This complication is more common in duodenal ulcers. On the other hand, the presence of ulcers associated with Helicobacter pylori increases the risk of stomach cancer, which reinforces the importance of early and adequate diagnosis and treatment. //Prevention// Prevention involves controlling all risk factors. In the case of anti-inflammatories, if they are essential, stomach-protective medications should also be used. University of Maryland Medical Center, Out. 2011 Cremers, M.

Urticaria,"//What is it?// Hives are when itchy patches or bumps appear on the skin. They can appear anywhere and vary in size. Each bump usually lasts less than 24 hours. However, new bumps appear when the previous ones disappear. They usually do not last more than six weeks. Urticaria is characterized by the sudden onset of localized or widespread swelling of the skin accompanied by a sensation of itching, burning or stinging. Angioedema is a similar type but occurs in the tissues deeper beneath the skin. //Symptoms// Itchy, drooling usually appears on the skin. In severe cases, the throat and airway may swell, making breathing and swallowing difficult. In these situations, you should seek emergency care immediately.  When to suspect hives: When the rapid appearance of reddish papules on the skin, sometimes whitish in the central part, accompanied by itching (pruritus) or sometimes a burning sensation, disappearing within a few seconds after pressure;;/ When the lesions regress within a period of 24 hours, spontaneously or with treatment, without leaving residual pigmentation.

The clinical history characterizes the circumstances of the appearance of the lesions and the objective examination endorses their appearance, color, distribution in the body, duration and accompanying symptoms. Skin tests may be performed to determine the substances to which the patient is allergic. Blood tests are often done to rule out systemic pathology. //Treatment// In mild and moderate cases, the most common treatment is a non-sedating antihistamine. These drugs relieve symptoms, particularly itching. Some therapies include cortisone. //Prevention// Simple lifestyle changes can help prevent hives from recurring in the future. If a person is allergic and knows which substances can cause a reaction, they should avoid any exposure to these factors. Allergy shots are another option to reduce the risk of new outbreaks.

Uveites,"//What is it?// Uveitis is a generic term that encompasses a set of rare ophthalmological pathologies, with an approximate prevalence of 100 cases per 100,000 people, but potentially serious, being responsible for 10 to 15% of cases of blindness.  By definition, uveitis is an inflammation of the uvea, the vascular layer of the eyeball. The uvea, in turn, can be divided into the anterior uvea (consisting of the iris and ciliary body), which is in contact with the lens and anterior structures of the eyeball, and the posterior uvea (choroidea), which is in direct contact with the retina. . The uvea is the most vascularized tissue in the human body.  This wealth of blood vessels is related to their function of nourishing the retina's photoreceptors, the main cells responsible for vision. However, this characteristic of the uvea also makes it highly susceptible to infectious or inflammatory processes, local or originating elsewhere in the body. //Causes// There are dozens of diseases that can cause uveitis. However, in more than 50% of cases a specific cause cannot be identified. Possible causes can be grouped into: Infectious, such as toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis, viruses or bacterial or fungal endophthalmitis;;/ Systemic autoimmune diseases, namely Behçet's disease, sarcoidosis, ankylosing spondylitis, inflammatory bowel disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus;;/ Specific autoimmune diseases of the eye, such as birdshot retinochoroidopathy or Fuchs' heterochromic uveitis;;/ Traumatic.;/ //Symptoms// The signs and symptoms associated with uveitis are varied and depend on the ocular structure involved: If the front of the eye is affected, symptoms include sensitivity to light (photophobia), red eye, blurred vision, and eye pain.;/ If the back of the eye is affected, eye symptoms include visual loss, flashes of light (photopsias), and floaters (myodesopsias).;/ Uveitis can affect one or both eyes and come on suddenly or occur over several days. If left untreated or diagnosed late, uveitis can result in glaucoma, cataracts, retinal detachment or permanent visual loss. //Treatment// The treatment of this pathology depends on its cause. In cases of infectious etiology, anti-infectives (antibiotics or antivirals, for example) are used to eliminate the microorganism responsible. In most cases, it is necessary to combat the inflammation using immunosuppression, which reduces the activity of the immune system. Corticosteroids are generally used as the first line of treatment and can be prescribed locally (using eye drops or injections) or systemically (tablets). In the case of severe uveitis, other immunosuppressive medications may be necessary to effectively control the inflammation. Some complications, such as cataracts, glaucoma or retinal detachment, may require surgery. Myopia, astigmatism and hyperopia often lead to the use of glasses or contact lenses.

Vaginitis,"//What is it?// The vagina is a dynamic ecosystem that evolves over the course of a woman's life and is influenced by hormones, sexual and reproductive activity. The pH of the vagina from premenarche to puberty is almost neutral (pH 7.0). In adolescence, due to the influence of estrogens, there is an increase in the thickness of the vaginal squamous epithelium, with a concomitant increase in glycogen levels. This increase causes the predominant flora to be lactobacillus and the pH drops to below 4.5. In healthy women, this low pH remains until menopause, when the epithelium becomes thinner and the pH of the vagina rises to values ​​greater than 6.0. Lactobacillus exist in high numbers in the normal vagina,  more than 10 million organisms per gram of vaginal fluid. Anaerobes, streptococci or staphylococci exist in smaller numbers. Women with high lactobacillus are less colonized by other infections such as Gardnella vaginallis, mycoplasmas, and anaerobes, as well as having less bacterial vaginosis or other sexually transmitted diseases, in addition to having healthier pregnancies. In women with HIV, but with a high number of lactobacillus, there is less spread of the virus in secretions. Vaginal symptoms are the main reason for gynecology consultations and emergency care. There has been little progress in the ability to diagnose and effectively treat vaginitis. //Symptoms// Your symptoms may vary depending on what causes the infection or inflammation. Some of the most common manifestations are: Abnormal vaginal discharge with an unpleasant odor;/ Burning sensation outside the vagina during urination;/ Itching around the vagina;/ Discomfort during sexual intercourse;/ //Causes// Bacterial vaginosis is the main cause of abnormal discharge (leucorrhoea), followed by vulvovaginal candidiasis and trichomoniasis (although less common). Inflammatory desquamative vaginitis of unknown aetiology is the cause of purulent vaginitis. Non-infectious causes include a lack of estrogen (postpartum or post-menopause) or allergic vaginitis.  //Bacterial vaginosis// It is probably the result of complex interactions between many species of bacteria, modified by host responses. Gardnella vaginallis has been identified in women with bacterial vaginosis. Approximately 50% of asymptomatic patients with normal pH are colonized with this bacterium. Prevalence: 29.5% have bacterial vaginosis. Symptoms: Symptomatic vaginosis covers 60% of all cases of increased, foul-smelling vaginal secretion. Risk factors: The event that leads to the shift to anaerobic dominance that characterizes vaginosis is unknown, but sexual activity may be a factor, at least in some women. It happens among those who have new or several sexual partners and also among homosexuals. Condoms protect against the disease. Treatment: As the causal factor is unknown, treatment attempts to reduce the number of these anaerobes and improve the symptoms of increased vaginal discharge with an odor. The usual treatment is oral or vaginal metronidazole or clindamycin. Both are recommended for bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy, taken orally. It is important to inform the attending physician of the presence of this abnormal secretion during pregnancy so that appropriate treatment can be prescribed to prevent obstetric complications. The treatments are effective although there is a high rate of recurrence: from 11% to 29% at three months. The biweekly use of vaginal metronidazole is effective in preventing vaginosis. //Diagnosis// A detailed medical history, particularly regarding previous sexually transmitted infections and sexual habits, is essential to guide the diagnosis. A pelvic examination assesses inflammation and any vaginal discharge. Sometimes a sample is taken to determine the cause of the inflammation. The cause of vaginitis can be diagnosed by checking the appearance of the vaginal fluid, its pH levels, and microscopic detection of specific cells. //Treatment// Treatment depends on the cause. It may include topical steroids applied to the skin, topical or oral antibiotics, antifungals, or antibacterial creams. Bacterial vaginitis is usually treated with antibiotics, such as metronidazole or clindamycin. Medications used to treat a yeast infection include butoconazole and clotrimazole. Other options include cortisone cream to treat severe irritation and antihistamines if the inflammation appears to be due to an allergic reaction; topical estrogen cream is also recommended if the vaginitis is due to low levels of this hormone. If a woman is pregnant she should tell her doctor why she has vaginitis and some treatment options may not be suitable. //Prevention// The following practices can help prevent it: Good general hygiene;/ Use mild soaps without irritants or scents;/ Wear cotton underwear;/ Avoid hygiene sprays and other feminine products;/ Wipe from front to back to prevent the spread of bacteria from the anus to the vagina;/ Wear loose clothing;/ Use condoms;/ Take antibiotics only when necessary;/ Cleveland Clinic Medical News Today Although less common, this group includes the most lethal of gynecological cancers: ovarian cancer.

Valvulopatia,"//What is it?// Valvular heart disease corresponds to diseases that affect the heart valves, preventing them from opening and/or closing properly. There are four (aortic, mitral, tricuspid and pulmonary) and all of them can present anomalies that manifest themselves differently. Valvular diseases that affect the aortic and mitral valves are the most important, due to their impact on the body. The function of heart valves is to regulate blood flow between the various chambers of the heart and the main vessels. As such, they are essential for the correct functioning of the entire cardiovascular system. //Symptoms// Valvular heart disease can be asymptomatic for long periods of time. The main symptoms are shortness of breath, chest pain and syncope (fainting). These symptoms tend to be more evident after exertion that increases blood flow. They can also cause arrhythmias, with a feeling of palpitations, and when the cause is endocarditis, fever occurs. If the disease is left untreated, a heart attack, stroke, blood clots or sudden death from cardiac arrest can occur. //Causes// The most common causes of valvulopathy are rheumatic fever, following a streptococcal infection, and degenerative forms. These have been increasing in frequency, following the increase in population life expectancy. Since they open and close around 60 times per minute, after 70 years they will have performed this movement more than two billion times, which explains their aging, hardening and calcification. Congenital malformations are also common. Asendocarditis, which corresponds to infectious processes of the valves, is also common and can occur, for example, after dental treatment during which microorganisms enter circulation and deposit in the valves, especially if they present structural changes. Trauma can also cause valvulopathy. Coronary heart disease, high blood pressure, aneurysms, some tumors are other possible origins, as well as drug use and exposure to radiation. //Diagnosis// Medical examination is very important here and cardiac auscultation makes it possible to detect many cases of valvular heart disease. The echocardiogram allows a better definition of the disease and its severity, being important for the therapeutic strategy. It may also be useful to perform a simple or exercise electrocardiogram and, in some cases, a cardiac catheterization. //Treatment// There is no medication that can treat valvular heart disease. However, adopting a healthy lifestyle and taking some medications can alleviate symptoms and prevent complications. Depending on the clinical case, the use of antibiotics, anticoagulants, and medications to control blood pressure may be recommended. Surgical treatment for valvulopathy consists of repairing the valve or replacing it with a prosthetic valve (synthetic or biological). In some cases, it is possible to dilate it by inserting a catheter, without the need for surgery. //Prevention// It is important to treat any tonsillitis that lasts more than 48 hours, especially if accompanied by a fever. In these cases, the use of an antibiotic can prevent the development of rheumatic fever and consequent damage to the heart valves. Controlling blood pressure, diabetes and atherosclerosis is equally essential. You should avoid smoking, consume alcoholic beverages in moderation, maintain a balanced diet, low in salt and fat, perform physical exercise regularly and maintain a healthy weight. Spanish Heart Foundation, 2012 National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services,Novembro de 2011 Cleveland Clinic, 2010 American Heart Association, 2014 The Johns Hopkins University, 2013 Saying that the heart does not hurt is a myth that is wrongly repeated. The heart hurts and any complaint of sudden pain can be a sign of myocardial infarction. It can appear during physical exercise or at rest and scares parents. Know what heart pain means and when to see a doctor. 1 in 6 Portuguese people may have heart failure without knowing it. The prevalence increases with age, but lifestyle helps reduce risk factors.
