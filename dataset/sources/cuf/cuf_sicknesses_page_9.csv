Gonalgia or knee pain,"//What is it?// Gonalgia (or knee pain) is a common problem that can affect people of all ages, but is more common in older people. Although it can have several causes, it is usually associated with wear and tear caused by everyday activities, such as standing, lifting, bending and walking. It can also be caused by traumatic injuries, such as sports injuries, or diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. Especially when it is more severe, gonalgia can impair quality of life.  //gonadal symptoms// The characteristics of knee pain, that is, the location and severity of the pain, depend on the cause. There are some symptoms that may accompany the pain, such as: Inability to fully straighten the knee;/ Swelling and stiffness;/ Weakness or instability;/ Redness and heat to the touch;/ Snaps;/  Some symptoms that should prompt a doctor's consultation are: Very swollen knee;/ Inability to bear weight on the knee or feeling that the knee is unstable;/ Noticeable deformity in the leg or knee;/ Inability to fully flex or extend the knee;/ Severe pain associated with an injury;/ Fever associated with redness, pain and swelling in the knee;/  //Causes// Gonalgia can have numerous causes, of different natures, and may be associated with aging, wear and tear (due to performing repetitive activities), injuries, sudden movements, among others. Some examples of problems that can cause knee pain are: Injuries such as fracture of the bones that make up the knee (such as the patella), meniscus tear, knee bursitis, knee tendinitis, sprain or strain of the knee ligaments, and anterior cruciate ligament injury.;/ Mechanical problems, such as a dislocated kneecap, hip or foot pain (which can lead to changes in locomotion to relieve this pain, which in turn can put more pressure on the knee), and iliotibial band syndrome.;/ Arthritis: there are more than 100 types of arthritis and those that are most likely to affect the knee are osteoarthritis (the most common type to affect this joint), rheumatoid arthritis, gout, chondrocalcinosis (or pseudogout) and septic arthritis.;/ Patellofemoral pain syndrome: a general term referring to pain that arises between the kneecap and the femur. Also known as “runner’s knee.”;/  There are several risk factors that can increase the risk of knee pain: Practicing certain types of sports and other activities that put more pressure on your knees. This is the case, for example, of basketball, as it involves a lot of jumping and turning, and running due to the repetitive impact. Some jobs can also put more pressure on your knees, such as working in construction or agriculture.;/ Excess weight or obesity: increases the pressure exerted on the knees and increases the risk of osteoarthritis by accelerating the wear of the cartilage in this joint.;/ Having a lack of flexibility or muscle strength, as this increases the risk of knee injuries. Strong muscles help keep joints stabilized and protected.;/ Previous injuries, which increase the risk of being injured again.;/  //Diagnosis// Diagnosing gonalgia involves a physical examination in which the doctor assesses the presence of symptoms such as swelling, pain or tenderness, heat and bruising. In addition, the doctor may also manipulate the knee to see if the person can move the leg in different directions and push and pull the joint. In some situations, the doctor may prescribe some auxiliary diagnostic tests, such as: X-ray;/ Computerized tomography (CT);/ Ultrasound;/ Magnetic resonance imaging;/ Blood tests or arthrocentesis (taking a sample of fluid from the knee) when infection or inflammation is suspected;/ Arthroscopy (minimally invasive endoscopic procedure that allows you to visualize the inside of the joint);/ Bone scintigraphy;/  //Knee pain treatment// Treatment for gonalgia depends on its cause. In general, it may include: Medication for pain relief and to treat the problem that is causing your knee pain, such as rheumatoid arthritis and gout.;/ Physiotherapy, to help strengthen the muscles surrounding the knee, giving it greater support and stability and relieving discomfort. In athletes or physically active people, it may be necessary to do some exercises to correct movement patterns and adopt more appropriate techniques. Furthermore, it is important to work on flexibility and balance. Wedges can also be used on one of the feet to support the arch, relieving pressure on one side of the knee most affected by osteoarthritis. Orthoses can also be used to support the joint.;/ Injections with medications or other substances directly into the joint, such as corticosteroids, hyaluronic acid, and platelet-rich plasma.;/ Surgery: in cases where it is necessary, it generally does not need to be done immediately and the pros and cons must be considered. Some of the surgeries that can be performed to treat gonalgia are: Knee arthroscopy: endoscopic and minimally invasive surgical procedure, in which the doctor introduces a small camera and instruments that allow him to visualize and repair some types of damage to the joint. Partial knee prosthesis: the area of ​​the knee that is most damaged is replaced, using metal or plastic prostheses. Total knee prosthesis knee: the joint is replaced with a prosthesis. Osteotomy: bone from the femur or tibia is removed to create better alignment of the knee and relieve arthritis pain. This surgery can help postpone or even avoid total knee replacement surgery.;/ Knee arthroscopy: endoscopic and minimally invasive surgical procedure, in which the doctor introduces a small camera and instruments that allow viewing and repairing some types of joint damage.;/ Partial knee prosthesis: the region of the knee that is most damaged is replaced, using metal or plastic prostheses.;/ Total knee replacement: the joint is replaced with a prosthesis.;/ Osteotomy: Femur or tibia bone is removed to create better knee alignment and relieve arthritis pain. This surgery can help postpone or even avoid total knee replacement surgery.;/  Less serious situations tend to respond well to some self-care measures that can be prescribed by the doctor who is monitoring you, such as: Taking over-the-counter medications, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, can help relieve knee pain.;/ Application of topical anti-inflammatory/analgesic drugs (ointments).;/ Rest in order to reduce the repetitive impact on the knee, giving the injury time to recover and preventing the damage from worsening.;/ Apply ice to the area (always wrapped in a towel or cloth to protect the skin) to reduce pain and inflammation. Do not use for more than 20 minutes at a time.;/ Applying heat, which may offer some temporary pain relief.;/ Compression, which helps prevent fluid buildup in damaged tissues and maintains knee alignment and stability. It must be tight enough to support the knee, but without interfering with circulation.;/ Do some stretching or lighter/gentler exercises.;/ Keep your leg elevated to reduce swelling, using a pillow or a reclining chair.;/  //Prevention// It is not always possible to prevent gonalgia, but there are some measures that can help prevent not only injuries, but also deterioration of the joint: Don't be overweight. Extra weight puts extra pressure on your knees, which increases your risk of injury and osteoarthritis.;/ Have good physical shape, appropriate to the sport you practice. It is important that the muscles are prepared for the effort they will be subjected to.;/ Train your strength and flexibility. Muscle weakness is one of the main causes of knee injuries. On the other hand, very tight muscles also increase the risk of injury, so it is important to stretch.;/ When practicing sports, adopt correct techniques. If necessary, take classes with professionals.;/ Adapt sports practice to any health conditions. For example, people who suffer from osteoarthritis, chronic knee pain or recurring injuries should review their sports practice. Limiting high-impact activities may provide some relief from symptoms, and you may choose to do swimming, water aerobics, or other low-impact activities a few times a week.;/ Load more;/ About us;/ Events;/ Clients and Companions;/ News;/ CUF Academic Center;/ Partnerships;/ Contacts;/ Frequently Asked Questions;/ Join us;/ Virtual Visit;/ English version;/ My CUF;/ Access Solutions and Health Plans;/ Facebook;/ Facebook Instagram;/ Instagram LinkedInCreated with Sketch.;/ LinkedIn Youtube;/ Youtube award4;/ award4 certification1;/ certification1 certification2;/ certification2 certification3;/ certification3 Complaints and compliments;/ Complaints and compliments Privacy and Cookies Policy;/ Terms and Conditions;/ Whistleblower Channel;/ © CUF 2024 All rights reserved Home;/ Health A-Z: Diseases, Symptoms and Treatments;/"
Gonarthrosis osteoarthritis of the knee,"//What is it?// Knee osteoarthritis corresponds to wear and tear on the knee joint, with progressive loss of cartilage, appearance of osteophytes (""parrot's beaks""), deformity and joint effusion. It can occur primarily or secondary to fractures, meniscus or ligament injuries, rheumatic diseases, etc.  //Symptoms// Knee osteoarthritis is associated with pain and loss of function, typically with decreased mobility and limited walking ability, significantly interfering with quality of life in more advanced stages. The knee is deformed and often has joint effusion (fluid). //Diagnosis// Diagnosis is performed through X-ray, and can be complemented by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). //Treatment// In the initial phase, analgesics and anti-inflammatories may be prescribed which, together with an appropriate physiotherapy plan, provide pain relief and improve joint function, although they do not treat osteoarthritis. Intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid (viscosupplementation) can alleviate symptoms, especially in the early stages of the disease. In cases where conservative treatment fails, surgical treatment is indicated. Different options are available, such as osteotomy (bone section and realignment) or knee prosthesis (joint replacement or arthroplasty), depending on the joint status and alignment of the limb. Having a cast on your arm or leg helps you recover from fractures and reduces pain. Know what to do in this situation. A dislocation occurs when bones in a joint, such as the shoulder or knee, are displaced from their normal position. Learn about treatment options. The purpose of crutches is to reduce the weight exerted on the lower limbs. Learn how to use crutches in different everyday situations.

Gonorrhea,"//What is it?// Gonorrhea, also known as gonorrhea (or, popularly, as “going hot”), is a sexually transmitted infectious disease (STD) caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Gonorrhea affects both women and men, causing more symptoms in men, and can be transmitted by asymptomatic carriers. Gonorrhea during pregnancy presents a risk of changes in the development of the fetus, and can also be transmitted to the baby during childbirth. Like other sexually transmitted infections, gonorrhoea is defined as being subject to mandatory clinical and laboratory reporting. According to the rules of the Directorate-General for Health and because it represents an increased risk of contamination of donor blood, a waiting period of three months and subsequent diagnostic analysis are required before donations from people suspected of being infected.  //Causes of gonorrhea// Gonorrhea is caused by the transmission of bacteria through sexual contact (vaginal, anal or oral) between heterosexuals or same-sex partners. Sexual accessories are also a means of transmitting the disease, if they are not disinfected or protected with a condom (which must be replaced between uses). The possibility of contracting the disease is greater in women under 25 years of age, in men who have sex with other men and in people with risky sexual behavior.  //Symptoms of gonorrhea// About half of infected women do not suffer from gonorrhea symptoms, compared to just a tenth of infected men. Asymptomatic carriers can, however, transmit the bacteria, which causes the disease, to other people. The bacteria mainly affects the genital tract and rectum, where the first symptoms normally appear, also affecting the eyes, mouth and joints. Genital symptoms in men are mainly urinary pain, yellowish or greenish discharge and edema and pain in the testicles. In women, in addition to pain and discharge, there may be blood loss outside of menstruation and pain during sexual intercourse. In the rectal region, symptoms are common to both sexes: pruritus (itching), bleeding, pus-like discharge and pain when passing stool. False urges to urinate or evacuate (tenesmus) are also common. Isolated, this symptom often leads women to confuse gonorrhea with a urinary infection. Also inflammation in the eyes, sensitivity to light, sore throat, cough, and swelling and pain in the joints - as well as abdominal pain in women - are symptoms that occur occasionally.  //Diagnosis of gonorrhea// The incubation period for infection varies from two to five days and, as sometimes there are no symptoms, it is important to carry out testing in order to interrupt transmission. Faced with undiagnosed and untreated gonorrhea, a pregnant woman can transmit the bacteria to her baby during birth, causing eye disease, which, in severe cases, can lead to blindness. Diagnosis involves examining the genitals and discharge; if there are symptoms, urine analysis or samples of exudates from the urethra, anus, cervix or mouth are necessary. The diagnosis will confirm the presence of the bacteria and rule out other infections such as syphilis, chlamydia or HIV, enabling simultaneous transmission of different infectious agents. It is important to seek a doctor as soon as any symptoms appear that may indicate the disease, especially if you suspect a risk situation, namely sexual activity performed without a condom, or if you are informed of the diagnosis of another person with whom you have had sexual contact. After a positive diagnosis, it is essential to inform others with whom you have had sex.  //Gonorrhea treatment// Gonorrhea is treated with antibiotics and treatment may be recommended to the partner. After starting treatment, a follow-up visit is recommended after one to two weeks to confirm the absence of the bacteria. The infected person should abstain from sex during this period. Curing the disease does not mean immunity to the bacteria, which can be transmitted again.  //Prevention// Diagnosis and treatment are essential to combat the transmission of the disease, which, despite often being asymptomatic, can have severe consequences. In the most serious cases, gonorrhea causes infertility in men and women, and pelvic inflammatory disease in women. Prevention of the disease is essentially achieved through care during sexual relations: Use a condom whenever sexual contact occurs, including vaginal, oral and anal;;/ Test yourself regularly for STIs (sexually transmitted infections) - both yourself and your sexual partners;;/ Do not share sexual accessories, disinfect them well and protect them with a condom before being used by someone else;;/ Do not have sexual intercourse if you (or your partner) suspect an STD.;/ Association for Family Planning, March 2024 Directorate-General for Health, March 2024 Mayo Clinic, September 2023 NHS, September 2023 Pedipedia, March 2024 SNS24, September 2023 WebMD, September 2023 Load more;/ About us;/ Events;/ Clients and Companions;/ News;/ CUF Academic Center;/ Partnerships;/ Contacts;/ Frequently Asked Questions;/ Join us;/ Virtual Visit;/ English version;/ My CUF;/ Access Solutions and Health Plans;/ Facebook;/ Facebook Instagram;/ Instagram LinkedInCreated with Sketch.;/ LinkedIn Youtube;/ Youtube award4;/ award4 certification1;/ certification1 certification2;/ certification2 certification3;/ certification3 Complaints and compliments;/ Complaints and compliments Privacy and Cookies Policy;/ Terms and Conditions;/ Whistleblower Channel;/ © CUF 2024 All rights reserved Home;/ Health A-Z: Diseases, Symptoms and Treatments;/"
Drop,"//What is it?// It is a disease caused by an inflammatory response to sodium monourate crystals, which occurs in people with high levels of uric acid. There are acute and chronic forms. Acute forms appear as sudden, self-limited attacks of arthritis (swelling, redness, pain and heat in a joint). While chronic forms result in the deposition of crystal aggregates in and around the joints, with progressive joint destruction. In addition to these manifestations, gout presents renal symptoms (stones and kidney failure) and metabolic symptoms (high blood pressure, high triglycerides). Patients are often obese, with high alcohol consumption and insulin resistance. It is a very painful and disabling illness. It is more common in males and generally begins between the ages of 40 and 60, and may be associated with a family history. In females, the incidence of gout is higher in middle age, especially in women taking diuretics and/or drinking excessively. In both sexes, obesity, high blood pressure, hypertriglyceremia and kidney failure increase the risk of this pathology. It rarely affects children. The appearance of this disease in young people is often associated with genetic changes. The current prevalence of gout is about 14 cases per thousand in men and six per thousand in women. In Portugal, a prevalence of 1.6% is estimated. //Symptoms// Gout has three phases: Acute gouty arthritis usually occurs with inflammation of just one joint. The patient reports very intense joint pain with exuberant inflammatory signs (heat, redness and swelling), often starting at night, waking him up. The joints of the lower limbs are the most affected, particularly the first toe. This is followed by ankles, knees, wrists, fingers and elbows. The shoulders are rarely involved. When the foot is not affected in the first episode, it is very likely that it will be in the following episodes. The crisis resolves spontaneously after five to seven days.;/ The period between attacks, during which the patient is symptom-free.;/ Chronic tophaceous gout, which occurs in patients with untreated high uric acid levels for years. It is characterized by the presence of gouty tophi, which correspond to an accumulation of sodium monourate deposits in the joints and which, in the long term, contribute to the formation of bone lesions due to erosion. Tophus are found in the ear pinna, serous sacs, forearm, Achilles tendon, and fingers or toes. Sometimes there may be ulceration of these tophi, with the crystals coming out in the form of a milky liquid content.;/ //Causes// It occurs when excess uric acid accumulates in the body, forming crystals that are deposited in the joints. It can result from either an excess production of this acid or the kidneys' inability to remove it. Some foods and medications tend to increase levels of these hormones, which can cause attacks: seafood, red meat, excessive alcohol, sugary drinks, aspirin, some diuretics, and immunosuppressants. There also appears to be a family predisposition to this condition. //Diagnosis// There are several diseases with symptoms identical to gout. For this reason, a correct diagnosis is essential. The clinical history is an important element, as is the medical examination. Identification of urate crystals allows the doctor to know if he is dealing with gout. Crystals can be obtained by sucking fluid that is analyzed in the laboratory. Determining blood uric acid levels is equally important, although they may be normal during a seizure and may be elevated in people who have never had gout. Radiography allows us to assess the presence of joint damage and, if necessary, even ultrasound or computed tomography can be used. //Treatment// One of the medications used in acute attacks is colchicine, which is very effective but is associated with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and other side effects. Anti-inflammatories reduce inflammation and relieve pain. Corticosteroids may also be helpful. Allopurinol is a medicine that helps block the formation of uric acid. As this medication does not relieve acute attacks, it should be started after the attacks are controlled and, in general, should be used chronically. Probenecid helps the kidneys in the process of removing uric acid. There are other therapies that, depending on the clinical condition, can be used in your treatment, such as the use of warm or cold compresses that tend to alleviate the painful component of acute attacks. Diet is a relevant complement to treatment. Drinks rich in fructose and alcohol, especially beer, should be avoided. Meat and seafood can also raise uric acid levels. //Prevention// During symptom-free periods, it is important to drink two to four liters of fluids per day, of which at least half should be water. Sugary drinks and alcohol should be avoided. The diet should be balanced, containing fruit, vegetables, cereals and fat-free or low-fat dairy products. These types of products appear to have a protective effect against gout. Meat and fish should be limited and properly controlled. Losing weight also helps to reduce uric acid levels. However, prolonged fasting or rapid weight loss should be avoided, as these can cause a temporary increase in uric acid.

Halitosis,"//What is it?// Halitosis is the medical term used to designate the presence of unpleasant breath. Human breath is a gas with a complex composition, which includes multiple volatile compounds. There are several causes that determine the occurrence of these compounds, including general health status, physical condition, various diseases, food and medication intake, environmental factors and lifestyle. Around 75% of halitosis cases are oral in origin. Despite everything, this percentage has decreased in recent years, probably given the population's growing awareness of proper oral hygiene. Extraoral causes (respiratory system, digestive tract and systemic) are responsible for around 25% of occurrences. These are more complex to diagnose. In others, there is a gustatory or olfactory sensation generated by a decrease in salivary secretion, digestive problems, stress or anxiety, which can lead the person to believe that they are suffering from this pathology. It is estimated that up to around 30% of the world's population may have this problem frequently, regardless of gender, age and social class. Halitosis prevalence values ​​in international studies vary greatly, between 2% and 44%. In Portugal, the prevalence is 49.5%. It is a condition with an important social impact and on the self-esteem of those affected. In fact, while there may be some concerns about physical health, most are more concerned about the social implications of halitosis. //Symptoms// The odors associated with this problem are varied, depending on the cause. Some people worry a lot, even though they have mild halitosis and others, with severe bad breath, on the contrary, don't worry. //Causes// The presence of food particles on teeth increases the number of bacteria in the mouth;;/ Foods: such as onions, garlic and seasonings. These, after being digested, pass into the circulation, reach the lungs and affect breath;;/ Tobacco: either directly or by inducing gum disease;;/ Poor oral, tongue and denture hygiene;;/ Lack of regular use of dental floss;;/ Gingivitis and Peridontitis;;/ Saliva: is important for cleaning the mouth and removing particles from the mouth. Some medications can contribute to its reduced production, such as proton pump inhibitors, anxiolytics and antihistamines;;/ Mouth infections and inflammation of the nose, sinuses or throat;;/ Medications and illnesses: such as antidepressants, some types of cancer, metabolic diseases and gastroesophageal reflux;;/ Male gender;;/ Advanced age.;/ //Diagnosis// There are several ways to diagnose it, such as the patient's self-perception, olfactory tests and sulphur compound monitors. Gas chromatography is the most reliable and objective method, but it is a technique that is not always available. It allows the identification of the chemical agents responsible for halitosis. //Treatment// Oral and dental hygiene is an essential step. The treatment of gum disease, periodontitis and cavities is very important and must be complemented by correct oral hygiene, which should include good toothpaste, mouthwash and dental floss. When the cause is not oral, it is important to investigate other origins, and treatment varies depending on what is diagnosed. //Prevention// Oral hygiene can not only treat halitosis but is also very important in preventing it. Brushing your teeth and tongue after meals, using dental floss at least once a day, and properly cleaning your dentures are some of the possible forms of prevention. It should be noted that toothbrushes should be changed regularly, on average every two to three months. It is recommended to have a Stomatology or Dentistry consultation once or twice a year. It is equally important to avoid dry mouth by drinking plenty of water and avoiding tobacco, coffee, sugary drinks and alcohol. Using sugar-free chewing gum helps stimulate saliva production. As far as diet is concerned, very sweet foods and drinks should be excluded.

Hemorrhoids,"//What is it?// Everyone has hemorrhoids. These are normal veins that exist in the anal canal and that help contain feces. They are classified as internal hemorrhoids (located in the anal canal, above the anus) and external hemorrhoids (located under the skin, around the anus and outside the anal canal). When we say we have hemorrhoids, it usually means that they are the source of symptoms, which is why in these circumstances we speak of hemorrhoidal disease.  Sometimes, soft, painless folds of skin develop around the anus: these are called hemorrhoidal lumps and are different from hemorrhoids. The situation that most often leads to hemorrhoidal disease is constipation, causing the hemorrhoidal veins to dilate, become inflamed and can form proccidences around the anus. Situations such as prolonged diarrhea and others that increase pressure inside the abdomen (pregnancy, chronic cough, occupational factors) can also lead to hemorrhoidal disease. It is an extremely common disease in the adult population, being rare in childhood. Its prevalence, although high, is difficult to assess, with very different estimates emerging, with incidence values ​​ranging from 4.4% to 86%. It is thought that more than half of the population may develop hemorrhoids after the age of 30. There is no difference between the sexes, with it usually appearing in the third decade of life and reaching a peak between the ages of 45 and 65. In Portugal, it is believed that around 20% of the population over 50 years of age suffer from this pathology, and the number of surgeries exceeds 40 thousand per year. It is important to emphasize that there is no relationship between hemorrhoids and rectal cancer. Although the symptoms, in particular blood loss, can simulate it, it is essential that it is excluded by carrying out a complete medical investigation, especially after the age of 50. //Symptoms// The most common symptoms are blood loss and protrusion during bowel movements, itching in the anal region and pain. Hemorrhoids begin to show symptoms when they increase in size. This can happen due to an increase in pressure in the anal canal caused, for example, by constipation or, in the case of pregnant women, by the weight of the fetus on the rectal and anal area. The main symptom is bleeding of bright red blood, which can be light and only visible on toilet paper or be abundant, covering the feces or even dripping into the toilet. Sometimes hemorrhoids are so large that they come out or prolapse through the anus, causing pain. These symptoms always appear after straining to evacuate or when passing hard stools. External hemorrhoids can accumulate blood and form a clot due to difficulty draining them, also caused by increased pressure in the anal canal. In this case, a hemorrhoidal thrombosis forms, which is very painful and is characterized by a hard ""lump"" around the anus. Hemorrhoidal shellfish may occasionally itch, especially when they are very bulky. //Causes// There is no exact cause. The vertical posture itself creates greater pressure on the rectal veins, which tends to cause them to prolapse. The most frequently associated factors are age, chronic constipation, excessive straining during bowel movements, pregnancy, intestinal malfunction caused by excessive use of laxatives or enemas, anal infections, cirrhosis of the liver and heredity. When the tissues supporting the veins stretch, they dilate, causing their walls to become thinner and more likely to bleed. If the pressure continues, the vessels will eventually prolapse. Sitting for long periods of time is another factor to consider. //Diagnosis// By proctological examination, which includes anal and perianal inspection, rectal examination and anoscopy. Anoscopy allows visualization of the anal canal through a short tube (anoscope) that is connected to a light source. When the main symptom is bleeding, it is necessary to complete the investigation with the study of the rectum and colon by performing a fibrosigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. //Treatment// Treatment depends on the severity of the condition. Milder symptoms can be relieved by dietary measures, such as increasing the intake of fiber (fruit, vegetables, bread, cereals) and fluids. It is important to reduce straining during bowel movements in order to reduce pressure on the hemorrhoids and prevent them from prolapse. There are some medications, such as corticosteroid ointments, that can relieve the symptoms. A warm bath for a few minutes offers some relief. This type of measure allows the pain and swelling to decrease and the hemorrhoid nodules to disappear. There are other therapeutic options, such as sclerosis or the use of an elastic ligature. In sclerosis, a substance is injected to cause fibrosis of the tissues and their irrigation, thus reducing prolapse and bleeding. Elastic ligation consists of inserting an elastic ring into the base of the hemorrhoid in order to produce a strangulation with the formation of an ulcer whose healing allows the mucosa to be fixed to the deep planes. In more serious cases: Instrumental therapy: is performed through the anoscope and consists of Sclerosis (injection of a substance that occludes and reduces the hemorrhoid) or Elastic ligation (placement of an elastic band that causes reduction and elimination of the hemorrhoid). Sometimes these two methods are used simultaneously. These are painless treatments, performed on an outpatient basis, and do not require hospitalization. 3 to 4 sessions may be necessary to complete the treatment.;/ Surgical therapy: surgery is indicated in the most serious situations and is necessary in approximately 10% to 15% of cases. In general, it does not require hospitalization and should be the preferred option when non-surgical treatments have proven ineffective, when there are lesions in the anus, in the presence of significant hemorrhage or prolapse and in cases of recurrent thrombosis.;/ Treatment of hemorrhoidal thrombosis: when the thrombus is under tension and is very painful, it must be removed with a small incision under local anesthesia.;/ //Prevention// Some important aspects are the regular intake of liquids and fiber, using laxatives in case of constipation to avoid straining during bowel movements and avoiding a sedentary lifestyle.

Hemovitreo,"//What is it?// Hemovitreous corresponds to the presence of blood inside the eye at the level of the vitreous humor. The vitreous is a gelatinous and transparent substance, located in the posterior 2/3 of the eye between the lens and the retina. The presence of blood leads to loss of its transparency and consequent loss of vision. //Symptoms// Hemovitreous is the main cause of sudden, painless vision loss. The main symptoms are: Dark moving spots (floaters);/ Blurred vision;/ Loss of vision (varies depending on the intensity of the hemorrhage);/ //Causes// Hemovitreous lesions can be divided into traumatic and non-traumatic. In non-traumatic cases, the most common causes are: Diabetic retinopathy;/ Retinal tears;/ Retinal detachment;/ Posterior vitreous detachment;/ Retinal vein occlusions;/ Age-related macular degeneration;/  //Treatment// As the causes are varied, treatment must be individualized according to the origin of the bleeding. Treatment may involve clinical surveillance until blood reabsorption occurs. Full recovery of vision can occur over months. In other situations, due to the cause of the hemorrhage or failure to resolve the clinical situation, surgery (vitrectomy) and/or laser photocoagulation may be necessary. Myopia, astigmatism and hyperopia often lead to the use of glasses or contact lenses. LASIK surgery can restore good vision. It's important to have sunglasses on hand all year round.

Hepatitis,"//What is it?//  Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver that can have several causes, the most common being viruses. The liver performs several functions in the body, such as those related to digestion, energy storage or removal of toxins. When hepatitis occurs, the liver is unable to perform its functions and the damage caused to it can develop into cirrhosis or cancer. Since there are several types, their severity varies greatly. Some forms are resolved only with rest, while in other cases there may be a need to resort to a more complex treatment that allows the progression of the disease to be controlled without curing it. Within hepatitis caused by bacteria or viruses, there are six different types of viruses: A, B, C, D, E and G.  //Hepatitis A// Hepatitis A and E result from ingesting contaminated water or food. B, C and D require the virus to come into contact with the patient's blood from other fluids, as can occur in sexual intercourse, blood transfusion, sharing syringes or transmission from mother to child during pregnancy. Recently discovered, G is transmitted, above all, through blood contact. The most common viral forms are responsible for thousands of cases around the world. Hepatitis B and C often develop into a chronic disease. Hepatitis A is common in Portugal. In general, it appears in childhood or young adulthood. It heals after three to five weeks and does not evolve into a chronic disease. It rarely requires hospitalization. Initially it resembles the flu with fever, muscle pain and general malaise, then jaundice, lack of appetite and vomiting appear. There is no specific medication and treatment involves rest and a diet high in protein and low in fat. Although it is a mild form, it can be fatal in areas with poor sanitation. Prevention involves hygiene measures such as washing your hands whenever you come into contact with potentially contaminated materials and, if you go to Asia, Africa or Central and South America, choosing to drink bottled water and eating packaged foods. There is a vaccine that is recommended for people who travel frequently or stay for long periods in countries where the disease is common.  //Hepatitis B// Hepatitis B is perhaps the most dangerous and serious, affecting millions of people around the world. It can become chronic and can be fatal, progressing to liver cancer. The main forms of contagion are sexual contact and the sharing of syringes among those who inject drugs. According to the World Health Organization, throughout the world this type has infected two billion people and causes the death of 600,000 per day. In Portugal, hepatitis B affects around 1% to 1.5% of the population. In acute forms, treatment involves rest. In chronic forms, medications such as interferons and others are used to control Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection. Although it is a serious form, it can be prevented by vaccination, which is around 95% effective. This is administered in three doses and is included in the National Immunization Program. //// //Hepatitis C// Hepatitis C very frequently evolves into chronic forms. It is estimated that there are 150 thousand patients with this condition in Portugal. Those most affected are injecting drug users and people who received a blood transfusion before 1992. Sexual contact is a possible form of infection, although less common. It can progress to serious liver disease and is, in Portugal, the main origin of liver cancer (60% of cases) and one of the most important causes of cirrhosis (25% of occurrences). Chronic hepatitis C is treated with peginterferon, whether or not associated with other medications. In situations of advanced liver disease, a liver transplant may be necessary. Data from the World Health Organization inform that there are around 150 million people infected with this virus and that more than 350,000 die each year from liver disease related to hepatitis C. There is no vaccine. //// //Hepatitis D// Hepatitis D only occurs in patients with type B virus, increasing the severity of this infection. Contagion is caused by contact with contaminated blood or sexual fluids. Although there is no vaccine for this type, as it can only infect patients with type B, immunization against hepatitis B also prevents infection by this virus. //// //Hepatitis E// Hepatitis E is transmitted by consumption of contaminated water or food and, in general, does not progress to chronicity. The risk of complications is greater in pregnant women. This hepatitis affects around 4.2% of the Brazilian population and there is already a tested vaccine, although not yet commercialized. //// //Hepatitis G// Hepatitis G was discovered more recently. All possible forms of contagion are still unknown, but it is known that it is transmitted, above all, through blood contact. //Symptoms// Most of the time it is not associated with any symptoms. When they occur, the most common are fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, dark urine and light stools, abdominal pain, and yellow coloration of the skin and eyes (jaundice).  Hepatitis can become chronic and can progress to more serious damage to the liver, such as cirrhosis or even liver cancer, when the clinical picture persists for more than six months. All types of hepatitis require a medical consultation and appropriate monitoring. //Causes// They can be caused by infectious agents, such as bacteria or viruses, or by the consumption of alcohol, medicines and some plants. There are also autoimmune hepatitis, in which the immune system attacks liver cells. This type mainly affects women, between 20 and 30 years old and between 40 and 60 years old. //Diagnosis// Through medical observation and the patient's clinical history, combined with laboratory tests that are considered appropriate. //Treatment// In general, in an acute phase, treatment essentially involves allowing the liver to recover, with physical rest and diet being important. The use of specific medications is important in the most serious and chronic forms, and should always be assessed on a case-by-case basis. These drugs seek to limit the multiplication of the virus and, therefore, reduce damage caused to the liver. //Prevention// Hepatitis can be a serious and difficult disease to treat. Effective prevention starts with each person's behavior. Hepatitis A is caused by the hepatitis A virus (HAV) and is mainly transmitted through contaminated food and untreated water. Preventing hepatitis A:Wash your hands with soap and water after going to the bathroomConsume only foods that have just been cookedDrink commercially bottled or boiled water if you are unsure of local sanitationEat peelable fruits if you are in a place with sanitation inappropriate You should only eat raw vegetables if you are sure they have been cleaned or disinfected completely Get vaccinated against hepatitis A before traveling to places where hepatitis A is endemic;/ Wash your hands with soap and water after using the bathroom;/ Only consume food that has just been cooked;/ Drink commercially bottled or boiled water if you are unsure of local sanitation;/ Eat peelable fruit if you are in a place with inadequate sanitation;/ You should only eat raw vegetables if you are sure that they have been thoroughly cleaned or disinfected.;/ Getting the hepatitis A vaccine before traveling to places where it is endemic;/ Hepatitis B is caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and is transmitted through contact with blood, semen and other body fluids. Can be transmitted sexually Prevention of hepatitis B:Inform any sexual partner if they carry the virus or assess whether they carry the diseasePractice safe sex using condomsUse only sterilized, disposable needlesDo not share toothbrushes, razors or manicure instrumentsOnly allow the use of piercing equipment properly sterilized skin (tattoo, piercing or acupuncture) Get vaccinated against hepatitis B if you are at risk;/ Inform any sexual partner if you are a carrier of the virus or assess whether they are a carrier of the disease;/ Practice safe sex using condoms;/ Use only sterile, disposable needles;/ Do not share toothbrushes, razors or manicure instruments.;/ Only allow the use of properly sterilized skin piercing equipment (tattoo, piercing or acupuncture);/ Get vaccinated against hepatitis B if you are at risk;/ Hepatitis C is usually acquired via injection from infected syringes How to prevent hepatitis C: Do not share needles, toothbrushes or manicure tools.

Hernia abdominal,"//What is it?// It corresponds to an area of ​​weakness in the abdominal wall that allows part of the intestine or another organ in this cavity to protrude to the outside. Umbilical hernias are one of the common forms in the abdomen, as well as inguinal hernias that occur in the groin area. Another form is the incisional one that appears in the area where a surgical incision was made. It is estimated that around 10% of the population may develop a type of hernia during their lifetime. In the United States of America, around half a million surgeries are performed every year. Even in Portugal, it is one of the most frequent. Inguinal hernias are more common in men and umbilical hernias predominate in women. As a rule, its incidence increases with age. //Symptoms// Detection of a bulge under the skin, usually painless, but which can cause discomfort and become more evident during activities that involve effort, such as coughing. The hernia tends to diminish or disappear when lying down. The symptoms depend on the organ that has been introduced into the abdominal wall. In addition to the intestine, a hernia can contain the bladder, colon or nerves, with different manifestations occurring in the urinary or sexual sphere. In the initial stages, it is possible to reduce it, that is, to push its contents into the abdominal cavity. When it becomes larger, it can become incarcerated and it is no longer possible to reduce it. If the blood flow is interrupted, strangulation occurs, which is manifested by pain, nausea, vomiting and cessation of bowel movements with constipation. In this case, the skin over the hernia becomes red, with marked signs of inflammation. Fever may occur. In the strangulated form, it is a surgical emergency because the intestine or another organ may enter a phase of necrosis, causing a potentially fatal inflammation of the abdominal cavity, called peritonitis. //Causes// The most common are obesity, pregnancy, activities such as lifting weights, chronic cough (which occurs in diseases such as cystic fibrosis or chronic lung infections), constipation, male gender, existence of a family history and abdominal surgery. All of these factors, either due to increased pressure or weakness of the abdominal wall, increase the risk of developing an abdominal hernia. //Diagnosis// In addition to the medical examination, a simple abdominal X-ray can be very useful. Ultrasound and computed axial tomography are also important for diagnosis. //Treatment// For small hernias, treatment involves avoiding activities that involve effort, such as lifting weights or other types of strenuous exercise. Wearing a belt helps to reinforce the weakened area of ​​the abdominal wall. In general, surgery is indicated when the hernia causes significant pain or discomfort. The surgery performed is called herniorrhaphy and involves closing the weakest area of ​​the muscle wall. When this area is extensive, synthetic materials are used to reinforce the weakened structures. //Prevention// Maintaining proper posture whenever lifting heavy objects, maintaining a healthy weight and normal intestinal transit (avoiding constipation by consuming plenty of fluids and fiber and avoiding holding back the urge to evacuate for too long). Regular physical exercise is also important, helping to strengthen abdominal muscles and control weight.

discal hernia,"//What is it?// In intervertebral disc disease, there may or may not be a rupture of the ligament with the disc contents escaping into the canal (foramen) with consequent compression on the nerve structures, spinal cord and/or nerve root. This compression may exist even if there is no rupture of the ligament surrounding the disc, which may be enlarged and thus compress the nerve structures. A herniated disc occurs when the nucleus pulposus, which forms the central part of the intervertebral disc, prolapses through a rupture in the surrounding annulus fibrosus and compresses neighboring structures. When a herniated disc compresses a nerve, it can cause pain, numbness, and loss of strength in the area of ​​the body that corresponds to that nerve. //Symptoms// A herniated disc can compress a spinal nerve, causing pain in the arm and hand (brachialgia) and/or in the neck (cervical herniation), numbness, tingling, changes in sensation and muscle weakness. In some cases, the herniation compresses the spinal cord, causing severe neurological dysfunction, with loss of balance, motor coordination, or generalized muscle weakness. A herniated disc can also compress a spinal nerve, causing pain in the leg and foot (sciatica) and/or in the back (lumbar herniation), numbness, tingling, changes in sensation and muscle weakness. A herniated disc can be caused by exertion, but it is common for the patient to not remember any particular activity or event that triggered the symptoms. //Causes// The natural wear and tear of the vertebrae as a result of repeated movements over time, as well as the bearing of excessive loads, are the main causes of degeneration of the intervertebral discs and herniated discs. The discs in the spine lose part of their nucleus pulposus as a person ages. This reduction in fluid makes them less flexible and more prone to herniating. It is not always possible to know exactly when the problem began, but it often occurs when lifting heavy objects. //Diagnosis// Although X-rays are part of the study of back or leg pain (in the case of lumbar disc herniation) or neck or arm pain (in the case of cervical disc herniation), in general, disc herniation cannot be seen in this examination since it is formed by non-bony material. The ideal examination for its diagnosis is Magnetic Resonance Imaging, or alternatively Computerized Axial Tomography. In some cases, a study of nerve conduction and Electromyography may be useful. //Treatment// Conservative, non-surgical treatment is effective in most patients and should be attempted initially. Treatment options include short-term rest, anti-inflammatory and analgesic medications, oral corticosteroids and physiotherapy. In selected cases, epidural injections (interlaminar or transforaminal) may provide lasting symptomatic relief. Surgery is only indicated in cases of persistent, recurrent or worsening symptoms after at least 6 weeks of conservative treatment, or in patients who initially present with significant motor deficits or urinary or bowel dysfunction. In the case of lumbar disc herniation, microdiscectomy is the most commonly used surgical procedure. It consists of removing the herniated fragment, thus decompressing the nerve, and can be performed using conventional or minimally invasive techniques. When it comes to a cervical disc herniation, microdiscectomy and anterior arthrodesis are the most commonly used surgical procedures and consist of removing the disc and herniated fragment via the anterior route and promoting intervertebral fusion by placing a bone graft taken from the iliac or a device containing a bone substitute. In selected cases, a cervical disc prosthesis may alternatively be placed in order to maintain movement of the affected segment. //Prevention// It is not always possible to prevent a herniated disc, but there are ways to reduce your risk: Use proper techniques when lifting weights. Do not bend at the waist, but rather at the knees, keeping your back straight.;/ Maintain a healthy weight. Excess weight increases the load on the lower back;/ Have correct posture when walking, sitting, standing and sleeping;/ Stretch frequently when sitting for a long time.;/ Do not wear high heel shoes;/ Exercise regularly to keep your back, leg and abdominal muscles strong.;/ Quit smoking;/ Eat healthy, balanced meals;/ WebMD Medical New Today Cleveland Clinic Load more;/ Anyone who has a herniated disc knows (and well) that carrying out some of the simplest everyday tasks is enough to cause a pain crisis.

Sportsman's hernia,"//What is it?// Also known as “pubalgia” or “athlete’s hernia”, it is a situation described several decades ago, being one of the differential diagnoses to be considered in the study of pubalgic syndromes, present in some athletes. The sportsman's inguinal hernia results from a weakness of the posterior wall of the inguinal canal but, unlike the previous scenario, here there is no detectable hernia on physical examination. It is a musculotendinous injury in the inguinal region. It is a painful injury to the soft tissues in the groin area that almost always occurs during sports that involve sudden changes in direction or twisting movements. Although a sportsman's hernia can develop into a traditional hernia, it is a different type of injury resulting from a tear in a soft tissue (muscle, tendon, or ligament) in the lower abdominal or groin area. The muscles most affected in this injury are the obliques of the lower abdominal wall as well as their tendons. One of the most affected areas is the insertion site of the thigh adductor muscle tendons into the pubic bone while the traditional hernia occurs in the inguinal canal. In 12% of cases it is bilateral. Men are affected more often than women. This situation affects 0.5 to 6.2% of athletes, of which 58% are professional football players. Ice hockey players tend to have at least one episode per season. //Symptoms// A sportsman's hernia is manifested by intense pain in the groin area at the time of the injury. This pain tends to improve with rest and resumes with sporting activity, especially with twisting movements. The pain becomes more intense during sporting activity and worsens with coughing or sneezing and with the act of kicking, in the case of football. This pain can radiate to the testicles. In this hernia, a protrusion in the groin is not visible, unlike inguinal hernia. However, a sportsman's hernia can develop into an inguinal hernia. This condition does not lend itself to physiotherapy treatment or rest measures, often forcing the athlete to stop playing sports for weeks or even months. If this injury is not treated, it can become chronic, with permanent pain that prevents sports. //Causes// Sports activities that involve placing the foot on the ground and twisting movements are those most frequently involved in soft tissue injuries to the lower abdomen or groin. Sudden changes in direction and foot movements are also associated with this type of hernia. Some of the sports most often associated with this injury are ice hockey, wrestling, tennis and football. It is not just professional athletes who are affected by this injury. It can occur at any level of physical activity. Another risk factor is the existence of an imbalance between the strength of the lower limbs and the lower abdominals. The existence of training plans that neglect the abdominal obliques can contribute to this problem. //Diagnosis// As there is no visible or palpable protrusion, the diagnosis is more difficult and is based on a medical examination, with some physical tests. X-rays, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging allow you to obtain additional information and exclude other injuries. Ultrasonography is also very effective in this diagnosis. //Treatment// Treatment focuses on rest and ice for seven to ten days. After two weeks, physical therapy should be started to increase the strength and flexibility of the abdominal and thigh muscles. Ice should be applied for 20-minute periods, three to four times a day. Anti-inflammatories help reduce pain and inflammation. If symptoms persist, it may be important to inject corticosteroids into the lesion site. In most cases, treatment for four to six weeks allows for a complete recovery. If pain returns when sports activities are resumed, the surgical option should be considered. Surgery allows the repair of damaged tissue and can be performed using the traditional method or laparoscopy, which is less invasive and allows for a faster recovery. In some cases, the inguinal nerve is severed during surgery to reduce pain. In other cases of persistent pain, the tendon that connects the thigh adductor muscles to the pubic bone is severed to relieve tension and increase range of motion. After surgery, a rehabilitation plan is defined which, in general, allows the resumption of sports practice 6 to 12 weeks later. In some cases, a sportsman's hernia may recur requiring another surgery. //Prevention// Prevention involves training appropriate to each type of sport, with strength and flexibility exercises. This training should provide a balance between the abdominal and leg muscles, so that the effort is distributed evenly.

A hiatus hernia,"//What is it?// A hiatal hernia is the protrusion of part of the stomach through the diaphragm, passing from its normal position in the abdomen into the thoracic cavity. The abdomen is separated from the chest by a muscle called the diaphragm. The esophagus passes through it in an area called the diaphragmatic hiatus, before it joins the stomach. Therefore, the stomach is located entirely in the abdomen, below the diaphragm, and the esophagus is in the chest. This position of the digestive tract in relation to the diaphragm is not static and varies slightly with body position, abdominal pressure and breathing. There are four types of hernia, with type I, caused by the connection between the esophagus and stomach sliding upwards towards the diaphragm, responsible for around 95% of cases. The larger the hernia, the more common are complaints of “gastroesophageal reflux”, that is, a feeling of heartburn in the chest and the presence of substances in the throat, behind the sternum, due to stomach acid in the esophagus that causes lesions. on your wall. Hiatal hernia is relatively common, being reported in more than a third of elderly people. //Symptoms// The main complaints of hiatal hernia are heartburn and regurgitation, that is, a sensation of stomach contents rising up towards the throat. A large hernia can also cause difficulty in passing food, with difficulty in swallowing (dysphagia). However, not all hernias cause these symptoms, as there must also be a malfunction of the muscle at the end of the esophagus, the lower esophageal sphincter. This function prevents stomach contents, often acidic, from passing into the esophagus (gastroesophageal reflux). More than 40% of people have a sliding hiatal hernia, but the majority are asymptomatic and when they are not, the signs are usually of little importance. However, if it becomes trapped or compressed by the diaphragm and there is not enough blood, it is a serious and painful problem called strangulation that requires immediate surgery. In exceptional cases, microscopic or massive hemorrhage of its lining may occur. //Causes// A hiatal hernia can be a congenital deficiency or a consequence of thoracic or abdominal trauma, among others. This deficiency translates into weakness of the diaphragm or the presence of a very large gap that allows the stomach to pass through. Although congenital hernias can occur, most appear in adulthood. The causes may be shortening of the esophagus or increased abdominal pressure that pushes the stomach toward the chest. The effort of vomiting can temporarily create this type of hernia in anyone. Likewise, excessive and sustained pressure on adjacent muscles, caused for example by coughing, sneezing, straining to defecate or lifting weights, may also be at its origin. Hiatal hernia is more common in people over 60 years of age and in obese people. //Diagnosis// X-rays usually clearly reveal their presence, although sometimes the doctor may have to press hard on the abdomen to reveal a sliding hiatal hernia. Imaging studies using contrast and computed tomography may be performed in urgent cases. The severity of the hernia is usually assessed by endoscopy. //Treatment// Most patients with hiatal hernia improve with general care alone: ​​diet, posture and medication. Definitive treatment involves surgery. It is indicated due to the presence of gastroesophageal reflux and the changes caused by it. //Prevention// Prevention involves avoiding wearing very tight clothing, avoiding bending over or lying down after meals, not eating too much at each meal so as not to overfill the stomach, controlling constipation, sleeping with the head of the bed elevated, not smoking and maintaining a healthy weight.

Hernia epigastrica,"//What is it?// It is similar to an umbilical hernia, but forms above the belly button. In general, they are small hernias and, therefore, only the lining of the abdominal cavity (peritoneum) can pass through. In the most serious cases, it allows the passage of an organ or part of the abdominal cavity. It occurs when weakness in the abdominal muscles allows tissue to protrude through the muscle. This type of hernia is usually present at birth and may heal without treatment as the child grows and the abdominal muscles strengthen. This type of hernia is more common in males by a ratio of three to one and its incidence is low, affecting less than 1% of the adult population. //Symptoms// Sometimes it is only visible when the child cries or does an activity that requires contracting the abdominal muscles. When it is visible, it is easily diagnosable and no other types of tests are necessary. If it becomes painful to the touch or the skin turns red and if these signs are accompanied by nausea, vomiting and pain, the hernia may have strangulated, a situation that requires urgent medical evaluation. It is important to remember that any strangulated hernia can be associated with the death of the tissues that were retained, with a consequent risk of infection, perforation and even death. //Causes// Although it usually occurs at birth, it can also develop in adulthood, in which case it is the result of a weakness of the abdominal wall, lifting heavy objects, coughing, constipation or being overweight. //Diagnosis// Observation of an epigastric hernia is sufficient to obtain a diagnosis. If necessary, an ultrasound or radiographic study may be requested to identify intestinal occlusion or other types of hernia. //Treatment// It does not heal spontaneously and, as such, always requires surgery. However, this can be postponed until the child is older, as long as strangulation does not occur. This way, it is more easily tolerated. There are two types of surgery, depending on the size of the hernia. For smaller hernias, laparoscopic surgery is preferred. For larger hernias, a classic abdominal technique is used. This is generally performed under general anesthesia and does not always require hospitalization. In the case of small hernias, the defect in the muscle wall is repaired using a suture. When the hernia is larger, a permanent mesh is placed to cover the defect in the wall. In most cases, patients can resume normal activities within two to four weeks. In the initial phase, it is best to avoid exertion that causes increased abdominal pressure, such as coughing, sneezing, crying, vomiting, sudden movements, or straining during bowel movements. //Prevention// When an epigastric hernia results from a congenital disorder, it cannot be prevented. In other cases, prevention involves avoiding excess effort and pressure on the abdominal wall. Don't smoke (to avoid bronchitis and coughing), maintain a healthy weight, avoid sudden weight gain, avoid lifting very heavy objects, prevent constipation and treat illnesses and allergies that often cause coughing, sneezing and vomiting.

Hernia inguinal,"//What is it?// An abdominal hernia is a weak spot in the abdominal wall that allows part of the intestine or another organ to protrude. Umbilical hernias are a common form of abdominal hernia, as are inguinal hernias, which occur in the groin area. An inguinal hernia occurs when part of the lining of the abdominal cavity or a portion of the intestine pushes through a weak spot in the abdominal muscles. This is usually painful. The occurrence of an inguinal hernia makes it more likely that a second hernia will occur on the opposite side. The prevalence of hernias in the general population is estimated to be 3 to 8%. Inguinal hernias are twice as common on the right side as on the left in men up to the age of 40; in men over the age of 40, 40% of inguinal hernias are bilateral. In the case of inguinal hernia, as the male fetus develops during pregnancy, the testicles descend from the abdomen into the scrotum through an area called the inguinal canal. When a hernia forms because the hole is wider and the ligaments are weaker than normal, it is called congenital or indirect. When the passage of the intestine is due to a defect at the base of the inguinal canal, it is called acquired or direct. Soon after the baby is born, this canal closes, preventing the testicles from returning to the abdominal cavity. If this canal does not close completely, part of the intestine can enter there, causing a hernia. This canal is also present in female babies and, therefore, inguinal hernias can also occur in girls. These occur in about 1% to 3% of all children and are more common in premature babies. Males are more affected than females. They are more common on the right although they can affect both sides. //Symptoms// An inguinal hernia may be asymptomatic. However, it is possible to see or feel the bulge created by the hernia in the groin or scrotum, especially when standing, coughing or straining. In babies, crying tends to accentuate this protrusion and, on the contrary, it reduces when the baby is more relaxed. Many hernias do not cause any symptoms and are discovered by chance. In other cases, the protrusion is visible, especially when standing and when coughing or making other efforts. A hernia can cause a burning or painful sensation, especially when bending forward, coughing or lifting weights. There may also be a feeling of heaviness, weakness or pressure in the groin area. Occasionally, there is pain and swelling around the testicles, which indicates the descent of the intestine into the scrotum. Complications result from the incarceration of the hernia contents, making it impossible for them to be reinserted into the abdominal cavity. This reduces blood flow to the affected segment of the intestine and causes pain and tissue damage. When this flow is completely interrupted, we are faced with a strangulated hernia which, if left untreated, causes tissue death, with infection that spreads throughout the abdomen and can be fatal. Symptoms include pain, nausea, vomiting and cessation of bowel movements with constipation. In this case, the skin over the hernia becomes red, with marked signs of inflammation. Signs of strangulation include the presence of nausea and/or vomiting, fever, increased heart rate, sudden pain that increases very quickly and a change in the appearance of the hernia protrusion, becoming redder or darker. Strangulation may occur in 1.3 to 3% of hernias. A strangulated hernia is a surgical emergency because the intestine or other organ may enter a necrotic phase, causing a potentially fatal inflammation of the abdominal cavity, called peritonitis. //Causes// There is not always an apparent cause for an inguinal hernia. Often, the weakness of the abdominal wall is present from birth. In other cases, this weakness appears later in life due to age, intense physical activity, coughing associated with smoking, trauma or abdominal surgery. In men, the point of weakness is the inguinal canal, where the spermatic cord passes from the testicle. In women, a ligament that holds the uterus in position passes through this canal and the hernia can occur at the point where the uterus attaches to the pubic bone. In any case, inguinal hernias are about ten times more common in men. Inguinal hernias are more common in children who have a family history of hernias, cystic fibrosis, hip dysplasia, undescended testicles, and urethral anomalies. In adults, the most common causes are those that cause an increase in abdominal pressure: obesity, pregnancy, especially multiple pregnancy, activities such as lifting weights, chronic cough that occurs in diseases such as cystic fibrosis or chronic lung infections, constipation and performing abdominal surgery. Smoking, malnutrition and old age are other risk factors. //Diagnosis// In addition to the medical examination, a simple abdominal X-ray can be very useful. Ultrasound and computed axial tomography are also important diagnostic techniques. //Treatment// In the case of small, symptom-free hernias, regular surveillance may be sufficient. However, most inguinal hernias, if not treated surgically, tend to enlarge as a result of pressure exerted by the surrounding tissues, so early surgery is important to avoid the risk of entrapment of the intestine in the inguinal canal. For large hernias with complaints, surgery is essential and can be performed via laparoscopy or the classic route. In the classic approach, an incision is made in the groin area, the herniated contents are placed back into the abdominal cavity and the muscle wall is closed and reinforced with synthetic material. After surgery, activities are gradually resumed, and it usually takes about six weeks to return to a normal level of activity. In laparoscopy, small incisions are made in the abdomen and through them the hernia is repaired and reinforced. This type of intervention allows for a faster and less uncomfortable recovery. //Prevention// Prevention involves reducing the strain on the muscles and abdominal cavity, although it is not possible to prevent an inguinal hernia that occurs after birth. In adults, it involves adopting a good posture whenever lifting weights, maintaining a healthy weight and normal intestinal transit, avoiding constipation by consuming enough fluids and fiber and avoiding holding back the urge to evacuate the intestines for too long. Regular physical exercise is also important, helping to strengthen the abdominal muscles and controlling weight. The use of containment beads can keep the hernia in place but does not correct the problem.

Hernia umbilical,"//What is it?// An abdominal hernia is a weak area in the abdominal wall that allows part of the intestine or another organ in the abdominal cavity to protrude outwards. The umbilical hernia is one of the most common forms. Generally speaking, it is harmless. It is more common in children, but can also affect adults. Some estimates suggest that around 10% of children have it. In childhood, the umbilical hernia becomes more visible when crying. Most of these hernias close during the first year of life, although they may take longer. When they do not close by the age of three, or when they appear in adulthood, surgery is important to avoid complications. Umbilical hernias tend to be more common in premature or low birth weight babies and affect both sexes in equal percentages, although some studies indicate a higher prevalence in females. In the case of adults, it is more common in women aged between 50 and 70 years. //Symptoms// It is manifested by the presence of a soft protrusion near the navel. Crying, coughing or other efforts make it more evident and, conversely, it reduces when the child is lying down or is calmer. In childhood, it tends to be painless. In adults, it can cause abdominal discomfort. Complications are rare in minors and result from the incarceration of the hernia contents, making it impossible to reinsert them into the abdominal cavity. This incarceration reduces blood flow to the affected segment of intestine, causing umbilical pain and tissue damage. When this flow is completely interrupted, we are dealing with a strangulated hernia which, if left untreated, causes tissue death, with infection that spreads throughout the abdomen and can be fatal. Strangulation manifests itself through pain, nausea, vomiting and cessation of bowel movements with constipation. In this case, the skin over the hernia becomes red, with marked signs of inflammation. Fever may occur. A strangulated hernia is a surgical emergency because the intestine or another organ may enter a phase of necrosis, causing a potentially fatal inflammation of the abdominal cavity, called peritonitis. In adults, the risk of incarceration is higher. //Causes// During pregnancy, the umbilical cord passes through a small opening in the abdominal muscles and this, in general, closes shortly after birth. If the muscles do not come together completely in the midline of the abdomen, a zone of weakness is created that allows the umbilical hernia to form at birth or later. In adults, the most common causes are those that cause increased abdominal pressure: obesity, pregnancy, especially multiple pregnancy, activities such as lifting weights, chronic cough (which occurs in diseases such as cystic fibrosis or chronic lung infections), constipation and abdominal surgery. //Diagnosis// In addition to the medical examination, a simple abdominal X-ray may be useful. Ultrasound and computed axial tomography are important techniques for diagnosis. //Treatment// Most umbilical hernias in children close before the age of 18 months. Surgery is only indicated if it is painful, if its diameter is greater than 1.5 centimeters, if it does not decrease in size after six to 12 months, if it does not disappear by the age of three or if incarceration occurs. In adults, surgery allows you to avoid complications, especially if the hernia becomes larger or is painful. The surgery performed is called herniorrhaphy and corresponds to the closure of the area of ​​weakness in the muscular wall. When this area is extensive, synthetic materials are used to reinforce the weakened structures. Relapses are rare. //Prevention// It is not possible to prevent the condition that occurs after birth. In adults, it involves adopting a good posture whenever lifting weights, maintaining a healthy weight and having a normal intestinal transit, avoiding constipation by consuming enough fluids and fiber and avoiding holding back the urge to evacuate the intestines for too long. Regular physical exercise is also important, helping to strengthen the abdominal muscles and controlling weight.

Herpes genital,"//What is genital herpes?// Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted disease that affects the genital region and is caused by the Herpes simplex virus. There are two types of herpes simplex virus (HSV-1 and HSV-2). HSV-2 is usually transmitted sexually, while HSV-1 usually infects the mouth, nose, or, more rarely, the eyes. Both types can affect the genitals and the skin around the rectum or hands (especially the nail beds) and can be transmitted to other parts of the body. The prevalence of HSV-1 infection is 60% to 80% in the world population, which may mean that there is a large reservoir of this virus. This incidence depends on age, being over 40% at 15 years of age and 60% to 90% in adults. In developed countries, it is 20% at five years of age and 40% to 60% between the ages of 20 and 40. The current trend is for the incidence of HSV-1 to exceed that of HSV-2. Genital herpes is more common in women than in men because the virus is easier to transmit from man to woman than in the opposite direction. //Sintomas do herpes genital// Symptoms of the first bout of infection usually begin four to seven days after infection and include itching, tingling, and pain. In a second phase, a small reddish plaque appears, followed by a group of small, painful blisters or vesicles that rupture and merge to form circular ulcers, which are generally painful and covered with crusts within a few days. Depending on the location of the infection, difficulty urinating and, in certain cases, pain when walking may occur. Ulcers heal after 10 days and may leave scars. Lymph nodes in the groin often enlarge slightly and become painful to the touch. As a rule, the first outbreak is more painful, prolonged and widespread than subsequent ones, and can cause fever and malaise. In men, vesicles and ulcers can appear anywhere on the penis, including the foreskin. In women, they appear on the vulva, inside and outside the vagina, and on the cervix. Those who have anal sex may have lesions around the anus and rectum. In immunocompromised individuals, such as those infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), herpes sores can be severe, spread to other areas of the body, persist for weeks and, on rare occasions, become resistant to treatment. The lesions tend to reappear in the same and adjacent areas, because the virus persists in nearby nerves and reactivates to reinfect the skin. VHS-2 reactivates better on pelvic nerves. VHS-1 reactivates best in facial nerves, causing cold sores or nasal herpes. Either way, either virus can cause disease in both areas. About three to 12 days after the first appearance of vesicles (or blisters) in the genital area, the herpes virus can spread to other parts of the body. However, serious complications are rare. The membrane covering the brain (meninges) can become infected, causing vomiting, headache, and stiff neck. The spinal cord can become infected, causing weakness in the legs or other symptoms. The nerves in the pelvic area can also be affected, causing temporary pain, constipation, inability to urinate and, in men, impotence. Although rare, the virus can spread through the bloodstream to the joints, liver or lungs, especially in newborns or people with poor immune systems. The most common complication of genital herpes is the reappearance of the vesicles, which, as a rule, are confined to one side of the body and are less intense than in the initial outbreak. The patient may feel discomfort, itching, tingling or pain in the affected area before each access. The risk of recurrence in the genital area is greater with HSV-2 than with HSV-1. In some people, outbreaks recur frequently for many years. The blisters can recur and extend beyond the genital area until reaching the buttocks, groin or thighs. In pregnant women, herpes infection can cause miscarriage or premature birth. On the other hand, the virus can enter the bloodstream and cause a serious and potentially fatal infection in the baby. As such, prevention, diagnosis and early treatment measures are even more important at this stage. //Causes// It is a viral infection that results from transmission that occurs as a result of vaginal, oral or anal sex with someone who is infected. The fluids present in herpetic vesicles contain the virus and contact with these fluids can cause infection. Infection can occur even when there are no visible blisters or vesicles because the virus can be shed from the skin in the infected area. Since the virus does not survive outside the cells it infects, it is impossible for contagion to occur through contact with sanitary facilities, towels or objects used by people infected with genital herpes. //Diagnosis of genital herpes// The clinical appearance of the lesions and their location are highly suggestive of Herpes simplex infection. For confirmation, samples of the lesions are sent for culture in the laboratory. Results are available within 48 hours. Blood tests may show evidence of past infections or suggest a recent one. //Genital herpes treatment// It is important to note that no treatment cures genital herpes, but only reduces the duration of each outbreak. On the other hand, the number and frequency of occurrences can be reduced by adopting continuous prophylaxis with low doses of antiviral medication. Treatment is most effective if started quickly, usually two days after the onset of symptoms. Acyclovir or related antiviral drugs can be administered orally or in cream form directly to the lesions. These medications reduce the spread of live virus from lesions, thereby reducing the risk of infection. They can also reduce the severity of symptoms during the initial outbreak. However, even early treatment of the first attack does not prevent recurrences. //Prevention// The best form of prevention is not to have sex with people infected with Herpes simplex. In the case of sexually active people, it is important, even in monogamous and stable relationships, to carry out regular laboratory tests to screen for this and other sexually transmitted diseases. Using a condom reduces the risk of infection by the virus. However, since herpes lesions can occur in areas adjacent to the genitals, infection can occur even when a condom is used.

Herpes labial,"//What is it?// Cold sores are a common and very common viral infection and it is estimated that more than 90% of the population is infected with the herpes virus. Once infected, the individual never stops having this virus. Generally, the first outbreak is the worst, but not all are severe; some are so discreet that the person does not realize they have been infected with herpes. Over time, outbreaks tend to become less frequent and serious because our body begins to produce antibodies (defenses) to the virus. //Symptoms// Small liquid-filled blisters, vesicles, appear on the skin affected by herpes, which are accompanied by tingling or pain. The vesicles then rupture and become covered with crusts that fall off after a few days. This process tends to repeat itself with varying frequency, from a week to long months or years. On average, each outbreak lasts two to three weeks. Although most lesions appear on or around the lips, cold sores are not limited to that area: they can appear inside the nose, on the cheek or on the chin. //Causes// The herpes virus is transmitted through contact with the skin of someone who has the virus and it is possible for contagion to occur even when the infected person does not show symptoms. Some ways this can occur are by: Kiss;/ Touching someone's skin, especially the face area;/ Sharing objects, such as cutlery or lipstick;/ Once a person is infected with the herpes virus, it never leaves the body again - it goes through some phases in which it is “dormant” and therefore does not cause symptoms. Some factors that can trigger a herpes outbreak are: Fever;/ Stress;/ Cold;/ Sol;/ Menstruation;/ Surgery;/ //Diagnosis// When lesions are active, a dermatologist can make a diagnosis simply by observing them. To confirm the diagnosis, the specialist may take a sample with a cotton swab and send it for laboratory analysis. If, on the other hand, there are no lesions, other tests, such as blood tests, may be done to check for the existence of the herpes simplex virus. //Treatment// There is no cure for cold sores. However, the lesions often disappear without the need for any type of treatment. Many people still choose to do so to alleviate symptoms and shorten the duration of the outbreak. Typically, an antiviral ointment is used to relieve burning, itching, and tingling. Taking an antiviral medication orally or intravenously may also help a cold sore outbreak go away faster. These medications, when taken daily, can decrease the severity and frequency of outbreaks and help prevent contagion. However, they should not be taken without a doctor's prescription. To alleviate discomfort, there are some strategies you can adopt at home, such as: Apply ointments that do not require a prescription;;/ Put ice on the gallbladders; and;/ Avoid factors that can trigger an outbreak, such as getting sunburned.;/  //To avoid infecting other people// When the virus is active: Avoid close contact and greet with a kiss;/ Do not share objects such as cutlery, glasses, towels and lipsticks.;/ Wash your hands whenever you touch the wound;/ Use a cotton swab to apply the medicine to the lesion.;/ American Academy of Dermatology, June 2019 American Sexual Health Association, June 2019 It is a common problem, which is often resolved without the need for treatment.

Hidradenitis suppurativa,"//What is it?// Hidradenitis Suppurativa is a chronic and recurrent skin condition, located in areas of friction and irritation. In women, it predominates in the groin, armpits and inframammary folds and in men in the buttocks and perianal region. It causes small, inflamed and painful nodules that can become very large, often causing abscesses that end up draining pus and causing large scars that interfere with the patient's movement and quality of life. The typical location and recurrence of the disease makes it possible to distinguish it from other skin diseases, such as: Epidermoid cysts;/ Acne;/ Folliculitis;/ Boils;/ //Symptoms// In its initial phase, Hidradenitis Suppurativa is characterized by the appearance of superficial or deep inflammatory skin lesions, forming painful nodules. With successive crises, abscesses, fistulas and ulcers with pus discharge are formed, associated with retracted scars. //Causes// Hidradenitis suppurativa is caused by inflammation of the apocrine sweat glands. Lesions begin with the occlusion of their excretory ducts, with a consequent inflammatory reaction. Obliteration of the pilosebaceous follicles and the release of keratin and cellular debris into the deeper layers of the skin also appear to be involved. Finally, various germs have been isolated, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Bacterioides spp. Anaerobic streptococci appear to be responsible for the intense inflammation and release of pus that characterize hidradenitis suppurativa. //Diagnosis// The diagnosis of Hidradenitis Suppurativa is clinical and is based on the evaluation of signs and symptoms and examination of the affected area of ​​skin. In the presence of lesions containing pus, material may eventually be collected for laboratory testing. //Treatment// A general study of the patient should be carried out to identify any associated diseases, such as diabetes and obesity. Local care should include hygiene measures with adequate washing, elimination of local friction, application of moist compresses, placement of padded dressings, and avoidance of tight or waterproof clothing. Several medical treatments have been tested with variable and transient effectiveness. We highlight oral corticosteroids or those injected into the lesions, oral isotretinoin, oral antibiotic therapy with clindamycin and rifampicin, oral finasteride and, more recently, biological agents (infliximab or adalimumab). Another option is surgical treatment with removal of the entire affected area down to normal skin. //Prevention// There are some simple measures that can reduce its occurrence: Keep your weight under control;/ Wear loose clothing made of natural fibers;/ Avoid rubbing the affected areas;/ Wash and clean affected areas daily with antibacterial soap;/ Medical News Today Mayo Clinic Cleveland Clinic Smoking, poor sleep, and excessive sun exposure are all enemies of healthy, youthful skin. But there are other mistakes you can avoid to prevent premature aging. A long, hot shower can be relaxing, but it can also dry out and irritate your skin.

Hydrocel,"//What is it?// The testicles are the organs responsible for the formation of sperm and are located inside a sac (scrotum). There, they are surrounded by a liquid that facilitates their movement and reduces the risk of external aggression. Hydrocele refers to an increase in the amount of this liquid, as a result of an inflammatory process that affects one or both testicles. This is a very common situation in newborns because, during their normal development, the testicles descend from the abdomen to the scrotum through a canal. When this channel does not close, fluid may pass from the abdominal cavity and accumulate in the scrotum. Approximately 1% to 2% of newborns have a hydrocele, with this rate being higher in premature babies, and may persist in approximately 80% to 95% of newborns and 20% of adults. //Symptoms// Its main symptom is swelling of the testicles, which can affect just one or both. The dimensions of the hydrocele typically vary in relation to exertion and may be accompanied by an inguinal hernia. During medical examination, it is difficult to palpate the testicle due to the liquid that surrounds it. If the patient experiences sharp pain in the scrotum or testicles, this could mean testicular torsion or another serious event and, therefore, this symptom requires an urgent hospital visit. A hydrocele, in itself, does not interfere with male fertility, but it can be a symptom of other factors that have an impact on fertility. //Causes// They may have a congenital cause and, in these cases, tend to disappear around 18 months of age. Acquired forms are based on inflammation of the testicles, related to tumours, testicular torsion or trauma. These are more common in young people and adults. Other possible causes are epididymitis (inflammation of the epididymis) or a previous operation for a varicocele. //Diagnosis// Through clinical history and physical examination. Illuminating the scrotum with a flashlight allows the hydrocele to be seen, since the fluid is transparent. Ultrasound is useful when there is doubt about the presence of masses in the scrotum. Laboratory tests may also be recommended to rule out an infection. //Treatment// As it usually does not represent a danger, its treatment is only indicated if it causes discomfort or when its size may compromise the transport of blood to the testicle. As a rule, surgery is not indicated in the first 12 to 24 months, as spontaneous resolution may occur during this period. It is only advanced if a concomitant inguinal hernia or other underlying testicular disease is present. The treatment is surgical, does not require hospitalization and is performed under general anesthesia. A small incision is made in the scrotum or lower abdomen to remove excess fluid. Needle aspiration is an alternative to surgery, but it is a less commonly used method as it is associated with a greater risk of infection and increases the likelihood of new hydrocele formation. //Prevention// There is no way to prevent the development of a hydrocele.

Hyperbilirubinemia,"//What is it?// Jaundice is the yellowish discoloration of the sclerae (i.e. the white surface of the eye) and skin. It is usually due to physiological immaturity of the newborn, but it can also mean illness, which is why parents should always inform the baby's pediatrician. Jaundice originates from the degradation of red blood cells.  These blood cells are renewed periodically, that is, when some end their lifespan they are replaced by others. This renewal involves the intervention of the liver, whose function is to clean part of the degradation products from red blood cells. When the liver is immature, jaundice may appear in this physiological cycle, which is assessed by the quantification of a substance called bilirubin in the blood. In general terms, it can be stated that jaundice is more evident the higher the bilirubin value, hence the term hyperbilirubinemia. It should be noted that in black children, observing jaundice on the skin is more difficult due to the natural color of the babies, so you should always pay attention to the color of the sclera.  //Symptoms// The main symptom is jaundice itself, but in cases of blood incompatibility, associated with major destruction of red blood cells, there may be paleness of the skin and mucous membranes due to associated anemia. //Causes// In newborns, jaundice is in most cases physiological, or developmental, usually appearing on the 3rd day of life, as a result of the newborn's hepatic immaturity. Premature babies have a higher incidence of this type of jaundice, precisely because they are more immature. This jaundice, although not considered a disease, may require phototherapy. What determines the need for therapy is the level of bilirubin in the blood. Developmental jaundice usually resolves within 15 days of life. Another frequent cause of jaundice in the neonatal period is blood incompatibility between the mother and the newborn. Parents are familiar with the different blood types, as well as the RH factor. Incompatibilities can also arise between the blood of mother and child, leading to greater and earlier destruction of red blood cells, causing jaundice. Not all human blood is compatible with each other, which can give rise to defensive immunological reactions with the consequent production of antibodies. Other rare causes of jaundice in the neonatal period exist, generally associated with important diseases.  //Treatment// Treatment for jaundice depends on its cause. Therefore, only after diagnosing the disease that is causing the jaundice can the patient be treated. Carotenemia is the name given to this condition which, despite being visually strange, is not dangerous.

Hypercalcemia,"//What is it?// Hypercalcemia corresponds to an above-average concentration of calcium in the blood (above 10.5 mg per deciliter). This situation can weaken bones, lead to the formation of kidney stones and interfere with the functioning of the heart and brain. Hypercalcemia may be caused by increased gastrointestinal absorption or an increase in calcium intake. //Symptoms// Sometimes it is not associated with any signs. In other cases, the symptoms are very serious and result from the effects of calcium on various organs. As the kidneys have to work harder to eliminate their excess, a feeling of thirst and an increase in the number of urinations may occur. Kidney stones that contain calcium can form. And if hypercalcemia is prolonged, calcium crystals form in the kidneys, which are associated with permanent damage and kidney failure. At the digestive level, hypercalcemia causes gastric discomfort, nausea, vomiting and constipation. Bones tend to be weaker, which causes pain. Muscle weakness may also occur. Osteoporosis associated with hypercalcemia can lead to fractures, deformation of the spinal curvature and reduced height. At the brain level, confusion, lethargy and fatigue may occur. In the most severe cases, coma and death may occur. At the cardiac level, arrhythmias or even death may occur. //Causes// People who consume large amounts of calcium, such as those with peptic ulcers and those who take milk and antacids that contain calcium, may develop hypercalcemia. An overdose of vitamin D can also affect the concentration of calcium in the blood by exaggerating its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Its most frequent cause is hyperparathyroidism, in which there is an excessive secretion of parathyroid hormones by these glands. The most common origin for this disorder is the presence of a benign tumor in one of these glands. Hyperparathyroidism is more common in women than men and develops more frequently in adults and in those who have received radiotherapy to the neck area. There are several forms of cancer that also cause hypercalcemia, such as kidney, lung or ovarian cancer. Others (prostate, breast, lung) can spread to the bones, destroying these cells and releasing calcium into the blood. Multiple myeloma (cancer that affects the bone marrow) and Paget's disease can also lead to bone destruction and hypercalcemia. Other situations include immobilized patients. Some medications, such as lithium, are another possible cause, in addition to the genetic component. Finally, dehydration can cause transient hypercalcemia. //Diagnosis// The condition is usually detected in routine blood tests. Other tests, including imaging studies, may be necessary to identify the cause. //Treatment// Treatment depends on its severity and causes. If the calcium concentration is not too high, base origin correction is sufficient. It is important to recommend that people with normal kidney function and who are prone to developing hypercalcemia drink plenty of fluids, which stimulates the kidneys to eliminate calcium, as well as helping to prevent dehydration. When the calcium concentration is very high or when symptoms appear at the brain level, treatment involves the administration of intravenous fluids and diuretics that stimulate its elimination. In more serious cases, dialysis may be necessary. If the cause is hyperparathyroidism, treatment usually involves surgical removal of one or more parathyroid glands. When hypercalcemia is caused by cancer, treatment is more difficult and involves controlling the underlying disease. There are drugs that help treat this pathology. //Prevention// Prevention involves drinking adequate amounts of fluids, controlling salt intake and maintaining physical activity. Whenever possible, it is important to avoid taking medications that cause hypercalcemia. Since vomiting and diarrhea involve fluid loss, it is important to treat these conditions whenever they occur.

Hyperglycemia,"//What is it?// This term designates the presence of high concentrations of glucose in the blood. In general, it occurs when insulin levels are reduced or the body is unable to use it correctly. It is present in diabetic patients, both type 1 and type 2. However, it can occur in other contexts, even in the absence of diabetes. It can occur during periods when nothing is eaten, which occurs when sugar levels are higher than 130 mg/dL, after a complete 8-hour fast, or after a meal - in this case, blood glucose values ​​must be greater than 180 mg/dL two hours after eating. It is worth mentioning that, in the absence of diabetes, blood glucose rarely exceeds 140 mg/dL after a person eats. It is important to recognize and treat it because, in the long term, it can cause damage to nerves, blood vessels and various organs. Hyperglycemia in the context of diabetes has a very important impact, given the prevalence of this disease. In 2014 it was estimated that around one million Portuguese people suffered from this disease. In the age group between 60 and 79 years old, around 25% of the population is diabetic. Still in Portugal, around 2.1 million individuals with hyperglycemia were detected without evidence of the disease. //Symptoms// Its most common manifestations are frequent urination, thirst, constant hunger, headaches, difficulty concentrating, blurred vision, fatigue, itching and weight loss. If hyperglycemia is not corrected, skin and vaginal infections, difficulty in wound healing, loss of sensitivity in the extremities due to nerve damage, erectile dysfunction, digestive and renal changes tend to occur. In more severe cases, a diabetic coma (ketoacidosis) may occur. In this situation, since the body does not have enough insulin to convert glucose into energy, it will turn to fat as an alternative source. During this process, excess ketones are formed, causing a clinical picture of nausea, vomiting, difficulty breathing, sweet breath and dry mouth. This situation can be fatal and requires urgent treatment. //Causes// In patients with type 1 diabetes, the body is unable to produce insulin in sufficient quantities to metabolize glucose, causing hyperglycemia. In type 2 diabetes, insulin is produced but does not exert its effect effectively, with the same consequences. In a diabetic patient, incorrect treatment can be associated with episodes of hyperglycemia. In addition to this disease, there may be other causes such as eating a large meal, exercising less intensively than normal, an episode of stress or a hormonal spike. //Diagnosis// Hyperglycemia is diagnosed by laboratory measurement of blood glucose levels. Normal values ​​range from 80 to 120 mg/dL for people under 59 years of age and without other medical problems, and from 100 to 140 mg/dL for individuals over 60 years of age and with associated disease. This measurement can be done as part of a more complete laboratory analysis or can be performed at home using devices specifically designed for this purpose. The measurement of glycated hemoglobin (A1C) allows the assessment of the average blood glucose level over the last two to three months, and is important for planning treatment. Ideally, its value should be less than 7%. //Treatment// Physical exercise is a healthy way to reduce hyperglycemia. A balanced diet is equally important. In the presence of symptoms suggestive of this pathology, it is useful to drink plenty of water. In the case of diabetes, adequate and regularly reviewed treatment is the best way to treat it. It may consist of a simple adjustment of the diet in mild cases or the use of oral antidiabetics and/or insulin, whenever justified. //Prevention// Prevention involves maintaining healthy lifestyle habits, a balanced diet and regular physical exercise. In diabetic patients, blood glucose control is essential to prevent episodes of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. This control involves regular medical evaluation, compliance with prescribed medication and blood glucose measurement. The patient must also always bring identification of their clinical condition with them so that, in the event of any complications, they can be treated conveniently.

Hyperhidrosis,"//What is it?// It is a benign disease characterized by excessive sweating (perspiration) or hypersweating. Sweat is an essential mechanism for regulating the body's temperature and is controlled by the autonomic nervous system. When sweat production exceeds the normal requirements for this regulation, which occurs in around 1% of the general population, it causes great discomfort. Hyperhidrosis usually appears in childhood, more frequently in girls, and symptoms tend to worsen during puberty.  //Symptoms// It usually appears on the palms of the hands, armpits, soles of the feet and face (sometimes associated with intense flushing), together or with a marked predominance of a particular region. When the incidence is seen in the palms of the hands and armpits, it changes the way these patients relate to the “outside world”. In fact, these people have difficulty in social contact, they avoid writing because the paper gets wet, they avoid greetings, picking up objects, working on the computer, driving because they are afraid that the steering wheel will become slippery. They frequently stain their clothes (appearance of a halo at the armpit level), wet socks that remain damp throughout the day, and they do not like to wear sandals or open shoes because sweat stains are visible. This whole situation, which worsens with heat and stress and stops during sleep, can cause serious psychological disorders, as there is a tendency to social isolation and hide the problem. //Causes// The causes of primary hyperhidrosis are not well known. Initially, it was thought that hyperhidrosis was associated with anxiety disorders and that it only occurred in anxious individuals or those with emotional changes. However, recent research has shown that individuals with hyperhidrosis are not more prone to anxiety, nervousness or emotional stress than the rest of the population when exposed to the same factors. In fact, the relationship is the opposite and it is hyperhidrosis that causes emotional and psychological changes caused by excessive sweating. Studies have also shown that certain genes play a role in hyperhidrosis. Secondary hyperhidrosis has a long list of known causes: Spinal cord injury;/ Alcohol abuse;/ Anxiety;/ Diabetes;/ Drop;/ Heart disease;/ Hyperthyroidism;/ Obesity;/ Parkinson's disease;/ Pregnancy;/ Respiratory failure;/ Shingles (caused by the herpes zoster virus);/ Some types of cancer, such as Hodgkin's disease;/ Some infections (HIV, malaria, tuberculosis);/ Medicines, including some antidepressants, anticholinesterases (for Alzheimer's disease), pilocarpine (for glaucoma), propranolol (for high blood pressure);/ Substance abuse;/ //Diagnosis// Several laboratory tests of blood and urine are important to rule out the presence of underlying conditions, such as hyperthyroidism or hypoglycemia. Patients are also asked about their sweating patterns: which parts of the body are affected, how often the episodes occur, and whether they also occur during sleep. Carrying out the thermoregulatory sweat test. This involves applying a moisture-sensitive powder to the skin. When excessive sweating occurs at room temperature, the dust changes color. The patient is exposed to high temperatures and humidity, which triggers sweating. When exposed to heat, people who do not have hyperhidrosis tend not to sweat excessively on their palms, unlike patients with this condition. This test also helps the doctor determine the severity of the condition. //Treatment// In the first phase of the treatment approach, dermatology has a say, with various types of therapies. When medical treatment is not effective, surgical treatment should be considered. This is performed by videothoracoscopy, under general anesthesia and consists of removing fibers from the autonomic nervous system responsible for these areas, located within the thoracic cavity. The result is immediate and the patient is discharged on the same day or the next day, with completely dry hands and prepared to return to their normal life, without limitations. //Prevention// Preferably use light and breathable fabrics, such as cotton and silk.;/ Wear socks made from moisture-repellent fibers (merino wool);/ Shower every day with antibacterial soap to control bacteria that can live on sweaty skin and cause odor;/ Dry your skin completely after bathing.;/ Use antiperspirant;/ Avoid spicy foods, alcohol and hot drinks which are stimulants of hyperhidrosis;/ Medical News Today WebDM For those suffering from hyperhidrosis, a condition that leads to excessive sweating of the hands, feet and armpits, the solution may be a 20-minute surgery.

Hyperopia,"//What is it?// It is a type of visual difficulty that mainly affects near vision, although in higher degrees it also affects distance vision. It occurs when the eyeball is shorter or the cornea has reduced curvature, so that the light that enters the eyes is not focused correctly. Although it can occur in isolation, in many cases it appears associated with astigmatism, another disorder that causes visual difficulties. It is more common in children and, when values ​​are reduced, it is not associated with visual difficulties. When it is higher, there is a risk of amblyopia (lazy eye) or strabismus. Unlike myopia, many cases of hyperopia improve with age and the child's growth. It affects around 55% of the population. In most cases, these are hyperopia of less than 0.5 diopters, which are not associated with any type of complaint. //Symptoms// It manifests itself in the form of visual fatigue resulting from the effort required to try to focus the images. This fatigue is greater at close range and worsens over time. In addition to visual difficulties, there may be loss of concentration, increased drowsiness and, in the case of children, lower academic performance. Congestion of the eye muscles caused by effort may be associated with a higher frequency of episodes of conjunctivitis and/or inflammation of the eyelids. //Causes// It occurs when the axial axis of the eye is short, when the radius of curvature of the cornea (transparent layer of the eye) is increased, when changes occur in the curvature of the crystalline lens (lens located inside the eye) or when it is surgically removed. In general, hyperopia is inherited, and there has been no evidence of environmental influence on its appearance. //Diagnosis// Its diagnosis is simple and is made during a medical consultation. In the case of children, it may be necessary to use drops that dilate the eyes and paralyze some of the eye muscles, so that hyperopia can be better quantified. //Treatment// It is corrected through the use of glasses, temporary or permanent depending on their degree. Contact lenses are also an alternative. In well-selected cases and after the age of 18, refractive surgery using a laser or the placement of intraocular lenses is a solution for those who do not wish to wear glasses or contact lenses. //Prevention// Although it cannot be prevented, there are measures to protect the eyes. It is important, among other aspects, to have a regular medical consultation, control chronic diseases such as diabetes and high blood pressure, consult an ophthalmologist whenever there are changes in vision or eye complaints, protect the eyes from ultraviolet radiation with certified sunglasses, maintain a healthy diet that provides the eyes with all the nutrients essential for vision, not smoking, using the correct prescription and always having adequate lighting.

Primary hyperparathyroidism,"//What is it?// Hyperparathyroidism is a common condition in which one or more parathyroid glands become overactive and secrete excess parathyroid hormone, with increased production of parathyroid hormone and leading to symptoms resulting from excess calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia), in the urine (hypercalciuria), removal of calcium from the bones (osteopenia and osteoporosis) and kidney stones. //Symptoms// In the presence of high calcium levels, symptoms such as muscle weakness, anorexia, fatigue, itching, constipation, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, increased urine volume, drowsiness, difficulty concentrating, mental confusion and depression appear. When it persists for a prolonged period, renal colic, high blood pressure and changes in the electrocardiogram, renal failure, muscular atrophy and visual difficulties occur. //Causes// It can be caused by benign tumors (adenomas), hyperplasia or, very rarely, by malignant tumors. //Diagnosis// It is difficult to diagnose, as it presents with subtle manifestations or is asymptomatic (50%), and is often considered a “missed diagnosis”. In women over 45 years of age, its incidence may be 1 case in 500, and in patients with renal lithiasis undergoing lithotripsy, a prevalence of 5% has been described. //Treatment// Recent studies have shown that there is benefit in early surgical intervention. In most cases, a minimally invasive curative approach is possible, with almost no morbidity, short hospital stays and a cure rate of 95% of cases. //Prevention// The amount of calcium and vitamin D that is consumed in the diet should be monitored. The Institute of Medicine recommends 1,000 milligrams of calcium per day for adults ages 19 to 50 and for men ages 51 to 70. This calcium recommendation increases to 1,200 milligrams per day for women ages 51 and older and men ages 71 and older.;/ Drink plenty of fluids, especially water, to produce clear urine and reduce the risk of kidney stones.;/ Regular exercise, including strength training, helps maintain strong bones.;/ No smoking.;/ Avoid certain medications.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia hbp,"//What is it?// It is one of the most common benign diseases in men that is characterized by an increase in the volume of the prostate. The prostate is a gland that plays important roles in sexuality and, mainly, in male fertility and is located below the bladder, surrounding the urethra. When it increases in volume, it can gradually narrow the urethra, making it difficult for urine to flow. As a result, the bladder muscles become thicker and stronger in order to be able to empty it. However, it leads to complaints of urinary frequency, difficulty in urinating and, if left untreated, can lead to urinary retention and the need for placement. a civet for its emptying. It affects around 40% of men at age 50 and around 90% at age 90. It is, therefore, a progressive disease, with a significant impact on quality of life. //Symptoms// Its symptoms result from an obstacle to urinary flow as a result of an enlarged prostate. In the initial phase, there is difficulty in starting urination or a sensation of incomplete urination. As the bladder does not empty completely, the number of trips to the bathroom tends to increase, especially at night (nocturia) and the need to urinate becomes increasingly imperative. The volume and strength of urinary flow tend to be reduced and a drop may remain at the end of urination. In a more advanced stage, the bladder may overfill, causing urinary incontinence. In some cases, the effort of urination can cause blood to appear in the urine. If the obstruction is complete, urination becomes impossible, causing acute, very intense pain in the lower part of the abdomen. Bladder infections may also occur, with a burning sensation during urination and fever. Urine that remains in the bladder can be a source of urinary stones, the elimination of which causes pain. Rarely, if diagnosis and treatment are not carried out, urine residue tends to increase pressure on the kidneys, with the potential for kidney damage. //Causes// The causes are not well understood, although this pathology appears to result from changes in sexual hormones that occur in the aging process, including testosterone, formed in the testicles, and dihydrotestosterone, originating in the prostate from testosterone. Estrogens (female sex hormones) may also play a role in this disease. In fact, men produce small amounts of these hormones. In any case, the best-identified risk factor for this condition is age: more than half of men aged 60 have prostate hyperplasia. A family history also appears to be important. Obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, low levels of HDL (the “good” cholesterol) and peripheral arterial disease are factors that appear to increase the risk of developing prostate hyperplasia, as do a sedentary lifestyle, smoking and an inadequate diet. //Diagnosis// It begins with the clinical history and medical examination, which may include a digital rectal examination, which allows the size and texture of the prostate to be assessed. Laboratory tests are important and allow the concentrations of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) to be measured, which is useful for diagnosing prostate hyperplasia and prostate cancer. Uroflowmetry allows the characteristics of urination to be assessed and the degree of obstruction to be quantified, and ultrasound of the prostate provides very precise images of this organ. In other cases, an endoscopic examination through the urethra may be useful. //Treatment// Current medicine offers different types of treatment for Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia. The aim is to eliminate or reduce the symptoms associated with this disease, prevent complications and, if possible, reduce the volume of the gland if it is enlarged.  Drug therapy Symptoms can be alleviated by using medications that relax the tone of the prostate (contraction of its muscle fibers) and thus increase the size of the urethra that passes through it, thus alleviating the obstacle to the flow of urine. If the prostate volume is increased, other medications that act on the volume of the prostate can be combined, allowing significant relief of symptoms and postponing the need for surgery, but generally with side effects on sexual life, namely erectile dysfunction and retrograde ejaculation (into the bladder).  Reduction of prostate volume through surgery In specific cases of large prostates, surgery is the best option whenever symptoms significantly interfere with quality of life. The most common procedure is transurethral resection of the prostate, in which an instrument (resectoscope) is introduced through the urethra into the prostate and a substantial portion of the prostate is eliminated. However, in some cases it may be necessary to resort to open, conventional abdominal surgery. In both cases, retrograde ejaculation (into the bladder) could be a complication after these surgeries.  Prostate volume reduction by water vapor (REZUM) Another treatment that has proven to be effective in treating benign prostate enlargement, as it has the same benefits as transurethral resection, is less aggressive than conventional surgeries and offers more advantages for the patient, is water vapor prostate therapy (REZUM). In this procedure, water vapor is injected into the prostate, produced in a special generator with controlled temperature and pressure and applied endoscopically to the prostate. It promotes the death of prostate cells around the urethra with subsequent reabsorption of the hyperplasia tissue by the body itself. This reabsorption can take up to 3 months, but patients generally feel relief from symptoms 2 weeks after the technique is applied. This technique is performed on an outpatient basis, with the patient discharged a few hours later. It can also be applied to some patients who do not have the clinical conditions for classical surgery. After carrying out the procedure, patients can stop taking the medication, which relieves them of its side effects, namely erectile dysfunction. This treatment aims to provide a better quality of life not only by reducing urinary frequency and relieving associated complaints, but also by preserving sexual function (normal erection and ejaculation).  Aquablation Aquablation is the latest treatment for Benign Prostate Hyperplasia (BPH), based on a high-pressure water jet with millimeter precision. It manages to destroy the prostate tissue that compresses the urethra, completely relieving the patient's obstructive symptoms caused by BPH, preserving sexual function, namely ejaculation, as well as urinary continence.  //Prevention// Considering that its main risk factor is age, there is no validated method of prevention for this disease. Some data suggest that regular physical activity, a low-fat diet, and regular consumption of vegetables rich in vitamin C and foods rich in zinc may reduce the risk of developing this condition. The most important thing is an early diagnosis, through medical consultation and laboratory tests, which allow for earlier and, therefore, more effective therapeutic intervention. Manual Merck online, 2014 Benign Prostate Hyperplasia, General Considerations and Medical Treatment, Pedro Bargão Santos, April 2011 University of Maryland Medical Center, Setembro 2012 0% incontinence and preservation of sexual function are two advantages of aquablation. Learn about this technique for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Hiperprolactinemia,"//What is it?// It is a condition characterized by excess prolactin. Normally this hormone is responsible for the production of breast milk in the postpartum period. //Symptoms// It is a more common situation in women and is usually manifested by milk production outside the postpartum period (galactorrhea), changes in menstrual cycles or loss of them (amenorrhea), infertility, decreased sexual desire and osteoporosis. //Causes// Its excess production can have several causes, such as physical and psychological stress, taking certain medications or the existence of a prolactin-producing pituitary adenoma. //Diagnosis// The diagnosis is based on the patient's individual symptoms and clinical history. Complementary studies with tests such as magnetic resonance imaging, blood tests or more complex dynamic hormonal tests allow the diagnosis of this condition to be concluded. //Treatment// The treatment is pharmacological. //Prevention// Depending on the underlying condition, it can be prevented by changing the medication causing the symptoms and improving the management of physical and psychological stress. Prolactin-producing pituitary adenomas do not require preventive measures.

High blood pressure,"//What is it?// This is an increase in blood pressure above values ​​considered normal. It occurs when there is excessive pressure of blood on the walls of the arteries during circulation. It can increase at certain times, due to physical or emotional exertion, and it is natural that, after these situations, its values ​​return to normal levels. This condition is only serious and causes health problems when it remains high for months, or when it increases suddenly. It is important to know that tension tends to increase with age. However, hypertension should not be considered normal in the elderly. As a rule, arterial hypertension is considered to be present when the maximum pressure is greater than or equal to 160 mmHge/or the minimum pressure is greater than or equal to 95 mmHge. High blood pressure is associated with coronary heart disease, stroke and heart failure and is the most common modifiable cardiovascular risk factor, which is why its treatment is essential in preventing these pathologies. Cardiovascular diseases are the cause of death for at least 34.1% of the Brazilian population, mainly as a consequence of stroke and coronary disease. It is estimated that the prevalence of high blood pressure in the Portuguese adult population is 42.1%, with only 39.0% of these patients taking antihypertensive drugs and only 11.2% being under control. //Symptoms// In the first few years, it does not cause any symptoms. Over time, blood pressure ends up damaging the blood vessels and the main organs of the body, such as the brain, heart and kidneys, causing headaches, dizziness, tinnitus and increased heart rate. The main diseases associated with high blood pressure are stroke, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, heart and kidney failure. //Causes// Around 90% of cases are related to lifestyle habits. Obesity is one of the important factors. Each pound of fat requires the formation of an additional 1.5 kilometers of small blood vessels to supply the excess adipose tissue. Increased blood pressure is required to pump blood through them. Therefore, being overweight by 20% or more increases the risk of hypertension by five times;;/ Excess salt consumption. It is known that high blood pressure is less frequent in populations where its consumption is low. Our body only needs 1/8 of a teaspoon of salt per day;;/ Tobacco is another cause to consider. Even just one cigarette can increase it for about 30 minutes. A pack-a-day smoker can, through smoking alone, cause an increase in blood pressure for 24 hours;;/ Around 5% to 15% of cases may be related to moderate alcohol consumption. On the other hand, one cup of coffee a day can cause an increase in blood pressure;;/ Physical inactivity and stress are also at its origin;;/ The remaining 10% of high blood pressure cases have organic causes, such as some hormonal changes, kidney or blood vessel diseases. //Diagnosis// It is important to remember that high blood pressure cannot be felt, it must be measured. In order to obtain correct values, it is important to rest in a sitting position for at least five minutes before measuring. You should use the same device and always measure on the same arm. The diagnosis of high blood pressure requires measuring an elevated blood pressure on three separate occasions over a period of a week or more. Once its existence has been confirmed, other tests must also be carried out to help understand its origin and/or the complications associated with it. //Treatment// Treatment depends on the severity of the condition. For example, people with moderate hypertension can control it by simply changing some lifestyle habits, such as reducing salt and alcohol intake, controlling their weight, exercising regularly and stopping smoking. There are several medications available for the treatment of high blood pressure that can be used alone or in combination. It is up to the doctor to decide which is the best treatment for each situation. //Prevention// Since most cases have their origin in lifestyle, it is important that it is healthy. All the recommendations mentioned in the treatment prevent the onset of this disease.

Secondary arterial hypertension due to endocrine causes,"//What is it?// Secondary hypertension is defined as high blood pressure associated with a direct cause that can be identified and treated. Most cases of high blood pressure do not have an easily identifiable apparent cause, and are known as essential hypertension. A small proportion of cases of high blood pressure are due to very well-established causes. Secondary hypertension of endocrine causes is related to the endocrine system, formed by the set of glands that secrete hormones that are made available in the blood circulation by the pituitary, hypothalamus, thyroid, adrenal glands, pancreas, ovaries, testicles and adipose tissue. It can be triggered by tumors or other abnormalities that cause some glands in the endocrine system to secrete excessive amounts of hormones that raise blood pressure. //Symptoms// Like primary hypertension, secondary hypertension usually does not present specific symptoms. However, if high blood pressure is present and the patient has some of these signs, it may mean that their condition is secondary hypertension: High blood pressure that does not respond to medication;/ Very high blood pressure - systolic blood pressure above 180 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) or diastolic blood pressure above 120 mm Hg;/ Sudden high blood pressure before age 30 or after age 55;/ Absence of family history of high blood pressure;/ Absence of obesity;/ //Causes// In recent years, some hypertensive syndromes have been linked to the high production of certain hormones, such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), pheochromocytoma, primary hyperaldosteronism, Cushing's syndrome and renin-producing tumors (primary reninism). Renovascular hypertension itself is considered a form of endocrine hypertension, since the renin-angiotensin system is involved in its pathogenesis. Hypertension may also be present in thyroid diseases. Diagnosis and management in such situations are always very complex. //Diagnosis// In this situation, the cause of high blood pressure, unlike the more common form of hypertension, is associated with diseases of the endocrine system or some medications. The diagnosis is based on laboratory studies of blood and urine and specific tests that allow us to conclude the cause of the disease. //Treatment// The treatment of this type of hypertension, caused by changes or diseases of the endocrine system, fundamentally involves treating the underlying diseases and simultaneously controlling blood pressure using medication. //Prevention// Secondary hypertension from endocrine causes is associated with diseases that are not caused by changes in individual habits or lifestyle.

Hyperthyroidism,"//What is it?// Hyperthyroidism is caused by the overproduction of thyroid hormones that are released into the bloodstream. This condition affects several organs and functions of the body. Hyperthyroidism is a relatively common disease that affects females more. The incidence increases with age, being more common around 60 years of age. Without treatment, it can affect different functions of the body, including the heart. Appropriate medication allows the disease to be controlled by reducing the production of thyroid hormones. //Symptoms// Clinical manifestations include anxiety, irritability, insomnia, tremor, increased intestinal transit, palpitations and increased heart rate, hyperactivity, heat intolerance, excessive sweating, weight loss despite increased appetite, menstrual irregularities, goiter, a lively and fixed gaze and/or prominent eyes, and visual changes (Graves' disease). In the elderly, the presentation of a clinical picture of hyperthyroidism may be less exuberant, characterized by apathy, with mental confusion, anorexia, and cardiac arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation). //Causes// The most common cause is Graves' disease, which is an autoimmune disease characterized by the circulation of altered antibodies that act on normal cells in the thyroid, stimulating its hyperactivity. //Diagnosis// Your doctor will ask about your symptoms, do a physical exam, and order blood tests. Advanced hyperthyroidism is usually easy to diagnose because the signs are clear, but it's less obvious in the early stages. A blood test known as a thyroid function test checks the levels of the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) and can reveal how the gland is functioning. Radioactive iodine can also be used to measure its function (radioactive iodine uptake test). //Treatment// Treatment must be individualized and discussed with the patient, including three options: Synthetic antithyroid (methibasol is the first-line drug);/ radioactive iodine;/ Surgery;/ Monitoring must be regular and follow-up maintained over the long term. //Prevention// Hyperthyroidism associated with thyroid disease is not preventable. The use of medications that act on the thyroid gland must be done exclusively under medical or pharmaceutical guidance. Blood tests allow you to monitor thyroid hormone levels whenever clinical suspicion warrants.

Hypochondria,"//What is it?// Hypochondria is a disorder in which a person reports physical symptoms and is especially concerned because they firmly believe that they correspond to a serious illness. This is a morbid fear regarding the functions of the body or the state of health in general, whether from a mental or physical point of view, giving rise to complaints that are communicated to other people. It is, therefore, a phobia of diseases, with several possible causes being identified. Although some scientists consider it to be an independent clinical condition, others prefer to designate it as a by-product of other disorders, such as depression and schizophrenia. From a therapeutic point of view, it has given rise to the most varied types of intervention. As the success obtained with such methods does not always correspond to expectations, it has been stated that the prognosis of hypochondria is reserved. Sociocultural factors are very relevant in this pathology. The role that in each era is attributed to certain diseases, such as tuberculosis, cancer or sexually transmitted diseases, can contribute to generating specific fears in many people in relation to the most commented and talked about disease. The internet and social networks, in recent times, can accelerate the dissemination of information about illnesses, which, in susceptible people, is an additional source of concern. On the other hand, an individual's previous health history is important, as it may make them more sensitive to a particular organ system or organ. In other cases, there may be an identification with a family member who has had a serious illness, or an upbringing in an environment where illnesses received too much attention. Although the existence of a real pathology can give rise to a phobia of diseases, generally speaking, there is no well-defined physical disorder at the basis of hypochondria. It is estimated that hypochondria affects around 1% to 5% of the general population, being equally common in women and men. Some data indicate a prevalence of between 4% and 9% in general clinic consultations in Portugal. //Symptoms// The person's concerns about the severity of the disease are often based on an incorrect interpretation of the body's normal functions, as happens, for example, with normal bowel sounds. People with hypochondria use these symptoms to substantiate their concern. Being examined and reassured by the doctor does not alleviate their concerns, maintaining the belief that the healthcare professional was unable to find the underlying illness. Complaints can be more general in nature, such as pain or tiredness, or be more specific. In hypochondriasis, the patient does not pretend or lie. He or she believes completely in the disease and therefore seeks out many doctors, in search of one who can confirm the presence of the pathology. In some cases, the organ or system that is the source of concern may vary over time. Hypochondria thus significantly interferes with the quality of life of these individuals and affects their family, social and professional life, generating anxiety or depression and significant losses of time and money in exams and consultations. On the other hand, they are exposed to additional risks, resulting from invasive tests carried out in the search for a diagnosis, or from dependence on analgesics or sedatives. //Causes// Its causes are unknown. There are factors that may be involved in its development, such as a history of physical or sexual abuse, serious childhood illness, reduced ability to express emotions, the presence of the pathology in question in a close family member and genetic elements. //Diagnosis// Diagnosis can be very difficult because the patient is convinced that their symptoms correspond to a real illness. Hypochondriasis is suspected when a healthy person with minor signs is concerned about the meaning of these signs and does not respond to reassuring explanations after careful assessment. The diagnosis is confirmed when the situation persists for years and its manifestation cannot be attributed to depression or another psychiatric disorder. It is important to rule out other illnesses through a medical examination. If it is confirmed that there is no reason for the symptoms, it is important to refer the patient to a psychiatrist or psychologist. //Treatment// Treating hypochondriasis is difficult because the patient is convinced that something serious is wrong with him or her. Reassurance does not alleviate these concerns. However, a good relationship with a doctor is beneficial. One of the main objectives is to help the patient live and function as normally as possible, even if the manifestations persist, and to change the way they think and react that are at the origin of the symptoms. To this end, monitoring and support measures are used, maintaining regular contact and establishing a good doctor-patient relationship; taking antidepressants or anxiolytics; and psychotherapy. This can help modify thinking and behavior patterns, deal with stress and improve social relationships. It is often difficult to implement given the patient's resistance and their conviction in the existence of a real disease. It is important to avoid resorting to complex and expensive examinations, but it may be necessary to treat some symptoms, such as pain. //Prevention// It is not possible to prevent hypochondria. However, adequate monitoring helps to reduce the severity of the symptoms and improve the quality of life of those affected. In a society so exposed to information about diseases, health care, exams, and new diagnostic technologies, it is to be expected that hypochondria can set in more easily. In fact, the availability of health information, although fundamental and very beneficial, may be associated, in the most susceptible people, with increased fears about various pathologies. What is really important is to detect these cases and try to offer as much support and reassurance as possible so that the symptoms can disappear or, at least, that they do not interfere so much with your daily life.

Hypoglycemia,"//What is it?// Hypoglycemia occurs when blood glucose levels fall below 70 mg/dl. Under normal conditions, the body maintains blood sugar levels within a fairly narrow range (around 70 to 110 mg/dl). In diabetes, these levels become too high; in hypoglycemia, they are too low. This leads to the malfunctioning of many of the body's systems. The brain is particularly sensitive because glucose is its only source of energy. The way it responds to low blood sugar levels is by stimulating the adrenal glands to release adrenaline through the nervous system. This in turn triggers the liver to release sugar to adjust its concentration in the blood. If levels remain too low, brain function may be impaired. //Symptoms// When blood sugar levels drop, the body reacts by releasing adrenaline from the adrenal glands. This hormone stimulates the sugar contained in the body's reserves and, at the same time, causes symptoms similar to those of an anxiety attack: sweating, nervousness, tremors, fainting, palpitations and, sometimes, hunger. If hypoglycemia is severe, the supply of glucose to the brain is reduced and symptoms such as dizziness, confusion, exhaustion, weakness, headaches, inappropriate behavior that can be mistaken for drunkenness, inability to concentrate, vision disturbances, convulsions and coma appear. Prolonged hypoglycemia can irreversibly damage the brain. Both anxiety symptoms and brain physiological changes can have a slow or sudden onset that progresses within minutes, from mild discomfort to severe confusion or even panic. In a patient with an insulin-secreting pancreatic tumor, signs are more likely to appear in the early morning hours when fasting. //Causes// It can be related to dietary errors, such as going several hours without eating or ingesting insufficient amounts of carbohydrates. It may result from administration of oral medication or excess insulin. If there is excessive secretion by the pancreas (usually associated with a pancreatic tumor), hypoglycemia may also occur. Excessive physical exercise without nutritional support and the consumption of large quantities of alcohol outside of meals are other causes. Some disorders of the pituitary gland, adrenal glands or an anomaly in the storage of carbohydrates or in the production of glucose by the liver are other possibilities. However, most cases occur in diabetic patients and are related to medications. If the dose is excessive for the amount of food ingested, the drug decreases sugar levels more than intended. This pathology is sometimes observed in people with psychological disorders who self-medicate with insulin or hypoglycemic drugs. Some forms of stomach surgery also cause dietary hypoglycemia between meals. A rare cause is an autoimmune disease in which the body produces antibodies against insulin. Finally, it can also be the result of heart or kidney failure, liver disease, cancer, malnutrition, shock, and serious infection. //Diagnosis// A clinical picture suggestive of anxiety, with behavior similar to drunkenness or the presence of other symptoms of altered brain functions, implies the determination of blood sugar and insulin values. Signs of hypoglycemia rarely develop at blood sugar values ​​greater than 50 mg/dl. Its low concentrations, together with the symptoms of the disease, confirm the diagnosis. If the manifestations improve when the values ​​increase a few minutes after ingesting sugar, the diagnosis receives definitive confirmation. The next step is to determine the origin of the hypoglycemia, based on the patient's clinical history, physical examination and some laboratory tests. In some cases, other complementary tests and, sometimes, hospital admission are necessary. Although some insulin-secreting pancreatic tumors may be visible on computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or ultrasound, they are usually so small that they go unnoticed. In these situations, exploratory surgery is necessary to detect these tumors. //Treatment// The initial measures, after a confirmed diagnosis, consist of taking 10 to 15 grams of sugar diluted in a small amount of water or juice, repeating the blood glucose measurement three to five minutes after ingestion. If the values ​​are still not within the normal range, the process should be repeated until the blood glucose levels stabilize. After stabilization, within 10 to 15 minutes a meal rich in slow-absorption carbohydrates, such as bread, pasta, crackers or toast, should be eaten. In the case of severe hypoglycemia, with agitation, changes in the state of consciousness or unconsciousness, help must come from third parties and involves laying the patient on their side, placing a piece of sugar on the inside of the cheek, and, if available, administering glucagon (hormone produced by the pancreas) intramuscularly or subcutaneously and contact the emergency room. It is important to emphasize that the intake should actually be sugar and not another food. While sugar is absorbed extremely quickly, other sweets contain fats that slow down its absorption. It is recommended that a diabetic patient always have three to four packets of sugar in their wallet. Insulin-secreting tumors must be surgically removed. In the case of diabetic patients with frequent episodes of hypoglycemia, it is important to review their treatment in order to achieve better glycemia control throughout the day. //Prevention// In the case of diabetics, it is necessary to monitor blood glucose throughout the day, eat carbohydrates with every meal, adjust insulin doses to dietary needs and physical exercise and vary the insulin administration sites. Patients who are predisposed to hypoglycemia can avoid these episodes by eating smaller meals than the usual three a day. They should also carry identification to inform emergency department staff of their condition.
