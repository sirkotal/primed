Hypotension,"//What is it?// It is thanks to the heart that blood circulates throughout our body through blood vessels. Blood pressure is the force exerted on the walls of the arteries by the blood that is pumped. There are several factors that can influence blood pressure, such as physical exercise, which causes an increase, or exposure to heat, which lowers it. Hypotension, or low blood pressure, means that the pressure at which the blood circulates is lower than what would be considered normal. According to the Portuguese Cardiology Foundation, blood pressure is considered normal when the minimum levels are up to 80 and the maximum levels are up to 120. However, hypotension ends up being a somewhat relative term, as blood pressure levels vary according to individual characteristics and what is considered low for one person may not be low for another, being worrying when it has a negative impact on the person. . //Symptoms// In general, chronic hypotension is considered worrisome if it causes symptoms such as: Dizziness when sitting or standing up;/ Imbalance;/ Nausea;/ Fainting;/ Dehydration and an abnormal feeling of thirst;/ Difficulty concentrating;/ Blurred vision;/ Pale, cold, clammy skin;/ Rapid and shallow breathing;/ Fatigue;/ Depression;/ Weakness;/ //Causes// Low blood pressure can occur in the following cases: Pregnancy, particularly in the first 24 weeks;/ Significant blood loss;/ Certain medications, such as diuretics or drugs to treat high blood pressure, heart disease, Parkinson's disease, depression, or erectile dysfunction;/ Heart problems, such as bradycardia, heart valve problems, heart attack (myocardial infarction) or heart failure;/ Endocrine problems, such as hypothyroidism or diabetes;/ Severe infection (septic shock);/ Allergic reaction (anaphylaxis);/ Nutritional deficiencies, such as vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency, as they can cause anemia;/ Emotional stress, fear, insecurity or pain;/ Dehydration, which reduces blood volume;/ Body's reaction to heat;/ //Diagnosis// To facilitate diagnosis, keep a diary of your symptoms and what you were doing at the time they occurred. Assessment of blood pressure levels is done by measuring blood pressure using a digital or manual sphygmomanometer. //Treatment// When a person does not present symptoms associated with hypotension or if these are not significant, treatment is not necessary. If, on the other hand, signs that may indicate the presence of a problem appear, the patient should consult their doctor. Treatment for hypotension will depend on the factor that is causing it. For example, if its origin is medication, the solution may be to adjust the dose or if it is due to a stomach ulcer, treating it can also treat hypotension. If a reason cannot be found that could be associated with low blood pressure, medication may be prescribed to raise it. Increasing fluid and salt intake may improve symptoms of hypotension. It is, however, important to emphasize that none of these measures should be adopted without medical advice. //Prevention// To prevent blood pressure levels from falling too low, simply adopt some simple lifestyle habits, such as: Stand up and sit down slowly;/ Raise the head of the bed by about 15 cm;/ Eat small meals frequently;/ Increase water intake;/ Avoid spending long periods standing or sitting without moving;/ Do not change position or posture suddenly;/ Avoid excessive alcohol or caffeinated beverage intake late in the day;/ American Heart Association, maio de 2019 Better Health Channel, May 2019 Fundação Paulista de Cardiologia, May 2019 Medical News Today, May 2019 National Health Service, May 2019 About us;/ Events;/ Clients and Companions;/ News;/ CUF Academic Center;/ Partnerships;/ Contacts;/ Frequently Asked Questions;/ Join us;/ Virtual Visit;/ English version;/ My CUF;/ Access Solutions and Health Plans;/ Facebook;/ Facebook Instagram;/ Instagram LinkedInCreated with Sketch.;/ LinkedIn Youtube;/ Youtube award4;/ award4 certification1;/ certification1 certification2;/ certification2 certification3;/ certification3 Complaints and compliments;/ Complaints and compliments Privacy and Cookies Policy;/ Terms and Conditions;/ Whistleblower Channel;/ © CUF 2024 All rights reserved Start;/ Health A-Z: Diseases, Symptoms and Treatments;/"
Hypothyroidism,"//What is it?// Hypothyroidism is a decrease in the production of thyroid hormones and results in changes in the regulation of metabolism and the use of energy by the body. It is the most common functional thyroid disease and reflects deficient hormone production. It is usually caused by primary thyroid failure, but it can also result from decreased TSH stimulation of the thyroid (central or secondary hypothyroidism). Autoimmune thyroiditis, also called Hashimoto's thyroiditis or chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, is the leading cause of hypothyroidism (70%) and is associated with high titers of anti-thyroid antibodies.  //Symptoms// The clinical manifestation is gradual and non-specific, so diagnosis is often delayed. Symptoms are varied and include fatigue, dry skin, hair loss and brittleness, slight weight gain, dull complexion, intolerance to cold, irritability, forgetfulness, depression, menstrual irregularities and even infertility. //Causes// Hypothyroidism results from insufficient hormone production by the thyroid gland. There are several causes: Autoimmune diseases: Hashimoto's disease or Hashimoto's thyroiditis. It is the most common cause of hypothyroidism. It is an autoimmune disease characterized by a disorder of the immune system in which antibodies attack the cells of the thyroid gland itself, causing inflammation and interfering with the ability to produce hormones;;/ Exaggerated response to hyperthyroidism treatment: Treatment of hyperthyroidism (a condition characterized by excess production of thyroid hormones) with radioactive iodine and medications can sometimes exceed normal levels and cause hypothyroidism.;/ Thyroid surgery: total or partial removal of the thyroid can lead to a decrease in hormone production that needs to be compensated for with medication.;/ Radiation therapy: Radiation treatments for head and neck tumors can affect thyroid hormone production.;/ Medications: Some drugs such as lithium can cause hypothyroidism.;/ Other less common conditions can also cause hypothyroidism: congenital disease, pituitary disease, pregnancy, iodine deficiency.;/ //Diagnosis// In the presence of a clinical picture suggestive of hypothyroidism such as fatigue, dry skin, constipation and weight gain, tests will be prescribed to determine the diagnosis of this condition. Laboratory studies include the measurement of TSH, which is the thyroid-stimulating hormone, and the levels of thyroxine (t4)  and triiodothyronine (t3), which are the hormones produced in the thyroid gland. An increase in TSH means that there is an effort by the body to force the production of hormones and is a response to the decrease in levels of these in circulation. Other tests may be necessary to diagnose the causes of the disease, namely the investigation and measurement of antithyroid antibodies. //Treatment// Treatment involves hormone replacement therapy with levothyroxine, which must be taken daily and on an empty stomach, that is, approximately 20 to 30 minutes before a meal. The dose is individualized according to age, weight and associated pathologies. It may take around six months for the clinical situation to stabilize. As in most cases hypothyroidism is permanent, treatment and follow-up are for the rest of your life. //Prevention// There is no way to prevent it, but people at higher risk of hypothyroidism (for example, women during pregnancy) should consult their doctor about the need for iodine supplements. Screening for hypothyroidism is only indicated in symptomatic patients, and may eventually be done in people at risk: history of autoimmune disease;/ previous radiation treatment to the head or neck;/ goiter;/ family history of thyroid problems;/ use of medications known to affect thyroid function;/ These people may be tested for early signs of the disease. If the results are positive, they should take steps to prevent the disease from progressing. There is no evidence that a specific diet prevents hypothyroidism, and there is no way to prevent it.

Hypotonia,"//What is it?// Hypotonia is defined as a decrease in resistance to passive movement. It is easily recognized when observing the newborn, being one of the most frequent signs of illness in this age group. It is a nonspecific clinical sign, but often associated with serious illness, so early diagnosis is important to establish appropriate therapy, establish prognosis and offer genetic counseling. The wide variety of underlying causes and corresponding complementary tests highlights the importance of a methodical and systematic investigation. We speak of hypotonia when there is a reduction in muscle tone. It is a symptom and not a disease in itself. Healthy muscles are never completely relaxed. There is always some degree of tension and stiffness that translates into resistance to movement. During sleep, muscle tone is lower. Hypotonia is different from muscle weakness, although it is sometimes difficult to distinguish the two conditions, which can even occur in the same patient. However, hypotonia is more common in newborns or children. It can also occur in later stages of life. //Symptoms// Signs include little or no control of the neck muscles, allowing the head to droop, a very limp body when picked up, an inability to bear any weight on the legs or shoulders, arms and legs hanging down at the sides of the body instead of having a normal flexion at the elbows, knees and heels, difficulty sucking and swallowing and a weak cry. Development in these children is slower, taking longer until they are able to crawl, walk and feed themselves. In adults, hypotonia translates into loss of balance with frequent falls, difficulty in getting up from a sitting or lying position, an unusually high degree of flexibility in the heels, knees and elbows, difficulty in reaching or lifting an object. //Causes// It can result from a deficit of oxygen or cerebral irrigation, these being the most common causes in newborns;;/ Hypotonia appears associated with many cases of cerebral palsy;;/ Premature newborns, born before 37 weeks, experience hypotonia because their muscle tone is not yet fully developed:;/ Many cases result from an interruption in signals transmitted to muscles from nerves. This may occur at the level of the brain or spinal cord (central hypotonia), or be the result of more peripheral nerve damage (peripheral hypotonia). Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy is the main cause of in newborns. Central causes of hypotonia (acute or chronic) are more common in the neonatal period (60-80%) than peripheral causes (20-40%), with the prognosis generally being more serious in the latter. In the neonatal period, the main causes are spinal muscular atrophy type I, congenital myotonic dystrophy and congenital myopathies.;/ But the list of diseases that can cause it is very long. In babies and children the following are found: cerebral palsy, brain and spinal cord injuries, meningitis, encephalitis, Down syndrome, Tay-Sachs syndrome, congenital hypothyroidism, spinal muscular atrophy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, myasthenia gravis, dystrophy muscle, Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. In older age, the most common causes are multiple sclerosis and motor neuron diseases. //Diagnosis// Clinical observation is essential to try to discover the underlying cause. As a rule, laboratory tests, imaging studies such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalogram, electromyography, and genetic studies are necessary. More specific tests such as muscle biopsies or nerve conduction studies may also be requested. It is important to emphasize that, in some cases, the origin of the condition is not detected, even with exhaustive investigation. //Treatment// Depending on its cause, hypotonia may improve, stabilize or worsen over time. In the case of prematurity, hypotonia tends to improve as the child develops. In many other situations, it is not treatable, so the approach involves physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy. Physiotherapy improves posture and motor coordination and helps to strengthen the muscles around the joints, providing greater stability. //Prevention// Considering that hypotonia can have such diverse causes, it is difficult to say that it can be prevented, especially with regard to the genetic diseases associated with it. In the case of congenital anomalies related to pregnancy, all precautions to have a healthy pregnancy can be useful in preventing this and other clinical conditions. Correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment of the underlying disease can also prevent or minimize hypotonia.

Hirsutism,"//What is it?// It is defined as the presence of hair in women, in anatomical areas characteristic of male distribution. Depending on the cause, hirsutism may manifest as an isolated complaint or accompanied by other signs of hyperandrogyny (acne, seborrhea, baldness), virilization (clitoral hypertrophy, increased muscle mass, changes in voice tone), menstrual disorders and/or infertility or even metabolic changes. It results from the action of androgens (male sex hormones) circulating on the skin. This occurs due to the presence and activity of enzymes capable of making substances with androgenic properties available inside the pilosebaceous follicle. Hirsutism is usually the result of medical conditions that are not serious. However, it can sometimes be a sign of a serious medical condition and this should be taken into account when evaluating the condition. Most women seek treatment for cosmetic reasons, as excess hairiness clashes with Western cultural standards and is therefore a source of discomfort and reduced self-esteem. Since the pattern of hair distribution varies from woman to woman, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between variations of normality and hirsutism. //Symptoms// In addition to the distribution of hair with masculine characteristics, women may present typical male baldness, a deep voice, breast atrophy, increased muscle mass and clitoral hypertrophy. //Causes// Hirsutism can result from three categories: Excess androgens produced by the ovaries and/or adrenal glands;;/ Increased skin sensitivity to circulating androgens;;/ Situations involving secondary changes in androgen transport and/or metabolism.;/ The first case includes polycystic ovary syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Cushing's syndrome and tumors of the ovaries or adrenal glands, which produce androgens. The second group is “idiopathic”, characterized by isolated hirsutism in the presence of regular menstrual cycles. The third group includes situations such as thyroid disease, hyperprolactinemia, use of drugs (phenothiazines, danazol, metyrapone, cyclosporine, among others) that can secondarily lead to this condition. Polycystic ovary syndrome is the most common cause of hirsutism of glandular origin. Its prevalence in women of reproductive age varies between 4% and 8% and is associated with hirsutism, oligo/amenorrhea (reduced or absent menstrual period) and infertility. Symptoms appear around puberty and progress over time. A significant number of patients are obese and in 30% to 60% of cases, especially in obese patients, insulin resistance occurs. These patients have a higher risk of developing impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes mellitus. Other dermatological manifestations such as acne and baldness are observed in a smaller number of individuals. Although the cause of this syndrome is unknown, the occurrence of a familial pattern suggests a genetic component of the disease. //Diagnosis// Diagnosis depends on the cause. For polycystic ovary syndrome, the criteria include at least two of the following three: Ovulatory dysfunction;;/ Evidence of clinical (signs and symptoms) or laboratory (increased serum androgen concentrations) hyperandrogynism;;/ Polycystic appearance of the ovaries on ultrasound.;/ Idiopathic hirsutism is defined by the presence of isolated hirsutism, with regular menstrual and ovulatory cycles and preserved fertility. As a rule, diagnosis involves laboratory evaluation. A pregnancy test, total testosterone and free testosterone levels, as well as other hormones, must be performed. //Treatment// Treatment should aim to control obesity and insulin resistance, acne, menstrual irregularities, infertility and metabolic complications. It is important to make lifestyle changes for at least six months before starting specific treatment for infertility. Metformin helps reduce insulin resistance, reduces the production of male sex hormones and improves fertility. Oral contraceptives are first-line drugs because they inhibit the production of ovarian androgens, improve hirsutism and acne and protect the endometrium, as well as progesterone, although they do not normalize male sex hormone levels or prevent pregnancy. Antiandrogens such as spironolactone or cyproterone acetate reduce the levels of male sex hormones, responsible for the manifestations of hirsutism. //Prevention// Hirsutism cannot be prevented. When it occurs in the context of polycystic ovary syndrome, it is important to control obesity and prevent insulin resistance.

Hysterectomy,"//What is it?// Hysterectomy involves the surgical removal of the uterus. Women who undergo this procedure stop menstruating and are also unable to get pregnant. Depending on the reason for the surgery, hysterectomy may be associated with adnexectomy, that is, the removal of the ovaries and fallopian tubes. If the ovaries are also removed, in addition to stopping menstruating, the woman may enter menopause earlier - surgical menopause. There are three types of hysterectomy: Total: consists of removing the uterus and cervix.;/ Supracervical: the upper part of the uterus is removed, but the cervix is ​​preserved.;/ Radical: removal of the uterus and cervix, as well as surrounding structures such as part of the vagina and lymph nodes.;/  The surgery is most frequently performed on women between the ages of 40 and 50.  //Who is it for?// Hysterectomy is usually performed as a form of surgical treatment for diseases that affect the female reproductive system and that do not benefit from other forms of medical treatment: Menorrhagia (menstruation with heavy and prolonged bleeding);/ Chronic pelvic pain;/ Fibroids (benign tumor that grows in the tissue of the uterus);/ Endometriosis;/ Recurrent uterine polyps;/ Cancer of the ovaries, uterus, cervix or fallopian tubes;/ Uterine prolapse (when the uterus drops into the vaginal canal due to weakened muscles), causing urinary incontinence;/ Adenomyosis (growth of endometrial tissue inside the walls of the uterus);/ Hyperplasia (increased number of cells in the uterus);/  //How the procedure is performed// A hysterectomy takes about one to three hours, but the length of the surgery depends on the size of the uterus, the physical condition of the patient, any other concomitant pathologies and the possible need to remove other organs. There are three surgical approaches to performing a hysterectomy: laparotomy, laparoscopy or vaginally, and the choice of surgical approach depends on the reason for the surgery. Alaparotomy (or abdominal hysterectomy) consists of removing the uterus from an incision in the abdomen. This type of approach is more common in cases of cancer, when the uterus is enlarged or when there is also disease that has spread to other pelvic areas. When compared to vaginal hysterectomy or laparoscopy, abdominal hysterectomy involves a longer recovery period and is associated with a greater risk of complications such as infection, blood loss, risk of pulmonary embolism, etc. In the laparoscopic procedure, a laparoscope (a small tube with a video camera) is inserted into the abdomen through a small incision. Several other small incisions are made for the insertion of other surgical instruments. The uterus is removed through these small incisions made in the abdomen or through the vagina. Laparoscopy can also be done robotically. Compared to laparotomy, laparoscopy involves less recovery time and is associated with a lower risk of complications. Vaginal hysterectomy is considered the preferred approach, as it is the least invasive and has a shorter recovery period and less risk of complications. In this procedure, the uterus is removed through an incision at the top of the vagina.  //Recovery and complications// Hysterectomy offers a greater quality of life to women who suffer from conditions that permanently affect the reproductive system, however, it is not reversible, the recovery period is long (between four to six weeks) and, like any other surgery, it involves risks and side effects, such as: Thrombosis (blood clots);/ Infection;/ Blood loss;/ Intestinal occlusion;/ Urinary tract injury;/ Adverse reaction to anesthesia;/ Incontinence;/ Decreased libido;/ Prolapso vaginal;/  //What to Expect After a Hysterectomy// Hysterectomy permanently changes some aspects of a woman's life. In addition to stopping menstruating, the patient may enter menopause earlier than normal if the ovaries are also removed (surgical menopause). Normally, a woman's sex life is not affected and may even improve.

Hpv human papillomavirus,"//What is it?// HPV, or Human Papilloma Virus, is responsible for a high number of infections, which are most often asymptomatic and regress spontaneously. This is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections worldwide. HPV can lead to benign lesions, such as warts, condylomas and benign lesions of the oropharynx, and, in relatively rare situations, can progress to cancer, with special emphasis on cervical cancer. As the name suggests, HPV is a common virus in humans, responsible for the formation of lesions called papillomas. There are different types of HPV; some types can infect the anogenital area, while others infect areas such as the feet or hands, where they can lead to warts or “blackheads.” Viruses that infect the anogenital area can be transmitted during vaginal, oral, or anal sex, or during intimate skin-to-skin contact between people where at least one person is infected. In the sexually active population, 50 to 80% of individuals acquire HPV infection at some point in their lives, although in the vast majority of cases there is no progression to symptomatic disease. Cervical cancer, the second most common type of cancer in women worldwide, is the most relevant disease associated with HPV infection, especially when it is not detected early, progressing to invasive forms. In fact, approximately 100% of cervical cancer cases are related to HPV infection. Progression to cervical cancer is very slow and generally asymptomatic. Persistent HPV infection has a prolonged latency period (years or decades between the onset of infection and the development of tumors) passing through several phases. To date, there are more than 200 types of HPV identified, of which around 40 preferentially infect the anogenital system: vulva, vagina, cervix, penis and perianal areas. Regarding cervical cancer, existing national data points to around 1,000 new cases every year, with an incidence rate of 20.95/100,000 women, for all ages. Total mortality from cervical cancer in Portugal is 4.5/100,000 women over 15 years of age. HPV can also be associated with cancer of the vulva, penis and anus, among others. //Symptoms// HPV generally causes a silent infection in which many of those infected have no symptoms or signs. Sometimes warts are present but not visible because they are located on an internal part of the body, or because they are very small. Anogenital warts, also called condylomas, can appear as small, raised, cauliflower-like lesions, or they can be flat. In women, warts can appear on the vulva, cervix, thighs, anus, rectum, or urethra. HPV does not appear to affect the ability to get pregnant. In very rare situations, HPV can lodge in the oropharynx of an infected child during birth. During pregnancy, the number and size of warts may increase, but they usually decrease after giving birth. //Causes// Genital HPV infections are generally transmitted sexually, through direct contact with the skin or mucosa, and, more rarely, during childbirth. Some cases of transmission by orogenital contact have also been described. Although many women become infected with HPV, the infection rarely progresses to cancer. Some factors have been identified that increase the risk of persistent HPV infection and progression to cancer: some types of virus (HPV 16 and HPV 18); co-infection with various immunodeficiencies; early onset of sexual activity; multiple sexual partners; multiple births; genetic predisposition; smoking habits; co-infection with other sexually transmitted microorganisms (mainly Herpes Simplex virus type 2 and Chlamydia trachomatis). Some studies suggest that prolonged use of oral contraceptives may be another risk factor for progression to cervical cancer. //Diagnosis// Regularly performing the Pap test helps identify early changes in colon cells, allowing for treatment and surveillance. This routine cytological test is an important screening tool, as there is no way to know in advance which person the virus will persist and develop into cancer. If these changes are not identified early, there is the possibility of them developing into more serious injuries and, eventually, cancer. The HPV-DNA test, which enables the genetic characterization of the virus, is available in Portugal, but is not part of regular screening. This more specific test can be recommended in situations of colon changes detected by the screening test. //Treatment// There is no known cure for HPV infections, but the vast majority of people have an adequate immune system and can eliminate the infection from their bodies. Although a high percentage of sexually active people are infected with HPV, only a small proportion will develop cancer. Treatment involves applying a product to the lesions. Methods may include cryotherapy, electrocoagulation, laser or, very rarely, surgical excision. Sometimes warts can return after treatment, making it necessary to repeat the treatment. //Prevention// Preventing HPV infection depends, above all, on the behaviors adopted. It is important to know preventive measures and use them consistently, learn to recognize the signs and symptoms of sexually transmitted infections, their consequences and methods of transmission. Women should regularly undergo a gynecological examination and undergo colpocytology and/or HPV-DNA testing, if recommended and available, even if you have had the vaccine. The use of condoms is recommended to prevent all sexually transmitted infections. It is important to emphasize that areas of skin not covered by the condom are not protected. It is very important to talk to your partner about sexually transmitted infections and their prevention and to bear in mind that a partner's previous behaviors are also a risk factor, especially if they have had multiple previous partners. Vaccination is essential and should be done by women, in accordance with the National Vaccination Program, or as recommended by a doctor. There are currently two vaccines that offer protection against types 16 and 18, responsible for around 70% of cervical cancer cases. One of them also protects against types 6 and 11, responsible for around 90% of anogenital warts, and, additionally, against types 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58, which provide extra protection against cervical cancers in plus 20%. Routine universal vaccination with the HPV vaccine applies to young people who turn ten years of age in the respective calendar year, in two doses. Vaccination does not require any prior analytical test to be carried out.

Jaundice,"//What is it?// Jaundice is the yellowing of the sclera (i.e. the white surface of the eye) and the skin. Jaundice is not a disease in itself, but rather a manifestation of a disease. Its degree is assessed by measuring the amount of a substance called bilirubin in the blood.  //Symptoms// Jaundice can either appear suddenly or develop slowly. The main signs and symptoms of jaundice include: yellow sclera and skin, darker urine, normal or whitish stools, depending on the type of underlying disease.   //Causes// Red blood cells degrade and have a limited lifespan, which is why they are renewed periodically, that is, when some end their lifespan they are replaced by others. This renewal involves the intervention of the liver, whose function is to clean part of the degradation products from red blood cells. From this renewal, a pigment called bilirubin appears, which when it accumulates in the blood causes jaundice. This buildup occurs when red blood cells break down more than normal or when the liver is not functioning normally. The main processes that can cause an increase in bilirubin in the blood and, consequently, jaundice are: Increased destruction of red blood cells, as in some types of anemia, namely hemolytic anemia;;/ Decreased liver conjugation capacity;;/ Decreased excretory capacity of the liver;/ Most of the time, lower conjugation capacity and liver excretion are associated. This is what happens in viral hepatitis, which is one of the most common causes of jaundice in children. When there are gallstones, the main defect is hepatic excretion. These different mechanisms determine the type of bilirubin that accumulates in the blood. The blood test measures total, direct and indirect bilirubin. Also the shade of jaundice can vary depending on the underlying disease.  //Diagnosis// The presence of jaundice is detected by clinical examination and involves detailed medical investigation to identify its cause. In this context it is important to repeat that jaundice is not a disease in itself, but rather the visible manifestation of an underlying disease. After taking the patient's medical history and performing a physical examination, the doctor may request additional tests, starting with blood tests, which will indicate the amount of bilirubin and red blood cells present in the blood, as well as showing the functioning of the liver through specific liver function tests. Other tests may be performed, but they depend on the underlying cause of the jaundice. The tests to be requested initially are: blood count, liver function tests, virus screening and abdominal ultrasound. //Treatment// Treatment for jaundice depends on its cause. Therefore, only after diagnosing the disease causing jaundice can we treat the patient. Carotenemia is the name given to this condition which, despite being visually strange, is not dangerous.

Neonatal jaundice,"//What is it?// Jaundice is the yellowish discoloration of the sclerae (i.e. the white surface of the eye) and skin. It is usually due to physiological immaturity of the newborn, but it can also mean illness, which is why parents should always inform the baby's pediatrician. Jaundice originates from the degradation of red blood cells. These blood cells are renewed periodically, that is, when some end their lifespan they are replaced by others. This renewal involves the intervention of the liver, whose function is to clean part of the degradation products from red blood cells. When the liver is immature, jaundice may appear in this physiological cycle, which is assessed by the quantification of a substance called bilirubin in the blood. In general terms, it can be stated that jaundice is more evident the higher the bilirubin value, hence the term hyperbilirubinemia. It should be noted that in black children, observing jaundice on the skin is more difficult due to the babies' natural color, which is why you should always pay attention to the color of the sclera.  //Causes// In newborns, jaundice is in most cases physiological, or developmental, usually appearing on the 3rd day of life, as a result of the newborn's hepatic immaturity. Premature babies have a higher incidence of this type of jaundice, precisely because they are more immature. This jaundice, although not considered a disease, may require phototherapy. What determines the need for therapy is the level of bilirubin in the blood. Developmental jaundice usually resolves within 15 days of life. Another frequent cause of jaundice in the neonatal period is blood incompatibility between the mother and the newborn. Parents are familiar with the different blood types, as well as the RH factor. Incompatibilities can also arise between the blood of mother and child, leading to greater and earlier destruction of red blood cells, causing jaundice. Not all human blood is compatible with each other, and can cause defensive immunological reactions with the consequent production of antibodies. Other rare causes of jaundice in the neonatal period exist, generally associated with important diseases.  //Symptoms// The main symptom is jaundice itself, but in cases of blood incompatibility, associated with major destruction of red blood cells, there may be paleness of the skin and mucous membranes due to associated anemia.  //Diagnosis// The diagnosis of jaundice is clinical, as it is made by looking at the baby. But the exact value of bilirubin is determined by measuring it in the newborn's blood. However, there are devices that reliably measure values ​​transcutaneously, so in most mild cases this method is sufficient. //Treatment// When there are excessive levels of bilirubin in the blood, the treatment is phototherapy. It is a treatment in which the baby's entire body surface, with the exception of the eyes, is exposed to a special fluorescent light whose characteristics reduce bilirubin in the blood and, therefore, jaundice. During this treatment, the eyes must be protected, as well as the baby must be offered more liquids. Popular beliefs about treating jaundice by placing the baby in the sun or giving water to drink from stones have no scientific basis.  //Prevention// Blood incompatibility, specifically the RH factor, can and should be prevented by administering specific antibodies to the mother. ABO group incompatibilities are detected in the neonatal period, therefore prevention is not carried out. Developmental jaundice cannot be prevented.  Carotenemia is the name given to this condition which, despite being visually strange, is not dangerous. Not to be confused with jaundice, a situation that is associated with the disease The baby uses its mouth to satisfy its food needs, but also to provide relief from pain and tension through sucking. Abdominal pain in children often requires a trip to the doctor. However, these are not always expressed correctly. Identify the warning signs.

Impetigo,"//What is it?// Impetigo is a common skin infection and occurs mainly in children between 2 and 5 years old. However, anyone of any age can have impetigo, and adults often become infected through contact with children. Caused by bacteria, impetigo is very contagious and can be transmitted quickly within the family and at school.  //Symptoms of impetigo// Impetigo can cause symptoms such as red, painful, itchy skin, swollen glands and, less commonly, fever or feeling unwell. Symptoms may vary depending on the type of impetigo:  It usually consists of an infection with Streptococcus pyogenes, although recent data have demonstrated more cases of Staphylococcus aureus as the cause of nonbullous impetigo. It is the most common type and evolves in different phases: Initially, only one or a few sores appear, often associated with itching;/ The wound ""bursts"" and the skin may appear red in that area;/ Glands located near the wound may become swollen.;/ Scabs form on wounds;/ The skin heals without scars forming (except when it is scratched or scratched);/  It is possible for the infection to spread to other areas of the body, going through the stages described above again. This is why early treatment is so important.  It is the least common type of impetigo and is caused exclusively by Staphylococcus aureus, consisting of a clinical situation that requires urgent medical advice. In this type of impetigo, blisters with liquid appear, but without redness in the surrounding skin, going through the following phases: Blisters appear that contain a cloudy or yellowish liquid (pus);/ The bubbles become softer and more transparent, eventually ""bursting"";/ Crusts form in areas where the blisters ruptured;/ The skin tends to heal without scarring.;/  Impetigo can appear on any area of ​​the body, although it is most common on exposed areas of skin, such as the face (around the nose and mouth) and hands. Bacteria are easily transmitted and new lesions can form in different locations from where the original infection formed.  //Causes// Impetigo is caused by bacteria mainly Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus, which infect the skin through: Cortes;/ Scratches;/ Insect bites;/ Burns;/ Rash;/ Wounds;/  Impetigo can also appear on the skin of children who, for example, have had chickenpox or itchy eczema - by scratching the skin, a ""gateway"" for bacteria is created, and impetigo can develop. Sometimes impetigo also develops on intact skin. The bacteria that cause impetigo thrive in hot, humid places, which is why this infection is more common in places with this climate. The main way impetigo is transmitted is through skin-to-skin contact with someone who is infected. For example, contact sports – such as wrestling and football – carry a higher risk of transmitting impetigo. However, contagion can also occur indirectly, that is, through contact with surfaces, towels, sports equipment and clothing used by the person with impetigo. People with diabetes or who are immunocompromised are at greater risk of developing impetigo.  //Diagnosis// Diagnosing impetigo involves observing the skin, particularly the characteristics of the rash. However, the attending physician or dermatologist can prescribe tests to help diagnose the problem or even to obtain more information to outline the most appropriate treatment plan. These may include, for example, laboratory analysis of pus taken from a blister or even skin so that the doctor can determine, for example, which type of bacteria is responsible for the infection. When the infection is spread throughout the body, blood tests may be needed. It is also important to determine whether impetigo developed after another skin problem, such as scabies. When impetigo continues to worsen or if recurrent episodes occur, your doctor may prescribe a skin or nasal swab to see if the bacteria present there are causing the impetigo episodes.  //Treatment of impetigo// It is important to treat impetigo to prevent possible complications of the infection, such as the development of new lesions, the presence of blisters for several weeks - with treatment, impetigo can disappear within a few days (and is no longer contagious after about 24 to 48 hours), without treatment it can last for 2-4 weeks - or the spread of the infection to deeper layers of the skin, which can be serious. In addition, treatment can also reduce the risk of passing the infection on to other people. The first step in treating impetigo is to regularly remove the scabs using warm water and soap. Afterwards, an antibiotic ointment should be applied (ideally not prolonged or frequently on the same person, as it can contribute to the development of resistance to bacteria). Lastly, cover areas of skin with impetigo to help heal as well as prevent transmission. There are situations in which antibiotics may be used, such as: Topical treatment alone is not effective in resolving impetigo;/ Presence of multiple and/or recurrent lesions;/ Widespread lesions;/ Epidemiological context in the family or at school;/  Children with impetigo cannot go to school until the problem is cured or when the doctor determines that there is no longer a risk of contagion - it is an illness that requires school avoidance. All patients with impetigo must take care to avoid transmission to other people: Avoid direct skin-to-skin contact;/ Keep wounds and blisters covered with gauze and adhesive;/ Wash your hands after touching the lesions;/  //Prevention// There are some measures that can be put into practice to prevent impetigo: Treat injuries (such as cuts or insect bites) as quickly as possible.;/ Take a shower after playing sports.;/ Always wash your hands with soap and water after using the bathroom or whenever they are dirty and dry them with a clean towel.;/ Avoid sharing personal objects, such as clothes, towels and sports equipment.;/ Wear clean clothes, avoiding taking them out of the dirty clothes basket (especially sportswear).;/  Some strategies that people with impetigo can adopt to prevent passing the infection to others, as well as spreading it to other areas of the body, include: Avoid direct skin-to-skin contact with other people until your doctor determines that there is no longer a risk of contagion.;/ Do not touch or scratch or itch the lesions.;/ Do not share personal objects, such as towels, toys, bedding or other items that the person with impetigo has used.;/ Keep injuries clean and covered.;/ Wash your hands with soap and water after touching injuries, using the bathroom or whenever they are dirty. Dry them on a clean towel.;/ Use a clean towel every time you bathe or need to dry the affected area.;/ Wash clothes, towels and bedding that have come into contact with the person with impetigo in hot water (at least 60 ºC) separately.;/ Wash clothing and bedding daily during the first few days of treatment.;/ In daily skin care, use a spoon or other object to remove the cream from the packaging. This will prevent the cream from getting contaminated inside the packaging.;/ Disinfect surfaces that the person with impetigo has touched, such as countertops and doorknobs.;/ Keep your nails short, as impetigo can cause itching and lead you to scratch your skin, so at least the likelihood of damaging your skin is lower.;/ American Academy of Dermatology Association, agosto de 2022 British Association of Dermatologists, agosto de 2022 Brazilian Society of Pediatrics, August 2022 Load more;/ We've debunked ten common myths about COVID-19 so that misinformation doesn't put you at risk of contracting the disease.

Active middle ear implants,"//What is it?// In normal hearing, the sound captured by the auricle is conducted to the eardrum, causing it to vibrate. This vibration is transmitted by the ossicles to the cochlea, where it will produce an electrical stimulus that is conducted to the brain by the auditory nerve and will be understood as an auditory sensation. Unlike conventional hearing aids, which provide more acoustic energy (""louder sound""), Active Middle Ear Implants capture and process ambient sound by providing mechanical stimulation (vibration) to the ossicles of the middle ear or directly to the fluid contained in the cochlea through the round membrane. Active Middle Ear Implants are partially or fully implanted electromagnetic devices that capture ambient sound, process it, and provide mechanical/vibrational stimulation to the structures of the middle ear. Partially implanted devices have an external component (containing the microphone, battery, processor, and transmitter) attached behind and above the ear through magnetic attraction to the internal component. The internal component is surgically implanted under the skin. The signal sent by the external processor is captured and converted into vibration by a transducer fixed to one of the ossicles of the middle ear or applied directly to the membrane of the round window. In fully implanted devices, all elements are implanted under the scalp and are completely invisible. The battery is charged daily using an external magnetically attached charger, with the charge lasting approximately 45 minutes. //Who can benefit?// Adults with moderate to severe sensorineural deafness who do not benefit from or cannot tolerate conventional hearing aids;/ Patients with external ear pathology (eczema of the auricle or ear canal, recurrent otitis externa, occlusion of the ear canal, etc.);/ Individuals with mixed or conductive deafness (due to changes in the eardrum, malformation or destruction of the ossicular chain, etc.);/  Currently, the indications and results of Active Middle Ear Implants overlap greatly with those of hearing aids. The fact that they do not require an earmold occluding the ear canal makes them very comfortable, avoiding the feeling of plugging or humidity reported by many individuals with conventional hearing aids. Active Middle Ear Implants, in addition to being completely invisible from the outside, allow you to maintain your hearing while sleeping, in the shower or while swimming.  //Limitations// They are not indicated in situations of active middle ear infection.;/ Some models do not allow for magnetic resonance imaging examinations;/ The battery of fully implantable devices currently has a predictable lifespan of 15 years, with replacement accomplished through minor surgery;/ //Surgery// The surgery is performed under general anesthesia, lasts approximately two hours and requires only one day of hospitalization.

Cochlear implants,"//What are they?// In certain cases of severe to profound deafness, the hair cells in the cochlea are so damaged that stimulation of the auditory pathway by sound or vibration cannot ensure an improvement in auditory perception. Cochlear implants convert environmental sound into electrical signals and transmit them directly to the auditory nerve through electrodes surgically implanted inside the cochlea. Cochlear implants are surgically implanted electronic devices that directly stimulate the auditory nerve, thereby providing an auditory sensation.  They are made up of two components: External Component;/ Generally used behind the ear, like a hearing aid, it consists of a microphone that captures ambient sound, a processor (minicomputer) that transforms these sounds into an electrical code and a transmitter that sends this code via radio frequency and through the skin to the internal component.  Internal Component;/ It is surgically implanted under the skin behind the ear. It consists of a receiver that receives the signal encoded by the external component and sends it to electrodes placed inside the cochlea, directly stimulating the endings of the auditory nerve. The electrical signals conducted by the auditory nerve will be sent to specific areas of the brain where they will be interpreted as sounds and language. //More information// Overall, we can say that the Cochlear Implant is indicated for all people with severe to profound deafness, of the neurosensory type (loss of hair cells in the cochlea) who do not benefit from well-adapted hearing aids.  Adults with severe to profound bilateral sensorineural deafness (current data show the advantage of Cochlear Implants in the auditory rehabilitation of individuals with unilateral deafness).  Children with severe to profound bilateral sensorineural deafness with little benefit in speech perception and language acquisition with the use of correctly fitted hearing aids.  The entire process begins with the first consultation, where the cause of deafness is investigated, its impact on language and integration into the social, school or professional environment, and the presence of other diseases that may prevent the placement of a Cochlear Implant is investigated. Hearing tests will quantify the degree of deafness, characterize the type of deafness and evaluate the effectiveness of hearing aids in perceiving sounds and understanding words. In potential candidates for Cochlear Implants, radiological examinations (""CT scan"" and ""MRI"") will be used to prove the existence of an intact auditory nerve and the presence of an implantable cochlea, essential requirements for the placement of a Cochlear Implant. In children, it is important to assess the degree of existing verbal language and the presence of diseases that may compromise auditory rehabilitation and language acquisition.  Cochlear implant surgery requires general anesthesia and a hospital stay of one to two days. An incision is made in the skin behind the ear, and about two centimeters of hair in this area must be cut. This single scar will be completely hidden by the hair in a short time. The mastoid (bony region behind the ear) is opened, creating a path towards the eardrum, exposing the first spiral of the cochlea. Through a small hole, the electrode cable is introduced into the cochlea where they will stimulate the endings of the auditory nerve. Finally, the receiver is placed under the skin behind the incision area. The entire surgery is performed with monitoring of the Facial Nerve (given its proximity to the path of the electrode cable) and lasts approximately 2-3 hours, being considered a safe surgery with a quick recovery. Surgery is just the first part of the Cochlear Implant rehabilitation process.  A few weeks after surgery, the audiologist will activate the Cochlear Implant by connecting the external component to the internal component. During this initial activation phase, you will be able to hear sounds, but only after a few programming sessions will you be able to understand words. Over time, the brain adapts better to the type of electrical stimulus provided by the Cochlear Implant, improving the quality of auditory perception.  In children with severe to profound deafness, initially - before language acquisition - a whole process of hearing rehabilitation and language acquisition begins, which will require dedication over many years on the part of the child and their family, audiologists, speech therapists and even their teachers. The motivation of all these elements is a determining factor in the success of the Cochlear Implant.  In adults with language, the entire activation and programming process is easier and faster.  The Cochlear Implant is currently the best method of rehabilitation for severe to profound deafness for those who do not benefit from the use of hearing aids. It ensures a great improvement in the perception of sounds and the possibility of understanding human speech.  In adults, the best results are observed when: Severe/profound deafness is not long-lasting (early intervention);/ There is language;/ There are no associated diseases that limit the potential for interpreting stimuli at the brain level;/ The adult is motivated to collaborate throughout the programming process;/  In children, the best results are observed when: Intervention is early. The earlier the brain receives auditory stimuli, the better and faster the development of auditory pathways in the brain. Although implantation at one year of age is considered desirable, it is possible, and we have performed surgery earlier;/ Bilateral stimulation;/ Motivation of the child and his/her family in the slow process of programming, rehabilitation and speech acquisition;/ Absence of associated diseases that hinder the brain's hearing process (perceiving requires more than hearing);/  About us;/ Events;/ Clients and Companions;/ News;/ CUF Academic Center;/ Partnerships;/ Contacts;/ Frequently Asked Questions;/ Join us;/ Virtual Visit;/ English version;/ My CUF;/ Access Solutions and Health Plans;/ Facebook;/ Facebook Instagram;/ Instagram LinkedInCreated with Sketch.;/ LinkedIn Youtube;/ Youtube award4;/ award4 certification1;/ certification1 certification2;/ certification2 certification3;/ certification3 Complaints and compliments;/ Complaints and compliments Privacy and Cookies Policy;/ Terms and Conditions;/ Whistleblower Channel;/ © CUF 2024 All rights reserved Start;/ Health A-Z: Diseases, Symptoms and Treatments;/"
Osteo-integrated implants,"//What are they?// Although hearing depends essentially on sound waves that, propagating through the air, reach our ear (air conduction), an important part of auditory perception results from the vibration produced by sound in the bones of the skull (bone conduction): when we speak, we hear our voice whether through the air or through the bone. This phenomenon explains the fact that most people do not recognize their own voice when it is recorded, given that the recorder only records the airway component. Osteo-Integrated Implants stimulate the inner ear through vibrations transmitted through the skull to the inner ear (bone conduction).  They are made up of two components: External Component;/ It captures external sound and processes it, transforming it into vibration.  Implantable Component;/ A small titanium ""screw"" is surgically fixed to the skull, slightly above and behind the ear. The physical characteristics of titanium and the surgical technique will allow for a close ""fusion"" between the implant and the bone (osteointegration). The vibration produced by the external component will be transmitted by the implant to the skull, propagating and stimulating the inner ear. //More information// Since the stimulation is carried out by vibration transmitted by the skull directly to the inner ear, this hearing implant is indicated in cases of deafness due to problems in the conduction of sound in the ear canal and/or in the transmission of vibration from the eardrum to the cochlea (transmission deafness due to pathology of the outer ear and middle ear) that cannot be satisfactorily resolved by hearing aids. They also have the advantage of being able to be applied to individuals with permanent (purging) infections who are unable to use hearing aids.  Adults and children with: Malformations of the outer ear or middle ear;/ Closure of the external auditory canal (due to exostoses or skin lesions);/ Sequelae of chronic otitis - with perforation of the eardrum or destruction of the ossicles;/ After cholesteatoma surgery;/ Mixed deafness (poor transmission of sound by the tympanic-ossicular system and with some loss of cochlear sensitivity);/ Profound unilateral sensorineural deafnessThe existence of only one functioning ear makes it difficult to perceive the spatial origin of sounds and affects the discrimination of speech perception in noisy environments (for example in a classroom). Placing an osteointegrated implant on the side of the deaf ear allows the sound that reaches that side to be transmitted by bone vibration to the functioning inner ear on the opposite side, thus restoring the sensation of stereophony and improving speech understanding.;/ Having only one functioning ear makes it difficult to perceive the spatial origin of sounds and affects speech perception discrimination in noisy environments (e.g. in a classroom). Placing an osteo-integrated implant on the side of the deaf ear allows the sound that reaches that side to be transmitted by bone vibration to the functioning inner ear on the opposite side, thus restoring the sensation of stereophony and improving speech understanding.;/ Osteointegrated implant surgery is usually performed under general anesthesia (but may be performed under local anesthesia if necessary), on an outpatient basis or with a one-day hospital stay. Since there is no intervention on the structures of the outer ear or middle ear, there is no risk of worsening pre-existing hearing. It is a surgery that lasts about an hour, is considered very safe, and the post-operative period is painless, allowing the patient to quickly resume their activities.  The osteointegration process between the titanium implant and the bone requires around four weeks, after which it is possible to connect the external component and begin its activation and programming.  In cases where direct fitting models between the external component and the titanium implant (percutaneous) have been chosen, it is only necessary to take ""hygiene"" care of the skin around the titanium implant. Fitting and removing the external component is very easy and safe, even for children. This osteo-integrated implant allows the practice of most activities and sports, although the external component must be removed when sleeping, bathing or swimming.

Cervico-isthmic incompetence,"//What is it?// Cervico-isthmic incompetence (cervical insufficiency) is defined as recurrent painless cervical dilation, that is, the cervix begins to shorten and open very early during a pregnancy, which can lead to losses in the second trimester or the inability of the cervix to maintain the pregnancy in the absence of uterine contractions. //Symptoms// In most cases, the pregnant woman is asymptomatic, but one of the following symptoms may appear: Pelvic pressure;/ Cramps;/ Back pain;/ Increased vaginal discharge;/ //Causes// The likely cause will be structural weakening of the cervix, which may be a consequence of: Previous cervical or uterine surgery (e.g., dilation and curettage, hysteroscopy);/ Congenital anomaly;/ Biochemical changes in the cervix that cause premature cervical shortening and dilation. These conditions can be caused, among others, by inflammation/infection of the membranes and hemorrhage in the decidua (uterine mucosa where the placenta is implanted) or in the placenta.;/ //Diagnosis// Diagnosis is based on a history of previous pregnancy loss in the second trimester, which can present in several ways: Classic history of two or more consecutive second-trimester pregnancy losses or extremely preterm births (<28 weeks), associated with no or minimally mild symptoms;/ Painless cervical dilation and prominent fetal membranes in the second trimester of pregnancy;/ Preterm premature rupture of membranes;/ Rapid and spontaneous labor of a pre-viable fetus;/ Rare or absent uterine contractions;/  It can also occur in situations without a history of previous fetal loss, and in these cases, the diagnosis is based on a combination of: Clinical presentation and physical examination - advanced, painless cervical dilation in the second trimester;/ Ultrasound findings - although the diagnosis is mostly clinical, ultrasound assessment of cervical length may be useful;/ //Treatment// Cervical cerclage is a surgical procedure in which a stitch is placed in the cervix. It is the basis of treatment and should be considered in the following situations: History of second trimester pregnancy loss with painless cervical dilation;/ Previous placement of Cerclage for cervical incompetence;/ History of extremely rapid and spontaneous preterm labor and a short cervix in the early second trimester;/ Painless cervical dilation on physical examination in the second trimester;/  Although cervical cerclage is the focus of treatment, several studies support the use of progesterone supplementation in women at risk of preterm birth. Lifestyle changes such as activity restriction and bed rest have not been shown to be effective. //Prevention// It is not possible to prevent the development of cervico-isthmic incompetence. However, early diagnosis and treatment are essential in preventing complications from this situation. Yes, they can, but not always. There are several types of uterine fibroids and not all of them influence a woman's ability to get pregnant. The period after the baby is born is full of doubts and worries.

Anal incontinence,"//What is it?// Anal incontinence consists of the involuntary loss of feces and/or gas through the anus. It can result from traumatic injury to the anal sphincter apparatus (obstetric or perineal trauma, local complication of anorectal surgical interventions) or from neuromuscular functional disturbance of the anal sphincter due to chronic diseases (diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, etc.) or neoplasms. This pathology generally causes a change in the patient's emotional, social and psychological balance, which often hides the symptoms, delaying their diagnosis. //Diagnosis// Assessment in the prosthetic examination can provide information about the tone of the anal sphincter and the existence of local pathology. It is often necessary to carry out additional tests: endo-anal ultrasound (which evaluates the structure of the anal sphincter system) and ano-rectal manometry (which studies changes in the muscular function of the rectum and anal canal). //Treatment// If the symptoms are mild, medical treatment with control of stool consistency through dietary care and medication may be effective. In some cases, re-education of the anal sphinter using biofeedback techniques can improve quality of life. If these measures fail, and in cases of serious injury to the anal sphincter, it may be necessary to consider surgical options.

Urinary incontinence,"//What is it?// Urinary incontinence, also known as urinary leakage, is defined as the involuntary loss of urine. These losses are often associated with weakening of the pelvic floor muscles and/or uncontrolled bladder overactivity, depending on the cause and age group. The lower urinary tract is made up of the bladder (organ that stores urine) and the urethra (channel through which urine exits), which has a muscular sphincter. The ability to store and eliminate urine requires a complex series of interrelated mechanisms involving the brain, bladder, urethra, and pelvic floor muscles and nerves. As urine is produced and stored in the bladder, the bladder muscles (detrusor muscles) relax and stretch to accommodate it. When your bladder fills up to a certain limit (which varies from person to person), you feel the urge to urinate. When the time is appropriate for urination, the brain signals the detrusor muscle to contract and the urethral sphincter to relax, allowing urine to be eliminated. Normally the bladder needs to empty four to eight times a day and one to two times at night. The urethra and bladder are supported by the pelvic floor muscles (a group of muscles that support the urethra and pelvic organs), which contract during physical exertion to help prevent urine leakage. It is estimated that urinary incontinence problems affect around 200 million people worldwide, with women being the population most affected by this problem, although there are also several men affected. In Portugal, it is estimated that there are around 600,000 incontinent people: three in ten women and one in ten men are affected by urinary incontinence. There are several types of urinary incontinence: Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI) - physical exertion (exercise, coughing or sneezing) puts pressure on the bladder, the urethra is unable to remain closed and urine leaks. In this case the abnormality or weakness is in the urethra or pelvic floor.;/ Urgency Urinary Incontinence (UUI) - UUI is caused by anomalous and involuntary contractions of the bladder (usually the bladder muscle does not contract until we are in the bathroom, ready to urinate). These anomalous contractions, which occur without warning, push urine up the urethra and can cause leakage.;/ Mixed Urinary Incontinence (MUI) - coexistence of SUI and UUI symptoms. An attempt should be made to determine which symptoms predominate and bother the patient the most. Treatment involves a therapeutic approach to both forms of incontinence.;/ Reflux Urinary Incontinence - involuntary loss of urine due to overdistension of a hypotonic bladder.;/ Functional Urinary Incontinence - this type of incontinence occurs when the patient, after recognizing the need to urinate, is unable to reach the bathroom in time, due to limited mobility or a neurological disease that prevents them from planning this action in a structured way.;/ //Symptoms// In women, the bladder and its outlet are controlled by a group of muscles called the pelvic floor muscles, which help to keep the bladder closed. Urinary incontinence in women can occur if these muscles become weak and lose flexibility. Activities as simple as sneezing can cause urine leakage. In the case of men, the most common urinary incontinence is manifested by continuous dripping. The most common cause is an increase in the size of the prostate that prevents the passage of urine during urination. As a result, the bladder never empties completely. In the post-prostate surgery phase, the bladder may be weakened, however, it usually recovers after a few months. Obesity can also cause involuntary urine leakage, as it increases pressure on the pelvic and abdominal muscles. In the case of children, there is no consensus on the definition, prevalence and severity of urinary incontinence. When the development of the nervous system is normal, children stop being incontinent around the age of three. “Wetting the bed” does not necessarily mean a health problem. It is estimated that approximately 5% of five-year-old children wet the bed, with boys being more frequent. Its causes are recurrent urinary infections or malformations of the urogenital tract. Except for cases such as urinary incontinence of neurological etiology, which requires a specific approach, many of its manifestations reverse spontaneously. //Causes// Its most frequent causes are recurrent urinary infections or malformations of the urogenital tract. Except for urinary incontinence of neurological etiology, which requires a specific approach, many resolve spontaneously. //Diagnosis// Diagnosis includes: Bladder diary: the person records how much they drink, when they urinate, the amount of urine produced, and the number of episodes of incontinence.;/ Physical examination: gynecological examination and assessment of the tone of the pelvic floor muscles. In men, digital examination of the prostate through the rectum may be important to rule out enlargement of the gland.;/ Blood and urine laboratory studies: assessment of kidney function and urinary infection screening;/ Uroflowmetry with measurement of post-void residue: non-invasive test that allows the assessment of the amount of urine remaining in the bladder after urination.;/ Pelvic ultrasound: assesses the presence of pelvic changes.;/ Stress test: The patient applies sudden abdominal pressure while the doctor checks for urine leakage.;/ Urodynamic test: Determines how much pressure the bladder and urinary sphincter muscle can withstand.;/ Cystogram: An X-ray provides a picture of the bladder.;/ Cystoscopy: A thin tube with a lens is inserted into the urethra allowing direct visualization of the lower urinary tract.;/ //Treatment// There are several forms of treatment. In addition to pharmacological and surgical treatment, pelvic reeducation can also play an important role. Through various techniques, it allows effective strengthening of the perineal muscles, in addition to being non-invasive and having no side effects. In some cases, surgical treatment may be necessary. //Prevention// To avoid urinary incontinence it is important to: Drink adequate amounts of fluids. Dehydration increases bladder irritation and makes incontinence easier.;/ Follow a healthy diet;/ Control your weight;/ Change bathroom usage habits. Go whenever you need. Avoid frequent and prolonged retention as it can damage the bladder muscles and facilitate urinary infection. Empty your bladder completely;/ Avoid constipation. Constipation can worsen urinary incontinence.;/ Exercising the pelvic floor muscles (Kegel exercises);/ Better Health Medical News Today Exercising your pelvic floor muscles is one way to treat incontinence.

Infecao por helicobacter pylori,"//What is it?// Helicobacter pylori (or, simply put, Hp) is a bacteria that infects and lives in the stomach. It is considered one of the most frequent infections worldwide and, in Portugal, it is estimated that around 60 to 70% of the population is infected. In the vast majority of cases, the infection is acquired in childhood, orally, through ingestion of contaminated food or water and through contact between individuals. It is a chronic infection, lasting for years, decades or even a lifetime, making it very difficult to spontaneously eliminate the bacteria. //Symptoms// The majority of individuals infected with Helicobacter Pylori remain symptom-free over time. However, in some people, the bacteria is the cause of digestive tract complaints. Hp is the cause of duodenal ulcers, gastric ulcers and certain chronic gastritis. In a very small percentage of infected people, the bacteria is associated with the appearance of some types of tumors, such as lymphoma or adenocarcinoma. //Diagnosis// The doctor orders a diagnostic test for the bacteria Helicobacter Pylori if he thinks the patient's current symptoms can be attributed to it or if the results of the upper endoscopy suggest its presence. Individuals who have had tumors or ulcers (gastric or duodenal) in the past and those with first-degree relatives with stomach tumors should also undergo a diagnostic test, even if they currently have no complaints. There are several reliable methods for diagnosing the bacteria. The doctor will advise the one that best suits a particular individual. A blood test (antibodies), a breath test (which looks for the presence of a substance in the breath after drinking a certain liquid), a gastric biopsy test or a microscopic analysis, also of a gastric biopsy, may be performed. In very specific cases, it may be necessary to cultivate the bacteria in a laboratory. //Treatment// As a general rule, if the bacteria has been diagnosed, it should be eradicated. However, there are clinical circumstances in which treatment may not be a priority. Eliminating Hp is difficult to achieve and, to achieve this, it is necessary to combine several medications, including several antibiotics. There are several different combinations of medications used to eradicate Hp, with the aim of achieving very high cure rates (80-90%). The choice of medication depends on several factors, so the doctor will decide which is the best option in each case. It is important to highlight that one of the main conditions for any treatment to be successful is the patient's rigor and discipline in complying with the medication doses and schedules. After treatment, it must always be confirmed that the bacteria has been effectively eradicated. For this, some of the methods described for diagnosing the infection are used. If Hp still persists, new treatment with different medications is recommended. If the bacteria has been eliminated, there is no need to repeat any type of test in the future. The reinfection rate - the probability of acquiring the infection again within a year - is low (2 to 3%). There is no need for any type of periodic ""surveillance"" for infection. //Prevention// There is no specific recommendation to prevent children or adults from becoming infected with Hp. There is still no effective vaccine. It is essential, however, from the point of view of general health and disease prevention, to cultivate good habits of body hygiene (for example, washing your hands after using the bathroom and before eating) and food hygiene (washing your hands thoroughly). food and drink drinking water) Load more;/ RSV infection can progress to bronchiolitis or pneumonia.

Respiratory infection,"//What is it?// It occurs when a part of the respiratory system is infected by a microorganism that can be a virus, bacteria, fungus or parasite. Its manifestations depend on the affected area. In fact, all parts of the respiratory system can suffer from an infection: nose (rhinitis); perinasal sinuses (sinusitis); pharynx (pharyngitis); larynx (laryngitis); bronchi (bronchitis, bronchiectasis); lung (pneumonia) and pleura (pleuritis). Although most are benign, they are very common and can be fatal. For example, pneumonia is the third cause of human mortality and tuberculosis ranks seventh. On a global scale, respiratory infections are responsible for around four million deaths every year. They can have a varied impact, depending on their frequency and severity. The most important are pneumonia, infectious exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, tuberculosis and influenza. In Portugal, it is estimated that more than 800 thousand cases of respiratory infections occur annually, 150 thousand of which are pneumonia. In 2008, there were more than 50 thousand hospitalizations for pneumonia, with more than four thousand people dying from this disease, making it the third cause of mortality in the country. //Symptoms// Symptoms will depend on the location of the infection and its severity. The most common complaints are nasal congestion and discharge, cough, sore throat and body aches, fatigue and fever. In general, symptoms begin one to three days after exposure to the agent. They may be associated with conjunctivitis in the case of infections caused by certain viruses, and with headache or facial pain in the case of sinusitis. In more advanced cases, difficulty breathing, dizziness, and changes in consciousness may occur. These symptoms generally reflect a difficulty in getting oxygen to the lungs and require urgent evaluation. //Causes// Being in direct contact with the external environment, the respiratory system is permanently exposed to infectious agents that can reach it by inhalation (through the air we breathe), circulatory route (through the circulation) or by aspiration of infected material from the mouth and /or upper airways. Risk factors include reduced defenses, as occurs in children, the elderly or patients with immunodeficiency (HIV or cancer). Among the various microorganisms that can cause respiratory infections, viruses are the most common. Among bacteria, the most frequent are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. //Diagnosis// Medical examination is essential in the evaluation of respiratory infection. In many cases, no additional tests are necessary and treatment can be determined promptly. In more serious cases, an X-ray or CT scan may be requested. Other tests that may be useful are respiratory function tests and laboratory studies of sputum or other samples to try to identify the agent responsible for the infection. //Treatment// Treatment depends on the location, risk factors and the agent responsible. For infections caused by viruses, there are no specific medications and treatment is based on relieving symptoms. Painkillers, nasal decongestants or cough medicines may be useful. In the case of bacteria, there are several classes of antibiotics that should always be selected by a doctor. It is very important, when faced with a respiratory infection, not to start an antibiotic right away because, in many cases, it is not useful and the risk of side effects and resistance to future treatments is unnecessarily increased. //Prevention// Although the respiratory system has defense mechanisms against various microorganisms, they are not always sufficient. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle, with a balanced diet, exercising, not smoking, among other aspects, is essential for prevention. Tobacco smoke reduces the activity of cells that destroy bacteria that enter the respiratory tract and, as such, is a major risk factor for respiratory infections. Poor air quality encourages infections and is a vehicle for the transmission of microorganisms. It is therefore very important to avoid poorly ventilated, overcrowded and polluted places, places with excessively dry air, places that are very cold and very humid, or places that are subject to sudden changes in temperature, as well as harsh weather conditions (cold, rain, humidity and wind). Currently there are medicines that belong to the vaccine family and that help increase resistance to respiratory infections. These medications have the ability to stimulate the activity of key cells and protect the respiratory system from infections. They are normally administered orally.

Urinary infection,"//What is it?// It corresponds to the presence of bacteria in any part of the urinary system (kidneys, ureters and bladder). Depending on the location, the infection is given different names. In the case of the kidney, it is called pyelonephritis, in the case of the bladder, cystitis and in the case of the urethra, it is called urethritis. They are one of the most common infections. Generally speaking, microorganisms reach the urinary system from the outside, through the urethra or, more rarely, from the blood and settle in the kidneys. Bacteria that reach the urinary tract are usually quickly removed before causing infection by the elimination of urine itself and the body's defenses. When this does not happen, the symptoms of infection become evident. They are more common in women, given the greater proximity of the female urethra to the anus and vagina and given the fact that it is a much shorter urethra than the male urethra, which allows microorganisms to more easily reach the bladder. Children, particularly males up to one year of age, also have a high prevalence of kidney infection, due to the presence of vesicourethral reflux. //Symptoms// The main symptoms caused by urinary tract infections are: Burning or pain when urinating;/ Occurrence of frequent and small amounts of urination;/ Urgent and frequent urge to urinate;/ Urine with a foul smell;/ Changes in its color;/ Difficulty starting urination;/ Elimination of blood in the urine;/ Pain in the lower abdomen;/ Fever;/ Chills;/ Lower back pain;/ Nausea;/ Vomiting;/ Most cases are not very serious. The exceptions are those involving the kidneys, which require special care. Kidney damage resulting from a urinary tract infection can cause renal scarring, high blood pressure or even renal failure. //Causes// The most common causes of urinary tract infections are: Pregnancy;/ Diabetes;/ Urinary obstruction;/ Inadequate hygiene habits;/ Insertion of foreign objects;/ Menstrual period;/ Neurological diseases;/ Sexually transmitted diseases;/ The presence of urinary tract abnormalities also tends to increase your risk. The same goes for institutionalized patients or those undergoing catheterization. The microorganisms responsible vary depending on where the infection is acquired. When it occurs in a non-hospitalized patient, the most common agent is Escherichia coli (around 80% of cases) and some staphylococci. In hospitalized or institutionalized patients, these bacteria may also be responsible, but others appear that are more aggressive and, therefore, require more complex treatment. These patients also experience urinary infections caused by fungi. //Diagnosis// Often, when a woman experiences a first episode of urinary tract infection, treatment is started immediately without resorting to a laboratory diagnosis. In cases of repeated infections, in children or hospitalized patients, it is important to assess which microorganism is responsible and seek to identify which situations may be the basis of the infection. Therefore, in addition to medical assessment, laboratory diagnosis is important as it allows the evaluation of the sample, its physical and chemical composition, the presence of microorganisms and, if they are present, their susceptibility to different antibiotics. This aspect is important in order to select the most appropriate antibiotic for each case. For this diagnosis to be effective, it is essential that urine collection is carried out according to very strict rules, which are different for men, women, children and catheterized patients. In the case of recurrent urinary infections, more in-depth evaluations may be necessary using ultrasound, tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, among other diagnostic techniques. //Treatment// In addition to treatment with the most appropriate antibiotic, it is important to take some extra precautions: Increase fluid intake;/ Take general care of intimate hygiene;/ Correct any anatomical changes that may be responsible for infections;/ Do not delay urinating (this resistance increases the risk of infection because it allows urine to remain inside the bladder for longer);/ Treatment of urinary tract infections with antibiotics should only be started after the bacteria have been identified by the laboratory. However, in daily clinical practice, the procedure is different and, almost always, the patient begins treatment with an antibiotic even without knowing the results of the tests. The most frequently used are fluoroquinolones. In the case of urinary tract infection during pregnancy, the choice of antibiotic must be carefully considered, as some are contraindicated during pregnancy. In men, they are often associated with kidney stones or an enlarged prostate, which means that both investigation and treatment must be oriented differently. //Prevention// There are several measures that can reduce the risk of urinary tract infections: Drink plenty of water and urinate frequently;/ Avoid liquids such as alcohol and caffeine which can irritate the bladder;/ Urinating immediately after sexual intercourse;/ Wipe from front to back after urinating and defecating to avoid contamination from the rectum.;/ Keep the genital area clean;/ Prefer showers to baths;/ Avoid using oils;/ Sanitary pads or menstrual cups are preferable to tampons;/ Avoid using diaphragms or spermicides as contraceptive methods;/ Avoid using scented products in the genital area;/ Wear cotton underwear and loose clothing to keep the area around the urethra dry.;/ Francisco José Barbas Rodrigues et al., Etiology and bacterial sensitivity in urinary tract infections, Rev Port Saúde Pública. 2011;29(2): 123-131 Medical News Today National Kidney and Urologic Diseases Information Clearinghouse(NKUDIC),A service of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases(NIDDK),National Institutes of Health(NIH); Maio 2012 The British Association of Urological Surgeons University of Maryland Medical Center, 2011 Load more;/ There are infections that can be caused by heat, chlorine and wet swimsuits.

Urinary tract infection does not drink,"//What is it?// Urinary tract infections (UI) are one of the most common infections in children, right after those of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract. From 3 months onwards, it is more common in girls and symptoms depend on the region of the urinary tract infected, age, severity and possible underlying urinary anomalies. The main causes of infection are gastrointestinal bacteria, the vast majority of which are Escherichia coli, which invade the urinary tract via the ascending route. //Symptoms// If the infection is located in the kidney (pyelonephritis) most children will have a high fever and abdominal pain. If the child is very young (newborn or latent) he or she may not have a fever but may refuse to eat, not gain weight, vomit or simply not be well. In infections localized to the bladder (cystitis) and especially in older children, the main symptom is pain when urinating, interrupted stream (peeing in “dribbles”), increased frequency of urination and sometimes urinary incontinence. Infected urine can be foul-smelling, thicker, cloudy and even contain blood. Not all girls with these symptoms have a urinary tract infection, and it could be an episode of vulvovaginitis. //Diagnosis// To confirm the diagnosis, it is necessary to obtain a urine sample which, in addition to identifying the microorganism, allows us to know its sensitivity to antibiotics. //Treatment// Infections must be treated with antibiotics to eliminate symptoms, eradicate bacteria from the urinary tract and prevent possible sequelae (kidney scarring). In younger febrile children, those with more severe illness, those who vomit or those with kidney or urinary tract anomalies, hospitalization may be warranted to administer antibiotics intravenously until the infection is resolved. UI may be the first telltale sign of a urinary tract abnormality. Therefore, in some cases (e.g. young children with fever, boys, changes in the urinary tract detected on prenatal ultrasound, children with recurrent urinary infections), it is very important that a study of the urinary tract is carried out. It is accepted that in a small number of children, kidney infection can leave permanent kidney damage (kidney scar). If these lesions are extensive, multiple and bilateral, they can later lead to high blood pressure and/or kidney failure. //Prevention// Prevention of urinary incontinence involves drinking enough water, emptying the bladder regularly and frequently, and cleaning the perineum properly. Constipation and intestinal parasites should also be treated. In some circumstances, preventive antibiotics may be necessary for a period that varies depending on the child's age, underlying anomalies and the risk of reinfection.

Scalp infections,"//Infections caused by Bacteria// Among bacteria, the most common disease is impetigo. It is a superficial skin infection caused by streptococcus or staphylococcus. Yellowish or reddish crusts are observed in more or less extensive areas. When the patient moves, he spreads the infection. It may not cause any complaints or may cause burning or itching. It often appears superimposed on another pre-existing disease on the scalp. It is treated with vigorous washing with soap and water, topical antibiotic ointment to break down the crusts and possibly oral antibiotics (usually erythromycin or flucloxacillin). Much less common are deeper skin infections, such as ectima, which causes ulcerations covered by crusts, and erysipelas/cellulitis, which causes large areas of redness and swelling, usually in patients with fever and general malaise. Treatment is with oral antibiotics, although in more severe cases hospitalization and intravenous medication may be necessary. //Infections caused by Viruses// Among the viruses, the most common to affect the scalp are the herpes virus and varicella-zooster. Although the herpes virus most often affects the face, it can also affect the scalp. The patient complains of burning and redness and grouped micro-vesicles are observed. Chickenpox, as is common knowledge, often affects the scalp, usually in the form of micro-vesicles. The same virus (varicella-zoster) in those who have had chickenpox causes the so-called “shingles”, which frequently affects the scalp. The pain and burning are more intense than in the case of herpes simplex and the affected area extends along the dermatome (skin with the same embryonic origin and with common innervation). These infections are treated with oral antivirals (acyclovir, valacyclovir), relieving pain/burning and preventing secondary infection. In children, the very common molluscum contagiosum virus can cause centrally depressed lumps that are easily removed by the doctor. //Fungal Infections// Scalp ringworm is a superficial fungal infection of the skin. It is much more common in children. The most frequent agents vary by geography. In Portugal and most developed countries, the most common agents are of the genus Tricophyton and Microsporum. There may be itching, which is the most common complaint, but is not mandatory. Upon observation, the most common thing is that there is simply peeling in a localized area of ​​the skin, and there may or may not be redness that becomes more evident on the periphery of the lesion. The lesions grow centrifugally.  Rarely, there may be lumps with actual pus lakes or large yellowish plaques. The doctor must collect material to be able to identify the agent.  The most useful antifungal medicine is griseofluvin (currently not available in Portugal), so we often use terbinafine, itraconazole and fluconazole.

Salmonella infections,"//What is it?// It is almost always a self-limiting disease, in the form of acute gastroenteritis. More rarely, it can be associated with generalized infection, arthritis, meningitis or pneumonia, among others. Salmonella is a bacteria responsible for infections in humans. There are two species which, in turn, are divided into subgroups. Knowledge of these divisions is important in the case of epidemics to be able to identify the source of infection and also to better study the resistance to antibiotics that these bacteria may present. Salmonella gastroenteritis represents a global public health problem, with its real incidence being much higher than the number of declared cases. In the United States, it is estimated that there are 1.4 million incidents per year, with only 10% being declared. These infections are more common in the summer months. In Portugal, between 2004 and 2008, 456 episodes were reported annually, 82% of which were in children under 15 years of age. Although a relationship is recognized between hygiene and sanitary conditions, the availability of drinking water and the way food is stored and prepared, in recent decades there has been an increase in its incidence in industrialized countries, a fact that can be justified by globalization and the changing eating habits. //Symptoms// In most cases, it manifests as diarrhea, abdominal pain and fever that develop 12 to 72 hours after infection. The disease lasts between four and seven days and most people recover without needing any treatment. In some cases, the infection can be serious and require hospitalization. This happens when it spreads from the intestines to the bloodstream and from there to other parts of the body. This condition requires urgent treatment with antibiotics. The most serious forms occur in the elderly, children and people with weakened immune systems. Most recover spontaneously, but some patients develop joint complaints, eye irritation and burning sensation when urinating. This condition is called reactive arthritis and can last months or years, leading to chronic arthritis that is difficult to treat. This situation can arise regardless of the use of antibiotics to treat gastroenteritis. //Causes// These bacteria inhabit the digestive tract of humans and other animals, such as some birds. In general, the infection is transmitted by eating food contaminated with animal feces, which, however, has a normal appearance. The most common are meat, milk, eggs and poultry, although contamination can also occur from vegetables. Correct food preparation allows the destruction of this type of bacteria. However, contagion can occur through the hands of those who handle or make them. Since Salmonella can be present in the feces of some domestic animals or pets, this is another possible source, especially if people do not wash their hands after coming into contact with them. Some reptiles, such as turtles and snakes, can also harbor this bacteria, so hand washing is essential, even if they are healthy. //Diagnosis// There are many diseases that can manifest with diarrhea, fever and abdominal pain. For this reason, diagnosis requires a laboratory study, using stool samples, to identify Salmonella and its subtype. //Treatment// Salmonella gastroenteritis rarely requires treatment, other than adequate hydration, and improves after five to seven days. If the diarrhea is very intense, it may be necessary to resort to intravenous hydration in a hospital environment. The use of antibiotics is only justified in cases of severe diarrhea, high fever, passage of the infection into the bloodstream, in hospitalized patients or in those at greater risk of complications, such as children, patients over 65 years of age and those with reduced defenses. //Prevention// It is important to avoid consuming undercooked foods, undercooked eggs and unpasteurized milk. All must be kept in good refrigeration conditions. Hands must be washed before preparing them, as well as the surfaces and utensils that will be used.  Food must still be cooled before being transported from one location to another. Hands should always be washed after contact with animals, even if they do not show any signs of illness.

Infertility,"//What is it?// Several steps are necessary for pregnancy to occur: the formation and release of an egg from the ovaries; its arrival through the fallopian tubes to the uterus; its union with the male sperm; and the attachment of the fertilized egg to the wall of the uterus (implantation). If problems occur in any of these steps, infertility may occur. Infertility is not exclusively a female problem. As a rule, one third of the causes are female, another third are male and the remaining cases result from a combination of problems in both partners. //Symptoms// Although the World Health Organization defines infertility as “the absence of pregnancy after two years of regular sexual intercourse and without the use of contraception”, it is considered a case of infertility when a pregnancy is not achieved after one year of trying. For women over the age of 35, this limit is six months. Infertility is also referred to as women who, although they are able to get pregnant, are unable to carry the pregnancy to term. //Causes// In about 10% of cases, the cause of infertility cannot be identified. However, there are numerous causes of infertility, both male and female. Male: Varicocele (dilation of the veins in the testicles, increasing the temperature, which affects the number and shape of sperm); changes in the ability of sperm to move; torsion or trauma to the testicle; consumption of alcohol, drugs or tobacco reduces the number of healthy sperm; kidney disease, hormonal changes, mumps, contact with pesticides, medications, exposure to radiation or chemotherapy. All of these factors can affect sperm production, and age itself is associated with a reduction in the number and quality of these cells. Heat is important because it interferes with sperm production. Therefore, professions such as cooks or drivers present a greater risk.;/  Females: most cases result from ovulation problems. One of the signs of changes in ovulation is the occurrence of irregular periods. One of the most common causes is polycystic ovary syndrome, which causes a hormonal imbalance that interferes with ovulation. Another common cause is primary ovarian insufficiency, which occurs when the ovaries stop functioning normally before the age of 40. There are other possible causes: pelvic inflammatory disease, endometriosis, surgery, fibroids, uterine polyps, thyroid disease, history of voluntary termination of pregnancy or repeated miscarriages. As for men, age, smoking, alcohol consumption and stress are factors to consider. Poor nutrition, excessive physical activity, sexually transmitted diseases, and being overweight or underweight also interfere with fertility. Age is important because as age increases, the ovaries become less capable of releasing eggs, their number is smaller, they are not as healthy and the risk of other health problems increases.;/ //Diagnosis// In the initial assessment, it is important to know the couple's sexual habits and recommendations can be made that prove relevant. Diagnosis tends to be time-consuming and expensive and, as noted, even with all testing and counseling, it cannot be guaranteed that pregnancy will occur. The causes of infertility are multiple and may or may not be associated with anomalies in the male or female reproductive system. Therefore, diagnosis must be carried out in stages and include both partners simultaneously. In addition to medical observation, laboratory tests, genetic and hormonal studies and some imaging methods, such as ultrasound or hysterosalpingography, are necessary. In the case of men, one of the most important tests is the spermogram. For women, one of the important steps is to understand whether ovulation occurs every month. //Treatment// Treatment depends on the cause and may involve medication, surgery, artificial insemination or assisted reproduction. It may be necessary to combine different techniques in the same case. In general, the drugs used are hormonal in nature and seek to improve the ovulation process.  Dealing with infertility can be difficult, as there is no way of knowing when the problem will be resolved. As such, the emotional burden associated with it is considerable. It is therefore important for couples to define their own limits. Diagnostic methods and treatments are expensive and do not always achieve the desired results. All alternatives that can reduce the anxiety that infertility tends to bring should be considered. This can be minimised by enlisting the support of healthcare professionals, friends and family and using relaxation techniques, if necessary. //Prevention// Many of the male forms are not preventable. However, not smoking, not consuming excessive alcohol, and avoiding high temperatures are some measures to consider. For women, some measures are essential to prevent infertility: Practicing safe sex is one of the most important measures to avoid sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis and HPV (human papillomavirus). These infections can cause pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility and serious systemic diseases.;/ Avoid environmental toxins.;/ Avoid high levels of mercury in foods such as swordfish and mackerel. Avoid benzene (found in detergents, dyes, rubbers, lubricants, hair products, and paint) because it is an endocrine disruptor that can contribute to infertility. Benzene has been shown to interrupt women's periods and decrease sperm counts in men.;/ Quit smoking: Almost all studies on smoking and fertility show a serious impact, including secondhand smoke.;/ Avoid alcohol and drug use.;/ Reduce caffeine intake.;/ Pay attention to the use of medications.;/ Maintain a weight within normal values;/ Portuguese Infertility Association Attain Fertility Division of Reproductive Health, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion,12 de Fevereiro de 2013 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research Reproductive Health, Infertility, Directorate-General for Health, National Reproductive Health Program, Lisbon 2008 Sexual and reproductive health, World Health Organization Load more;/ Endometriosis has a major impact on a woman's life and diagnosis is often delayed.

Humanity,"//What is it?// It is defined as a subjective experience of inadequate or limited quality sleep, despite the existence of an opportunity and adequate conditions for sleeping, with impairment to social, occupational and other daytime activities. It can also be defined as difficulty falling asleep (initial insomnia), difficulty maintaining it (intermediate insomnia), waking up too early (terminal insomnia) or, although less frequently, a complaint of non-restorative sleep or poor sleep. quality. Regarding duration, it can be acute (lasting less than four weeks) or chronic (lasting more than four weeks) with symptoms occurring at least three nights a week. Sleep fills approximately one third of life and is essential for the individual's physical and mental recovery. Several studies point to a decrease in its average time, of the order of an hour and a half, compared to the beginning of the last century. On the other hand, in European countries the increase in spending on “sleeping medicines” is a reality and is a growing concern. Sleep disorders therefore constitute a public health problem that requires intervention both at an individual level and at a broader level. In Portugal, according to the results obtained in some studies, 28.1% of the population over 18 years old suffers from insomnia symptoms, at least three nights a week (in people over 65 years old, complaints of insomnia reach 50%), with negative repercussions on health and quality of life. It is the most common sleep disorder in adults and is associated with important consequences, such as increased mortality caused by cardiovascular diseases, psychiatric disorders, diabetes, accidents and work absenteeism. Around 69% of patients attending a General Clinic consultation experience insomnia and, despite it affecting millions of people around the world, it continues to be under-diagnosed, which is why many patients do not receive adequate treatment. There are variations in sleep throughout life. which are normal, but insomnia is never normal. Insomnia can be an illness in itself, a symptom of another illness or a consequence of poor sleep and lifestyle hygiene. Therefore, it must be correctly evaluated and treated. //Symptoms// It normally manifests itself: Due to the presence of an altered sleep pattern, characterized by difficulty falling asleep, insufficient sleep duration, waking up too early, frequent or prolonged awakenings and variability in the pattern from night to night;;/ For the quality of sleep, characterized by anxiety or agitation before or during, a feeling of tiredness upon waking and unpleasant sleep experiences, particularly nightmares;;/ Due to daytime consequences, characterized by drowsiness, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, lack of energy, anxiety, depression or irritability, learning and memory problems that affect performance at work and school. On the other hand, it can be the cause of serious accidents, when drowsiness occurs while driving a car or other vehicles.;/ Transient insomnia (lasting from one to several nights) is a common situation with no serious consequences. Persistent or chronic (lasting months/years) may correspond to a disease situation that must be evaluated by the doctor. //Causes// The most common causes of acute insomnia are situational stress (work, interpersonal, financial or other), environmental stress (noise in the room) and death or illness of a close person. Regarding the causes, it can be divided into primary (not caused by a known physical or mental condition) or secondary (caused by another medical or psychiatric illness, medications, among others.). The prevalence of secondary is much higher than that of primary, and appears to be increasing. Mood and anxiety disorders are present in 30% to 50% of patients with insomnia; medical illnesses (most often pain) are found in 10% of patients, substance abuse is found in another 10%, and only 10% appear to result from primary sleep disorders. The psychiatric illnesses that most frequently present with insomnia include major depression and anxiety. Risk factors include increasing age, female gender, presence of other illnesses (medical, psychiatric illness, substance abuse), few social relationships, low socioeconomic status, marital or partner separation, unemployment and working for a living. shifts. Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease can also cause it, as well as pathologies that cause pain, difficulty breathing, thyroid or digestive problems, a stroke or menopause. //Diagnosis// A correct clinical history is essential, with a sleep diary, as well as additional information about your partner to know how he/she sleeps. The objective examination and the request for complementary diagnostic tests should be directed towards the suspicion of a secondary cause of insomnia. //Treatment// Insomnia is a common disorder that can manifest itself as difficulty falling asleep at the beginning of the night, maintaining sleep throughout the night or early awakenings. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, sometimes called CBT-I, is an effective treatment for chronic sleep problems and is recommended as a first line of treatment for insomnia. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia is a structured 5-week program that helps you identify and replace thoughts and behaviors that cause or worsen sleep problems with habits that promote deep sleep. Unlike sleeping pills, CBT-I helps to overcome the underlying causes of sleep problems. How does cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia work? The cognitive component of CBT-I teaches you to recognize and change beliefs that affect your ability to sleep. This type of therapy helps you control or eliminate negative thoughts and worries that inhibit sleep. The behavioral component of CBT-I helps develop good sleep habits and prevent behaviors that impede quality sleep. Depending on each person's needs, the sleep therapist may recommend some of these CBT-I techniques: Stimulus control therapy.;/ Sleep restriction therapy.;/ Hygiene where I am.;/ Check the environment where I am.;/ Relaxation techniques.;/ Thought control techniques.;/ Remain passively awake.;/ Biofeedback.;/ The most effective treatment approach may combine several of these methods. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy vs. Medication Sleeping medications can be an effective short-term treatment – ​​for example, they can provide immediate relief during a time of great stress or sadness. But they are not the best treatment for long-term insomnia. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia is the treatment recommended by the world's medical colleges for long-term sleep problems. Unlike pills, CBT-I treats the causes underlying causes of insomnia rather than just alleviating the symptoms. //Prevention// It is helpful to avoid substances that aggravate them, such as caffeine, tobacco and other stimulants. The effects of these substances last up to eight hours;;/ Some cold or allergy medications can affect sleep;;/ An alcoholic drink before bed makes it easier to fall asleep, but tends to make you feel lighter, with a greater likelihood of waking up during the night;;/ It is also useful to adopt habits that facilitate sleep, such as reading a book, listening to music or taking a hot bath;;/ Physical exercise should be done at least five to six hours before bedtime and very heavy meals should be avoided;;/ The room must have a comfortable environment in terms of temperature, lighting and silence;;/ It's worth trying to create a rhythm, going to sleep and waking up at the same time every day, including weekends.;/ Eleonora Paixão et al., An observation on the prevalence of sleep disorders in mainland Portugal, National Health Observatory, January 2006 Luís Filipe Cavadas et al., Approaching Adult Secondary Insomnia in Primary Health Care, Acta Med Port 2011; 24: 135-144 National Institutes of Health Department of Health and Human Services, Dezembro de 2011 Sleep Health Foundation, 2011 University of Maryland Medical Center, Janeiro de 2012 Have questions about insomnia?

Chronic ankle instability,"//What is it?// The concept of chronic ankle instability is defined by the occurrence of recurrent sprains and the persistence of residual complaints for a prolonged period of time with the maintenance of a subjective sensation of joint failure.  Chronic instability develops after trauma, such as a sprain, although it can have other causes.  This chronic instability condition is characterized by repeated situations of a sensation that the foot is giving way on its outer surface. This sensation can occur while walking or even when standing still.  Chronic instability affects many athletes.  Sports in which athletes frequently perform jumps and receptions while standing on one foot present a high risk of injury to the ankle joint.  Considering that ankle sprains are very common and that this injury progresses to chronic instability in around 30% of cases, the notion of the frequency of this clinical condition is very clear. //Symptoms// The most common symptoms are pain in the outer ankle, difficulty walking, a feeling of instability, swelling, stiffness and repeated sprains.  The pain can be so intense that it makes walking difficult. //Causes// The most common cause of chronic instability is incomplete healing of an ankle sprain.  After a sprain, the tissue connecting the bones is under tension or torn. If treatment or physical therapy is not adequate, the ligaments can become weakened, resulting in instability.  Other possible causes of this condition are nerve injuries with stretching or rupture after a blow, inflammation of a tendon, arthritis, a fracture or the development of a scar after a sprain. //Diagnosis// Diagnosis is based on clinical observation, X-rays or magnetic resonance imaging.  Ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) scans may be helpful.  //Treatment// Treatment depends on the final diagnosis and includes the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroid injections, compression and physical therapy.  Surgery is useful when medical treatment is not effective and may involve removing loose tissue fragments, cleaning the joint surfaces, or repairing ligaments or tendons.  Post-operative rehabilitation can take 6 to 10 weeks. //Prevention// Prevention of chronic instabilities involves maintaining adequate strength, flexibility and balance in the ankle joint.  In the case of sport, it is essential to warm up correctly and define specific training programs for each modality and wear appropriate footwear. These shoes should be replaced when wear on the sole is visible.  In the case of running, very uneven surfaces should be avoided.  Whenever signs of fatigue occur, rest is crucial.  When a sprain occurs, early and appropriate treatment is essential to prevent the persistence of changes that can evolve into chronic instability.

Patellar instability,"//What is it?// The knee is the largest joint in the body and the patella is the bone located in the anterior region, connecting the muscles of the femur and the tibia, the two bones involved in the knee joint. Strengthens and provides stability to the joint, allowing normal flexion and extension of the knee. Patellar instability occurs when the patella slips out of its joint with the knee and causes pain and difficulty in mobilizing the lower limb. //Symptoms// Patellar instability is characterized by pain in the anterior aspect of the knee, resulting from the inability to bear weight in a “semi-squat” position. //Causes// The cause is multifactorial, however instability may depend on the insufficiency of stabilizing structures, such as the patellofemoral ligament and the alignment of the lower limb. //Diagnosis// The clinical examination consists of observing the gait and testing the flexion and extension movements of the knee. Inspection and palpation of the knee joint allows the evaluation of the angulation of the movements as well as the alignment of the bones and the tone of the muscles. The radiological study allows the evaluation of the positioning of the kneecap in the joint and the detection of other causes of pain such as injuries to the muscles, ligaments, cartilage or menisci. //Treatment// The treatment of this pathology can be something very simple, such as alectomy (release of the external wing of the knee) or it may be necessary to perform an osteotomy of the anterior tuberosity of the tibia (distal realignment through a programmed and guided fracture). //Prevention// To prevent patellar instability and keep your knees healthy you should: Wear the right shoes for each activity (running, walking);/ Always warm up before exercising;/ Do exercises to keep your thigh muscles (quadriceps and hamstrings) strong and flexible;/ Increase the intensity or duration of exercise gradually;/ Reduce any movement that causes knee pain;/ Maintain a healthy weight, reducing pressure on these joints;/ OrthoInfo, American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons WebMD Load more;/ About us;/ Events;/ Clients and Companions;/ News;/ CUF Academic Center;/ Partnerships;/ Contacts;/ Frequently Asked Questions;/ Join us;/ Virtual Visit;/ English version;/ My CUF;/ Access Solutions and Health Plans;/ Facebook;/ Facebook Instagram;/ Instagram LinkedInCreated with Sketch.;/ LinkedIn Youtube;/ Youtube award4;/ award4 certification1;/ certification1 certification2;/ certification2 certification3;/ certification3 Complaints and compliments;/ Complaints and compliments Privacy and Cookies Policy;/ Terms and Conditions;/ Whistleblower Channel;/ © CUF 2024 All rights reserved Start;/ Health A-Z: Diseases, Symptoms and Treatments;/"
Wrist instability,"//What is it?// The wrist is a complex structure, composed of bones, ligaments and tendons that together and harmoniously allow movements in different planes. Due to its positioning and range of motion, the wrist is susceptible to constant axial forces and deformation vectors. Wrist stability is defined as its ability to maintain static and dynamic balance between joints under physiological loads and movements. Instability corresponds to the disturbance of this balance, related to bone and/or ligament injuries, resulting in an inability to maintain anatomical and joint relationships and causing a performance deficit, with pain and collapse of the wrist. Acute, repetitive wrist injuries are a leading cause of wrist instability. This instability may also be associated with other diseases such as osteonecrosis, chronic inflammatory diseases (rheumatoid arthritis), some neurological and neoplastic diseases, in addition to specific congenital malformations. Fractures of the radius and scaphoid may also be related to instability. Wrist instability is an often overlooked condition. Adequate interaction between doctors and radiologists is essential to make a correct diagnosis, thus preventing the disease from progressing and preserving patients' quality of life. //Symptoms// Symptoms vary greatly, with pain, loss of strength or a popping sensation when using the hand being common. Sometimes swelling may occur. Limitation of movement occurs in the late stages //Causes// Wrist instability is a continuum of disorders that can result from acute trauma or repeated injuries. A fall can cause multiple ligaments to rupture, and repeated minor trauma can damage individual ligaments. These micro-injuries, if left untreated, can progress to arthritis with pain and disability. Sports that involve twisting movements of the wrist (racquet sports, gymnastics) are often associated with this condition, but any sport where there is a risk of falling can be associated with wrist instability. //Diagnosis// Early diagnosis is essential, however most patients do not seek medical attention immediately because the initial injury tends to be undervalued. Medical observation is very important, and the various bones and ligaments must be palpated and examined. There are some specific maneuvers that contribute to this diagnosis. The diagnosis of wrist instability is a challenge for clinicians and radiologists and must be made based on clinical data and imaging studies. In advanced stages, the diagnosis is obvious, but in the initial stages conventional radiographs may be normal. The initial evaluation should be based on conventional radiographs. If the initial evaluation shows discrete changes, but the clinical findings are suggestive, further studies should be performed. Although rarely used for this diagnosis, magnetic resonance imaging allows the study of ligaments and soft tissues, assisting in eventual surgical planning. Computed tomography is ideal for evaluating bone and joint surfaces. Arthroscopy allows direct visualization of joint surfaces and ligaments. //Treatment// Treatment will depend on the type of injury detected, the cause, how long it has been developing and the presence of arthritis. Initial treatment methods include immobilization and physical therapy, as well as stopping activities that aggravate symptoms. Whenever possible, affected ligaments should be repaired or reconstructed, which involves surgery. Recovery time varies. Generally, desk work can be resumed after 4 to 6 weeks. Driving can be resumed after 6 to 8 weeks, and activities such as golf or racket sports should be avoided for 3 to 4 months. //Prevention// Preventing wrist instability in sports depends on adequate physical preparation, with an emphasis on muscle strength, balance, flexibility and defining training programs appropriate for each sport.

Heart failure,"//What is it?// Heart Failure corresponds to a clinical situation in which the heart loses its ability to pump blood to meet the body's oxygen and nutrient needs. It can result from various diseases or be a degenerative process associated with age. This is a common problem and it is estimated that, in Portugal, it affects around 4.4% of the adult population. For ages over 80 years, this incidence is around 16%. It is a disease closely associated with other highly prevalent diseases such as diabetes and obesity, therefore, its approach must occur in the context of the patient's overall treatment. //Symptoms// Many of its symptoms are nothing more than the body's attempt to compensate for the heart's increasing inability to circulate blood throughout the body. This compensation involves an increase in the strength and contraction of the heart muscle and its own rhythm, which can generate palpitations; or by greater retention of salt and water in the kidneys in order to increase the volume of circulating blood, which can cause swelling in various parts of the body, depending on the position and the action of gravity (while standing, liquid accumulates). if in the lower limbs; This increase in fluids results in a greater number of urinations during the night. There is also an increase in the thickness of the heart muscle (hypertrophy) which aims to compensate for the lower contractile capacity of this muscle. Although these mechanisms can, at an early stage, compensate for the loss of function of the heart muscle, they tend to introduce additional strain and, as such, contribute to a further deterioration of its function.  Heart failure must be promptly diagnosed and treated in order to avoid the development of these mechanisms and all their consequences. In established heart failure, one of the main symptoms is tiredness, which occurs after less and less effort or even at rest. There may also be loss of appetite, coughing or an increase in abdominal volume. The accumulation of fluid in the lungs can cause pulmonary edema, with difficulty breathing and shortness of breath, forcing patients to sleep with the head of the bed elevated or even sitting up. //Causes// Any disease that affects the heart or blood circulation can cause heart failure. One of the most common is coronary artery disease. These arteries supply blood to the heart muscle itself and, therefore, when affected, this muscle cannot perform its function effectively, which can lead to a heart attack. Other causes are myocarditis (inflammatory and/or infectious processes of the heart muscle), pericarditis (inflammation of the membrane surrounding the heart), diabetes, hyperthyroidism or obesity. As well as changes in the heart valves, arrhythmias and uncontrolled hypertension. Furthermore, any disease that causes a marked increase in the body's consumption of oxygen and nutrients will place additional strain on the heart and, if left untreated, may lead to the development of heart failure. //Diagnosis// Diagnosis involves assessing the severity of the condition and its underlying cause. Tests usually requested include a chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram and a laboratory study for a more complete evaluation. In some cases, an angiographic study may be necessary. //Treatment// As a rule, heart failure cannot be reversed and treatment aims to improve quality of life, autonomy and reduce mortality associated with this condition. In addition, it must focus on its cause, which can be medical or surgical, depending on its nature. Blood pressure and cholesterol and diabetes must also be controlled. An adequate diet is essential, as is practicing physical exercises adjusted to each patient's abilities and not smoking. Controlling salt intake is particularly relevant because it is associated with greater fluid retention and, as such, greater stress on the heart. Treatment for heart failure can be done by prescribing: Diuretics, which combat fluid retention;;/ Medicines that increase the strength of the heart muscle contraction and reduce its rhythm, such as digoxin;;/ Vasodilators, which reduce the workload required of the heart. If there is arrhythmia, a pacemaker may need to be implanted;;/ Anticoagulants, as in these patients there is a higher tendency for clots to form inside the heart, which can enter circulation causing distant embolisms.;/ When heart failure is very severe and does not respond adequately to therapy, a heart transplant may be indicated. //Prevention// Prevention involves adopting a healthy lifestyle in terms of diet, physical exercise, weight control and regular medical check-ups, while also avoiding tobacco, alcohol abuse and illicit substances. If there are risk factors, such as high blood pressure, diabetes or coronary heart disease, prevention involves diagnosing and treating these conditions appropriately before the heart muscle becomes overloaded.  If you want to know even more about heart failure, consult the article written by our experts.

Kidney failure,"//What is it?// Kidney failure is a disease caused by the progressive decrease in kidney function. Blood enters the kidneys through the renal arteries and passes to the nephrons which act as small filters. There are about a million in each kidney. This is where excess water and toxic products that form in the body are filtered from the blood. The “clean” blood returns to the bloodstream through the renal veins. Excreted toxins and excess fluid accumulate in the bladder in the form of urine. When the bladder fills, urine is eliminated from the body. If the kidneys become ill, their ability to remove toxins and water that accumulate in the body is reduced and kidney failure develops. Patients with chronic renal failure suffer a slow and progressive loss of kidney functions, that is, their ability to eliminate toxic substances produced by the body, to adequately maintain water and minerals in the body, and to manufacture hormones. Initially, the body adapts and compensates for this loss of function, so that symptoms only appear at a very advanced stage. Often, the first signs are related to anemia, typical in patients with kidney failure. When kidney function drops to 10% to 15%, it is not possible to live without replacement treatment, that is, dialysis or kidney transplantation. Kidney failure tends to affect both kidneys. In fact, a single kidney is enough to maintain completely normal function. It can be acute, when it appears suddenly, normally tending to recover, and chronic, when its failure occurs slowly and progressively, with fewer possibilities of recovery. In Portugal, it is estimated that 800,000 people suffer from chronic kidney disease and that there are around 16,000 people with kidney failure, including those who have already received a kidney transplant. Every year there are more than two thousand new cases of patients with kidney failure and around two thousand are on the waiting list for the possibility of a kidney transplant. //Symptoms// The kidney is an organ with great functional reserve, capable of adapting to the progressive loss of its function. This means that symptoms only appear when the decrease in function is very great. A chronic patient may be symptom-free until kidney function is at 15% to 20%. However, this situation does not mean that you should not consult a doctor immediately. An earlier diagnosis can slow the progression of the disease and maintain a good quality of life. Progressive tiredness, generalized weakness and fatigue when making small or moderate efforts are some of the symptoms that appear initially. They result from anemia, common in kidney failure. In other cases, insomnia occurs that requires the use of medication. In a more advanced stage, digestive symptoms appear, such as loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting. When there is kidney failure, there is a greater tendency for fluid accumulation (edema), more abundant on the legs at the end of the day and on the face in the early hours of the morning, upon waking up. Increased blood pressure is very common, occurring in around 90% of patients in advanced stages. There may still be a need to get up during the night to urinate several times (nocturia) or sleep with several pillows to improve breathing. Some patients still have generalized itchy skin and it tends to become drier and paler. Other, less common symptoms include menstrual changes in young women and a tendency to bleed into the skin or lose blood from the digestive tract. In acute kidney failure, where the kidneys suddenly stop working, signs include: Fluid retention;/ Internal bleeding;/ Confusion;/ Seizures;/ Coma;/ //Causes// There are several diseases that can cause or contribute to kidney failure. For many, if there is an early diagnosis and adequate treatment, it is possible to avoid this evolution. Glomerulonephritis, pyelonephritis, polycystic kidneys, diabetes and high blood pressure are the most common causes if they are not properly controlled. Diabetes is, in fact, a frequent cause of chronic kidney failure, as well as other serious vascular, ocular, and neurological complications. Vascular kidney diseases are often the result of prolonged hypertension. It may also occur as a result of a urinary tract abnormality or an obstacle in the urinary tract (for example, a stone), or a chronic infection. Abuse of medications that are toxic to the kidneys also tends to lead to chronic kidney failure. The drugs most frequently involved are analgesics and anti-inflammatories, used inappropriately and for long periods of time. //Diagnosis// The diagnosis is made by carrying out blood and urine tests that allow kidney function to be assessed. Tests that assess the general condition of the body and help understand the cause of kidney failure are also important. Among the analyses, creatinine and creatinine clearance stand out, which are very useful for measuring kidney function. The degree of anemia is measured from hematocrit and hemoglobin levels. It is important to know the levels of calcium and phosphorus in order to prevent bone problems. In diabetic patients, strict control of glucose levels is necessary. Urine analyzes make it possible to assess protein losses (proteinuria) in some patients, as well as the elimination of salt and other products. //Treatment// Treatment makes it possible to correct problems arising from poor kidney function and prevent kidney failure from occurring or, if it already exists, delay or stop its progression. Includes diet and medication. Diet helps control blood pressure and reduces the accumulation of substances such as urea, phosphorus or potassium, which diseased kidneys cannot eliminate in sufficient quantities. Medication helps control blood pressure, supply hormones that the kidney is unable to produce or relieve symptoms that may appear, such as vomiting and/or itching. There are general recommendations, valid for the general population, such as maintaining a healthy weight, avoiding tobacco and alcohol or regularly exercising. The amount of liquid you should drink varies according to the amount of urine you eliminate daily. There are kidney diseases where you urinate a lot and you need to drink a lot of water. In others, the amount is small and it is necessary to reduce fluid intake so that they do not accumulate. When blood pressure is high, salt should be eliminated and foods that contain it should be avoided. It is also important to control the protein, potassium, fat and sugar content in order to adjust them to the patient's needs. Anemia, bone problems and other diseases should be properly studied and controlled. Calcium and vitamin D may be useful in some situations. Hemodialysis is the method by which the patient's blood is taken, through an extracorporeal circuit, to an artificial semipermeable membrane through which toxic substances that have accumulated in the blood are removed. A hemodialysis session lasts an average of four to five hours and generally occurs three times a week. It can be done in a hospital establishment or in the patient's home. Peritoneal dialysis takes place inside the abdomen, through the membrane that surrounds the intestine (peritoneum). The liquid is placed and drained through a tube that is placed in the abdomen and remains there, allowing continuous use. This technique also allows the extraction of excess liquid and toxins accumulated in the blood and is repeated cyclically. Kidney transplantation is indicated in the most advanced forms of renal failure. //Prevention// Preventing kidney failure involves early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of conditions that can cause it, such as kidney disease, stones, infections, high blood pressure and diabetes. Correct use of medication, always under medical supervision, is very important because this is a possible cause of kidney failure. Adequate protection of the kidneys also includes a balanced diet, low in salt and fat, regular exercise, avoiding tobacco, restricting alcohol consumption and periodic medical evaluation. Urology Care Foundation, March 2013 Chronic Kidney Disease Management Platform, Ministry of Health, 2013 Portuguese Association of Kidney Insufficiency The Renal Association, 2013 American Kidney Fund, 2013 Dialysis Portal, December 2012 The kidney is a very important organ for the body's balance. Kidney diseases are usually silent, hence the importance of knowing the warning signs. A cause for alarm for anyone who encounters this problem, blood in the urine can be an indicator of several diseases, so it should not be ignored. Hypertension, stroke, dementia, osteoporosis, excess weight. Excess salt can increase the risk of several diseases. The key is moderation.

Food intolerance,"//What is it?// Food sensitivity can be divided into two parts: one is allergy and the other is intolerance. Intolerance to a food is an abnormal reaction, generally continuous and of low reactivity that can occur simply due to the lack of an enzyme necessary for the digestion of a component/part of a food, resulting in chronic inflammation. //Symptoms// When a food irritates the stomach or there is difficulty in digesting it properly, symptoms such as: Flatulence, pain and abdominal distension;/ Asia;/ Headaches;/ Irritability or nervousness;/ //Causes// Intolerances are usually linked to elements present in food, such as: Lactose, a natural sugar found in milk, cheese, and other dairy products;/ Sulfites, present in wines, preserved foods and soft drinks;/ Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, rye and other grains;/ Fructose, a natural sugar found in most fruits and corn syrup;/ Certain carbohydrates (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols) that attract water into the intestine during digestion;/ //Diagnosis// Food intolerance can be difficult to diagnose as symptoms may be associated with just one component of a given food and may also depend on the quantity ingested. The patient's clinical history is essential to identify the foods that trigger complaints. The exclusion of suspected foods should improve symptoms and their reintroduction into the diet may restart complaints. Allergy testing can differentiate between the two distinct conditions. //Treatment// During the nutrition consultation, a nutritional assessment is carried out and a nutritional plan adapted to any clinical situation is drawn up. //Prevention// You cannot avoid all food intolerances. If the food or food component in question is well identified, it is possible to exclude it from the diet and improve the clinical picture.

Food poisoning,"//What is it?// Food poisoning is a common, sometimes serious and life-threatening problem. People infected with foodborne disease-causing pathogenic organisms may be asymptomatic or vary in complaints from mild intestinal discomfort to severe dehydration,  bloody diarrhea, prostration, and severe changes in general condition and consciousness. The World Health Organization (WHO) has published data that are very enlightening regarding the importance of bacteria, viruses and parasites as causative agents of foodborne diseases. Diarrhea caused by contaminated food and unsafe drinking water is currently the leading cause of illness and death in developing countries, killing around 1.8 million people every year, mainly children. Gastroenteritis is the most prevalent disease worldwide. According to estimates, foodborne illnesses are 300 to 350 times more frequent than reported cases indicate, affecting one in every three people annually. These illnesses are mostly: food poisoning, a term used to encompass infections that occur when food contaminated with a pathogenic microorganism that is capable of growing in the gastrointestinal tract is ingested; and  food poisoning, which results from the ingestion of food in which bacteria or other microorganisms previously grew that produced toxins that end up being ingested along with it. Since 2005, the reporting of foodborne outbreaks has been mandatory for all Member States of the European Union. In 2006, 24 countries reported a total of 5,710 outbreaks, involving 53,568 people, resulting in 5,525 hospitalizations and 50 deaths. When comparing the results for that year with those for 2005, there was a 6.6% increase in the number of reported cases. The main foods involved were eggs and egg products (17.8%) and meat (unspecified, responsible for 10.3%). They were followed by fish and fish by-products (17.8%) and dairy products (3.2%). In Portugal, as is the case in most industrialized countries, data on food-borne diseases are scarce, which translates into an underestimation of the real dimension of this issue and, probably, an incorrect perception of the relative importance of each of the pathologies. . Several factors contribute to this situation. Most victims of an infection or food poisoning do not consult a healthcare professional and, when they do, they are rarely subjected to analyzes that allow the responsible agent to be identified. //Symptoms// The incubation period is the time between consuming food and the appearance of the first symptoms. This can vary from a few minutes to hours and days, depending on the type of agent and the amount of food ingested. Another factor that can influence it is the fact that the symptoms are the result of poisoning or an infection. In intoxication, the signs appear more quickly because the toxin is already present in the food ingested, while in infection the incubation period is longer, as the microbes take some time to proliferate in the digestive system. During incubation, the microbes pass through the stomach and go to the intestine, attaching themselves to the cells in its wall, where they multiply. From that point on, they can invade the intestinal wall, produce toxins or pass into the bloodstream, invading other tissues in the body. The amount of the agent (virus, bacteria, fungus) that needs to be ingested to the point of causing symptoms is called “infectious dose”. This may vary from person to person, depending on age and the type of agent causing the contamination. There are frequent cases in which several individuals eat the same food but only some become ill, either due to the quantity or the way the body reacts to the infectious agent. The main symptoms are vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, fever, headache, chills, muscle pain, weakness and general discomfort. //Causes// It is estimated that around 90% of foodborne illnesses are caused by microorganisms. These can be found in almost all foods, but their transmission results, in most cases, from incorrect practices in the last stages of their preparation or distribution. Although more than 250 different types of bacteria, viruses and parasites are known to cause foodborne illnesses, only a few appear frequently. Among the bacteria, Escherichia Coli stands out, which usually causes infection through ingestion of food or water contaminated by feces. Its main symptoms are diarrhea, nausea and fever, which generally appear six to 36 hours after ingestion. Salmonellosis is one of the most common poisonings, caused by the Salmonella bacteria, usually found in eggs, poultry, meat and milk. In most cases, the symptoms begin eight to 48 hours after ingestion, with the main symptoms being diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain and fever. This poisoning is not serious when treated properly, and on average, lasts two to five days. However, when diagnosed in babies, the elderly and debilitated patients or those with serious illness, Salmonellosis can be fatal. Brucellosis is caused by the Brucella bacteria. It is transmitted mainly through unpasteurized dairy products. As such, the main route of poisoning is the ingestion of milk and/or dairy products from animals infected with the bacteria. Symptoms include muscle pain, chills and fever. The incubation period ranges from five to 30 days. The bacterium Clostridium Perfringens is widely distributed in soil and in the intestinal tract of animals. This bacteria produces spores that survive normal cooking temperatures and multiply during cooling. Therefore, even when cooking the meat, potentially pathogenic bacteria still remain. The manifestations of the disease can take six to 24 hours to appear and the most common are abdominal cramps, diarrhea and nausea. Listeriosis is caused by the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes, which mainly affects pregnant women, people with weakened immune systems and newborns. It is often confused with the flu because of some symptoms such as body aches and fever, but it is also accompanied by nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. If the poisoning affects the nervous system, symptoms such as headaches, stiff neck, mental confusion and convulsions may appear. This bacterium is found in raw foods, such as meat and vegetables, and in processed foods, such as unpasteurised milk or cheese. Botulism is caused by a toxin produced by the bacteria Clostridium Botulinum, found mainly in poorly packaged, canned, preserved foods and in cases of inadequate handling and industrialization. In more serious cases, it can cause double vision, difficulty swallowing and speaking, and paralysis. Normally the incubation period is 12 to 72 hours. Poisoning caused by the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus also occurs, which can originate from people who handle food, as this bacteria lodges in the nose, throat or hands. It can also come from foods that are more susceptible to the production of staphylococcal toxin, such as refrigerated or incorrectly stored creams, sandwiches, inadequately refrigerated milk and prepared meats. The main symptoms are vomiting, nausea, diarrhea and abdominal pain. The incubation period is two to six hours. The most common bacterial cause of food poisoning is Campylobacter bacteria, found in raw poultry meat, unpasteurized milk, red meat and untreated water. As for viruses, they can be caused by Hepatitis A, transmitted by water and poorly processed food, and by Rotavirus, an important cause of childhood diarrhea, acquired through water, food, contaminated surfaces and from person to person. Some parasites, such as Giardiasis, cryptosporidiasis, trichiniasis, raw fish disease (caused by the fish parasite, Diphyllobothrium latum, through ingestion of raw or undercooked fish) are also responsible for food poisoning. //Diagnosis// Diagnosis involves clinical history and medical examination. It may be important to obtain a stool or vomit sample to check for blood or mucus. This is also sent to the laboratory where tests are carried out to find out the exact cause of the food poisoning. A urine sample may also be needed to see if there is an infection. In some cases, a tomography or abdominal x-ray and possibly blood tests are used to screen for other diseases. //Treatment// a doctor. However, medical help should be sought if the illness lasts more than a few days or if the stool contains blood or yellow or green mucus, or if the poisoning affects pregnant women, elderly people or babies. In some situations, antibiotics may be prescribed for certain types of bacterial infection. The recovery period depends on the type of pathogen, the age and physical condition of the patient. It is important not to eat other foods while symptoms persist. The stomach should rest for about an hour after vomiting, and small amounts of water should be consumed. In fact, hydration is an essential component in the treatment of these illnesses. It is also important to maintain personal hygiene to avoid passing the disease on to others. //Prevention// The main rules for preventing poisoning are: maintain cleanliness; separate raw foods from cooked ones; cook them well; keep them at the right temperatures; and use safe water and raw materials.

Ischemia,"//What is it?// Ischemia is the medical term that designates the presence of inadequate blood and oxygen flow to a specific part of the body. It can occur anywhere, such as the heart, brain, limbs, intestines, eyes and usually results from a narrowing or blockage of the arteries that supply the affected area. This serious condition can cause tissue damage, loss of a limb, or even death. //Symptoms// The symptoms of ischemia depend on where it occurs and how quickly it sets in. When the process is gradual, the body is able to compensate by supplying blood to the affected area through other arteries. This mechanism keeps the patient free of symptoms for a long time. When it is sudden, the symptoms are more pronounced. When ischemia affects the lower limbs, the most common symptoms are pain, a burning sensation and muscle cramps when walking. These symptoms ease with rest, but can progress to severe pain at rest or even loss of tissue, with gangrene. This condition requires immediate medical attention. If the ischemia is sudden, the pain is more intense, the pulses are not palpable, the limb becomes cold and pale, and weakness and loss of sensation occur. It is mandatory to seek immediate medical attention. At the heart level, it leads to angina pectoris, characterized by pain in the chest region that occurs when walking or exerting yourself and that is relieved by rest. If cardiac ischemia is sudden, a myocardial infarction may occur. In the brain, it causes strokes in the acute form and more non-specific symptoms, such as memory loss or difficulty concentrating, when it sets in gradually. In the intestines, blockage of the arteries tends to occur gradually, causing abdominal pain after meals. The patient becomes afraid to eat to avoid the pain, which causes weight loss. In the acute form, intestinal gangrene may occur with sudden and intense pain that requires urgent medical attention. In the eyes, occlusion of the artery that feeds the retina causes sudden loss of vision that requires urgent evaluation. //Causes// The main causes and risk factors for ischemia are atherosclerosis, tobacco, advanced age, high cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, diabetes, a family history of cardiovascular disease, a sedentary lifestyle and obesity. //Diagnosis// The diagnosis depends on the location, but symptoms are always the first source of suspicion. Tests include Doppler ultrasound, angiography, catheterization, magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography, depending on the case and the organs affected. Other tests may be requested to further study the ischemia and detect the risk factors associated with it. //Treatment// Treatment also depends on the affected area and its severity. In all cases, controlling risk factors is an essential aspect of treatment. In general, treatments aim to improve blood flow to the affected areas. In the specific case of lower limb ischemia, it has been shown that quitting smoking is crucial to prevent the progression of ischemia and prevent the loss of the affected limb. Various classes of medications with hypotensive, vasodilatory, cholesterol-controlling, analgesic or other effects can also be used. Properly advised physical exercise can be useful in lower limb ischemia and angina pectoris. It allows weight loss, control of blood pressure and diabetes and reduction of cholesterol. There are several surgical options for treating ischemia: angioplasty (dilation of obstructed arteries with a balloon and/or reinforcement of the artery wall), bypass surgery to create alternative irrigation routes for the affected areas, administration of drugs that dissolve clots directly into the arteries or surgery to remove atherosclerotic plaques. //Prevention// It should be based on the prevention of risk factors and their early identification and treatment. Therefore, controlling atherosclerosis, cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes and weight are essential. Smoking should be avoided and physical exercise encouraged.

Bunions,"//What is it?// Bunions, or hallux valgus, are a deformity in the big toe, in which its alignment changes and begins to deviate towards the second toe. This deviation results in a bony formation - a bump - on the side of the foot, where the toe joins the foot. This area can become inflamed and cause pain. The term ""hallux"" refers to the big toe. As the hallux deviates from its axis pointing towards the little finger, we speak of a ""valgus"" deviation. This inevitably creates a bony protrusion on the foot, which is also known as a bunion. This defect disturbs the correct alignment of the fingers and, in some cases, the pressure exerted by the big toe can lead to deformation of the joint of the second finger, which in turn “pushes” the third finger and so on. Bunions tend to progress slowly and worsen over time and are one of the most common foot deformities, and although anyone can develop them, they are more common among women. The higher prevalence in females is possibly due to the preference for tighter and narrower shoes and the fact that their ligaments are looser. //Symptoms// The symptoms of bunions only manifest themselves locally, in the area where this deformation is found, and include: Dor;/ Inflammation and redness;/ Burning sensation;/ Calluses;/ Numbness;/ Typically, symptoms occur when wearing shoes that are too narrow, which pinch the toe, forcing them to “clump together”. This happens, for example, with shoes with a pointy shape and high heels. Spending long periods of time standing can also result in worsening symptoms. //Causes// Bunions are often caused by some type of defect that already exists in the structure of the foot (which is usually genetic) and which increases the likelihood of the person developing them. This is why an individual whose parents or grandparents have bunions is more likely to suffer from this problem as well. Its appearance may also be due to the type of footwear used, for example, when the size is inappropriate or too tight. These can also develop when the big toe pushes against the second toe and causes the toes to cross, making walking difficult due to the pressure that shoes put on the toes. This problem tends to get progressively worse because, as the big toe is tilted, the tendons can no longer pull it in a straight line. Other factors that can contribute to the development of bunions are age, arthritis (such as rheumatoid) and playing sports. //Diagnosis// Simple observation allows you to check for bunions. However, to assess its severity and degree of deformation, the specialist may use x-rays. //Treatment// Faced with the existence of bunions, there are several possible scenarios: some people have large deformities that do not cause pain, but difficulties in terms of footwear, while others have small bunions, but which are very painful. Treatment will depend on these characteristics. The specialist - for example, a podiatrist - can recommend some strategies that, although they do not correct the deformation, alleviate the symptoms and prevent their exacerbation, such as: Performing specific exercises;/ Use of orthoses (which can be, for example, rigid to wear at night) and padded protectors;/ Choose suitable, comfortable footwear, preferably low and wider at the front, in order to avoid chafing;/ To relieve pain and inflammation, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, such as ibuprofen, may be prescribed, for example, and the application of ice several times a day may be recommended. When these measures fail and/or the pain interferes with daily activities, surgery can be carried out. This procedure can be performed using an open or minimally invasive (percutaneous) technique. The choice of technique will depend on factors such as the severity and size of the deviation, correction capacity, presence of osteoarthritis and associated pathologies, joint mobility, surgeon preference or length of the big toe in comparison to the others. In both cases, excess bone is removed and osteotomies (cuts in the bone) are performed to realign the finger. This is the only way to correct the deformation. Current anesthesia and pain control techniques have made these procedures faster and less painful, and can be performed on an outpatient basis, but the patient often remains in the hospital for at least one night. //Prevention// Some measures that you should adopt on a daily basis to prevent the development of bunions include: 1. Choose shoes that fit your feet, spacious enough so that your toes are not squeezed together; 2. Avoid wearing high-heeled shoes with an open heel; 3.Vary the height of your heels throughout the day; 4. If you wear high heels every day, wear ones that are no higher than 4 cm; and 5. Wear shoes that have a buckle over the instep, as this gives the foot more security and helps prevent it from slipping forward.

Respiratory function laboratory,"//What is it?// From children to adults, respiratory diseases of the airways, generally chronic, affect more than a third of the population, such as asthma and allergic rhinitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the latter often related to smoking habits. Therefore, with a view to responding to emerging clinical needs, the Allergy Center is equipped with a Respiratory Function Laboratory, fully equipped with the most up-to-date resources to evaluate and diagnose pathologies of the upper and lower airways, in children from the first years of life and adults of any age. //Types of evidence// Respiratory function tests in infants Aware of the need, in particular clinical cases, to perform functional tests on infants, our Laboratory is equipped with the most sophisticated equipment that allows, under the supervision of highly qualified professionals, to perform respiratory examinations from the first months of life. The Respiratory Functional Testing Laboratory therefore has an unparalleled capacity to respond to all clinical situations in all age groups.  Respiratory function tests in preschool age Respiratory function tests in preschool age have the same methodological character as respiratory function in adults, however, they have important particularities in their technical execution that are fundamental both for the child's collaboration and for obtaining reliable results. and reproducible. The assessment of lung function in preschool age clearly depends on the child's motivation to collaborate, therefore, methodological and intuitive games are used that encourage the child to carry them out, thus completing the necessary respiratory maneuvers. Non-occlusion plethysmography is performed to assess specific airway resistances, and consists of regular breaths at a standard respiratory rate, inside a cabin.  //What do we do?// Respiratory function tests are a set of techniques that allow evaluating the capacity of the lungs at rest and when stimulated by exercise or drugs (bronchodilators or bronchoconstrictors). These exams can be carried out from the age of 3 and allow for an early diagnosis of respiratory changes as well as monitoring their evolution and therapeutic response over the years. In order to also respond to some functional changes that occur during sleep, we also perform sleep tests on an outpatient basis. In our laboratory, the various techniques we have available to fully evaluate the respiratory system are: Spirometry;/ Pletismografia corporal total;/ Alveolar-capillary diffusion;/ Muscle pressures;/ Bronchodilation test;/ Inhalation provocation test;/ Respiratory effort test;/ Bronchial inflammation levels (FeNO);/ Cardiopulmonary exercise test;/ Altitude Tolerance Test;/ Transcutaneous oximetry;/ Night oximetry;/ Polygraphic register I am III;/ Actigraphy;/ Rhinomanometry;/ //Techniques// 1. Spirometry Spirometry is the study of lung volumes and flow rates. It is performed using a pneumotachograph, a device that measures airflow and describes it numerically, allowing the determination of several fundamental parameters in the evaluation of bronchial caliber. This is a non-invasive procedure, which is carried out through a forced expiratory maneuver and which encompasses the following phases: breathing at tidal volume, performing a maximum inspiration and culminating in a maximum forced expiration to the residual volume. As with most respiratory exams, there is no mandatory preparation, and you must follow the instructions of the attending physician, namely whether or not to suspend your medication before carrying out the exam.  2. Body Plethysmography (Ventilatory Mechanics) Body Plethysmography allows the assessment of lung volumes in a more detailed way than Spirometry, and is performed as a complementary procedure. Body Plethysmography, in addition to enabling the determination of airway resistance, provides us with access to non-mobilizable lung capacities and volumes, thus playing a crucial role in assessing the effectiveness of ventilatory mechanics. This technique is performed inside a cabin – Plethysmograph – where several respiratory maneuvers will be requested, of varying effort, which cause changes in pressure in the cabin and which allow the measurement of data relevant to the study of respiratory function. As with Spirometry, after a baseline study a new assessment can be carried out, either after the administration of a bronchodilator, or after the inhalation of a medication that can cause obstruction of the airways (methacholine), or even after performing physical exercise.  3. Study of Alveolar-Capillary Diffusion The functionality of the pulmonary alveoli may be compromised in various circumstances, which is why its determination is particularly relevant in the assessment of parenchymal lung diseases, in the assessment of pulmonary involvement of systemic diseases, in the evidence of desaturation during exercise, among others. The Diffusion Capacity Study makes it possible to evaluate the diffusion of gases - oxygen and carbon dioxide - across the alveolar capillary membrane. The Single Breath method is the most used and consists, succinctly, of inhaling a gas mixture composed of 10% He (Helium), 0.3% CO (Carbon Monoxide), 21% O2 (Oxygen ) and the rest of Nitrogen. In this technique, you breathe at tidal volume, proceeding with a complete exhalation, followed by a maximum inspiration. After a brief period of apnea, the gas is exhaled. Carbon monoxide, by competing with oxygen in binding to hemoglobin, makes it possible to quantify the alveolar surface available for gas exchange, through its concentration in exhaled air.  4. Nonspecific Inhalation Provocation Test with Methacholine The Non-Specific Inhalation Provocation Test is normally carried out in cases where the existence of bronchial hyperreactivity is suspected or when there is doubt in the diagnosis of immunoallergic pathology, such as asthma. It allows studying the reaction of the airways to a non-specific agent, generally a drug, such as Methacholine. This technique, in our Laboratory, includes the inhalation of different concentrations of methacholine and regular evaluation using flow-volume curves. The test, which may cause some symptoms, such as coughing or difficulty breathing, only ends after the clinical and functional return to initial conditions.  5. Respiratory Stress Test The respiratory effort test is an auxiliary means in the diagnosis of bronconstriction induced by physical exercise and can also be used to monitor the response to established control therapy. The assessment of the response to exercise is carried out by measuring the basal cardio-respiratory parameters and after effort, which is carried out on a treadmill with adjustable speed and incline for 6 to 8 minutes. Respiratory stress tests can be performed on children from the age of six.  6. Gasimetria arterial Arterial blood gas analysis (ABG) is an invasive test that provides us with relevant information about the adequacy of respiratory function (oxygenation, ventilation and acid-base balance), allowing, among other things, to determine the need for oxygen therapy, monitor ventilatory support and the severity of disease progression. This method consists of puncturing an artery, normally the radial artery, whose pulsations are easy to find, approximately 3 cm above the wrist. After collecting a small sample of arterial blood, it is analyzed.  7. Determination of Nitric Oxide in expired air Nitric Oxide (NO) in exhaled air is a very sensitive biochemical marker in the evaluation of bronchial (eosinophilic) inflammation in asthma. Assessment of the exhaled fraction of nitric oxide is a quick, non-invasive and painless method that consists of a single, slow exhalation through a mouthpiece. It is feasible for children from preschool age (3-4 years) to adults.  8. 6-Minute Walk Test The 6-minute Walking Test (PM6M) is an exam that allows the assessment of tolerance to small and medium efforts, useful for evaluating prognosis and/or evaluating therapeutic efficacy. The objective is to walk as fast as possible during the 6 minutes, on a previously defined route in a large space. In addition to other assessments, blood pressure, heart rate, peripheral oxygen saturation, dyspnea classification and arterial blood gas analysis must be monitored before and after PM6M. The distance covered and the evolution of transcutaneous oximetry during the test are recorded, with or without supplementary oxygen supply.  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a very disabling respiratory disease, but it can be prevented and treated. Know your symptoms. It is one of the main causes of hospitalization and death in Portugal. Around 150,000 cases occur every year and pneumonia can affect all ages. Usually caused by a virus, acute laryngitis is more common in winter and children between 3 months and 5 years of age are most affected.

Laparoscopy minimally invasive surgery,"//What is it?// Laparoscopy is a minimally invasive surgical technique that allows surgical procedures to be performed in the abdominal and pelvic cavities. When applied to the thorax, it is called thoracoscopy. Nowadays, most general surgery procedures can be performed using the laparoscopic technique. It is a more modern and less invasive surgical technique than conventional surgery, which involves making small incisions (about five millimetres) and using a laparoscope (a high-resolution camera attached to a fibre optic cable), which allows the surgeon to view the different organs on a screen. Laparoscopy is defined as: being less aggressive, causing less pain, allowing for faster post-operative recovery, requiring a shorter hospital stay and, therefore, the patient being able to resume personal, family, social and professional activities sooner. It was in 1989, in Europe, that the first laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed. In Portugal it occurred in 1991. //Advantages// Laparoscopy is a minimally invasive surgical technique that offers clear benefits when compared to conventional open surgery, namely: minor surgical trauma;/ lower risk of intraoperative bleeding and infection;/ less postoperative pain;/ The hospital stay is significantly shorter (1 to 2 days), even in cases of more extensive surgeries, and some procedures can be performed on an outpatient basis (with discharge on the day of the intervention). This type of surgery also allows for a faster postoperative recovery and an earlier return to usual activities and work. It also has an unquestionable aesthetic benefit, as in laparoscopy the scars are very small (5 to 10 mm). //Technique// The laparoscopic technique uses fiber optic technology with a video camera and a light source to visualize the intra-abdominal anatomical structures. To do this, it is necessary to create an intra-abdominal space with pneumoperitoneum (by insufflating carbon dioxide into the peritoneal cavity). The surgical procedure through laparoscopy uses small incisions (approximate size of 5 to 12 mm) through the abdominal wall/skin. Depending on the surgery to be performed, these incisions are 3 to 6. Sometimes, to remove the ""operative part - diseased organ"", it is necessary to make a larger incision, which for aesthetic reasons we choose the region below the navel/supra pubis. Laparoscopy always requires general anesthesia, however, it does not alter the possibility of a short hospital stay and potential discharge within 24 hours. //Procedures// Laparoscopy is often used in the following surgical procedures: Correction of gastroesophageal reflux disease/hiatal hernia;/ Correction of achalasia;/ Obesity surgery;/ Cholecystectomy - Ex.: gallbladder stone surgery;/ Splenectomy - spleen surgery;/ Small bowel surgery - Ex.: Crohn's disease;/ Appendix surgery - appendectomy;/ Colon and rectal surgery - colon and rectal cancer, colon polyp and diverticular disease;/ Diagnostic laparoscopy - for biopsies, e.g. liver or lymph nodes;/ Oncological staging laparoscopy;/ Gynecological surgery - surgery of the ovaries, fallopian tubes and/or uterus. Ex: endometriosis surgery;/ Abdominal wall surgery - hernia treatment;/ Adrenal gland surgery;/  This technique can also be used in other procedures, namely: Stomach surgery - gastrectomy;/ Pancreas and liver surgery;/ Urological surgery;/  Performing laparoscopy in the best conditions requires operating rooms equipped with modern technology, competent and experienced surgical teams with adequate training, and the role of the surgeon is the decision-maker. //Candidates// Almost anyone can be a candidate for laparoscopy, but there are generally contraindications, such as: blood clotting disorders, severe liver disease, severe cardiopulmonary problems and/or multiple previous abdominal surgeries. And specific situations of the disease and the patient in which the decision to perform the procedure must be made by the surgeon. Sometimes laparoscopic surgery is converted - that is, the surgeon decides to convert the surgery into a laparotomy (larger skin incision), the reasons may be technical or anatomical, but they are always in the best interests of the patient. //Other surgeries// L.E.S.S. The single-port abdominal surgical technique - also known as L.E.S.S. or scarless surgery - is a minimally invasive technical approach par excellence. It differs from conventional laparoscopy in that it uses a single small port/incision within the umbilicus. This technique involves some specific instruments and devices, and current experience is limited to a few surgical procedures (such as cholecystectomy and some surgical procedures for colon diseases and obesity).  T.EM., T.E.O. eT.A.M.I.S. Transanal surgeries - known as T.E.M. (Transanal Endoscopic Microsurgery), T.E.O. (Transanal Endoscopic Operations) or TAMIS (Trans Anal Minimally Invasive Surgery) - are primarily minimally invasive surgical techniques. They provide excellent results in the surgical treatment of some lesions of the anal canal and rectum, particularly polyps and tumors/cancers. António Manso and Nuno Bonito, CUF specialists, explain the importance of early diagnosis and surgical treatment in colorectal cancer. Watch the video. Laparoscopy is a less invasive surgical technique. However, it cannot be used in all cases and sometimes the best solution is conventional surgery.
