Nodular thyroid disease,"//What is it?// A nodule is a discrete lesion of the gland that results from the abnormal growth of thyroid cells. In turn, an increase in its total volume is called a goiter. Nodular thyroid disease is one of the most common and most prevalent in women. Its prevalence in the general population varies from 4% to 60%, depending on whether the nodules are diagnosed by palpation or ultrasound. //Symptoms// Most nodules are asymptomatic and are usually discovered during a routine examination or noticed by the patient as a lump in the neck. Some patients may complain of neck, jaw or ear pain. When they become large, they can cause difficulty in swallowing or breathing. Rarely, they cause hoarseness. //Causes// The nodules may be single or multiple and in most cases the cause is unknown, although they may occur in situations of iodine deficiency, be induced by medication, after radiotherapy to the head and neck or have a genetic cause. The vast majority of them are benign (non-cancerous), but a small percentage (5% to 10%) are carcinomas. A clinical evaluation is therefore essential to exclude malignancy. //Diagnosis// Physical examination and tests do not allow us to determine whether the nodule is malignant or not. Therefore, ultrasound is essential to determine its size and characteristics, since, as a general rule, only those larger than one centimetre or with a certain appearance should be evaluated as they have significant malignant potential. In these cases, fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is necessary, which collects cells from the nodule for microscopic study. Only in very specific situations should a thyroid scintigraphy be performed. //Treatment// The most common benign nodules are colloids, cysts and adenomas. In these cases, monitoring should be done every six to 12 months. If growth occurs or its characteristics change, it is necessary to repeat the CAAF. When surgery is indicated, it must be performed by a doctor with experience in thyroid surgery to reduce the likelihood of complications. Malignant nodules, despite being cancerous, are not as serious as other types of cancer, as they are almost benign in nature. In these cases, the initial indication is surgery, and it is often necessary to complete treatment with radioactive iodine. These patients require monitoring for the rest of their lives. //Prevention// Doctors aren't sure what causes most thyroid nodules, and they can't be prevented. Did you know that one in ten Portuguese people may have thyroid disease? Inês Sapinho, endocrinologist, and Maria Olímpia Cid, general surgeon, talk about treatments. Hypoparathyroidism is a rare condition that results from a lack of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and is manifested by low levels of calcium in the blood.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"//What is it?// Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) refers to a set of chronic, incurable lung conditions that limit the airways and cause difficulty breathing, the most common cause of which is tobacco consumption. It is characterized by irreversible or partially reversible bronchial obstruction with treatment. //Symptoms// Chronic cough and expectoration, respiratory infections especially in winter;/ Difficulty breathing (dyspnea) and wheezing;/ Sensation of chest tightness;/ Patients over 40 years of age, smokers or exposed to fumes or dust that are harmful to the respiratory system, who have a cough with sputum and dyspnea (tiredness), should consult a pulmonologist to screen for this pathology. //Causes// Tobacco is the most common cause. Smoking stimulates the production of mucus and obstruction of airflow, and smoking cessation reduces symptoms.;/ Air pollution and occupational exposure;/ Childhood respiratory infections and genetic factors;/ //Diagnosis// Clinical assessment of the patient, signs and symptoms is essential. The patient's history usually shows persistent and worsening symptoms over time. Respiratory Function Tests are the best exam to confirm the diagnosis: spirometry (measures the amount of air and the speed of flow during breathing) assesses lung performance - if spirometry is inconclusive, a lung diffusion capacity test can be performed. Blood tests, X-rays and computed tomography scans may also be useful. //Treatment// Smoking cessation is essential;/ Bronchodilators (used depending on the severity of the disease and the presence or absence of exacerbation);/ Oxygen, if there is partial respiratory failure;/ Non-invasive ventilation, if there is global respiratory failure;/ Respiratory physiotherapy;/ Prevention of respiratory infections with vaccination;/ //Prevention// Quitting smoking is essential for a longer, healthier life;/ Avoid exposure to secondhand smoke;/ Protecting yourself from chemicals, dust and smoke at home and at work;/ American Lung Association Medical News Today Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a very disabling respiratory disease, but it can be prevented and treated.

Chronic kidney disease,"//What is it?// Chronic kidney disease consists of kidney damage with progressive and irreversible loss of kidney function. In its most advanced stage, the kidneys are no longer able to maintain normality in the patient's internal environment. It is estimated that in Portugal more than 800 thousand people suffer from this disease. Every year, 2,200 new terminal cases are registered, and there are currently 14,000 patients dependent on dialysis, of which five thousand are transplanted. It can affect all ages and genders, although its incidence is higher in adults and the elderly. Diabetes, obesity and high blood pressure are three of the factors that contribute to the numbers being even higher in the future, which is why early diagnosis and treatment are essential. Kidney failure can be acute, when it appears suddenly, normally tending to recover, and chronic, when kidney failure occurs slowly and progressively, with no possibility of recovery. It is important to emphasize that a single healthy kidney is enough to maintain completely normal kidney function. //Symptoms// The absence of symptoms in the early stages of the disease causes a large part of the population to underestimate, ignore or postpone the care to be taken. This initial lack of signs results from the kidneys' ability to adapt to the progressive loss of their function, which means that signs only appear when the pathology is already very serious. An individual may be asymptomatic until kidney function is within 15% or 20% of normal values. In the presence of kidney disease, diabetes or hypertension (in very advanced stages, up to 90% of patients may have high blood pressure), a specialist doctor should be consulted to try to delay, as much as possible, the progression of the pathology, maintaining the quality of life. The main warning signs are burning or difficulty urinating; urinating frequently, especially at night; urinating with blood; presence of swollen eyes, hands and/or feet, especially in children; pain under the ribs that does not change with movement; high blood pressure. Other common complaints are progressive tiredness, generalized weakness and fatigue when making small or moderate efforts. These problems result from anemia, common in kidney failure. Other times, progressive insomnia is observed, in which the patient has to take medication to be able to sleep. Quite often, in the face of a serious condition, there is a loss of appetite, nausea or vomiting. The kidney has the function of eliminating most of the liquids and waste from metabolism. Therefore, in the presence of abnormal kidney function there is a tendency for fluid to accumulate, more abundant in the legs as the day progresses, and on the face in the early hours of the morning, upon waking up. Some patients also have generalized itchy skin and a dry, pale complexion. Symptoms, which are rarer, include menstrual changes in young women and a tendency for bleeding into the skin or blood loss through the digestive tract. //Causes// The most common causes are glomerulonephritis, pyelonephritis, polycystic kidneys, diabetes and high blood pressure. There may be hereditary factors that increase the tendency to chronic kidney disease. //Diagnosis// Diagnosis involves carrying out blood and urine tests, and measuring blood pressure. Urinary tests make it possible to evaluate protein losses, as well as the elimination of salt and other elements. In diabetic patients it is necessary to maintain strict control of glucose levels in order to reduce its impact on kidney function. It may also be necessary to resort to ultrasound, tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. //Treatment// The type of treatment for chronic kidney disease depends on the stage the patient is in. Therapy makes it possible to correct problems caused by poor kidney function and prevent kidney failure or, if it is already present, slow down or stop its progression. Includes diet and medication. The diet helps control blood pressure and reduce the accumulation of substances such as urea, phosphorus or potassium, which diseased kidneys cannot eliminate in sufficient quantities. In this way, the signs tend to improve and it is possible to delay or stop the loss of functions. Medication is used to stabilize blood pressure, to supply hormones that the kidney is unable to produce, or to relieve vomiting or itching. The amount of liquids you should drink varies depending on the amount of urine you eliminate each day. When there is a lot of water, you need to increase your water intake. When there is little, you need to reduce the amount of liquids you drink so that they do not accumulate. If you have high blood pressure, you should eliminate salt and avoid eating sausages or canned foods. When the kidneys function less than half of normal, they are no longer able to eliminate substances resulting from protein intake, especially those from meat and fish. In these cases, it is useful to reduce them in the diet, compensating them with other foods. Potassium can also accumulate in the blood and must be monitored, as well as fats and sugar, especially in diabetic patients. On the other hand, whenever necessary, medications may be prescribed to control blood pressure and calcium and phosphorus levels, and to treat or control anemia. When kidney function is no longer sufficient to meet the body's needs, it is essential to do so mechanically, through hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. In both cases, the objective is to filter the blood, preventing toxic substances and excess fluids from accumulating. These treatments should be carried out, on average, three times a week. //Prevention// There are recommendations that apply to the general population: maintain a normal weight, avoid tobacco and alcohol, practice regular physical exercise, among others. The prevention of chronic kidney disease involves controlling all its risk factors, such as diabetes and hypertension, and early diagnosis and treatment of any kidney disease, thus preventing its progression. It is important to carry out periodic exams, comply with the prescribed treatment for diabetes and/or high blood pressure, control excess weight, follow a healthy diet and a periodic exercise program, stop smoking, avoid the heavy use of over-the-counter painkillers, take dietary changes, reducing salt and proteins, and limiting alcohol intake. João Egidio Romão Junior, Chronic Kidney Disease: Definition, Epidemiology and Classification, J Bras Nefrol XXVI (3, Suppl. 1), August 2004 National Kidney Foundation, 2013 Brazilian Society of Nephrology, 2013 National Kidney Foundation, 2007 The kidney is a very important organ for the body's balance. Kidney diseases are usually silent, hence the importance of knowing the warning signs. A cause for alarm for anyone who encounters this problem, blood in the urine can be an indicator of several diseases, so it should not be ignored. Hypertension, stroke, dementia, osteoporosis, excess weight. Excess salt can increase the risk of several diseases. The key is moderation.

Chronic venous disease,"//What is it?// Chronic venous disease, or chronic venous insufficiency, corresponds to an anomaly in the functioning of the venous system caused by an incompetence of the valves in the veins, associated or not with obstruction of venous flow. The venous system is divided into superficial, perforating and deep, and this disease can affect any of these compartments. Venous function depends on the proper functioning of the valves and propulsive muscles, which ensure venous flow in the opposite direction to gravity. Valvular incompetence of superficial veins can result in weakening of the vascular walls or be secondary to thrombophlebitis, while deep venous incompetence usually arises as a result of obstruction. The frequency of this disease increases with age. In Europe, of adults aged between 30 and 70 years, 5% to 15% have this disease, with 1% already having a varicose ulcer. In the United States, around seven million people have this condition, which is the cause of 70% to 90% of all lower limb ulcers. This is a very common problem, capable of reducing quality of life and with socioeconomic repercussions, considering that its complications can be responsible for chronic and disabling pain and, consequently, the loss of working days and early retirement. //Symptoms// Sensation of heaviness and pain in the lower limbs, especially at the end of the day and, in some cases, itching. Tingling, hyperpigmentation of the skin (due to accumulation of hemoglobin), progressive replacement of the epidermis and subcutaneous tissue by fibrosis, swelling, presence of varicose veins and moles may also occur. Stasis ulcers, which occur in chronic venous disease, begin spontaneously or traumatically, vary in size and depth, and often heal and recur regularly. Its most common location is on the inside of the leg, close to the ankle. These ulcers are only painful when they are infected. They usually have irregular edges, with a red base, exudation with blood or pus, and pigmentation around them. If left untreated, the veins tend to dilate, making symptoms more severe, and severe venous insufficiency may occur, with a risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. //Causes// It is currently known that advanced age, family history and gender constitute important risk factors for the development of the disease. Women are more prone to illnesses, especially in the last 14 days of the menstrual cycle. In addition to these, there are other causes: Standing or sitting for many hours, especially with your legs crossed;/ Sedentary lifestyle;/ Prolonged stay in hot places, because heat dilates the veins and increases stasis;/ Prolonged sun exposure, hot baths, sauna and warm clothing;/ Constipation and excess weight;/ Very tight clothing;/ Shoes with high heels or flats;/ Pregnancy and oral contraception can aggravate the disease, as estrogens increase venous permeability and progesterone promotes their dilation. //Diagnosis// It is essentially clinical, based on medical history and physical examination. Its assessment can be complemented by various diagnostic methods, with emphasis on Doppler. Phlebography is indicated when non-invasive methods do not provide sufficient clarification and/or treatment guidance. //Treatment// It is important to treat reflux and venous hypertension and reverse the symptoms in order to improve the quality of life of patients. Pharmacological treatment is indicated for all types of chronic venous disease and should be used as an adjunct to compression therapy. These medications act on the macro and microcirculation, increasing venous tone, reducing capillary permeability, acting on the venous wall and valves and preventing venous reflux. They also improve lymphatic flow and have an anti-inflammatory effect. Their effectiveness in relieving symptoms such as pain, cramps, restless or heavy legs, itching and paresthesia has been widely confirmed. Compression is the most frequently used form of treatment for larger varicose veins, with edema, pigmentation changes or active ulcers. Elastic compression promotes the reabsorption of edema and prevents its formation, reduces venous caliber and increases flow speed, reduces reflux when standing and improves muscle contractility. It can be done using elastic stockings, elastic bandages, boots or bandages or through pneumatic devices, the first two being the most widely used. Elastic stockings can go up to the knee, to the base of the thigh or be tights. The doctor decides which model is best for each case. Mechanical extraction seeks to treat reflux and venous hypertension by removing varicose veins. Another therapeutic option is endovenous thermal ablation, a minimally invasive option that has proven to be very effective. It can be performed using laser or radiofrequency, on an outpatient basis and under local anesthesia. Sclerotherapy has been gaining ground because it is minimally invasive. It consists of the intravenous administration of sclerosing agents that cause endothelial damage, activation of the coagulation cascade, local thrombus formation and consequent venous occlusion. //Prevention// Standing or sitting for long periods of time, especially with your legs crossed, should be avoided as it can lead to the development of venous disease. If your work requires it, it is important to try to make circular movements with your feet or walk after work. Regular exercise is equally important, as it stimulates muscle contraction and venous return. Gymnastics, swimming, cycling or dancing should be preferred, which promote venous circulation, and basketball or tennis should be avoided as they require sudden movements, inducing pressure variations in the veins that cause their dilation and reduced return. venous. Hot places should also be avoided as they dilate the veins and increase stasis. On the other hand, running cold water and staying in cool places is recommended, as it stimulates venous function and relieves pain and the feeling of heavy legs. Constipation and excess weight also increase venous blood pressure. Therefore, it is useful to eat a diet rich in fiber (vegetables), stay well hydrated and reduce the intake of saturated fats (such as butter). Clothing that is too tight compresses the veins and hinders circulation, so it should be avoided. Wearing appropriate shoes is also important. Heels of three to four centimeters should be preferred over high-heeled or flat shoes. During sleep, the venous system is not stimulated, so it is advisable to perform pedaling movements before falling asleep, as well as elevating your feet (10 to 15 centimeters from the bed). Massaging the legs from bottom to top also stimulates venous return. U.S. National Library of Medicine, February 2014 Medeiros, Julia et al., Therapeutic strategy in chronic venous disease.

Rotator cuff diseases,"//What is it?// The rotator cuff is a set of muscles and tendons that surround the shoulder joint, which is extremely important for its movement. If the shoulder hurts, it is possible that there is an injury to that area and that it could be caused by trauma or aging of the joint. A rotator cuff injury actually justifies the appearance of shoulder pain. This is, as a rule, a condition of tendinopathy, that is, a problem with the tendons. There are many causes of injury. It may be a simple tendinopathy, in which some repetitive movements can cause inflammation of the tendons (tendinitis). It may be a calcifying tendinopathy, with the formation of calcium deposits in the tendons, causing pain, reduced strength and mobility. Finally, a rupture of the cuff may occur, related to ageing itself or, sometimes, trauma that can cause partial or total ruptures of the cuff, resulting in a painful shoulder, with loss of strength and limited movement. //Symptoms// The most common symptoms are pain at rest and at night, especially when sleeping on the affected shoulder; pain when raising and lowering the arm or with specific movements; a feeling of weakness when raising or rotating the arm; a sensation of crackling when moving the shoulder in certain positions. Ruptures that occur suddenly, such as from a fall, cause very intense pain associated with immediate weakness of the forearm. The pain tends to be more evident when raising the arm from the outside of the body. In the initial stages, the pain is mild and only occurs when the arm is raised above the head, for example, to take something out of a cupboard. At this stage, anti-inflammatories and analgesics are effective. Over time, the pain becomes more noticeable at rest and does not go away with treatment. The arm becomes weaker, making daily activities, such as combing your hair, more difficult. //Causes// Generally speaking, these injuries result from trauma or a degenerative process. A fall with overextension of the arm or lifting a weight that is too heavy can tear the rotator cuff. Most injuries result from overuse of the tendon over time. It is a degenerative process that occurs over time and is most evident in the dominant arm. This degenerative process can be accelerated by several factors: Repeated efforts put pressure on the muscles and tendons of the cuff. Tennis, baseball, rowing and weightlifting are some of the sports that increase this risk.;/ Reduced blood flow that occurs with aging hinders natural repair processes, which can contribute to rupture.;/ Abnormal bone growth (spurs) can occur in the shoulder. When you raise your arm, these spurs rub against the shoulder cuff tendon, weakening it and increasing the risk of rupture.;/ This type of injury is more common after the age of 40, in athletes who practice the sports already mentioned, in painters, carpenters and other professionals who keep their arms above their heads for a long time. At younger ages, the most common cause is trauma, such as a fall. //Diagnosis// The medical examination allows the condition of the joint to be assessed. During this examination, palpation and movement of the shoulder will allow its strength, mobility and stability to be assessed. In addition to this, other imaging tests (such as radiography, ultrasound, tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) help to better determine the cause and type of injury, as well as the most appropriate treatment for the situation. Arthrography allows a rupture of the cuff to be determined by injecting an opaque product. //Treatment// Treatment is medical, surgical, or both. Whatever the option, it is important to perform simple exercises and learn how to correctly mobilize the shoulder. A mild shoulder injury does not require surgery and treatment involves rest and the use of analgesics and anti-inflammatories, sometimes in the form of infiltration. Rest helps to relieve pain. Therefore, it is recommended to walk with your arm against your chest, limiting your efforts. It is important to make regular movements to prevent stiffness in the joint. Electrostimulation is a method that can be used to control severe and persistent pain. The electrical impulses act by blocking the pain signals that come from the shoulder. Ultrasounds allow deep tissue to be reached, improving circulation and calming muscle pain. The associated use of a corticosteroid cream can help reduce inflammation. Depending on the case, heat or cold may be used. Surgery is indicated if other treatments have failed. The techniques currently available allow us to expect good post-operative results, although they are not, of course, risk-free. Arthroscopy allows observation of the inside of the joint, treatment of any associated injuries, reduction of post-operative pain and facilitation of immediate rehabilitation by avoiding opening the joint, with small scars. Open surgery may be necessary to repair a torn cuff. In this case, the incision is larger than in arthroscopy and the recovery is slower. In this surgery, the injury can be repaired, calcifications removed or, if necessary, total or partial replacement of the shoulder joint. After surgery, it is essential to keep the shoulder resting for about 1 month, placing the arm on the chest. You may need to start a rehabilitation program to prevent stiffness and swelling in your shoulder. //Prevention// For people who have already suffered from this injury, it is important to perform daily exercises to stimulate shoulder strength and balance. In addition to exercising the pectoral, shoulder and arm muscles, it is equally important to strengthen the muscles in the back of the shoulder. For people who carry out activities or sports associated with a greater risk of this injury, daily exercises to prevent it must be carried out and breaks must be respected when carrying out repeated activities with effort on the shoulder.

Thyroid diseases,"//What are they?// The thyroid can be affected by several pathologies, generally more common in women. The main ones are: goiter, presence of nodules, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism and autoimmune diseases, such as Graves' disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis, which result from the production of antibodies that can stimulate or destroy the gland. Thyroid diseases are often silent but are very common, affecting more than one million Portuguese people and 300 million people worldwide. In Portugal, more than 400 new cases of thyroid cancer appear each year, one of the most serious diseases that affects this organ. Nodular thyroid disease is one of the most common diseases, being more common in women. Its prevalence in the general population varies from 4% to 60%, depending on whether the nodules are diagnosed by palpation or ultrasound. The thyroid is a gland located at the base of the neck, immediately below the ""Adam's apple"", and is made up of two lobes joined by a central part. Its function is to produce and release into the bloodstream two hormones, triiodothyronine (T3) and tetraiodothyronine (T4 or thyroxine), which are essential for the normal functioning of the body, through the control/speed of cell metabolism. Therefore, they are essential for the growth and development of the body, regulating body temperature, heart rate and blood pressure, bowel function, weight control, mood states, among other functions. Its activity is regulated by other glands located in the brain that detect blood levels of thyroid hormones and thus stimulate it to secrete more or less according to the body's needs. //Symptoms// Thyroid dysfunction, increased or decreased hormonal secretion known as hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, can cause exuberant symptoms and signs attributable to any other organ or system, due to the important action of thyroid hormones in its normal activity. Goiter and nodules correspond to a clinical situation in which the thyroid may be diffusely enlarged (simple goiter) or with the formation of nodules (nodular goiter). These can be benign or malignant. Generally speaking, thyroid cancer is not very aggressive. Single nodules, less than one centimeter, only require annual control. The larger ones should be evaluated by performing an aspiration cytology performed with a fine needle to check whether it is benign or malignant. In the case of multiple nodules (nodular goiter), discomfort or compression may occur in the neck, which may justify surgical treatment. In the case of hyperthyroidism, in which there is an excess of thyroid hormones in circulation, there is a faster metabolism throughout the body. This condition manifests itself as an increase in the size of the gland (goiter); weight loss despite increased appetite, palpitations (increased heart rate), irritability, nervousness, anxiety, insomnia, hand tremors, heat intolerance and excessive sweating, hair loss and nail changes, diarrhoea, menstrual irregularities and reduced or absent menstrual flow, muscular weakness, a fixed, lively gaze and/or prominent eyes. In hypothyroidism, on the other hand, the hormone levels produced by the thyroid are insufficient, compromising the normal functioning of the body. The main symptoms are a slight increase in weight (due to fluid retention), fatigue/easy tiredness, increased sensitivity to cold, constipation, dry skin, hair loss, menstrual irregularities, depression, muscle pain and tingling. //Causes// They vary greatly depending on the disease. In the case of nodules, there is often no explanation for their appearance. In others, they may be due to genetic causes, radiotherapy to the head and neck, certain medications or an iodine deficiency. Hyperthyroidism can result from an autoimmune disease, the presence of one or more nodules that produce excess thyroid hormones; thyroiditis (viral thyroid infection), or an excess of these hormones due to abundant intake of iodine from food (iodized salt, fish, shellfish and vegetables) or present in some medicines and products, such as amiodarone, lugol's solution or contrasts for radiological examinations. Hypothyroidism can also be caused by an autoimmune disease, a lack or excess of iodine, which is provided by food (iodized salt, fish, seafood and vegetables), a previous surgery with partial or total removal of the gland, the use of certain medications, such as amiodarone, lithium or interferon; exposure to radiation during radiotherapy for thyroid, head or neck diseases. //Diagnosis// Assessment of symptoms allows you to understand what type of change is present. Blood tests detect and measure the levels of thyroid hormones in the bloodstream. Its execution takes time, so obtaining results is not immediate. TSH, total thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) and their free fractions can be measured. Determining TRH using current methods is sufficient in most cases to assess possible hormonal changes. Other dosages will be ordered depending on each patient. Physical examination and tests do not allow us to determine whether a nodule is malignant or not. Therefore, ultrasound is essential to determine the size and characteristics of the nodules. In this scenario, fine needle aspiration cytology is necessary, which collects cells from the nodule for microscopic study. In more specific situations, a thyroid scintigraphy should be performed. //Treatment// In the case of hyperthyroidism, treatment may consist, depending on the case, of the administration of anti-thyroid drugs, radioactive iodine or surgical intervention. Other medications may be useful to alleviate symptoms. For hypothyroidism, treatment involves the administration of thyroid hormone, usually in the form of tablets. In both cases, it is important to regularly monitor the levels of these hormones in order to adjust the doses of the prescribed medications. //Prevention// There is no way to prevent these diseases. If there is a family history of thyroid disease, regular surveillance is important in order to make an early diagnosis. It is helpful to avoid exposure to radiation, tobacco, and environmental toxins.

Pigmentation diseases,"//What is it?// The color of the skin, hair and iris is determined by a pigment, melanin, which is produced by melanocytes. These diseases result from changes in this pigment. These changes depend on racial factors, exposure to sunlight, which increases its production as a protective mechanism against ultraviolet radiation, and hormonal factors. Hypopigmentation, which corresponds to a reduced amount of pigment, is usually limited to small areas and tends to result from a previous inflammatory process. More rarely, it may represent a hereditary disease. On the contrary, the increase in the amount of melanin (hyperpigmentation) may be a response to hormonal changes, such as those that occur in Addison's disease, during pregnancy or with the use of oral contraceptives. The skin can also darken in diseases such as hemochromatosis or hemosiderosis, or as a response to various medications that are applied to the skin, ingested or injected. //Types// The most common are albinism, vitiligo, melasma and changes caused by lesions. Although the majority are benign and the diagnosis is simple, it is essential to exclude melanoma and its precursors and identify lesions that are manifestations of other clinical conditions.  Albinism It is an uncommon and hereditary disease in which melanin is not formed. In Europe, it is estimated that one individual in every 10,000 is affected by albinism, and around 2% carry the gene that determines the pathology without undergoing changes. People with albinism may have white hair, pale skin, and pink eyes. They often present with abnormal vision and involuntary eye movements. Because melanin protects the skin from the sun, these individuals are very prone to sunburn and, consequently, skin cancer. Therefore, it is essential to avoid direct exposure to sunlight, wearing sunglasses and applying sunscreen with a high protection factor to uncovered parts of the skin. There is no cure for albinism.  Vitiligo The loss of melanocytes produces smooth, white patches on the skin. In Portugal, it affects around 1% of the population. The incidence in men and women is identical. In 25% to 50% of cases, there is a family history. In some people, only one or two well-defined spots appear; in others, the spots are more extensive. The changes are more visible in patients with dark pigmentation. As with albinism, non-pigmented skin is extremely sensitive to sunburn. Those affected by vitiligo also produce white hair because the hair follicles lose their melanocytes. This pathology can appear after physical trauma and can be associated with Addison's disease, diabetes, pernicious anemia and thyroid disease. This illness can have an important psychological impact, due to its effect on image and self-esteem. There is no known cure for vitiligo. Small areas can be camouflaged with various dyes that do not stain clothing and whose effects last for several days. Treatment with photosensitive drugs combined with ultraviolet A rays is sometimes effective; however, the therapy takes time and must be continued indefinitely. Sunscreens and sunscreens are essential to prevent burns.  Loss of pigment after skin injury The skin can lose its pigment after recovering from certain illnesses and skin infections such as vesicles, ulcers or burns. In this case it is not as white as in vitiligo and, over time, it may return to its normal pigmentation. Cosmetics can camouflage this type of stain.  Melasma It usually appears on the face (forehead, cheekbones, forehead or chin) in the form of dark brown hyperpigmented plaques, often well defined, on both sides of the face, in a symmetrical shape. Melasma appears mainly in women (90% of cases), particularly during pregnancy, although it can also appear when taking oral contraceptives. The darkening generally disappears shortly after giving birth or discontinuing these contraceptives. People with melasma should use sunscreens on dark plaques and avoid exposure to the sun to prevent the disease from worsening.  Café-au-lait stains These spots are light brown in color and measure between one and 20 centimeters. They tend to be present from birth or appear in the first months of life. They correspond to an increased concentration of melanin in melanocytes and can appear anywhere on the body, especially on the trunk. They affect around 10% to 30% of the population. They do not cause symptoms and only require treatment for cosmetic reasons, which can be performed by laser or surgery. When more than six spots appear with a diameter greater than five millimeters before puberty or greater than 15 millimeters after puberty, other diseases such as tuberous sclerosis, neurofibromatosis, Albright syndrome or Fanconi anemia should be investigated. //Diagnosis// It involves taking a clinical history, a medical examination and, whenever necessary, collecting skin samples for laboratory testing. When a general disease is suspected, specific tests are requested. //Prevention// Many of these diseases, such as vitiligo or albinism, are not preventable. However, avoiding excessive sun, adequate cleansing and hydration tend to keep the skin healthier and prevent the appearance of changes in its pigmentation. Smoking, poor sleep, and excessive sun exposure are all enemies of healthy, youthful skin. But there are other mistakes you can avoid to prevent premature aging. A long, hot bath can be relaxing, but it can also dry out and irritate your skin. Understand how wrong habits can do more harm than good. There are some benefits to taking cold showers and baths, however, there are also risks for heart patients. Learn about them.

Eating disorders in children,
Intervertebral disc diseases,"//What is it?// Intervertebral discs are located between the vertebrae and function as shock-absorbing elements. When subjected to stress or trauma, the discs can swell, compressing the surrounding structures and causing various symptoms. This condition corresponds to a herniated disc. Disc disease is a common cause of pain in the adult population but is relatively rare in the younger population involved in sport. This type of disease may or may not be associated with sciatic pain (pain that radiates down the leg). The most common disc diseases are degenerative diseases, ruptured discs and sciatica. In degenerative diseases, the water content of the discs decreases with age, making the discs thinner and more rigid. As such, friction between the vertebrae increases, causing the formation of bone spurs that are associated with pain. This is one of the most common causes of chronic pain in older adults. In disc ruptures, there is a break in the outer layer of the disc, allowing its gelatinous content to leak out. When this material comes into contact with nearby nerves, it causes pain and alters the function of these nerves. Ruptures occur most frequently in the lumbar region. The risk of disc rupture decreases with age, due to the degenerative process mentioned above which reduces the water content of the discs and therefore reduces the extravasation of gelatinous material from any breaks that may occur. Sciatic pain results from compression of the sciatic nerve, which runs from the spinal cord to the back of the leg. One of its causes is a ruptured disc. Due to its importance and frequency, sciatic pain will be discussed separately. //Symptoms// Symptoms of disc disease vary depending on its location and severity. In many cases, this disease progresses without any symptoms. The most common complaints are low back pain, pain that radiates down the legs, worsening of the pain with bending the trunk or sitting for long periods, worsening of the pain with coughing or sneezing and a tingling or stinging sensation in an arm or leg. The symptoms of a herniated disc also depend on its location and the extent of the herniation. If the disc does not compress any nerves, there may be no symptoms. Compression of the nerve causes pain, numbness or weakness in the area of ​​the body where the nerve is located. When the herniated disc is located in the lumbar spine, sciatica may occur. If it is in the upper part of the lumbar spine, near the last ribs, the pain may radiate to the front of the thigh. If the hernia occurs in the neck, the pain and numbness are located in the shoulders, arms or chest. Pain in a leg caused by a herniated disc usually occurs in only one of the lower limbs, can have a sudden or gradual onset, can be constant or intermittent, can worsen with coughing, sneezing or with the effort exerted during evacuation, can worsen even more with the sitting position, standing for long periods or with twisting and flexing movements. This pain can be relieved by walking, lying horizontally, or other positions that reduce pressure on the injured disc. Deeper muscle pain or even muscle spasms may also occur. //Causes// The most common causes of disc disease are vehicle-related trauma, heavy lifting, and falls. Age, obesity, poor posture and disc degeneration are other factors to consider. Tobacco consumption, poor muscle tone and a sedentary lifestyle are other relevant factors. It is important to remember that low back pain is not always the result of disc disease. For example, muscle pain is an even more common cause of lower back pain than disc disease. In these cases, the pain does not radiate down the leg and, in general, does not require treatment. Fractures related to osteoporosis in the elderly are another cause of low back pain. Tumors can also cause lower back pain. The presence of severe, nocturnal pain and weight loss are reasons to raise this hypothesis. //Diagnosis// The diagnosis involves a medical examination and MRI, which allows us to understand whether the pain is due to a disc injury or other causes that may simulate this injury. //Treatment// Treatment will depend on the cause, location and severity of the disc disease and can range from rest to surgery. As a general rule, it is important to modify activities that aggravate symptoms and put pressure on the spine. There are low-impact exercises that increase muscle strength and reduce stress on the discs. The use of heat, cold, traction techniques, electrical stimulation and ultrasound may be recommended in particular cases. Anti-inflammatories and analgesics, used under medical supervision, can significantly relieve symptoms. In some cases, corticosteroid injections may be administered directly into the affected disc. As a rule, time is a good ally in treatment and most symptoms disappear after 4 to 6 weeks. Surgery is necessary in about 10% of cases when other treatments have not been effective. //Prevention// As already mentioned, most disc diseases resolve spontaneously. Here are some tips to prevent this from happening: Do not remain seated for long periods of time;/ Avoid lifting heavy objects;/ Don't forget that bending and twisting movements put pressure on injured discs.;/ Exercise your abdominal muscles to strengthen them and improve support for your lower back;/ Maintain correct posture when sitting, standing and walking;/ Perform exercises that increase the flexibility of your spine and strengthen your muscles to improve your mobility and reduce muscle tension.;/ Roberto Basile Júnior et al., Spinal injuries in sports, Rev Bras Ortop, Vol. 34, No. 2, February, 1999 Spine-health.com, 2012 American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 2013 North American Spine Society Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, Jan 2013 Inês Campos et al., Low back pain in sport.

Abdominal pain in children,
Sciatica pain,"//What is it?// Sciatica pain corresponds to the presence of pain, weakness, numbness or tingling in one leg. It is not a disease but rather a symptom of an underlying medical condition. Sciatica involves pain, tingling, weakness or numbness that originates in the lower back, travels down the gluteal region to the back of the leg, following the path of the sciatic nerve. This is the longest nerve in the body and runs from the lumbar region of the spinal cord to the back of each leg, then branches out to the foot. Sciatica results from compression or irritation of this nerve and therefore follows its course. Its frequency varies, according to studies, between 1.6% and 43% of the populations evaluated. It is more common in middle age, rarely occurring before the age of 20. In general, the evolution is favorable but in around 30%, the symptoms last a year or more. Most cases result from a herniated intervertebral disc that compresses a nerve root. Other possible causes include narrowing of the canal surrounding the spinal cord, and tumors or cysts that compress the nerve roots. //Symptoms// Symptoms can vary depending on the type, location and severity of the condition causing the sciatic pain. It is usually intense and sharp and occurs only in one buttock or leg, although rarely it can affect both sides. Sitting tends to aggravate the pain, which is accompanied by a burning or tingling sensation. On the contrary, there is improvement when lying down or while walking, but when it is very intense, it can make it difficult to stand or walk. Coughing or sneezing can accentuate the pain. This can affect the lumbar region of the spine, although it is more intense in the leg. The presence of weakness or a feeling of numbness can make it difficult to move the leg or foot. This pain can be inconstant or permanent, becoming, in this case, disabling.  In most cases, there is improvement after a few weeks or months, just using painkillers. If the symptoms are very severe or disabling, surgery may be necessary. Although the symptoms of sciatica can be very disabling, permanent and irreversible nerve damage is rare. //Causes// When the jelly-like contents of a disc leak out, it compresses the nerve roots that make up the sciatic nerve. These roots become inflamed and irritated by chemicals released from the disc nucleus. Pain results from compression of the sciatic nerve, which can occur from outside or inside the canal where the spinal cord passes through. This constriction can be caused by a herniated disc (the most common cause), a muscle contracture around the sciatic nerve, a pinching of the canal where the spinal cord passes through, or a misalignment of a vertebra. Often, a specific event or trauma does not immediately trigger sciatic pain; it only develops later. Runners can be affected by this injury due to the nature of running, which creates a compressive force on the spine that is about four times its weight. This phenomenon causes degenerative changes in the spine, such as narrowing of the canal, joint changes or herniation of a disc. //Diagnosis// In addition to the clinical history and careful medical observation, the diagnosis of sciatica is based on imaging methods, such as magnetic resonance imaging. Other neurological examinations may be important to assess the condition of the sciatic nerve. Most cases of sciatica correspond to compression of the nerve roots of the fifth lumbar vertebra (L5) or the first of the sacral spine (S1). //Treatment// Since it is a symptom, treatment consists of resolving its causes. For most people, treatment is conservative, with surgery reserved for the most severe cases. Around 80% to 90% of cases can be resolved without surgery and around half of the attacks last less than six weeks. Properly planned exercise and heat or cold to relieve pain and spasm are good non-medical options. Physiotherapy can also be effective. Although rest is important, some level of activity should be maintained, as movement helps reduce inflammation. Anti-inflammatory medications and muscle relaxants help reduce pain and inflammation. However, they can have side effects and should always be prescribed by a doctor based on each patient's medical history. In cases of very intense pain, a corticosteroid injection may be given in the epidural region to reduce inflammation more quickly. There are also several other types of alternative treatments such as spinal manipulation by a chiropractor, acupuncture, cognitive behavioral therapy or osteopathy. In general, most cases of sciatica resolve within a period of between four and twelve weeks. After relieving the acute pain, the patient must enter a rehabilitation program to improve various aspects of the vicious posture, which is often aggravated by pain, thus preventing other crises from occurring. Ergonomic assessment of the workplace as well as lifestyle assessment can also contribute to reducing the frequency of recurrent sciatic and low back pain attacks. Surgery is only indicated when the pain is so intense that it becomes disabling, compromises the bladder and anal sphincter, impairs muscle strength, does not improve after six to 12 weeks and aims to correct the cause of compression of the sciatic nerve. As disc herniation is its most common origin, removal of the intervertebral disc that causes this constriction is the most frequently performed intervention, allowing symptomatic relief in 90% to 95% of patients. After surgery, it is important to avoid driving, sitting for long periods, lifting weights or bending your torso for about a month. Exercises to extend the spine may be recommended. However, in around 5% of cases, a new disc rupture may occur, and after five years, studies indicate the return of back pain in a high percentage of cases. //Prevention// Although the degenerative processes that lead to herniated discs cannot be avoided, there are some measures that help protect the spine. It is important to adopt correct techniques when lifting weights, keeping your back straight. Correct posture at all times is important to help reduce pressure on the spine. Physical exercise strengthens the back and abdominal muscles, and also has beneficial effects. You should not sit for long periods of time. Finally, tobacco should be avoided as it accelerates the degeneration of the intervertebral discs.

Headache in children,
Heart pain in children,
Regional door from also,"//What is it?// Compared to other areas of the body, the hip joint is a model of endurance. In fact, it takes considerable force to injure a healthy hip because the large muscles of the thigh, lower back and glutes are subjected to such intense stress. Even so, sports-related injuries can occur. Hip injuries are quite common, accounting for approximately 5% to 6% of musculoskeletal complaints in adults and approximately 10% to 24% of complaints in children. This type of injury is more common in certain types of athletes, such as those involved in dancing, running and football, given the increased effort and extreme hip movements involved in these activities. Regional hip pain is a complex problem that can be related to the lumbar spine and the gluteal region, often radiating to the groin region. //Symptoms// Regional hip pain is a common complaint that affects the hip or the structures surrounding the hip and can be associated with a number of problems. More precise location of the pain can provide very useful information for identifying the underlying cause. Generally speaking, problems with the hip joint cause pain in the inner region of the joint or in the groin. When the pain is located in the outer region of the hip, upper thigh or buttocks, the cause tends to be in the muscles, ligaments, tendons or soft tissues surrounding the hip joint. Sometimes regional hip pain can be caused by conditions that originate in other areas of the body, such as the lumbar spine or knees. Occasionally other symptoms appear, such as weight loss, night sweats, fever, abdominal or genitourinary complaints and, in these cases, the underlying disease may have a different origin. //Causes// The main risk factors for hip injuries in sport are a poor warm-up and too rapid an increase in training pace. Almost always, the cause of regional hip pain in the sporting context is a traumatic event, such as a fall or violent impact. Injury can also result from extensive, repeated movement. Regional hip pain in athletes can involve several diagnoses that vary with age. In young people and adolescents, injuries to the extremities are more common due to the lack of ossification in the growth plates, and synovitis. Tendinitis and bursitis occur in older athletes, such as trochanteritis already discussed. Here is a list of some of the conditions that can cause regional hip pain: Arthritis (rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, septic arthritis);/ Injuries (bursitis, dislocations, hip or pelvic fracture, tendonitis);/ Pinched nerves (herniated disc, sacroiliitis, sciatica, spinal canal tightness);/ Cancer (bone metastases from other tumors, leukemias);/ Other problems (avascular necrosis, Legg-Calve-Perthes disease, osteomalacia, osteomyelitis, osteoporosis, Paget's disease of bone, synovitis);/ Fractures are one of the most common and serious causes of regional hip pain. These fractures are more common in older people, given the presence of osteoporosis, which makes the bones more fragile. This type of fracture significantly affects quality of life. In fact, less than 50% of people with a femoral neck fracture are able to return to their previous levels of activity. //Diagnosis// Medical examination allows you to identify the cause of regional hip pain and radiographic studies complement this information. This medical examination is largely based on clinical history, the patient's age and a set of tests that seek to identify the origin of the pain. The medical examination is based on observation, palpation and specific tests of muscle and joint strength and mobility. Radiological examinations, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging provide additional information, and laboratory studies are sometimes useful to exclude other diagnoses. //Treatment// Considering the vast number of illnesses and injuries that can be associated with regional hip pain, it is not possible to review all treatments here as they will depend on each diagnosis. As important aspects, it is worth mentioning the need for a medical consultation whenever complaints persist in order to make a correct and early diagnosis. //Prevention// It is always advisable to avoid activities that aggravate the pain and to use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, under medical supervision. Using a pillow between your legs at night can help reduce pain. When it comes to physical exercise and sport, it is essential to never forget to warm up and cool down properly before and after exercise. The hip muscles must be properly stretched and warmed up. You should avoid running on surfaces that slope downwards. In these cases, it is better to walk. Flat, soft surfaces are also ideal for running. Cycling or swimming are better than running for preventing hip pain. It is not necessary to stop exercising, but it may be important to reduce this activity. Losing excess weight reduces the strain on your hips and wearing appropriate footwear is essential. It is also worth highlighting the importance of adequate nutrition, with emphasis on calcium and vitamin D.

Sore throats in children,
Drepanocitose,"//What is it?// Also called sickle cell anemia, it is a disease that affects red blood cells. Under normal conditions, these cells are rounded and their function is to transport oxygen from the lungs to the tissues and carbon dioxide from them to the lungs. In this pathology, red blood cells are shaped like a waning moon or sickle and, therefore, are unable to transport oxygen adequately, are less deformable and tend to obstruct blood vessels, last less time and their premature destruction causes anemia, jaundice, paleness and painful crises that require hospitalization. This is a hereditary disease, more common in black people, although it can also affect Caucasians. It is a genetic disorder, but for a child to be affected, they must inherit the gene from both their parents (autosomal recessive transmission). When only one parent transmits it, there are no symptoms, although the gene can be passed on to the next generation. //Diagnosis// Due to the inability of red blood cells to deform and move through small blood vessels, they cause capillary occlusion that can affect several organs. Some of the symptoms are a feeling of coldness inside, shortness of breath and a feeling of thirst. Painful crises are caused by the trapping of red blood cells and the obstruction of capillaries, and can occur in any part of the body (muscles, bones, abdomen, chest). The pain can be moderate or severe. In these cases, painkillers may not be enough and it may be necessary to go to hospital for more intensive treatment. Anemia and fatigue also occur, given the shorter lifespan of red blood cells, with consequent less oxygen transport to the tissues; in children, swelling of the hands and feet may occur, associated with blockage of circulation in the extremities; increase in the number of infections, due to damage to the spleen, an essential organ in the defense against infections; growth retardation, due to lack of oxygen and nutrients; visual changes, caused by blockage of retinal circulation. The circulatory problems that characterize this disease can be associated with complications such as stroke, angina pectoris, pulmonary hypertension, organ damage, blindness, skin ulcers and the formation of gallbladder stones. //Causes// Sickness sickness is a hereditary disease caused by a mutation in hemoglobin, which alters the shape of red blood cells. Some of the factors that can lead to this deformation are low oxygen or fluid levels in the tissues, dehydration, sudden changes in temperature, infections, excessive exertion and stress, closed and polluted environments, inadequate nutrition and long periods of fasting. //Diagnosis// The diagnosis is essentially laboratory-based, and it is possible to investigate the presence of an abnormal form of hemoglobin and the presence of atypical red blood cells in a blood sample. On the other hand, the analyses of these patients also reveal the presence of anemia. In addition to diagnosis, it is important to assess the risk of cardiovascular complications, using different technologies, such as ultrasound. //Treatment// A bone marrow transplant could potentially cure the disease. However, it is a complex procedure with significant risks and, for this reason, it is not performed routinely. The treatment of sickle cell disease aims to avoid painful crises, alleviate symptoms and prevent complications of the disease. Regular surveillance is important to measure red blood cell levels and assess the patient's general health status. Therapy may involve the use of painkillers, blood transfusions or, if necessary, oxygen support. The use of antibiotics and vaccines is important both in the prevention and treatment of infections, which are very common in this disease. Hydroxyurea reduces the frequency of painful crises and may reduce the need for blood transfusions. For sickle cell disease there are a series of experimental interventions, such as gene therapy and new medications, which can correct the genetic defect that is at its origin, in the first case, or improve circulation and oxygen transport to tissues, in the second. Taking folic acid supplements, maintaining a healthy diet, drinking plenty of fluids, exercising regularly but without excess are equally useful aspects. It is important to avoid extreme temperatures and to use over-the-counter medications, such as nasal vasoconstrictors, with caution, as they tend to further hinder blood circulation. If traveling to places located at high altitudes, it is important to consult your doctor in advance to determine the need for oxygen supplementation. //Prevention// Being a genetic disease, it cannot be prevented. Genetic counseling is important to check whether both members of a couple are carriers of this gene. Pregnancy in women with sickle cell disease is considered high risk, due to the greater possibility of crises during pregnancy and a high susceptibility to developing other diseases such as high blood pressure or kidney disease. In addition, hemorrhages may occur during childbirth.

Eco doppler,"//What is it?// Echo Doppler is a non-invasive test that allows estimating blood flow through blood vessels using ultrasounds that shine on blood cells.  Echo Doppler is useful in diagnosing the presence of blood clots, the functioning of the valves in the veins of the lower limbs, heart valves, congenital heart disease, arterial occlusions, peripheral arterial disease of the lower limbs, aneurysms or narrowing of arteries, such as those in the neck.  This test allows you to estimate the speed of blood flow. //Indications// Arterial vascular Doppler ultrasound is indicated for diagnosing and quantifying the process of atherosclerosis. The main manifestations of atherosclerosis in which vascular Doppler ultrasound is used are cerebrovascular disease, aortic diseases and peripheral arterial disease. In addition to atherosclerosis and its complications, such as thrombosis, arterial vascular Doppler ultrasound is also indicated for diagnosing other diseases, such as embolisms, aneurysms and congenital malformations. This type of Doppler ultrasound does not require fasting or other special care for its performance.  Carotid Doppler ultrasound is widely used to assess whether there is thickening of the inner lining of these arteries. This increase in thickness is an early sign of atherosclerosis and these patients are considered to be at higher risk for clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis, such as myocardial infarction and stroke.  Venous Doppler echo is indicated for the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis and also allows the evaluation of superficial veins and perforating veins, which connect superficial veins to deep veins), better studying cases of venous insufficiency. //Advantages and benefits// Eco Doppler has the advantage of being an alternative to more invasive examinations, such as arteriography or venography, which involve the injection of contrast substances and the use of X-rays. In Eco Doppler, no needles, injections or radiation are necessary. On the other hand, it is a widely available technology, easy to use and less expensive than other imaging studies. In the case of carotid echo doppler, the detection of a narrowing allows the implementation of treatment measures that can prevent a stroke. //Methodology// It is a non-invasive, painless examination that does not involve the use of radiation and has high applicability and reproducibility.  During the examination, the ultrasound probe is pressed against the skin in the area to be studied and moved from one location to another.  Initially, a gel is applied to the skin that allows for better obtaining of the desired information.

Echocardiogram,"//What is it?// An echocardiogram uses sound waves to produce images of the heart, allowing the doctor to see how the heart contracts and pumps blood.  The images obtained allow the identification of various anomalies of the heart and its valves.  Depending on the information that needs to be obtained, the echocardiogram can be performed in different ways. //Methodology// The echocardiogram can be performed via the transthoracic route, in which the probe that captures the images is placed directly on the patient's chest, or via the transesophageal route, in which the probe is inserted into the esophagus.  This technique is used when images obtained through the chest are not informative.  Transthoracic Echocardiogram In a transthoracic echocardiogram, a gel is placed on the patient's chest and the probe is firmly applied to the skin. The probe sends ultrasound waves toward the heart, and a translator records the echoes produced by the heart. These echoes are then converted into images using a computer.  Transesophageal Echocardiogram No special preparation is required for a conventional echocardiogram. In the case of a transesophageal echocardiogram, the patient should not eat for a few hours beforehand. Since this examination is performed under sedation, the patient should not drive in the hours following, so they should be accompanied.  Stress Echocardiogram It is also possible to perform an overload echocardiogram, identical to the stress electrocardiogram, in which the patient walks on a treadmill to be able to evaluate the behavior of the heart and valves during physical effort and, in some cases, contrast substances can be used. for additional information. Stress tests are useful because some heart diseases, such as angina pectoris, only manifest themselves under stress.  The doctor will choose the most appropriate test in each case. The echocardiogram takes, on average, less than an hour. //Advantages and benefits// Through this examination, it is possible to visualize the heart valves, the heart chambers and observe how it contracts. It is, therefore, a very dynamic examination.  Some of the information it provides is the size of the heart, the strength of its contraction, the presence of lesions in the heart muscle, lesions in the valves or heart defects.  This information allows us to diagnose many heart diseases and select the most appropriate treatment. //Indications// An echocardiogram is indicated whenever the presence of damage to the heart valves, the walls of the heart or changes in its ability to pump blood properly is suspected. It is also indicated for the diagnosis of congenital heart defects even before the baby is born.  The main indications are: Definition of the dimensions of the heart cavities and the thickness of their walls;/ Assessment of mitral, tricuspid, aortic and pulmonary valves;/ Assessment of systolic and diastolic function of the ventricles and their contractility;/ Analysis of the anatomy of the pericardium;/ Study of congenital heart diseases;/ Assessment of the aorta, pulmonary artery and vena cava;/ Investigation of the presence of intracardiac thrombi;/ Assessment of the presence of heart disease in patients at risk, such as those with high blood pressure or cardiac symptoms (shortness of breath, chest pain, angina, palpitations);/ Evaluation of competitive athletes to exclude some causes of sudden death in athletes;/ //Side effects// This is a relatively simple exam.  In the case of a transthoracic echocardiogram, some discomfort may be felt when the electrodes are removed from the chest.  In the case of a transesophageal echocardiogram, the throat may be sensitive for a few hours after the exam.  If the examination is performed under stress, changes in heart rhythm may occur, and more serious complications such as a myocardial infarction are very rare.

Ecoendoscopia bronquica,
Obstetric ultrasound,"//1st Quarter// This ultrasound confirms the gestation period with high reliability, by measuring the CCC (craniocaudal length), assessing the viability of the fetus and its heart rate, studying the basic anatomy (shape) of the fetus, biophysical screening for chromosomal anomalies (e.g. trisomy 21, 13, 18) and, through the evaluation of some ultrasound markers (nuchal translucency, nasal bones, venous duct, etc.) which, together with the biochemical examination (blood analysis), allows a risk calculation for chromosomal anomalies to be carried out with a detection rate of around 95%.  //2nd Quarter Morphological// At this stage, the fetus is the ideal size for a more accurate assessment of its anatomy, which is why the main objective of this examination is to detect congenital malformations. Fetal growth is also assessed by measuring the head circumference, abdominal circumference and femur length, as well as the amniotic fluid, placenta and umbilical cord. In most cases, the sex of the baby can be determined during this examination. //3rd Quarter// The main objective of this exam is to check the growth of the fetus and its well-being. The 3rd trimester examination must also include the study of fetal anatomy, considering that some fetal malformations can only be diagnosed at this point in pregnancy, while other structures are no longer easy to assess at this stage, given the size and posture of the fetus. Whenever there is reason to doubt the gestational age or it is impossible to calculate it, an Early Obstetric Ultrasound should be performed to date the pregnancy (generally before 10 weeks). This exam aims to: Exclusion of an extrauterine pregnancy (ectopic pregnancy);/ Confirmation of gestation time,;/ Verification of the number of fetuses present and their viability.;/ In most cases, this ultrasound is performed vaginally, given the better image quality obtained this way. 3D and 4D Obstetric Ultrasound allow you to observe the baby in three dimensions (3D) and in real time (4D). They can be performed at any stage of pregnancy, although it is more common to perform them from 26-28 weeks onwards, due to the realism of the images obtained. Note that it is not always possible to obtain images of the fetal face, which is limited to the position of the fetus, amount of amniotic fluid and maternal obesity. These are optional exams and never substitutes for the previous ones and are sometimes important as documentation of morphological changes. In certain situations, it may be necessary to perform more ultrasounds during the pregnancy, particularly in cases of diagnosed fetal anomaly, maternal pathology (Diabetes, Hypertension, etc.), changes in fetal growth or in the amount of amniotic fluid. Obstetric ultrasound is a useful and essential complementary diagnostic test for monitoring all pregnant women. It is used to monitor the progress of the pregnancy, ensure good fetal development and detect any abnormalities in the fetus. Other complementary diagnostic tests may be necessary to clarify suspected/detected clinical situations (amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling, fetal echocardiogram, fetal magnetic resonance imaging, etc.). Despite technical improvements and constant training of doctors, this examination does not guarantee 100% certainty, as there are inherent limitations that may lead to the non-detection of an anomaly or the suspicion of a non-existent anomaly. These limitations include, among others: the position of the fetus, the amount of amniotic fluid, and maternal obesity. //Exams// Load more;/ Erythema infectiosum, caused by parvovirus B19, is a common disease in children, with mild symptoms.

Varicose vein ecotherapy sonovein,"//What is SONOVEIN?// SONOVEIN is a robotic medical device designed for the non-invasive treatment of truncal varicose veins, using high-intensity ultrasound (HIFU) (therapeutic ultrasound) that allows blood vessels to coagulate outside the body.  //How does it work?// SONOVEIN ecotherapy uses ultrasound waves identical to those used in a normal ultrasound device but with higher energy waves. This energy is transmitted in the form of thermal energy at the level of the vein, causing retraction and sealing of the vessel. This technology is similar to using sunlight on an eye lens to create a hole in a leaf. The main advantage of this technique is that these ultrasound beams can pass through the skin without causing damage to the surrounding tissues, which allows for greater precision in the treatment. The result is seen on the screen, allowing immediate evaluation of the results.  //Methodology// The patient lies on a table with the lower limbs elevated, and the doctor places an armed arm at the lower limb level that applies a beam of heat responsible for thermally sealing the vein.;/ Pulse by pulse, a segment of vein the size of a grain of rice, is treated by “slices”;/ In each treatment cycle, the treated venous segment is burned at 85-90º;/ As the energy is administered from outside the body, there is no need for cuts, insertion of catheters or chemicals and therefore there is no scarring or risk of infection. In some patients, it is necessary to add a small amount of local anesthesia due to intolerance to the thermal beam.  //Indications// Varicose veins of the lower limbs – large and small saphenous and perforating veins;/ An evaluation consultation is necessary. The treatment is indicated for truncal varicose veins and is appropriate for people who are afraid of surgery.  //Advantages and Benefits// No cuts;/ No incisions;/ Immediate return to daily activities;/ Does not require anesthesia or pre-operative consultation;/ No need to stop anticoagulant drugs;/ No age limit;/ No hospitalization;/ Without Operating Room;/ High applicability:Allows the treatment of tortuous veinsAllows the treatment of patients with ulcers;/ Allows the treatment of tortuous veins;/ Allows the treatment of patients with ulcers;/  //Contraindications// Patients with thrombosis in the veins to be treated and/or deep vein thrombosis;/ Patients without indication:Deep vein thrombosis / phlebitisSuperficial varicose veinsReticular varicose veins and effusions;/ Deep vein thrombosis / phlebitis;/ Superficial varicose veins;/ Reticular strokes and varicose veins;/ About us;/ Events;/ Clients and Companions;/ News;/ CUF Academic Center;/ Partnerships;/ Contacts;/ Frequently Asked Questions;/ Join us;/ Virtual Visit;/ English version;/ My CUF;/ Access Solutions and Health Plans;/ Facebook;/ Facebook Instagram;/ Instagram LinkedInCreated with Sketch.;/ LinkedIn Youtube;/ Youtube award4;/ award4 certification1;/ certification1 certification2;/ certification2 certification3;/ certification3 Complaints and compliments;/ Complaints and compliments Privacy and Cookies Policy;/ Terms and Conditions;/ Whistleblower Channel;/ © CUF 2024 All rights reserved Start;/ Health A-Z: Diseases, Symptoms and Treatments;/"

Eczema,"//What is it?// Eczema is a problem that affects the skin and can manifest itself in two different ways: atopic eczema or allergic contact eczema. Eczema or atopic dermatitis manifests itself as areas of the skin with inflamed, red, scaly and rough patches, with itching. Sometimes blisters or bleeding lesions may also appear. It can appear in children and then disappear, but sometimes it remains throughout adulthood. //Symptoms// //How does atopic eczema manifest?// Itching associated with signs such as redness, exudation, dryness and peeling of the skin and, in more prolonged situations, scars caused by persistent itching.;/ When the lesions appear in certain locations, varying according to the age group: in younger children, on the head and on the extensor surfaces of the limbs; in young people and adults on the flexor surfaces (behind the knees and in front of the elbows) and also on the eyelids and in the perilabial region.;/ Link to other allergic diseases, namely asthma and/or allergic rhinitis.;/ Family history of allergic diseases.;/  //How does allergic contact eczema manifest itself?// When there is contact, repetitive or for long periods of time: From the skin with an allergen. Among the most common are metals (nickel, chromium, cobalt), cosmetics, medicines, rubbers and glues, among others.;/ The skin shows redness, vesicles with exudation and itching at the site, and this reaction can extend to other parts of the body and persist for more than a week.;/ The skin appears dry, cracked, scaly and hardened.;/ //Causes//  //What causes atopic eczema?// It is not known for sure what causes it, but there appears to be a genetic factor, with a familial predominance.;/ Around half of children with this pathology are also more prone to other atopic pathologies, such as hay fever or asthma.;/ Atopic dermatitis may indicate an increased risk of food allergies, such as to peanuts, for example.;/ Living in cold or heavily polluted places appears to promote eczema.;/  //What  are the causes of allergic contact eczema?// It results from the reaction to allergens that come into contact with the skin. In susceptible people, these cause itching, redness, and sometimes vesicles or blisters. To discover its cause, it is necessary to carry out epicutaneous tests or contact tests. //Diagnosis// It is generally done through contact tests. These tests use a technique in which small amounts of allergens are applied to the skin on adhesive strips and then removed after 48 or 72 hours. A positive reaction consists of a red, itchy spot at the site of contact with the allergen. //Treatment// Mild eczema usually responds to corticosteroid creams and oral antihistamines prescribed by a dermatologist. More severe eczema may require treatment with oral or injectable corticosteroids, other anti-inflammatory drugs, and immunomodulatory agents. People with allergic contact eczema should: Avoid the allergen that causes the reaction and chemicals that cross-react with it.;/ Replace some products with others that do not cause reactions. Your dermatologist can recommend the most suitable ones.;/ //Prevention// In order to prevent eczema flare-ups you should: Establish a skin care and protection routine and follow your doctor's recommendations;/ Do not scratch the skin in areas that cause itching.;/ Wear gloves outdoors, especially in the winter months;/ Use mild soap when bathing and dry your skin instead of rubbing it.;/ Apply a moisturizer immediately two to three times a day;/ Take a bath with warm water, avoid very hot water;/ Stay hydrated by drinking water throughout the day - water helps maintain skin moisture;/ Prefer clothing made of cotton or other natural materials;/ Avoid extremes of temperature and humidity and limit exposure to known allergens;/ Manage stress, practice regular aerobic exercise, hobbies and meditation or yoga;/ These are common pathologies that affect the largest organ in our body: the skin. However, they have different causes, symptoms and treatments. Learn to distinguish eczema. Smoking, poor sleep, and excessive sun exposure are all enemies of healthy, youthful skin. But there are other mistakes you can avoid to prevent premature aging. It is common to find pine caterpillars in forests or parks. We must be aware of the dangers they pose to people and animals.

Vocal cord edema,"//What is it?// Vocal cord edema occurs in the non-muscular part of the vocal cord, called the vocal fold, just below the surface in an area called Reinke's space. Swelling in this area is called Reinke's edema. Edema occurs due to the accumulation of fluid or mucus in the vocal cords. In small volumes, it alters the quality of the voice, but in some cases it can even make breathing difficult. It is associated, in most cases, with acid reflux from the stomach, vocal abuse and smoking. //Symptoms// The voice becomes lower and hoarse; in severe cases, shortness of breath may occur. //Causes// It almost always occurs when tobacco consumption is maintained for a long time. Other causes may include: thyroid disease, hormonal changes, gastroesophageal reflux or excessive use of the voice. //Diagnosis// Diagnosis is made by observing the patient and assessing the change in voice; direct observation of the vocal cords by the doctor shows the inflamed area causing the symptoms. //Treatment// It is necessary to correct the triggering factors (acid reflux from the stomach, vocal abuse and smoking), carry out drug therapy, speech therapy; in serious situations it may be necessary to resort to surgical intervention. //Prevention// Stop or drastically reduce your cigarette, pipe and cigar smoking. There are smoking cessation programs that are especially helpful for those who have difficulty quitting.;/ Lifestyle changes minimize gastric reflux, as do medications that reduce stomach acid production.;/ Reduce both the frequency and duration of voice use and avoid episodes of vocal abuse.;/ Consult your doctor in situations where your tone of voice changes, such as unexplained or persistent hoarseness.;/ University of Pittsburgh The Voice Foundation Given the period we are living in and the request to stay at home, with our children collected and protected, we all have to play different roles.

Electrocardiogram ecg,"//What is it?// It is one of the most frequently used complementary non-invasive diagnostic tests to assess cardiac function.  An electrocardiogram is a test that detects the electrical activity of the heart. Each contraction of the heart muscle or heart valves is controlled by small electrical impulses generated in the heart itself. The ECG can identify the normal patterns of transmission and generation of these electrical impulses.  Therefore, the ECG is the most suitable test for evaluating cardiac arrhythmias and for the initial investigation of cardiac ischemia. //Advantages and benefits// The ECG is an important complementary test for interpreting heart rhythm and detecting heart ischemia.  The electrocardiogram is also of great value in the evaluation of other types of cardiac abnormalities, including heart valve disease, cardiomyopathy, pericarditis, and cardiac sequelae of high blood pressure.  Being a harmless and inexpensive examination, it is extremely useful for studying the heart. //Methodology// The resting electrocardiogram is performed with the patient lying down and with the torso bare.  Ideally, the patient should not have made any type of effort in the last 10 minutes, nor smoked in the 30 minutes before the exam. They should also avoid drinking cold water before the exam because it can alter the tracing obtained.  Six electrodes are fixed to the chest, using adhesives, and 4 more pads, also with electrodes, are placed on the wrists and ankles. Typically, a little gel is used between each electrode and the skin to increase electrical conduction.  In some cases, the 6 electrode patches attached to the chest are replaced by rubber pears with a metal base, which are attached to the skin using a vacuum, like suction cups.  After the electrodes are correctly placed, they are connected to the machine that will read the heart's electrical activity.  The test is very quick, lasting just a few seconds. The machine captures the heart's electrical signals and prints a trace on a special graph paper. //Indications// The most common indications for ECG are arrhythmias, congenital heart defects, heart valve problems, coronary disease, current or old acute myocardial infarction.  The electrocardiogram, because it is cheap and easily accessible, is the first test performed on patients who present with complaints of chest pain, fatigue, difficulty breathing, dizziness or other symptoms that may suggest heart disease.  The information provided by the exam is relatively reliable, but around 25% of patients with angina have a normal ECG. Changes resulting from angina on the ECG can be confused with changes caused by ventricular hypertrophy, conduction disturbances resulting from old heart attacks, etc.  The ECG is also useful for monitoring the evolution of a heart disease already confirmed by other diagnostic methods. //Care to be taken// A resting electrocardiogram does not pose any health risk.  Sometimes, a slight allergy may occur at the site of the adhesives.  If the patient has a lot of chest hair, it may be necessary to shave it so that the electrodes can be attached.

Pulmonary embolism,"//What is it?// Pulmonary embolism is the sudden obstruction of a pulmonary artery caused by an embolus. These cross the veins, the right heart chambers and the main pulmonary tree, originating from the veins of the lower limbs in 95% of cases. An embolus generally corresponds to a blood clot (thrombus), but there may also be emboli of fat, amniotic fluid, bone marrow, tumor fragments or an air bubble that travel through the bloodstream until it obstructs a vase. Their formation may begin in the right heart when there is atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, endocarditis or, rarely, myocardial contusion. Thrombi originating here are rare and are associated with a mortality rate of around 30%. In general, unobstructed arteries are able to send enough blood to the affected area of ​​the lung to prevent tissue death. In cases of obstruction of large blood vessels or when there is lung disease, the volume supplied may be insufficient to prevent tissue death. In these situations, which account for 10% of the total, pulmonary infarction occurs. Damage is minimized when the body quickly breaks down small clots. Large clots take longer to break down and therefore cause greater damage. This is why they can cause sudden death. Venous thromboembolism is the most frequent embolic complication in the postoperative period, being rare in the pre- and intraoperative period. In the United States of America its prevalence is 600 thousand cases per year, although only 260 thousand receive treatment, because more than half of individuals do not present symptoms. The annual mortality from venous thromboembolism is estimated at between 50,000 and 100,000. In Portugal, between 2002 and 2006, an increasing incidence was found from 3.1 to 3.6 occurrences per thousand patients hospitalized annually. Mortality associated with pulmonary embolism ranged between 26% and 23.4%. //Symptoms// Small emboli do not cause symptoms, but most cause difficulty breathing. This may be the only sign if it does not progress to a heart attack. Some of the symptoms include rapid breathing, anxiety, agitation, sharp chest pain, especially during deep breathing (which may radiate to the shoulder, arm, neck or jaw), increased heart rate, nausea, fainting or seizures that result from a sudden decrease in the heart's ability to supply enough oxygenated blood to the brain and other organs, and an irregular heart rhythm. People with occlusion of one or more of the large pulmonary vessels may have bluish skin (cyanosis) and sudden death may occur. Pulmonary infarction causes coughing, blood-streaked sputum, sharp chest pain when breathing, and fever. Symptoms appear within hours. Signs of pulmonary embolism usually develop suddenly. The risk of death depends on the size of the embolus, the size and number of obstructed pulmonary arteries, and the patient's health status. In people with recurrent episodes of small pulmonary emboli, signs such as chronic shortness of breath, swelling of the ankles or legs, and weakness tend to develop progressively over weeks, months, or years. Approximately 50% of people with untreated pulmonary embolism will have another episode in the future, and about half of these relapses can be fatal. Treatment with drugs that inhibit clotting (anticoagulants) can significantly reduce the frequency of relapses. //Causes// The most common type of embolus is a thrombus that is produced in a vein in the leg or pelvis. These clots tend to form when blood circulates slowly or stagnates, as happens when someone remains in the same position for a long time. When the person resumes movement, the clot may break away. More rarely, they form in the veins of the arms or on the right side of the heart. When a clot from a vein breaks off and passes into the bloodstream, it usually moves to the lungs. There are factors that increase the predisposition to blood clotting in the veins, such as: surgery, especially if extensive and time-consuming; invasive medical procedures; prolonged bed rest or inactivity (sitting for a long time, traveling by plane, among others); stroke and myocardial infarction; obesity; fracture of the pelvis or leg; and increased tendency of the blood to clot (certain forms of cancer, use of oral contraceptives, hereditary deficiency of a blood clotting inhibitor). The risk of pulmonary embolism is also higher in patients over 40 years of age; hospital stay for more than six days; in situations of immobility; and in associated diseases (previous thromboembolic accident, malignant diseases, obesity, and heart and venous failure of the lower limbs). //Diagnosis// The medical examination is very important and should be complemented by an electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, more specific laboratory tests such as D-dimer measurement, computed axial tomography with contrast administration, Doppler ultrasound study of the veins of the lower limbs, and pulmonary scintigraphy or angiography. //Treatment// The treatment of pulmonary embolism encompasses two essential aspects: acute cardiovascular and ventilatory support, and definitive treatment. Hemodynamic and ventilatory cardiovascular support is essentially a symptomatic therapy, involving ventilation and cardiovascular support measures. As a rule, initial treatment involves the administration of oxygen and, if necessary, painkillers. Definitive treatment involves anticoagulants, such as heparin, which are administered to prevent existing blood clots from increasing in size and to prevent new ones from forming. Heparin is administered intravenously to obtain a quick effect, and the dose must be carefully regulated. Warfarin is then administered, which also inhibits clotting but takes more time to act. The duration of anticoagulant treatment depends on the patient's situation. He should have periodic blood tests throughout the duration of warfarin therapy to determine whether the dose should be modified. When the severity of the clinical condition is greater and there is a risk to life, there are two other forms of treatment: thrombolytic therapy and surgery. Thrombolytic drugs (substances that dissolve the clot) such as streptokinase, urokinase or tissue plasminogen activator can be effective. The surgery consists of removing the embolus from the pulmonary artery and can save the patient's life. //Prevention// There are several ways to prevent blood clots from forming in the veins of people at risk of pulmonary embolism. For post-operative patients, especially those of older age, it is recommended that they wear compression stockings, do leg exercises, and start getting up and doing physical activity as soon as possible. Heparin (an anticoagulant) is the most widely used treatment after surgery to reduce the chances of clots forming in the calf veins. It is injected in low doses, under the skin, immediately before the intervention and for the following seven days. Not all patients can be treated with heparin, and medical prescription is mandatory. Dextran, which is administered intravenously, also helps prevent clots but, like heparin, can cause bleeding. Warfarin is administered orally in some surgical interventions with a greater risk of clot formation, such as the placement of a hip prosthesis. When emboli recur despite all preventive treatments or if anticoagulants cause significant bleeding, a filter can be placed, through surgery, at the level of the vena cava that collects circulation from the lower part of the body. It prevents clots from reaching the pulmonary artery. João F.

Encephalitis,"//What is it?// It corresponds to irritation and swelling (inflammation) of the brain, almost always caused by an infection. This is a rare condition, most common in the first year of life, and its incidence decreases with age. However, the most severe forms occur in young people and the elderly. //Symptoms// Sometimes, symptoms are preceded by complaints of a cold or gastroenteritis. When encephalitis is not very serious, the signs are similar to those of other diseases: mild fever, moderate headache, fatigue and loss of appetite. Confusion, imbalance, disorientation, irritability, sensitivity to light, stiff neck and neck, and vomiting may also occur. In newborns and children, it may be more difficult to recognize the clinical picture, which tends to be characterized by body rigidity, irritability, frequent crying (which increases when the baby is held), poor feeding, more prominent fontanelles, and vomiting. Encephalitis should be considered an emergency when there is loss of consciousness, lack of response to stimuli or coma, muscle weakness or paralysis, convulsions, severe headaches and sudden change in mental state (indifference, memory loss, loss of judgment). The prognosis is variable. Some cases resolve quickly and without sequelae. However, encephalitis can be serious, causing permanent problems or even death. The acute phase usually lasts one to two weeks, after which the fever and other symptoms gradually disappear. Some people may take months to fully recover. When brain injury occurs, it can affect hearing, memory, muscle control, sensation, speech or vision. //Causes// The most common causes of encephalitis are viral infections. Exposure to the virus can occur through breathing (particles emitted by an infected person), contaminated water or food, mosquito (or other insect) bites and direct skin contact. Encephalitis can also be caused by an allergic reaction to a vaccination, autoimmune diseases, infections with bacteria, fungi or parasites, or be a consequence of cancer. It causes swelling of tissues, with destruction of nerve cells, hemorrhage and, sometimes, brain damage. The viruses responsible vary by geographic location and season. Encephalitis caused by the herpes simplex virus is the most common for all ages, including newborns. Routine vaccination has significantly reduced this disease caused by other viruses, such as those associated with rabies, polio, mumps, measles or chickenpox. //Diagnosis// A medical examination is essential, revealing many of the signs mentioned. It is important to carry out imaging studies (MRI, CT scan), collection of cerebrospinal fluid by lumbar puncture, blood and urine tests, electroencephalogram and laboratory tests to search for viral agents. //Treatment// Treatment should provide medical support (rest, nutrition, and fluids) to help the body fight the infection and alleviate symptoms. Medications may include antivirals, antibiotics, anticonvulsants, corticosteroids (to reduce brain swelling), sedatives, analgesics and antipyretics. In case of brain injury, physical therapy and/or speech therapy are necessary to improve lost functions and increase quality of life. //Prevention// Children and adults should avoid contact with encephalitis patients. In areas where the infection is transmitted by mosquitoes, they must be properly controlled (use of repellents and nets, removal of sources of standing water, clothing that adequately covers the body). Compliance with the vaccination schedule is important and, if traveling to potentially dangerous areas, the recommended vaccines must be administered at the traveler's appointment.

Endocarditis,"//What is it?// It is an infection of the inner lining of the heart (endocardium). Endocarditis generally occurs when a bacteria or microorganism from another part of the body (such as the oral cavity) spreads through the bloodstream and adheres to damaged areas of the endocardium. If left untreated, it can damage or destroy the heart valves and cause potentially fatal complications. The characteristic lesion of endocarditis is an infected clot made up of platelets and fibrin and containing other cells. This can be located anywhere on the endothelium, but frequently occurs on the surfaces of heart valves and valve prostheses, in the case of operated patients. Endocarditis is rare in normal hearts, so people at risk are those with diseased heart valves, artificial valves (after surgery) or other types of heart anomalies. Despite the severity of infective endocarditis (its in-hospital mortality varies between 10% and 26%), the disease is rare, with an incidence of three to 10 episodes per 100,000 patients annually. //Symptoms// It can manifest gradually or suddenly, depending on the agent and the pre-existing heart disease. The most common signs are fever, night sweats, chills, changes in cardiac auscultation, fatigue, joint and/or muscle pain, difficulty breathing, paleness, persistent cough, weight loss, blood in the urine, pain in the spleen region (on the left side of the stomach), small red spots on the skin (petechiae), red and sensitive subcutaneous nodules on the fingers. If left undiagnosed and untreated, it can cause complications such as damage and infections to other organs, stroke, heart failure or death. //Causes// Endocarditis occurs when a microorganism enters the bloodstream and lodges in previously damaged heart valves or the endocardium. The most common microorganisms are bacteria, but it can also be caused by fungi. Its entry into circulation can occur after brushing your teeth or during a meal, especially if your gums are not healthy. For the same reason, some oral health procedures may be the cause. Skin diseases, sexually transmitted diseases or inflammatory bowel diseases can also be the starting point for endocarditis. The use of catheters or needles during medical interventions, tattoos or piercings also creates an opportunity for these microorganisms to enter circulation, as does the sharing of syringes and needles. The immune system usually destroys these microorganisms, and they often pass through the heart without attaching themselves or causing disease. However, the presence of a heart valve or other damaged heart tissue creates an ideal rough surface for microorganisms to attach themselves, multiply, and cause disease. Risk factors include the presence of artificial heart valves (especially in the first year after their implantation), congenital heart disease, previous episodes of endocarditis, rheumatic fever (causes damage to the valves), and intravenous drug use (due to sharing contaminated needles). //Diagnosis// Clinical suspicion is possible based on the history and medical examination. In this context, auscultation is very useful. Endocarditis can mimic other diseases and, therefore, more precise tests are necessary, including blood tests, echocardiography, electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. //Treatment// First-line treatment is antibiotics. If the heart valves are severely damaged, surgery may be necessary. Antibiotics should be administered intravenously in a hospital setting and should be selected based on the results of laboratory tests. As a rule, this therapy lasts between four and six weeks and, after clinical stabilization, can be continued on an outpatient basis. //Prevention// Prevention involves adequate oral hygiene, avoiding skin infections caused by tattoos or piercings, whenever there is previous heart damage, taking prophylaxis with antibiotics before any oral intervention or other interventions involving the airways, skin or deeper tissues. Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, Agosto 2011 Ana Santos Ferreira, Infectious endocarditis – an ever-present suspicion, Rev Port Med Geral Fam 2013;29:54-60 Prophylaxis of Bacterial Endocarditis in Pediatrics, General Directorate of Health, December 2012 The Johns Hopkins University, 2013 Duarte Cacela and Rúben Ramos, CUF cardiologists, explain the advantages of using custom prostheses in the treatment of tricuspid heart failure.

Endometriosis,"//What is it?// The endometrium is one of the layers that makes up the uterus and corresponds to its internal lining. During the menstrual cycle, it is cyclically regenerated through a process of desquamation. This corresponds to menstruation and allows the renewal of all tissue elements. Endometriosis is the name given to the clinical process in which the cells that make up the endometrium are found outside their normal location, for example in the pelvic peritoneum, ovaries, bladder, appendix, intestines or even the diaphragm. In addition to these forms, which manifest in the abdominal cavity, endometriosis can, although more rarely, affect more distant organs, such as the lungs, nose or skin. The prevalence of endometriosis is approximately 10% in the population of reproductive age. In women with infertility, this prevalence increases to approximately 25% to 45%. //Symptoms// In 80% of cases, pain is the main manifestation. In 20% of cases, it is associated with infertility and may also be, although more rarely, asymptomatic. Endometriosis pain is very debilitating and has a strong impact on many aspects of a woman's life. Its presentation varies greatly and depends on the severity of the disease and the location of the endometriosis foci. This pain may occur during menstruation and initially subsides with treatment with anti-inflammatories or the pill. As it becomes more intense, it stops responding to treatment. In other cases, the pain manifests itself during sexual intercourse (dyspareunia). Depending on its location, the pain varies: it may occur in the pelvic region or may appear as intestinal cramps, especially during menstruation, associated with diarrhea or, more rarely, constipation. If it affects the bladder, the pain occurs during urination, and there may be blood loss in the urine (hematuria). Rectal bleeding (rectorrhage) occurs when endometriosis invades the rectal mucosa. If it is present in the ureters, irreversible kidney failure may occur. Many women also report heavy menstruation. It is important to note that when left undiagnosed and untreated, it tends to progress and invade other tissues. On the other hand, there appears to be a correlation between this pathology and clear cell carcinoma of the ovary, which reinforces the need for early diagnosis and treatment. Infertility is another of its manifestations and results from the invasion and occlusion of the fallopian tubes by endometrial tissue. //Causes// The origin of endometriosis is still not fully known and is therefore a matter of controversy. Retrograde menstruation through the tubes, a normal phenomenon in many women, can facilitate the implantation of endometrial tissue in the pelvic region and, therefore, is one of the accepted mechanisms for the development of the disease. On the other hand, the influence of genetic, hormonal (high levels of estrogen), racial (higher risk in Caucasian women), environmental (toxic substances, such as dioxins) or social (stress) factors is also possible. //Diagnosis// Clinical history and medical examination are important in the diagnosis, but in the absence of endometriomas (localized lesions of endometriosis), there are few non-invasive diagnostic methods capable of detecting the disease. Of these, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging are the most effective. Depending on the complaints and their location, it may be necessary to perform a cystoscopy, rectosigmoidoscopy, a barium enema or a CT scan. However, the ideal method is laparoscopy. Only through this technique can a complete diagnosis be obtained. //Treatment// Since it is not possible to cure endometriosis, treatment should be aimed at relieving pain and other symptoms, increasing the chances of pregnancy and reducing the number of foci. Surgical treatment consists of removing the foci by laparoscopy. Whenever possible, attempts are made to eliminate only these spots. If this is not possible, as is the case with more extensive forms of endometriosis, surgery will involve excision of the affected pelvic organs. In some cases, it is possible to resort to laparoscopic treatment, with a laser. Regarding medical treatment, it consists of controlling pain through the use of analgesics, anti-inflammatories or hormonal therapy. //Prevention// It is not possible to prevent the development of endometriosis, but this possibility can be reduced by reducing estrogen levels in the body. In this sense, it is important to choose the most appropriate method of contraception for each woman, practice physical exercise regularly, in order to reduce fat mass (source of estrogen) and avoid excessive consumption of alcohol and caffeine. Endometriosis Association, 2013 Office on Women's Health, 2014 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, abril 2013 Abnormal uterine bleeding can occur at any age, but it requires proper evaluation and treatment due to the risk of anemia and other complications.

Myocardial infarction,"//What is it?// Myocardial infarction is the name also given to a “heart attack”. It occurs when one or more arteries that supply the heart become blocked and this organ does not receive blood and oxygen in the quantities it needs. Under these conditions, cells in the affected area die. A myocardial infarction is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment. Most myocardial infarctions are caused by clots, which in turn result from the process of atherosclerosis, which involves narrowing and stiffness of the arteries. The presence of high levels of triglycerides and LDL cholesterol leads to the formation of plaques within the arteries, reducing blood flow. In the last two decades, there has been a significant reduction in the mortality rate from cardiovascular or circulatory system diseases in the Brazilian population. Even so, these pathologies are still the main cause of death in Portugal, and in all European countries. In 2011, the mortality rate from myocardial infarction in Portugal was 24.2 cases per 100 thousand inhabitants, with 4366 deaths. //Symptoms// Myocardial infarctions can manifest themselves in a variety of ways, sometimes quite misleading. The most common are a tight, heavy or pressure-like pain in the center of the chest. The pain tends to radiate to the back, left arm, jaw or neck. Breathing becomes irregular and rapid, as does the heart rate. Dizziness, weakness, nausea and vomiting, sweating and a feeling of panic occur. //Causes// Myocardial infarction results from the interruption of blood flow to the heart, resulting in the death of the non-irrigated tissue. The most common cause of this blockage is atherosclerosis. Factors such as high blood pressure, high levels of LDL cholesterol (the “bad” cholesterol), accumulation of the amino acid homocysteine, smoking, diabetes and chronic inflammation contribute to it. In other cases, blood flow to the heart is interrupted by a spasm in a coronary artery. The main risk factors are tobacco, a diet rich in fats, high levels of LDL cholesterol, lack of physical exercise, excess weight, family history of heart attack, diabetes, high blood pressure, stress and, in the case of women, menopause. //Diagnosis// When faced with symptoms suggestive of a myocardial infarction, it is essential to go to a hospital immediately. The more time passes, the smaller the chances of recovery. Diagnosis is based on clinical evaluation, electrocardiogram and blood tests. Additional tests may be requested, such as a chest x-ray, echocardiogram or cardiac catheterization. //Treatment// The aim is to re-establish the interrupted blood flow, in order to preserve the heart muscle and its function as much as possible. Nitroglycerin has a vasodilatory action and is useful while waiting for the emergency medical team to arrive. In the hospital, medications and/or techniques are used to unblock the clogged artery, such as angioplasty. In the hospital setting, some of the medications prescribed are aspirin, which helps prevent blood clotting, nitroglycerin, painkillers, thrombolytic agents, which dissolve clots and must be administered within the first two hours after the heart attack, and anticoagulants, such as heparin. In certain cases, surgery may be necessary. This includes catheterizations followed by angioplasty, which consists of dilation of the occluded artery with the placement of a structure (stent) that keeps it unobstructed, or a graft (bypass) that allows the occluded artery to be bypassed and reestablish blood flow. After discharge from hospital, important lifestyle changes (diet and exercise) are essential, as well as the use of medications that reduce the risk of new episodes. These medications include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, which dilate blood vessels, beta-blockers, which reduce heart rate and blood pressure, and statins, which help to lower cholesterol levels. Niacin or bile acid sequestrants, which help to reduce cholesterol, fibrates, which help to control triglyceride levels, and anticoagulants, which prevent the formation of clots, may also be useful. //Prevention// It is possible to reduce the risk of a heart attack by stopping smoking, doing aerobic exercise (walking, swimming, cycling) for at least 30 minutes a day, five days a week, reducing stress levels and adopting a healthy diet, low in saturated fats and rich in fruit, vegetables and cereals. Maintaining a healthy weight is also very important. If the patient has high blood pressure, diabetes or cholesterol, it is essential to treat and control these conditions as they tend to increase the risk of a heart attack.

Pulmonary emphysema,"//What is it?// Pulmonary emphysema is a pathology in which the small air sacs (alveoli) where gas exchanges occur during breathing are gradually destroyed, reducing the surface area available for these exchanges and, therefore, decreasing the amount of oxygen that is transported to the blood, which makes breathing difficult. //Symptoms// Generally, symptoms of emphysema develop between the ages of 40 and 60. It is a disease that may not cause any symptoms for years. The most common complaint is difficulty breathing, which sets in gradually. First after physical exertion and, in more advanced stages, even at rest. Breathing also becomes noisier and wheezing may occur. Nails and lips tend to acquire a bluish or grayish color, which reflects the difficulty in oxygenating the extremities of the body, and can cause difficulty in concentrating and an increase in heart rate, given the effort that the heart makes to try to compensate for the reduced oxygen transport. There is associated weight loss, although in more advanced stages, due to the inactivity that the disease requires, there may be an increase in weight.  In the absence of treatment, emphysema can be associated with a collapsed lung, respiratory infections or heart problems. //Causes// Pulmonary emphysema is one of the forms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and its main cause is tobacco. In fact, smoking constitutes a serious public health problem, being responsible for 90% of lung cancer cases, 86% of bronchitis and emphysema cases, 25% of heart ischemic processes and 30% of extrapulmonary cancers. According to the Portuguese Society of Pulmonology, in Portugal it is estimated that 5.42% of the population between 35 and 69 years old suffers from COPD. The pathology mainly affects men (because there are more who smoke) than women. Around 8.7 individuals die annually for every 100,000 inhabitants. Secondhand smoke is also a risk factor. There are other substances that can cause pulmonary emphysema, such as inhaling marijuana, environmental pollution, silica and tar dust and some industrial fumes. There is also a hereditary form of this disease, resulting from the absence of a protein that protects the elastic structures of the lungs. This type of emphysema is called alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. //Diagnosis// The medical specialty that diagnoses and treats pulmonary emphysema is Pulmonology. The exams normally used are a chest x-ray or a lung tomography, laboratory tests that evaluate the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood and lung function tests that determine the degree of impairment of the lungs of the patient with emphysema. //Treatment// There is no cure because the changes in the lung structure are irreversible. The goal is to alleviate symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. Treatment is always defined in a personalized way and may include medications that help reduce or stop tobacco consumption, bronchodilators that improve breathing or corticosteroid inhalers that allow easier breathing. In addition to medications, it may be necessary to resort to a pulmonary rehabilitation process, where breathing exercises are learned that improve patients' quality of life and nutritional strategies are defined to help reduce weight, whenever this is necessary. In more advanced forms, the use of oxygen at home, sometimes for 24 hours, may be relevant. Surgery is indicated in more severe cases and allows the removal of damaged lung tissue. A transplant is the last resort solution when other options have not been effective. These forms of treatment can and should be complemented by lifestyle changes that help stop the progression of the disease and prevent its complications. Of all, the most important is to stop smoking and also protect yourself from secondhand smoke, in addition to avoiding some paints, car exhaust, cooking odors, certain perfumes, scented candles and incense. It is also important to keep the air conditioning filters properly clean. //Prevention// Regular physical exercise is useful because it increases lung capacity. Cold air should be avoided, which causes bronchi spasm, worsening breathing difficulties, and special attention should be paid to respiratory infections. The doctor's role is important to indicate which vaccines are most useful in each case.

Knee sprain,"//What is it?// Knee sprains correspond to an injury to your ligaments.  Sprains range in severity from a slight strain to a complete tear of a ligament. Mild injuries cause pain and swelling. Moderate injuries are partial ligament tears and involve greater disability. Severe injuries are complete tears and require surgical repair.  Most sprains involve the internal lateral ligament, the anterior cruciate ligament, with injuries to the posterior cruciate ligament being rarer. //Causes// Sports that involve accelerations and decelerations, such as basketball, football, field hockey, skiing, are those most associated with knee sprains, mainly affecting the anterior cruciate ligament.  However, this type of injury can occur in any sport in which movement with acceleration and rotation of the knee occurs.  In football, the trauma occurs with the foot fixed to the ground, or attached to the opponent's leg, causing abnormal internal or external rotation of the femur in relation to the tibia. The ligaments and menisci are subjected to stress above that which can be tolerated, triggering a reflex with contraction of the thigh muscles, in an attempt to protect the joint.  When the energy of the trauma is greater than this defense mechanism, there is deformation and rupture of the structures involved. The result is muscle strains, ligament and meniscal strains and tears.  Sprains caused by someone squatting and rotating their knee in an abnormal way can also cause injury and, statistically, are more linked to meniscus injuries. It occurs, for example, when a climber moves his knee in an abnormal and sudden way to climb a rock.  Another mechanism of injury is sudden deceleration, classically when the individual kicks the air instead of the ball, or the opponent, in the case of fights. This is the most common form of isolated injury to the anterior cruciate ligament.  As mentioned, the ligament most affected in sprains is the internal lateral ligament. This ligament can be injured following a blow to the external surface of the knee, especially if the foot is well supported on the ground at the time of the blow. This blow forces the knee to move to the inside and stretches the ligament, causing pain on the inner side of the knee. In these cases, the knee appears to lose its strength and give way on the inside.  A sprain of the outer side of the knee, affecting the outer lateral ligament, is caused by a blow to the inner side of the knee, which forces the knee outward. This type of injury is rarer because a blow to the inside of the knee is less likely. //Symptoms// Disability can be almost immediate, caused by pain and swelling, sometimes appearing 1 to 4 hours after the trauma. However, the fact that it is almost immediate does not allow us to conclude that it is a serious injury.  Some patients report that the knee “gives in” and a popping sound can be heard that strongly suggests a tear in one of the menisci.  A rule to remember is the following: if the pain is on the same side as the impact, it should only be a bruise and the pain will tend to disappear quickly. If the pain appears on the side opposite to the impact, it is likely a more serious injury.  As a rule, if there is an injury, there is pain and muscle contracture and, often, this is greater in partial ligament ruptures, as there is greater activation of the pain receptors in the structures involved.  When there is instant swelling, in 80 to 90% of cases it is a rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament, associated or not with injury to other structures. This swelling results from bleeding within the joint (hemarthrosis). //Diagnosis// In the initial assessment, traditional treatment is instituted (ice, discharge, joint protection and analgesia) and the need for radiological examinations is discussed.  The existence of bone fractures sends the athlete to an orthopedic consultation.  The objective examination at 48-72 h with joint effusion and/or ligament instability requires the performance of a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). The presence of lesions with surgical indication has an orthopedic approach.  In the absence of instability, joint effusion or the absence of injuries with a very likely surgical indication on MRI, the athlete is indicated for Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation treatments.  On the 14th day, the athlete should be reassessed. Favorable clinical progress allows the athlete to move on to the rehabilitation phase with functional return.  The maintenance of complaints requires referral to an orthopedic doctor and possible diagnostic/therapy arthroscopy.  As described above, a sprain is very painful and can disable the individual from participating in sports. Until proven otherwise, a sprain followed or not by swelling is serious and sports should not be continued unless the patient is somewhere remote and must walk to get help.  Recourse to an orthopedic doctor must be immediate and must not be delayed in order to avoid a worsening of symptoms. //Treatment// To treat a knee sprain, the English ""PRICE"" concept is followed: Protection, Rest, Ice, Compression and Elevation. The knee should be immobilized in a slightly compressive manner.;/ Ice must be used, and it is advisable to use it every 4 hours for 20 minutes, without direct contact with the skin to avoid frostbite;/ Keep the affected limb elevated;/ The use of axillary crutches is important and the affected limb should not be stepped on.;/  Surgery should be used for moderate to severe injuries, depending on the work and sporting demands. It is also useful when pain occurs during daily activities, such as walking or simple twisting maneuvers. If there is muscle atrophy, it is important to strengthen them before surgery.  Sometimes, several surgeries may be necessary to remove cartilage fragments.  Recovery involves taking time off for about 6 weeks, performing light tasks for 4 to 5 months, and returning to contact sports just 9 months later.  In mild sprains, a rehabilitation program using an exercise bike can be useful in order to stimulate knee mobility. Leg extensions are also useful for increasing muscle strength. //Prevention// Preventing these injuries involves warming up correctly before practicing sports, with extension exercises.  Sudden increases in load during training should be avoided.  Equipment and footwear must be appropriate for each sport to avoid twisting movements at the knee.

ankle sprain,"//What is it?// Ankle sprains are probably the most common musculoskeletal injury. It is estimated that 15-25% of all musculoskeletal injuries are of this type.  The overwhelming majority are external sprains (around 95%).  They are usually benign lesions and resolve without sequelae, but even the most serious lesions can evolve favorably if subject to an appropriate therapeutic approach.  The ankle ligaments hold the bones and joint in position, protecting the ankle joint from abnormal movements such as twisting, rotating, and rolling the foot.  These ligaments are elastic structures that stretch to their limit and then return to their normal position. If a ligament is forced beyond its normal capacity, a sprain occurs, which in severe cases can be associated with a rupture of the elastic fibers that make it up. //Symptoms// Warning symptoms for a serious sprain include the presence of immediate and excruciating pain, the perception of a rupture on the external surface of the ankle accompanied by a clicking/noise and the rapid appearance of swelling/edema.  Night pain, hematoma formation, instability in movement and the inability to bear weight on the ankle may occur.  The amount of force involved in the trauma allows sprains to be classified into different degrees. Grade 1 - The mildest, only slight stretching of the ligament occurs Grade 2 - Partial rupture of the ligament Grade 3 - Complete rupture of the ligament  The symptoms will be more pronounced the more severe the sprain.  Having a sprain in the past that was not treated correctly increases the risk of further sprains.  When sprains occur repeatedly and the pain remains for more than 4 weeks to 6 months, it is considered a chronic sprain. These chronic injuries alter proprioception and generate imbalance and muscle weakness that increase the risk of new injuries. //Causes// The main risk factors are, in addition to predisposing anatomical changes (such as differences in the length of the lower limbs or ligament laxity), a history of repeated sprains and all sports that involve pushing/jumping and running movements. //Diagnosis// The diagnosis is made based on clinical elements. Radiography makes it possible to exclude an associated fracture.  Magnetic resonance imaging allows better study of the ligaments involved //Treatment// Most patients with mild sprains do not require medical attention. In these cases, immobilization is not necessary; strength and flexibility exercises are sufficient. Rest, application of ice for 20-30 minutes 3 times a day, use of a bandage and elevation of the ankle above the level of the heart for the first two days are very helpful measures.  Patients with severe sprains, due to swelling, pain and functional impotence, should seek medical help.  Since walking can be painful, the use of crutches may be helpful.  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs help control pain and inflammation.  In grade 2 sprains, immobilization associated with physiotherapy becomes more relevant and, in grade 3, surgery may be necessary, although some cases can only be treated with adequate immobilization.  In most cases, the healing process takes 4 weeks to 6 months. Early incorporation of movement in ankle injuries is important to prevent stiffness.  In the rehabilitation process, electrical or ultrasound stimulation helps control pain and swelling and prevents the problem from becoming chronic. A suitable exercise program completes this rehabilitation process, allowing the recovery of strength and flexibility in this joint.  Surgery is rarely necessary and is only used when medical treatment is ineffective. Surgery can be performed using arthroscopy, which allows visualization of the joint and detection of bone or cartilage fragments, as well as direct assessment of the affected ligament.  Surgery allows reconstruction of the ligament and should always be followed by a full rehabilitation program for a few weeks to months. //Prevention// The best prevention involves adequate maintenance of the strength, flexibility and balance of the ankle joint.  In the case of sport, it is essential to warm up correctly and define specific training programs for each modality and wear appropriate footwear. These shoes should be replaced when wear on the sole is visible.  In the case of running, very uneven surfaces should be avoided.  Whenever signs of fatigue occur, rest is crucial.

Entropy and triquiase,"//What is it?// Entropion corresponds to a change in the position of the eyelid, which inverts, leading to direct contact between the skin and eyelashes and the ocular surface. It can be involutional (progressive relaxation of tissues with age), spastic (associated with exaggerated contraction of the eyelid muscle) or cicatricial (caused by scarring of the conjunctiva, the mucosa that internally covers the eyelid and eyeball). Trichiasis corresponds to a change in the orientation of the eyelashes while maintaining the position of the eyelid margin. These eyelashes can be difficult to identify without the aid of magnification and the diagnosis is usually made by an ophthalmologist. //Symptoms// Inversion of the eyelid and/or eyelashes can cause a sensation of irritation, pain, foreign body sensation, and a red eye. Contact with the ocular surface can lead to the development of corneal abrasions and ulcers, which can be complicated by infections and permanent scarring. //Treatment// Variable.
