Pharyngitis,"//What is it?// It is an inflammation of the throat, most often caused by viruses but also by bacteria. Pharyngitis can appear associated with a cold, flu or mononucleosis, or in the context of streptococcal infection, some sexually transmitted diseases, such as gonorrhea. It is one of the main reasons for consultation in General Medicine. Although most of the time its origin is an infection, only around 20% of cases justify treatment with antibiotics, as is the case with streptococcal pharyngitis. //Symptoms// Symptoms are similar in viral and bacterial pharyngitis and include a sore throat and difficulty swallowing. The mucous membrane lining the throat may become infected and covered with a white membrane or pus. Fever and swollen lymph nodes in the neck may also occur. Pharyngitis can become complicated, causing ear infections, sinusitis or abscesses around the tonsils. //Causes// It results from inflammation and swelling of the back of the throat (pharynx), located between the tonsils and the larynx. Most are caused by viral infections, such as respiratory viruses or the mononucleosis virus. Bacteria such as Streptococcus or those responsible for sexually transmitted diseases such as gonorrhea can also cause pharyngitis. It is more common in the cold months, being contagious within the family and those closest to us. The most common routes of transmission are hand contact with infected nasal secretions. Its symptoms tend to develop after a short incubation period of one to three days. //Diagnosis// Medical examination, in many cases, allows the diagnosis of pharyngitis to be made. In others, it is recommended that throat exudate be collected and sent to the laboratory in order to identify its origin. Blood tests may also be requested, which may detect, for example, a high white blood cell count, suggestive of an inflammatory and/or infectious process. //Treatment// Symptoms can be relieved by using painkillers, throat lozenges, or gargling warm salt water. Children or adolescents under 18 should not be given aspirin because it can cause Reye's syndrome, which is a rapidly progressing and often fatal disease that affects the brain and liver. Antibiotics are of no interest if the infection is viral and are therefore not administered until laboratory tests have confirmed a diagnosis of bacterial pharyngitis. If tests indicate that it is caused by a streptococcal infection, the most recommended antibiotic is penicillin. If you are allergic to it, there are alternatives such as erythromycin. //Prevention// The viral and bacterial microorganisms that cause pharyngitis are contagious. As such, the best prevention is good hygiene: Wash your hands regularly, especially after using toilet facilities, before and after eating and whenever you sneeze or cough;;/ Do not share food, glasses or cutlery;;/ Cough or sneeze into a tissue which should then be disposed of;;/ Use alcoholic solutions to wash your hands whenever soap and water are not available;;/ Avoid touching public telephones or drinking from public fountains;;/ Regularly clean phones, remote controls and computer keyboards with disinfectant solutions;;/ Do the same every time you travel;;/ Avoid close contact with people who are sick.;/ It is also important to stay at home on days with a higher level of pollution, wear masks when cleaning to avoid inhaling dust particles, stop smoking and avoid exposure to smoke, as well as use humidifiers if the air is very dry. .

Fascite palmar,"//What is it?// Palmar fasciitis is a rare medical condition that causes inflammation of the palmar fascia (tissue between the skin and the tendon and vascular-nervous structures in the palm of the hand and fingers, which connects these two parts). It usually affects both hands and is more common in people with polyarthritis (arthritis that affects more than five joints). //Symptoms// The inflammation caused by palmar fasciitis can make it difficult and even painful to stretch your fingers. //Causes// Current research has not yet been conclusive regarding the cause of palmar fasciitis. //Treatment// Treatment options for palmar fasciitis include: Massages;/ Painkiller medications;/ Anti-inflammatory therapy with corticosteroids;/ Treatment of underlying clinical conditions, such as polyarthritis;/ //Prevention// There are no preventative measures for palmar fasciitis. However, early detection and treatment can help patients achieve good outcomes. DoveMed Medical News Today, March 2020 There are few children who decide to wash their hands of their own free will.

plantar fasciitis,"//What is it?// The plantar fascia is a thick, strong band that extends from the bottom of the heel bone (calcaneus) to the toes, behaving like an extension of the Achilles tendon. It is not very elastic and plays an important role in maintaining the arch of the foot during walking and stance. Plantar fasciitis is defined by painful retraction of the plantar fascia with increased curvature. //Symptoms// The typical symptom is plantar pain in the heel, especially with the first steps in the morning or after sitting for some time. The pain progressively improves with walking, intensifying again at the end of the day. //Causes// Plantar fasciitis doesn’t necessarily have just one cause. Several risk factors can increase a person’s likelihood of developing this condition. These include: Age - most common between 40 and 60 years old;/ exercises such as running, with repeated impact on the plantar fascia;/ Flat feet (commonly called flat feet), high curvature of the feet, or tightness of the calf (also called calf) muscles;/ Overweight, obesity or pregnancy;/ Arthritis;/ Standing for long periods of time, often in high-heeled shoes;/ Women are more likely than men to suffer from this condition either through pregnancy or through wearing inappropriate footwear. //Diagnosis// The diagnosis is essentially clinical, however simple radiography under load, ultrasound and Magnetic Resonance Imaging are important means to aid the diagnosis, providing information about the state of the plantar fascia and surrounding structures. //Treatment// The most effective treatment is rest and relief from the weight on the feet. Most cases are treated with non-surgical medical treatments, with surgery reserved for situations in which, despite treatment, satisfactory results are not obtained after one year of the onset of symptoms. These include: Use of orthotic devices such as adapted shoes, padded insoles and heel supports.;/ Night splint: People usually sleep with their feet relaxed and pointing down. In this position, the heel relaxes, contracting the plantar fascia and calf muscles, which increases pain in the curvature of the foot. Wearing a night splint keeps the foot in flexion, reducing muscle and fascia tension.;/ Physical therapy can help stretch muscles to improve range of motion, reduce pain and inflammation, and aid healing.;/ Anti-inflammatory treatment with corticosteroids on the fascia can reduce pain and inflammation.;/ The vast majority (about 80-90%) of patients will improve with this medical treatment over a period of months. If none of these treatments are effective, your doctor may recommend surgery. Although this is a low-risk surgery, complications such as pain or nerve damage can occur in some cases. There are two main options: Gastrocnemius muscle recession allows the calf muscles to be lengthened, increasing the range of motion in the ankle and reducing stress on the plantar fascia. This is a minimally invasive surgery that can reduce recovery time.;/ Fasciectomy involves cutting the fascia to reduce its tension. People with good ankle range of motion are the best candidates for this procedure.;/ //Prevention// Warming up before starting any sporting activity is essential. It is equally important to maintain adequate activity levels without overexertion or overload. Maintaining a healthy weight helps reduce pressure on your heels. Medical News Today Load more;/ If you are a woman and play sports, be aware that the foot and ankle are often prone to injuries. Know the precautions to be taken.

Yellow fever,"//What is it?// It is a viral hemorrhagic disease with high mortality, transmitted, like dengue, by the bite of disinfected Aedes mosquitoes. The name yellow fever results from the color that the skin and eyes acquire in the most serious situations, due to jaundice. It is estimated that this disease currently affects around 200,000 people and causes 30,000 deaths per year, of which around 90% occur in Africa. The areas at risk are the tropical regions of this continent and South America. Epidemics occur frequently and can infect more than 20% of the unvaccinated population. Some cases of yellow fever have been recorded in countries in North America and Europe. These are generally small in number and result from importation from the territories where it is most prevalent. //Symptoms// The manifestations are very varied, which makes early identification difficult. There are cases where there are no symptoms and, in others, it can present as a generalized organic dysfunction. The initial phase is characterised by flu-like symptoms, with high fever, headaches, muscle pain, loss of appetite and nausea/vomiting. Flu-like symptoms predominate for four or five days, disappearing spontaneously in most people. In around 15% of cases, there is progression to a toxic phase, with high mortality, characterised by multi-organ dysfunction (mainly liver and kidneys), widespread haemorrhage and absence of urination. In general, symptoms appear three to six days after being bitten by an infected mosquito. In a small number of individuals, the infection progresses to multi-organ failure, with jaundice and liver failure, haemorrhages, kidney failure, changes in consciousness, convulsions, coma and death. In the most severe cases, mortality can be over 50%. //Causes// Yellow fever is transmitted by certain species of mosquitoes. Infection occurs when an unprotected person is bitten. Once infected with the virus, it can be a source of infection for other mosquitoes before symptoms appear. This insect becomes capable of transmitting the virus nine to 12 days after biting an infected individual. //Diagnosis// Clinical diagnosis is difficult because its symptoms can be similar to those of other diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever, dengue fever or other forms of hemorrhagic fever. Medical history provides clues, especially if travel to higher risk areas has occurred. Blood tests allow you to accurately confirm the diagnosis. //Treatment// There is no specific treatment for this disease - however, there is an effective vaccine to prevent infection. General measures to reduce exposure to mosquitoes (repellent, mosquito nets) are also recommended. As a rule, these patients must be hospitalized in order to receive supportive treatment. This involves rest, fluid replacement, fever and pain control. It is important that they are also protected from additional bites in order to stop the transmission cycle and reduce the risk of infecting other people. Medications such as aspirin that increase the risk of bleeding should be avoided. //Prevention// There is a very effective vaccine for preventing yellow fever. It consists of a live, attenuated virus and is safe and effective over the next 10 years in more than 95% of cases. The WHO recommends vaccination for all travelers to high-risk areas. There are even a number of countries where proof of vaccination is mandatory (such as Angola or São Tomé and Príncipe). However, there are specific contraindications for this vaccine (such as for pregnant women), so it is important to seek prior advice at the traveler's consultation.

Fever in children,"//What is it?// It is a common symptom of acute childhood illnesses, due to the body's defense reaction against infection. It can appear suddenly and be accompanied by cold extremities and tremors. Fever is one of the most common manifestations in children, causes great anxiety in the family and is the cause of many pediatric consultations and parental absenteeism. It is not a disease, but a symptom, common to several diseases. It consists of an increase in body temperature above the normal daily variation. Body temperature is controlled by a regulatory center, which balances heat gains and losses, according to a normal daily rhythm (circadian rhythm). Temperatures are lowest in the morning and highest (around 1ºC) in the late afternoon. Thus, body temperature varies throughout the day, ranging between 36.5 – 37.5ºC. Fever is the body's defense response to an infection. The increase in body temperature contributes to the inactivation of microorganisms and control of their multiplication. For these reasons, fever should only be treated to alleviate existing discomfort. The use of excessive antipyretics can be harmful, not only because of their toxicity, but also because it could be prolonging the disease and its complications. //Symptoms// If fever is the only symptom of illness, immediate medical consultation is not justified, with the exception of infants under 3 months of age. The doctor advises parents to wait for other signs of illness that allow diagnosis, which generally occurs within 3 days. But, in addition to fever, there may be warning signs, such as the child being “wilted”, not playing when the fever goes down, shortness of breath, spots on the skin, changes in behavior or consciousness, convulsions, persistent vomiting or headaches. intense headaches. In these cases, parents should contact their doctor as soon as they detect these signs. //Causes// Fever is not a disease, but a symptom, common to several diseases, the vast majority of which are due to a virus infection. //Diagnosis// A child is feverish if the axillary temperature is greater than 37.5ºC, or the rectal temperature is above 38ºC. If you are under two years old, it must be measured in the rectum, and in other cases in the armpit or in the ear with digital devices. Babies and younger children typically have higher temperatures than older children and teenagers: From 0 - 3 months, fever is considered to be equal to/greater than 38°C rectally and you should always consult a doctor immediately;/ From 3 - 6 months, fever is considered if it is equal to/greater than 38°C rectally. Fever equal to or greater than 39ºC is always a reason to consult a doctor;/ In older children, fever is considered if it is equal to/greater than 37.8°C under the armpit. A fever equal to or greater than 39.5°C, accompanied by signs of illness (prostration, vomiting, intense headaches, spots on the skin...) is always a reason to consult a doctor;/ //Treatment// Although it is important to look for the cause, as it is a reaction of the body, its presence does not imply the immediate use of antipyretics. This medication does not alter the normal course of the disease and should be reserved only to improve the child's comfort.  //What you SHOULD DO when children have a fever:// Monitor for signs of severity;/ Take off or reduce the amount of clothing;/ Offer liquids, in small amounts at a time, several times and do not insist on eating.;/ With an axillary temperature above 38ºC and associated discomfort, administer an antipyretic, preferably using dipyrone. Only if the fever reappears at intervals of less than 6 hours, another drug, such as ibuprofen, should be alternated.;/ If the child is less than 3 months old, seek immediate medical attention;/ In older children, if no other complaints appear, you can wait 3 to 5 days before medical evaluation;/ As a complement to the antipyretic, especially if your child is under 5 years old, you can give him a bath in lukewarm water (about 2 degrees below body temperature), as the fever will go down more quickly.;/  //What you SHOULD NOT DO when children have a fever:// Warm the child by putting more clothing on him/her;/ Use antipyretics even without fever, to prevent, at a fixed time (use in SOS and only if necessary);/ Wanting to treat fever with antibiotics;/ Insist on a normal and abundant diet;/ Attributing fever to a tooth eruption;/  //You should go to the hospital emergency room if signs of seriousness appear:// Prostration, groaning;/ Difficulty breathing;/ Vomiting and severe headaches that persist or worsen;/ Skin lesions (moles) that do not disappear with local pressure;/ Seizures, changes in consciousness or behavior (irritability, agitation, drowsiness);/ //Prevention// There are no ways to prevent fever, as fever itself is not a disease, but a physiological response of the body. In healthy children it is often self-limited and benign.

Cleft lip and palate,"//What is it?// Cleft palate is an embryopathy that affects the soft and hard palate to varying degrees. It may be associated with cleft lip. Its annual incidence varies between 1/3,300 and 1/10,000 births, being more frequent in females. In Portugal, it is estimated that around 1 in every 600 children born has a cleft lip, palate or lip-palate. In other words, around 150 children are born in Portugal each year with this malformation.  The cleft palate is located in the middle, joining the oral cavity to the two nasal cavities and the nasopharynx. Its clinical forms vary from a cleft with a notch in the posterior part of the hard palate to a complete cleft of the palate extending to the posterior region. There are other types, such as submucous cleft palate, which are covered by oral and nasal mucosa, making diagnosis more difficult. //Causes// This embryopathy appears between the 7th and 12th week of pregnancy and results from an error in the fusion of the palatine process. Nonsyndromic clefts are thought to result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Exposure to alcohol, tobacco or drugs during pregnancy can influence genetic susceptibility. Diabetes diagnosed before pregnancy also increases the risk of developing cleft palate. Medications such as some anti-epileptics are also associated with a higher risk. //Symptoms// Cleft palate can disturb sucking-swallowing in newborns to varying degrees. In non-syndromic forms, normal feeding is possible. In syndromic forms, there is a risk of food aspiration. There may be interference with the normal functioning of the Eustachian tube, causing recurrent ear infections and hearing loss. Dental alignment problems are caused by an error in the growth of the jaw. Speech difficulties may also occur. A fundamental aspect to be mentioned is the impact of the cleft palate on the child's physiognomy and, therefore, on their image and self-esteem. It is essential to manage this aspect well, in order to minimize the psychological consequences of this condition. //Diagnosis// The diagnosis is fundamentally clinical. The presence of associated malformations allows differentiation between isolated forms or those associated with syndromes. Prenatal diagnosis by ultrasound is possible from the 2nd trimester. When this diagnosis is established, the mother must be referred to a prenatal diagnosis center in order to establish whether it is an isolated anomaly or associated with other disorders. //Treatment// Treatment requires multidisciplinary medical and surgical intervention from birth until the end of development. As a rule, it involves primary surgery, sometimes followed by secondary surgery (maxillofacial and plastic). After surgery, monitoring must be adapted to the child in order to resolve morphological and functional problems that may arise during growth and development. This monitoring involves speech therapy, orthodontic treatment for dental alignment problems, jaw surgery if necessary, and regular monitoring by an ENT doctor to control ear infections or other disorders. The prognosis is variable and depends on the quality of initial management and regular monitoring. Syndromic forms have a worse prognosis, with more severe speech problems that require additional surgical treatment. //Prevention// Being a congenital anomaly, it cannot be prevented. In any case, pregnant women can minimize their risk by avoiding tobacco, alcohol and potentially harmful drugs and by properly monitoring their pregnancy. Orphanet, December 2011 Division of Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, NCBDDD, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, outubro 2014 Cleft Palate Foundation, 2014 RSV infection can progress to bronchiolitis or pneumonia.

Fibrilhacao auricular,"//What is it?// Atrial fibrillation is the most common chronic arrhythmia, affecting around 10% of the population over 70 years of age. It is estimated that in Portugal around 200,000 to 250,000 individuals have atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is a type of cardiac arrhythmia in which there are very irregular and usually rapid heartbeats, with 80 to 160 beats per minute. In this situation, the heart is unable to pump blood efficiently, which leads to the formation of small clots within the heart itself. These clots can be carried through the bloodstream and lodge in any part of the body. When they reach the arteries that supply the brain, they can cause a stroke. Atrial fibrillation is one of the main causes of stroke, which is why it is recommended that these patients undergo chronic therapy with anticoagulant medications, which are medications that thin the blood, preventing the formation of clots.  //Treatment// The treatment of arrhythmias depends on the type of arrhythmia and the presence of other heart diseases. There are drugs that can be useful in the treatment of arrhythmias and in some situations there are minimally invasive treatments that can involve the implantation of devices, such as a pacemaker. This electronic device is implanted in the patient's chest, from which two or more probes are inserted and remain inside the heart. If the heart rate becomes too slow or with prolonged pauses, the pacemaker itself detects this anomaly and sends electrical stimuli that correct this disturbance, causing the heartbeat to return to normal. Some special pacemakers can also improve the contraction of the heart itself, treating symptoms in patients with severe heart failure. There is also another device, the cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), which, when implanted in the same way, can detect cardiac arrest due to malignant ventricular arrhythmia (usually an arrhythmia originating in the ventricles called ventricular fibrillation, in which the heartbeat is too fast and disorganized, leading to death within a few seconds) and deliver a small shock that treats this arrhythmia, reverting the heart rhythm to normal. The ICD may be the only effective therapy for preventing sudden death in patients at high risk of developing this type of arrhythmia, such as people who have had a myocardial infarction and who have severely compromised ventricular function (when the heart muscle has been severely affected). Load more;/ 1 in 6 Portuguese people may have heart failure without knowing it. The prevalence increases with age, but lifestyle helps reduce risk factors. Cancer treatment can cause adverse cardiac effects. Monitoring patients in Cardiology is essential to prevent cardiovascular disease.

Fibromyalgia,"//What is it?// It is a chronic disease characterized by painful and diffuse neuromuscular complaints but also by the presence of pain points in specific regions. Although there have been several descriptions of this pathology for a long time, it was only recognized by the World Health Organization as a disease in the late 1970s. Fibromyalgia is a chronic illness but its symptoms vary in intensity and may even disappear or decrease temporarily only to reappear later. These changes may be related to changes in the weather, hormonal issues, stress, depression, anxiety or greater effort than usual. The severity of the symptoms makes fibromyalgia very disabling, with a significant impact on the quality of life of those affected. This disease affects approximately 2% to 8% of the adult population. Of these, between 80% and 90% of cases are women aged between 30 and 50 years. Although there are no rigorous national statistics, it is estimated that 5% to 6% of the population suffers from this pathology, with a predominance of women over 40 years of age. Other studies report that in Portugal there is a prevalence of around 3.6%, and there may be undiagnosed cases. In fact, many people remain in diagnostic uncertainty for several months or years. //Symptoms// The most important symptom is pain, which can affect a large part of the body. Sometimes it starts in a generalized manner, although it can affect specific areas such as the neck, shoulders or lower back. Fibromyalgia pain can be described as a burning sensation or discomfort, in which muscle spasms sometimes occur. Manifestations may vary depending on the time and day, and may be more frequent in the morning, worsening with physical activity, climate change, lack of sleep and stress. In addition to pain, it can cause tingling and swelling in the hands and feet, especially when getting out of bed, as well as causing muscle stiffness. Another change in fibromyalgia associated with pain is fatigue, which persists throughout most of the day with little tolerance to physical exertion. People with this pathology also frequently complain of anxiety, attention, concentration and memory disorders. Some have gastric problems and irritable bowels. And about 70% report sleep disturbances, with pain increasing on days when they sleep worse. //Causes// Its causes are not exactly known. Numerous factors probably contribute to this disease. However, it appears to be related to a deregulation of certain substances in the central nervous system. Stress, some immunological and endocrine diseases, physical trauma (surgery, car accident) or psychological trauma (death, divorce) seem to contribute to the development or maintenance of this clinical condition. Some cases of fibromyalgia that begin after a bacterial or viral infection have also been described. //Diagnosis// Since there is no exam or analysis that allows confirmation of your diagnosis, it is based on clinical history and medical observation that highlights a set of painful points associated with fatigue, sleep disorders and emotional changes. The current diagnostic criteria are the presence of diffuse pain throughout the body lasting more than three months, pain when palpating 12 out of 18 tender points and at least two of the following four symptoms: fatigue, sleep disturbances, emotional disturbances and headaches. It is essential to exclude other diseases that can cause these complaints, such as muscle injuries, changes in the immune system, hormonal problems and rheumatic diseases. As such, any necessary examinations must be carried out. In the case of fibromyalgia, the results are normal. //Treatment// There is no cure for fibromyalgia. As the years go by, the patient tends to get worse if there are no conditions for adequate treatment, adaptation or in the absence of help from others in various daily tasks. There are no specific medications and treatment must be multidisciplinary and adapted to each patient and their stage. Analgesics, muscle relaxants, antidepressants and, in some cases, anti-inflammatories can be useful in some stages of the pathology. More recently, new drugs have been approved that help control your symptoms and that act on certain brain chemicals. Your prescription must always be carried out by your doctor. To improve their physical and mental state, patients should exercise, preferably with a program adapted to their physical condition, whether in a gym or in a swimming pool. Massages, heat applications, physiotherapy and/or acupuncture and relaxation techniques are also useful. Getting restful sleep and a balanced diet should also be part of daily habits. It is also important to control stress and try to adapt your lifestyle to changes in energy levels and the symptoms of fibromyalgia. It is also essential that the patient feels supported in their family, social and professional environment. //Prevention// There is no known prevention for this disease. More common in women, fibromyalgia is a disease that significantly affects patients' daily lives. Diagnosis is essential to control the disease.

Liver fibrosis,"//What is it?// It is the result of a scarring response of the liver to repeated insults. After an acute injury, such as viral hepatitis, liver cells regenerate and replace those that have died. During this process, an inflammatory response occurs. If the injury persists, regeneration is no longer possible and the dead cells are replaced by fibrous tissue. This progression leads to the formation of extensive areas of fibrosis and progression to liver cirrhosis. This can progress to liver failure and often requires a liver transplant. On the other hand, liver cirrhosis significantly increases the risk of liver cancer. //Symptoms// In itself, it does not cause symptoms. Its manifestations result from liver dysfunction, progression to cirrhosis and all associated complications, such as varicose veins that can bleed, ascites (accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity), encephalopathy and kidney failure. In more advanced stages, liver failure may occur, which, in the most severe cases, can be fatal. In the early stages, fibrosis is insidious. Progression to cirrhosis occurs over a period of 15 to 20 years. Loss of liver function can be manifested by the presence of yellowish skin and mucous membranes (jaundice), abdominal pain, intense itching, dark urine, discolored stools, chronic tiredness, nausea or loss of appetite. //Causes// As a rule, all chronic liver diseases can cause liver fibrosis. It results from repeated damage to the liver. The most common are hepatitis C and alcohol abuse. With the increasing rate of obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver has become an important cause. //Diagnosis// It involves clinical evaluation, laboratory tests and imaging studies, such as ultrasound, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Liver biopsy is the best means of diagnosis as it assesses the extent and severity of fibrosis. However, it is an invasive examination that can be associated with some complications such as pain or bleeding. //Treatment// Since liver fibrosis is a response to an attack, treatment should focus on identifying and treating it. It is therefore important to cure viral hepatitis, avoid alcohol consumption, remove heavy metals (such as iron or copper) when they are the cause of the pathology, or decompress the bile ducts in cases of obstruction. These procedures can stop the fibrosis process and, in some cases, reverse it. Since inflammation is one of the factors in its progression, the use of anti-inflammatory drugs may be indicated. Corticosteroids are useful in autoimmune hepatitis and acute alcoholic hepatitis. Antioxidants and other substances with immunomodulatory action that can protect liver cells may also be used. Adequate nutrition is a good complement to treatment, with zinc and vitamin D supplementation. In addition, physical exercise helps maintain muscle mass. There are also specific therapies for ascites and hypertension, should these pathologies develop. However, when cirrhosis occurs with clinical complications, liver transplantation is the only possible approach. //Prevention// Unlike cirrhosis, liver fibrosis is reversible, as long as the aggression that is stimulating it can be stopped. This regression, however, can take years. The risk of developing liver cancer in cirrhosis of the liver is around 1% to 4% per year. This has a high mortality rate if diagnosed late, which is why all patients with cirrhosis should have an abdominal ultrasound every six months, so that the tumour can be identified while still small. In this case, there are some effective treatments, such as liver transplantation, surgical removal, radiofrequency or chemoembolisation. Protecting the liver is important to avoid diseases that can attack it and trigger the process of liver fibrosis. In this sense, it is important not to consume alcoholic beverages in excess (more than two to three for men and one to two for women, per day), not to consume alcohol before the age of 18, to be vaccinated against hepatitis B, not to share syringes or any material used in the consumption of injected drugs, do not share the material used to inhale drugs (prevents hepatitis C), use condoms in the case of multiple partners or risky sexual relations (prevents hepatitis B and C) and combat excess weight.

Pulmonary fibrosis,"//What is it?// It is the abnormal presence of fibrous or scar tissue in the lungs. It can appear as a result of lung diseases (there are more than 200 that can cause pulmonary fibrosis) and that interfere with its function, affecting breathing, gas exchange and, consequently, the entire metabolism. It is not a disease in itself but a consequence of a previous pathology. It is an irreversible disease that can develop very gradually or more quickly.  //Symptoms// Since pulmonary fibrosis interferes with the elasticity of lung tissue and gas exchange, the most common symptoms are coughing and difficulty breathing, with shorter and faster inhalations and exhalations. These symptoms may be very mild and almost imperceptible at first, but they become more severe as the fibrosis develops. Thus, difficulty breathing is only evident after physical exertion, but it can start to appear even after very simple activities such as taking a shower, getting dressed or eating. The cough is usually dry and chronic, causing chest discomfort. Poor blood and tissue oxygenation is associated with cold, purplish extremities, which may lead to changes in the nails. There is also a decrease in appetite and weight loss. In other cases, patients report muscle and joint pain. //Causes// In many cases, it is not possible to identify its cause, and it is classified as idiopathic. In others, the most common causes are autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, polymyositis); occupational diseases, in which there is exposure to substances such as asbestos, beryllium silica, heavy metals, tar, environmental exposure to bacteria, fungi or radiation; some medications, such as nitrofurantoin, sulfasalazine, amiodarone, propranolol, phenytoin, methotrexate, bleomycin or oxaliplatin. There are also cases that arise after a viral infection. Contact with birds may also be at its origin. And since in around 10% to 15% of cases there is more than one family member affected, it may still be associated with a genetic cause. //Diagnosis// Diagnosing the causes of pulmonary fibrosis is difficult. However, it should always be tried because the evolution of the disease and its treatment vary greatly depending on its origin. In general, it should involve a multidisciplinary team that includes pulmonologists, rheumatologists and internists. An accurate diagnosis involves medical observation and clinical history, where relevant data can be obtained to identify the cause of pulmonary fibrosis. Depending on the elements obtained, additional tests are requested, such as a thoracic tomography, laboratory studies, respiratory function and exercise tests, arterial blood gas measurement or, if necessary, a bronchoscopy or surgical lung biopsy. Studying the heart and cardiac function can also be useful in some situations. //Treatment// Pulmonary fibrosis is irreversible and as such cannot be cured. The current therapeutic strategy aims to prevent the formation of additional fibrosis and alleviate the symptoms already present. Corticosteroids may be important when there is a significant inflammatory component. Azathioprine and cyclophosphamide may also be prescribed whenever the physician considers it appropriate. When oxygen levels are reduced, oxygen therapy is necessary. There are also specific lung physiotherapy techniques that seek to increase the function and elasticity of the lungs and, in this way, improve the quality of life of patients. Lung transplants are reserved for the most severe cases, which have not responded to treatments. Patients must be carefully selected and meet a set of criteria to be eligible for this transplant. //Prevention// Avoid toxic or other substances associated with the development of pulmonary fibrosis. In professional cases, all measures must be taken to reduce this exposure and ensure the safety and health of workers. When a disease occurs that may be associated with pulmonary fibrosis, regular surveillance is essential so that it is detected and treated as early as possible.

Fatty liver,"//What is it?// Also known as hepatic steatosis, it means accumulation of fat in the liver cells. The liver is the second largest organ in the body and performs numerous functions, both in the digestion and utilization of nutrients, as well as in the removal of harmful substances, in addition to good regulation of coagulation. Fatty liver is a common disease that, in Portugal, affects around 15% of adults, which indicates the occurrence of approximately one million and 200 thousand cases, of which 200 to 300 thousand are the most serious forms of the disease, which may progress to liver cirrhosis. Globally, it affects around 20% to 30% of the population regardless of age, gender or ethnicity. There is a higher incidence in men, especially at older ages, and also in postmenopausal women. It can affect around 3% of children (aged around four years) and 20% to 50% of obese children. This accumulation of fat in the liver results from eating too much of it, to the point where the body is unable to process it. We speak of a fatty liver when the fat corresponds to 5% to 10% of the liver mass. It may be a simple situation that does not cause liver damage, or it may progress to inflammation of the liver tissue, as occurs with cirrhosis. //Symptoms// Most patients have no symptoms. Sometimes, tiredness and pain or discomfort may appear in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen. Other possible manifestations are: loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, jaundice, fever, ascites (distension of the abdomen due to accumulation of fluid). The last three already correspond to advanced forms of the disease, with damage and inflammation of the liver. //Causes// One of the important causes of fatty liver is alcohol consumption. However, this condition also appears in people who do not drink, and is called non-alcoholic fatty liver. This condition is prevalent in patients with overweight/obesity, diabetes and increased cholesterol and/or triglycerides. Other, rarer causes of fatty liver include: medications (amiodarone, estrogens, corticosteroids, tamoxifen, antiretrovirals, tetracyclines), certain genetic metabolic diseases, rapid weight loss, artificial forms of nutrition, and the ingestion of toxins (chemicals and mushrooms). There may also be some hereditary predisposition to the occurrence of this pathology. The fat that is ingested is metabolized in the liver and other tissues. If it is excessive, it is stored in adipose tissue. From there it can be transferred to other places and also to the liver. In other cases, fat accumulates in this organ, which is unable to transform it to be eliminated. Around 80% of alcohol consumers develop this condition because alcohol causes a rapid accumulation of fatty acids in the liver. //Diagnosis// The most common techniques are abdominal ultrasound, which reveals a larger liver. This disease can also be suspected due to changes in blood tests, which detect an increase in liver enzymes (transaminases) in obese, diabetic and/or dyslipidemic patients. A biopsy is the test that allows you to confirm your diagnosis and also assess the degree of inflammation. //Treatment// There is no specific treatment or effective medication in this situation. Lifestyle changes and weight loss are fundamental aspects. Therefore, diet and exercise are very important. It is also necessary to avoid the consumption of alcoholic beverages and properly control associated diseases, such as diabetes and changes in cholesterol and triglycerides. It is worth highlighting that, in its early stages, fatty liver is reversible.  //What are the complications associated with fatty liver?// Although the majority of cases have a benign evolution, it is currently known that progression to cirrhosis is possible. This risk is greater in older patients, diabetics and those who already have liver inflammation (called non-alcoholic steatohepatitis). //Prevention// Opting for a healthy lifestyle, preventing obesity, and practicing physical exercise are important aspects of this prevention. As well as a diet low in saturated fats, rich in fiber and moderate alcohol consumption. You should also prefer fish and lean meats to red meat and pork. It is also useful to supplement the diet with substances capable of preventing this disease and improving liver function, such as: vitamin E and C, selenium, omega-3 and ginseng, among others. Canadian Liver Foundation, 2012 American Liver Foundation, Outubro 2011 FattyLivers.org, 2013 Brazilian Society of Gastroenterology, 2007 Brazilian Society of Hepatology, 2009 Surgery can give people with obesity back the quality (and years) of life that they would otherwise be unable to achieve. Learn about the different techniques. Surgical treatment for obesity and diabetes can be performed using different techniques, depending on the objective and characteristics of each person.

Phimosis,"//What is it?// Phimosis does not correspond to the normal fact that the foreskin is glued to the glans, a common situation in the first years of life (at six months only 20% of boys are able to fully expose it, but almost 90% are already able to do so at three years of age), but rather the difficulty, or even impossibility, of exposing the glans of the penis due to the fact that the foreskin (“skin” that covers the glans) has a very narrow ring. Around 90% of newborns have physiological phimosis or the inability to completely retract the foreskin. During the first three to four years of life, factors such as the growth of the penis shaft, the accumulation of epithelial secretions, intermittent erections and masturbation during puberty lead to the separation of the foreskin from the glans. As a rule, about 90% of foreskins are completely retractable by age three and less than 1% of men have phimosis by age 17. The foreskin, in addition to its protective effect on the urethral meatus, has other functions such as contributing to sexual pleasure, which can lead to dissatisfaction in circumcised men. Therefore, many of the circumcisions usually performed can be avoided. Phimosis only becomes problematic if it causes obstruction to the flow of urine, pain, blood loss in the urine, or infection. //Symptoms// In many cases, its only manifestation is difficulty in retracting the foreskin. However, infections of the glans or urinary tract, painful erections and difficulties in urination, with a reduction in the intensity of the urinary stream, may occur. Phimosis is a risk factor for penile cancer. //Causes// The most common reason is diaper rash, which can cause scarring and fibrosis. As they retract the skin, the foreskin ring becomes narrower. In other cases, parents concerned about normal adhesion between the glans and the foreskin perform massages, forcing the skin and causing small traumas that, when healing, make the ring narrow, causing phimosis. It can also result from a chronic infection associated with poor hygiene. It can occur even in uncircumcised people or even after circumcision. In older men, diabetes is a risk factor for chronic infection and consequent phimosis. Although very rare, phimosis occurs in women, involving the clitoris and causing pain during sexual intercourse. //Diagnosis// The diagnosis is clinical, made during a medical examination. //Treatment// Surgery is indicated to allow adequate hygiene of the penis, to enable satisfactory sexual relationships in the future, to reduce the risk of urinary infections, of the foreskin, of the glans, and of venereal diseases, penile cancer, in addition to also reducing the risk of breast cancer. cervix in future sexual partners. It is important to note that phimosis does not prevent or harm penis growth and, therefore, surgery is not intended for this purpose. In uncomplicated cases, it can be performed around the age of seven to ten. By then, the foreskin can detach normally, thus avoiding surgery. At this age, the child can already understand the need for the operation, making it less traumatic on a psychological level. On the other hand, it is important that it occurs before adolescence, when more frequent erections make the post-operative period more painful and increase the risk of complications. The surgery is performed on an outpatient basis and, in childhood and even adolescence, general anesthesia is preferred, usually preceded by the use of a sedative and an analgesic, to prevent the patient from watching, participating and being frightened during the surgical procedure, to avoid the pain of the needle “pricks” and the introduction of the local anesthetic, to keep the patient still and to allow them to not remember the procedure, thus avoiding future psychological trauma. As for the technique, the amount of skin to be removed depends on the age and degree of phimosis. In younger children, it is recommended to be vigilant, maintain adequate hygiene and avoid excessively forcing the retraction of the foreskin, so as not to cause scars that worsen the clinical condition. Local application of corticosteroids may be useful in some cases. //Prevention// The best prevention is to teach parents good hygiene for children, without massage or exercise, and by recognizing and properly treating dermatitis, diaper rash and infections that may occur. Carlos Brás Silva et al., Phimosis and Circumcision, Acta Urológica 2006, 23; 2:21-26 21 Patient.co.uk, May 2011 University of California, San Francisco, 2013 Common in newborns, phimosis (resulting from adhesions between the skin of the foreskin and the glans of the penis) almost always resolves spontaneously.

Anal fissure,"//What is it?// Anal fissures are tears in the lining of the anal canal that cause pain and sometimes bleeding during defecation. They are caused by injuries to the anal canal when passing large or hard stools, repeated diarrhea, or as a result of childbirth. In some cases, they are associated with Crohn's disease, an inflammatory bowel disease, and fistulas near the anus. Fissures may be accompanied by light bleeding or yellow discharge and itching. They are usually treated at home. //Symptoms// The main symptoms of anal fissure include: Pain, especially during bowel movements. The pain is sharp and intense, and a burning sensation may persist after defecation. In some patients, fear of pain causes them to avoid defecating, leading to an increase in the consistency and volume of the stool and worsening of the pain and fissure.;/ Sharp pain when cleaning;/ Bright red blood in the stool or on toilet paper, also common in fissures in children;/ Itching in the anal area, intermittent or persistent;/ //Causes// The most common causes of anal fissure are associated with constipation, which causes very hard stools, diarrhea or inflammation of the anal canal. //Diagnosis// In most cases, the clinical history and circumstances surrounding the onset of symptoms will guide the diagnosis of anal fissure. The healthcare professional may ask about diet, habits, or intestinal problems, as well as other medical conditions. In most cases, inspection of the anal area can confirm the presence of a fissure. Often, the number and location of fissures can point to other conditions, such as Crohn's disease. The presence of marginal thickenings suggests that the fissure is chronic and repeated. In these cases, your doctor may suggest a sigmoidoscopy to look at the lower part of the colon (called the sigmoid colon), or a colonoscopy to look at the entire large intestine. Both tests involve the insertion through the anus of a long, thin, flexible tube connected to a light source and which allows the presence of abnormal lesions or inflammatory conditions to be detected. //Treatment// In most cases, anal fissures heal spontaneously with the topical application of creams, associated with taking laxatives and local hygiene using warm water. In cases where complaints persist for several days without reacting to treatment, it should be reevaluated. the patient's situation, exclude diseases that may be at its origin, such as Crohn's Disease, and consider the need for surgical correction. If the fissures persist, causing a decrease in quality of life, they can be treated with an injection of a substance that reduces the tone or strength of the internal anal sphincter (botulinum toxin) or with surgery. //Prevention// Keeping your stool soft with a balanced diet;/ Maintain adequate fluid intake;/ Don't delay going to the bathroom;/ Changing babies' diapers frequently prevents cracks from appearing;/ Avoid foods that are not well digested, such as nuts and popcorn;/ In individuals more susceptible to fissures, hygiene with soft, lubricated cotton wipes after defecation is beneficial.;/ Regular exercise can reduce the risk of developing constipation, resulting in a lower risk of fissures;/ Avoid sitting on the toilet for a long time;/ WebMD Medical News Today Load more;/ Frequent infections, gastrointestinal problems, excessive fatigue...

Fistula,"//What is it?// A fistula designates an anomalous communication between two or more body structures that, under normal conditions, do not communicate with each other. It can occur in the most varied locations, the most common being the digestive, urinary, reproductive and circulatory systems. They are very common, and almost always treatable, with a favorable prognosis. Its origin may be congenital or result from disease, infection, trauma or surgery. The formation of a fistula is associated with very uncomfortable symptoms and, if left untreated, can progress to conditions of significant severity. Depending on its location, it can allow urine, feces or secretions to pass outside and cause symptoms such as pain, irritation, nausea or diarrhea. //Symptoms// Its manifestations are as variable as its location. Due to their frequency, the symptoms of anal and vaginal fistulas are referred to. In the anal fistula, a communication forms between the anus region and the surrounding skin, usually as a result of an infectious process. For this reason, the most common signs are fever, malaise, constipation, pain during bowel movements, loss of blood or pus through the fistula and swelling of the skin around it. In the vaginal area, communication develops between the vagina and an organ in the pelvic region. The most common causes of this type are childbirth, Crohn's disease, previous surgery or cancer. Depending on the organs involved, these fistulas can be colovaginal, enterovaginal, rectovaginal, ureterovaginal, urethrovaginal or vesicovaginal, in the latter case they connect the vagina with the bladder. The symptoms vary depending on their location but are very uncomfortable because they can involve the passage of faeces or urine into the vaginal canal. Discomfort, unpleasant odours and a feeling of vaginal discomfort also occur. In other types of fistulas, fever, pain, itching and malaise tend to be the predominant symptoms. If the fistula closes and the infection remains, an abscess may form. In the case of an arteriovenous fistula, blood communicates between an artery and a vein. As a consequence, the oxygen that is transported does not reach the target tissues, being diverted to the venous circulation. These fistulas are most common in the lower limbs but can occur anywhere on the body. The most common signs are the presence of bulging veins, swelling of the hands or feet, tiredness and, depending on its location, low blood pressure or heart failure. A clot may form within these fistulas and its release into the bloodstream may cause distant embolisms. //Causes// Fistulas can be congenital in nature or result from disease, infection, injury or surgery. Inflammatory bowel diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, are frequently associated with the formation of fistulas. Intestinal diverticulitis is another risk factor. When an infection occurs in a gland with an accumulation of pus, if left untreated, the material under tension ""seeks"" an exit to the outside, forming a fistula. //Diagnosis// The diagnosis depends on the clinical history and medical examination. It is from there that the most appropriate complementary tests are defined for each case. In the case of fistulas involving the digestive system, it is important to carry out an endoscopic and/or radiological study. In others it is useful to introduce a contrast substance followed by a radiographic study. This technique allows you to see its extent and which organs are involved. For arteriovenous lesions, Doppler, tomography or magnetic resonance imaging studies are relevant. //Treatment// Treatment also depends on its location and the severity of the symptoms. In some cases, antibiotics or immunosuppressants are used. For fistulas located in the digestive system, a special liquid diet can allow good healing and closure. Arteriovenous fistulas can be embolized by introducing a catheter. Vaginal infections do not always require treatment, as they can close spontaneously. In the case of anals, surgery is almost always necessary. When there is no response to therapy, surgical intervention is also the option. This may consist of just removing the fistula if the organs involved are healthy, or partially removing them if there are signs of significant disease. //Prevention// There is no defined strategy for its prevention. The important thing is an early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Cleveland Clinic, 2014 The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons, 2014 Teresa H. deBeche-Adams e col.,Rectovaginal Fistulas,Clin Colon Rectal Surg. 2010 Jun; 23(2): 99-103 Load more;/ RSV infection can progress to bronchiolitis or pneumonia.

Flatulence,"//What is it?// Flatulence corresponds to a sensation of the presence of gas in the digestive tract. Air is a gas that can be swallowed with food. Swallowing small amounts is normal, but some people do it in large volumes, unconsciously, especially in states of anxiety. This situation causes a feeling of satiety, generating excessive belching or expelling air through the anus. Most of the swallowed air is subsequently expelled (only a small portion passes from the stomach to the rest of the digestive tract). The body eliminates gases through eructation, absorbs them through the walls of the gastrointestinal tract into the blood (being eliminated through the lungs) or expels them through the anus. //Symptoms// It is thought to cause abdominal pain, bloating, belching and excessive expulsion of gas through the anus. However, the exact relationship between flatulence and any of these symptoms is not known. Some people seem to be particularly sensitive to the effects of gases while others can tolerate large amounts without symptoms. Flatulence can lead to repeated belching. As a rule, air leaves the anus more than ten times a day. Infants with abdominal cramps sometimes also expel large amounts of gas. //Causes// In addition to the air that is swallowed, other gases are formed in the gastrointestinal tract. Hydrogen, methane and carbon dioxide are produced by the bacterial metabolism of food in the intestine, especially after eating beans or cabbage. Grains, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, asparagus, peas, onions, fruits, juices and sugar-free diet products, wheat, corn, barley, milk and dairy products can also be their origin. People with a deficiency in the enzymes that break down certain sugars also tend to produce large amounts of gas when they eat foods containing these sugars. This is also the case for people with lactase deficiency, tropical diarrhea or pancreatic insufficiency. Other common causes include the use of antibiotics, irritable bowel syndrome, malabsorption and the ingestion of foods that are difficult to digest, such as fiber. //Diagnosis// Tests may be necessary to determine its cause and, mainly, to exclude possible diseases of the digestive tract. Thus, the doctor may order an abdominal CT or ultrasound, an x-ray with contrast, blood tests, or an upper or lower endoscopy. //Treatment// Distension and eructation are difficult to treat. If the main problem is burping, reducing the amount of air swallowed may help. However, this goal is difficult to achieve because swallowing is often an unconscious act. You have to avoid chewing gum, drinking carbonated drinks or antacids (such as baking soda), you should eat more slowly and in a calm environment. Flatulence can be controlled by adjusting your diet and avoiding foods that are difficult to digest. To find out which ones are causing the problem, you may need to eliminate one or a group of products at a time. You can start by eliminating milk and dairy products, then fruits and certain vegetables, and then other foods. Taking some medications can help reduce gas production, although they are not usually very effective. //Prevention// Prevention involves simple measures such as eating relaxedly, without rushing, chewing slowly, not eating too much cabbage or beans, not chewing gum, not drinking carbonated drinks and walking for 10 to 15 minutes after meals. Manual Merck U.S. National Library of Medicine, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, Fevereiro de 2014 Brazilian Society of Gastroenterology, 2008 Among fruits, vegetables and legumes, get to know eight types of foods that are most likely to cause flatulence.

Folliculitis,"//What is it?// Folliculitis occurs when there is an infection of the hair follicles caused by bacteria, such as staphylococcus, or other factors. This infection manifests itself in the form of small, white-tipped pimples around one or more hair follicles. When severe, it can cause permanent hair loss and/or scarring and should be treated by a dermatologist. In most cases, it is superficial and regresses spontaneously. //Symptoms// Folliculitis can be: Superficial: Affects only the upper part of the hair follicle and manifests itself in the form of small red pimples, with or without pus; the skin may become red and inflamed, with itching and sensitivity in the area;;/ Deep: When the inflammation reaches deeper areas, boils may form, with large red, sensitive and painful areas, as well as raised lesions with yellowish pus in the center. Itching and intense pain may also occur. In these cases, the likelihood of scarring is greater with destruction of the hair follicle.;/ //Causes// The bacterial invasion that causes folliculitis can occur spontaneously or be favored by other factors, the most common being: Excessive moisture or sweat, shaving or waxing;/ The use of jacuzzis and swimming pools;/ Wearing tight clothing;/ Taking antibiotics or corticosteroids for long periods of time;;/ Contact with substances that irritate or block follicles (makeup, cocoa butter, motor oil, among others);/ Skin injuries or diseases such as diabetes or HIV/AIDS that reduce the body's defenses are also risk factors;/ One of the most common agents of folliculitis is a bacteria, staphylococcus, which exists under normal conditions on the skin and only becomes aggressive when introduced into the deeper layers of the skin. Bacteria of the genus Pseudomonas can also cause this type of infection, as can some fungi. //Diagnosis// A doctor can diagnose folliculitis simply by looking at the skin. In some cases, they will take samples of the secretion from the lesion to be examined in a laboratory. These samples can identify the microorganism responsible for the folliculitis. //Treatment// Mild cases of folliculitis are likely to heal on their own. Persistent, recurrent or more serious infections may require treatment depending on the type of infection. Antibiotics applied locally, orally or both are often used. When it progresses to the formation of boils, surgical drainage may be necessary as a way of relieving pain and eliminating inflammation more quickly. If itching is intense, it is useful to use warm water, as well as the use of specific medications. In some cases, local or oral corticosteroids may be used. //Prevention// There are several ways to prevent folliculitis, taking into account the most common causes: Keep your skin clean, dry and free from abrasions or irritations. Diabetics are more prone to infections.;/ Use gentle skin cleansing products (soap, gel);/ Avoid routine antiseptic washes that tend to dry out the skin and destroy protective bacteria. You must keep your skin hydrated. However, you should avoid oils that trap bacteria inside the pores.;/ After physical exercise and contact with chemical agents, bathing or showering is essential.;/ When shaving, avoid cuts by using gel, foam or soap to lubricate the blades. Areas with folliculitis should not be shaved; it is preferable to use a depilatory cream.;/ Bath towels should not be shared.

Fracture of the femoral head,"//What is it?// The head of the femur is supplied by three arterial sources: the round ligament, the external circumflex femoral artery and the internal circumflex femoral artery (the most important).  Almost 70% of the femoral head is involved in load transfer, so changes in the articular surface can lead to the development of post-traumatic osteoarthritis.  Femoral head fractures are almost always associated with a hip dislocation. //Causes// Most femoral head fractures result from road accidents with trauma to the lower limb and transmission of force through the femur to the femoral head which, depending on the position of the hip, can result in dislocation and/or fracture. //Diagnosis// Radiographs of the pelvis, anteroposterior and oblique views are used to diagnose head fracture, hip dislocation and the existence of intra-articular fragments.  CT is important to identify associated acetabular fractures and the existence of intra-articular fragments. //Treatment// The objectives are to reduce the dislocation and, if possible, osteosynthesis of the femoral head.  To perform osteosynthesis of the femoral head, it is necessary that the vascularization of the femoral head is not affected, otherwise the risk of avascular necrosis and subsequent post-traumatic arthrosis is very high.

Spinal fracture,"//What is it?// The spine is made up of vertebrae that create the natural curves of the back. Between the vertebrae are intervertebral discs that act as shock absorbers and allow the spine to move. Muscles and ligaments connect the vertebrae and allow movement, providing support and stability. Each vertebra has an opening (foramen) in the center, which align to form the spinal canal. Protected by the vertebrae, the spinal cord and other nerve roots travel through the spinal canal. Nerves branch off from the spine, carrying messages between the brain and muscles. Other vertebral joints such as the facet bones ensure vertebral movements and rotation. The spinal column is divided into 3 segments: cervical, thoracic and lumbar. The most common vertebral fractures occur in the thoracic and lumbar spine. A spinal fracture is a serious injury, usually caused by a car accident, fall, or other high-impact accident. The energy required to severely fracture the spine can also cause spinal cord injuries or other damage that requires additional treatment. Men experience thoracic or lumbar spine fractures four times more often than women, and older adults with osteoporosis are also at higher risk. //Symptoms// Pain and changes in mobility, whether or not associated with neurological changes, are the main manifestations of the disease. If the spinal cord is involved, numbness, tingling, weakness, or bowel/urinary dysfunction may also occur. //Causes// They are typically caused by high-impact trauma, such as a car accident, fall from a great height, or sports accident. Osteoporosis, tumors, or other underlying conditions that weaken bones can also lead to fractures, even during normal daily activities. There are several types and their classification is based on the pattern of the injury and whether the spinal cord was also affected or not. //Diagnosis// The doctor performs a complete examination of the skull, chest, abdomen, pelvic region, limbs and spine. A neurological examination assesses the patient's mobility and sensation, as well as the ability to identify the position of all limbs. Testing the patient's reflexes helps determine if there is any damage to the spinal cord or peripheral nerves. After the physical examination, a radiological evaluation is necessary. Depending on the extent of the injuries, this may include X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs of various areas, including the thoracic and lumbar spine. The doctor will identify the fracture pattern, the best treatment, and whether surgery is necessary. //Treatment// Surgical treatment consists of instrumentation (with screws and bars) of adjacent levels. It may be necessary to replace the fractured vertebra with an implant (spacer) to regain its height. In cases caused by osteoporosis, the surgical procedure involves the use of bone cement inside the vertebral body, using a percutaneous technique (introduction of a cannula(s) through a small incision in the skin, with a balloon(s) that expands and allows the application of bone cement to fill the space).This procedure is performed under general anesthesia, with an inpatient stay of four to seven days. //Prevention// Prevention involves measures that avoid the main causes of impact that can damage the spine, particularly in terms of safe driving with a seat belt, preventing falls and the use of appropriate equipment when practicing sports - horse riding, mountaineering, climbing. Warnings about diving in shallow and unknown waters, caution when using trampolines and wearing a helmet when cycling are some examples of fracture prevention. Preventing osteoporosis is essential for the health of your spine. Shoreline Orthopaedics Load more;/ Back pain and injuries are complex and debilitating conditions.

Fracture of the femoral neck,"//What is it?// Fractures of the femoral neck occur between the head of the femur and the pertrochanteric region (between the lesser and greater trochanters).  They correspond to 50% of proximal femur fractures; They occur in men, on average, at the age of 72 and in women, at the age of 77.  Several studies confirm the exponential increase in the incidence of proximal femur fractures with advancing age, with this increase being accentuated after the age of 65 and for both sexes.  Fracture typology:  Low-energy trauma - more common in the elderly - fall with impact on the greater trochanter  High-energy trauma – young and elderly patients – falls from heights and car accidents  Cyclical stress - more common in athletes, military recruits and ballerinas //Symptoms// Impacted fractures and stress fractures may not present deformity, and the patient may be able to put weight on the fracture and only describe mild pain.  In the case of dislocated (dislocated) fractures, patients are unable to walk and have shortening and external rotation of the limb. //Diagnosis// X-rays of the pelvis and lateral view of the proximal femur are usually sufficient to make the diagnosis.  Sometimes, a CT scan may be necessary to clarify the fracture line, or in cases where the X-ray is not sufficiently clear. //Treatment// The head and neck of the femur have a complex vascular structure that determines the prognosis and therefore the treatment of these fractures varies according to the fracture line and the distance from the tops of the fracture.  Types of treatment:  Non-surgical: Reserved only for patients with other illnesses with extreme medical risk and where surgery could endanger their life; It may also be considered in dementia patients, without the ability to walk and with little pain.;/  Stress/fatigue fractures: non-surgical treatment with unloading and reduced physical activity can be performed. Surgical treatment with internal stabilization should be considered if conservative treatment fails.;/  Impacted, non-decoapted fractures: They may become decoapted if not stabilized. There is also the risk of avascular necrosis due to the risk of changes in the vascularization of the femoral head due to the fracture.;/  Decoapted/distant fractures: In young patients, reduction and fixation of the fracture is attempted. In elderly patients, prosthetic hip replacement is usually performed, which can be partial (hemiarthroplasty in patients with little functional requirement) or total hip replacement in less elderly patients, still with a significant level of activity.;/  Recovery from this type of injury involves early mobilization, lifting and gait training. The objective is to rehabilitate the patient to the functional level prior to the fracture.

Fracture of the wrist and hand,"//What is it?// Fractures of the wrist and hand can involve several bones, some small, such as the phalanges, and others larger, such as the metacarpals. A fracture occurs when enough force is applied to a bone to break it, causing pain, swelling, and functional disability, often associated with deformation. Fractures can be simple and aligned and stable, they can be unstable with a tendency to angle or rotate, and they can also be comminuted (with multiple bone fragments that are usually very unstable). An open fracture occurs when one of the bone fragments pierces the skin and requires special attention due to the risk of infection. In terms of grip, the possibilities are also diverse and it is important to analyze them individually. In fact, the wrist is made up of 8 small bones and also the radius and the ulna. These bones form several joints between themselves and are covered by cartilage. Osteoporosis increases the risk of wrist fractures. One of the most susceptible bones is the radius. Wrist fractures can be simple, when the bones are aligned and stabilized, or they can be unstable when the bone fragments move or change position. Proper alignment is essential to avoid future deformities and limited movement, with arthritis and pain.  Radius fractures are common in sports such as skateboarding and football. The severity varies with the degree of joint involvement being greater in high-contact sports (e.g. equestrian or motorized sports). The most common mechanism is falling onto the hand with the wrist in hyperextension. Pain, functional impotence and swelling occur. Initial imaging evaluation is done by radiography, but computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging may be necessary in joint fractures or when a ligament injury is suspected. The presence of numbness or tingling in the fingers suggests nerve damage. The goal of treatment is to maintain bone length, radial inclination, and congruence of the various radial joints. Nondisplaced fractures should be treated conservatively. Displaced fractures should undergo reduction and fixation.   The bones in the hand are very precisely aligned. If a finger fracture is not properly repaired, significant problems can occur. Even a single finger fracture can cause the entire hand to become misaligned, and without treatment, the finger will become stiff and painful. Generally speaking, finger fractures occur as a result of trauma to the hand, a direct impact or a fall. Even a ball can cause a broken finger. Symptoms include swelling and deformation in the fracture area, pain, hematoma formation, inability to move the finger. The bones in the fingers can fracture in different ways, including complete fractures, spiral fractures, fractures with fragments, etc. Alignment of the fractured finger can be done without surgery followed by immobilization for about 3 weeks. This immobilization may include the neighboring fingers to provide additional support and will be followed by an appropriate period of physical therapy.  This fracture deserves special treatment given the importance of the thumb. It is thanks to the thumb that it is possible to hold an object and a fracture of this finger increases the risk of arthritis later in life. The thumb is made up of two bones, the distal phalanx and the proximal phalanx, and the most serious fractures are those that affect the finger close to its joints, mainly in its connection with the wrist. These fractures are more difficult to treat and have a worse prognosis. The most common causes are direct impacts, such as falls, or those caused by a ball that you try to catch by pushing your thumb back. Fractures can occur through indirect mechanisms, such as muscle contraction or sprain, which can happen in sports such as wrestling, hockey, football and skiing. Calcium deficiencies increase the risk of this type of fracture. The use of appropriate protective material reduces the risk of thumb fracture, and good prior preparation and adequate nutrition are equally important. A thumb fracture is characterized by intense pain at the fracture site, swelling, limited movement, deformation, and a feeling of numbness or coldness in the thumb. A delay in treatment, with continued swelling, makes it more difficult for the bones to align correctly. Immobilization is important to prevent movement or dislocation of the fractured bones. This immobilization should be maintained for 6 weeks and, during this period, control X-rays will be taken. Surgery may be necessary depending on the location and amount of movement of the bone fragments. Surgery involves fixing the fragments internally or externally. Immobilization is maintained for 2 to 6 weeks and physiotherapy is started after this period. It may take about 3 months to regain full use of the hand. If the hand is kept in a stable position, these fractures heal well, although there is a risk of developing arthritis that can limit movement and strength in the thumb. Performing movements with the thumb in hot water and using objects designed to stimulate the movement of opening and closing the hand could help, although these strategies must always be defined by the orthopedic doctor.  The scaphoid is the most commonly fractured bone in the wrist (60% of cases). This fracture tends to be underdiagnosed and can be a threat to an athlete's competitive life, with possible progression to osteoarthritis. If left untreated, it can affect the entire mobility of the wrist. As such, early diagnosis and appropriate treatment are extremely important. Fractures of the scaphoid bone almost always result from a fall on the wrist in hyperextension and displaced towards the thumb, although there may be other mechanisms. The greater the extension of the wrist in the fall, the greater the risk of fracture of this bone. When the extension is less, the fracture of the radius is more likely. This type of fracture causes pain in the wrist, especially in the region of the anatomical snuffbox (small triangular cavity formed by the tendons of the thumb when it is extended). This pain should raise suspicion of a scaphoid fracture. Deformation or swelling is rare in this type of fracture, which can delay diagnosis. If this fracture is not visible on the initial radiological examination, the wrist should be immobilized and a new examination should be performed after two weeks. In addition to X-rays, scintigraphy, magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography are important tests for an early and accurate diagnosis.  The hand contains 27 bones. Fractures of the metacarpals and phalanges are common in several sports. The most common fracture is the “boxer's fracture” which occurs when you hit your hand against a surface with a clenched fist. In this fracture, the fifth metacarpal (in the little finger) becomes depressed and the tissues become tender and swollen. These fractures can occur in a fall, twisting motion, car accident, or in direct contact sports. They manifest themselves in the form of swelling, pain, deformation, inability to move one or more fingers, reduction in finger length, depressed knuckles and crossing of one finger over another when trying to clench the fist. Treatment involves realigning the bones, which is often possible without surgery. Immobilization is essential for 3 to 6 weeks. After this period, gentle hand movements should be started. Surgery may be needed to stabilize and align the bones. This is important because if the bones heal in the wrong position, loss of finger function can occur. //Symptoms// Fractures of the wrist and hand manifest as: severe pain that worsens with movement of the joint;/ edema (swelling);/ wrist deformity;/ pain when touching the affected area;/ //Causes// Medical conditions: Some clinical situations condition susceptibility to the occurrence of fractures: Osteoporosis or other bone disease;/ Osteoporosis or other bone disease Tobacco, this interferes with calcium absorption.;/ Tobacco, this interferes with calcium absorption. Restrictive diets with low calcium or vitamin D intake;/ Restrictive diets with low calcium or vitamin D intake Sports:Contact, snow or jumping sports have a high risk of trauma to the wrist and hand and resulting fractures. //Diagnosis// The diagnosis of a wrist and hand fracture is made through medical evaluation and X-ray. Clinically, the presence of pain on palpation of the radius area, deformity and edema suggest the presence of a fracture, which is confirmed with the X-ray study. Computed tomography (CT) is rarely performed to diagnose a fracture of the wrist or hand, but it can be useful in studying the characteristics of complex fractures in order to plan surgical treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging is useful in studying non-osseous lesions that may be associated with fractures of the radius, but is generally not performed immediately after the fracture, but in situations where complaints persist that cannot be explained by the fracture. //Treatment// Clinical evaluation and x-ray are mandatory to evaluate the fracture and its treatment. Immobilization with a splint or cast may be indicated for stable and aligned fractures. Some fractures can be reduced and fixed percutaneously with steel wires or screws. Others may require open reduction and fixation with screws or plates. In some cases it may be necessary to use a bone graft to complement the stabilization of the fracture. External fixators may be an alternative in multifragmented fractures. Treatment depends on factors such as the patient's age, activity level, occupation, dominant hand, previous injuries, presence of arthritis or other diseases. Immobilization is important in well-aligned fractures or those that have already been reduced. This immobilization is necessary for several weeks. The mechanisms for fixing a fracture involve the use of different types of materials (plates, screws, implants) and the fixation can be internal or external. In cases of loss of bone material, it may be necessary to place a graft. Anatomical alignment is not required for a good functional outcome. Fractures with good bone alignment can be expected to have a good functional recovery. Problems with fracture healing include stiffness, malalignment with rotation or angulation of the finger, infection, delayed healing or nonunion. Fractures in children can affect bone growth. A physical therapy program with exercises and splinting may be indicated. During the healing process, it is important to maintain flexibility in your fingers and shoulder. Once your wrist is stable, you should begin an exercise program to restore strength, flexibility, and function. Recovery time varies and can last several months. Sometimes, some stiffness and pain may persist. Complications of fractures are directly related to their characteristics, the treatment carried out and the rehabilitation performed. Limitation of wrist mobility: Pain and restriction of wrist movement usually decrease markedly about 2 months after cast removal or surgery and by 2 years improvements have occurred.  If the fracture is very complex or the patient does not comply with the proposed rehabilitation exercises, limited movement and pain may persist.;/ Osteoarthritis: Fractures that extend into the joint cause premature aging of the joint and can develop into osteoarthritis after a few years.;/ Osteoarthritis: Fractures that extend into the joint cause premature aging of the joint and can develop into osteoarthritis after a few years.

Pertrochanteric intertrochanteric fracture,"//What is it?// Pertrochanteric, extracapsular fractures occur in the region between the greater and lesser trochanter of the proximal femur. They occur in an area of ​​trabecular bone, with an abundant blood supply, so, unlike fractures of the femoral neck, osteonecrosis and non-consolidation are uncommon.  Pertrochanteric fractures occur, on average, at age 70. They correspond to around 50% of all fractures of the proximal femur and are more common in women, in a ratio that can reach up to 8:1.  More than 90% of pertrochanteric fractures in the elderly result from a simple fall with direct impact on the greater trochanter. //Symptoms// Patients with pertrochanteric fractures are generally unable to walk and have a shortened limb with external rotation. //Diagnosis// Normally, simple radiographs are sufficient to make the diagnosis and outline the fracture line. //Treatment// Non-surgical: associated with a higher mortality rate than surgical treatment. Reserved only for patients with other pathologies with extreme medical risk in which surgery could endanger the patient's life. It can also be considered in demented, non-ambulatory patients with little pain.  Surgical: the objective is stable internal fixation to allow early mobilization with load on the operated limb. The stability of the operated fracture depends on the bone quality, the fracture pattern, the quality of the reduction and the position of the implant. Surgery must be performed early, as soon as the patient is medically stabilized. Usually, fracture reduction and internal stabilization with osteosynthesis material are performed; on rare occasions, prosthetic replacement may be necessary in patients in whom the initial osteosynthesis surgery has failed and a new osteosynthesis is not feasible.  Recovery depends on early mobilization of patients with walking training and weight bearing on the operated limb according to the surgeon's instructions.

Fractures,"//What is it?// Whenever a bone is subjected to a force that exceeds its adaptive capacity, the bone breaks, that is, we suffer a fracture. Depending on the mechanism and intensity of the injury, the fracture may be complete or incomplete, oriented in different directions, or result in multiple fragments (comminuted fracture). In some cases, there is a concomitant injury to the skin, leaving the bone in direct contact with the outside (open fracture), with an increased risk of complications, namely infection. Most of the time, a fracture results from considerable trauma, but in cases of osteoporosis or tumors (pathological fracture) it can occur with low-intensity trauma. Repetitive minor trauma can also lead to the development of a particular type of fracture, the stress fracture. //Symptoms// Most patients complain of marked pain in the affected area and functional disability. Other common symptoms are edema (swelling) and deformity. //Diagnosis// The history and clinical examination, including a description of the accident, usually lead to suspicion of a fracture. An X-ray confirms the diagnosis and helps define a treatment plan. In some cases, a computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be necessary. //Treatment// The goal of any treatment of a fracture, whether conservative or surgical, is to replace and maintain the fractured fragments in their correct position until the bone consolidates (i.e. until the bone fuses), which occurs in a variable amount of time depending on the bone affected. The replacement of the fragments in their position is called reduction, which can be done by manipulation or surgically. Once the fracture has been reduced, it is necessary to maintain it in that position, for which reason plaster immobilization, orthoses (splints, braces, etc.), or external fixators (devices that are placed on the bone at a distance from the fracture and joined by bars outside the skin, commonly used in cases of open fractures). When surgery is chosen, the reduction can be maintained using screws, plates and rods or pins, which, as long as they do not cause symptoms, can be maintained indefinitely. Several factors will interfere with the consolidation time, some dependent on the fracture (affected bone, location, type of fracture, etc.), others on the patient (age, nutritional status, associated diseases, etc.). In a study carried out in Sweden, it was concluded that the probability of a child (up to 16 years old) suffering a fracture was 42% for boys and 27% for girls. From these numbers it is clear that fractures are relatively common in children, but why does this happen? Children's bones have accelerated metabolic activity due to the growth process. They grow in length due to the growth cartilages at the ends of the long bones, and they grow in width due to the periosteum that covers the bones along their length. Long bones are tubular to be able to absorb deforming forces during a fall without fracturing. Children's bones are immature and therefore more flexible and can absorb impacts more easily. However, in the first years of life, they are not very resistant to twisting movements and therefore it is not uncommon for a child who has just started to walk to suffer a small fracture of the lower limb just because the foot gets stuck on the floor or because the thigh gets stuck in the railing. from the bed. Children also suffer similar fractures to adults, such as joint fractures or diaphyseal fractures (end of the bone), all depending on the fracture mechanism. But they are subject to another type of fractures related to the child's anatomical differences (plastic, compression, green branch, epiphyseal or growth cartilage deformity). The doctor has to assess not only the type of fracture but also the body's ability to respond to each fracture. On the other hand, given that the child is growing, it is necessary to consider the influence that the fracture may have on bone growth, which is sometimes not easy to predict at the initial stage. For this reason, complex fractures should be evaluated by orthopedists familiar with the treatment of children. Fractures involving the elbow in children are those that cause the most medical problems, not only due to the risk of vascular changes but also due to the difficulty of treating them, due to anatomical conditions. The most relevant complication of fractures in children is a growth disorder, however, these are rare. Children often “break” because they are very active and fall very easily, using their hands as bumpers. Hence the high frequency of fractures involving the hands and the distal end of the forearm (more than 50%). These are generally simple fractures (plastic, compression or green branch deformity) and without any functional repercussions in the future. Adolescent fractures, normally associated with sports, can be more complex, especially when located in the lower limbs and can be responsible for late sequelae. In conclusion, we can say that fractures in children and adolescents are relatively common, but in most cases they are simple situations, easy to treat and with no repercussions in adulthood. Elbow fractures in children, or lower limb fractures in teenagers may be the exception with an increased risk of complications.

Stress fractures,"//What is it?// This type of fracture corresponds to a small break in the continuity of the bone. They can result from overuse, such as in high-impact sports (long-distance running or basketball). Tennis, gymnastics and dancing are also associated with a higher risk of stress fractures, given the repeated impact of the foot on the ground.  Most of these fractures occur in the weight-bearing bones of the foot and lower leg.  When muscles are fatigued, they are no longer able to absorb the shock resulting from repeated impacts and transfer this stress to the bones, which can cause small fractures.  The most common sites are the second and third metatarsals of the foot, the calcaneus, the fibula, and a bone in the midfoot. //Symptoms// One of the most common symptoms is pain that develops gradually, increases with activities that involve weight bearing and decreases with rest.  Swelling of the foot or outer ankle and tenderness at the fracture site may occur.  Sometimes a hematoma forms. //Causes// As noted, stress fractures occur in high-impact activities and depend on the frequency, duration, and intensity of exercise.  People who don't exercise can also develop stress fractures. In the presence of osteoporosis or other diseases that weaken the bone, even daily activities can cause stress fractures. This condition is referred to as bone insufficiency.  Poor conditioning, i.e. doing too much exercise too soon, is a major risk factor for stress fractures.  Using worn or inadequate equipment is another factor to consider, as well as a change in the surface on which the exercise is performed.  An inadequate technique that alters the mechanics of absorbing impacts on the ground.  Sometimes, the presence of a blister, callus or tendonitis affects the way the foot absorbs impact from the ground and can increase the risk by forcing a smaller area of ​​bone to support more weight than usual.  In females, the absence or irregularity of the menstrual period is associated with a decrease in bone density, increasing the risk of fractures. //Diagnosis// Medical observation and clinical history are the starting point for diagnosis.  Stress fractures are difficult to visualize on an x-ray unless they are healing.  Magnetic resonance imaging is the most effective diagnostic tool for detecting this type of fracture. //Treatment// Whenever a stress fracture is suspected, it is very important to immediately stop activity and rest. Ignoring the pain can lead to a complete fracture.  Ice should be applied and the foot elevated above the level of the heart. Anti-inflammatories help control pain and swelling but can slow bone healing.  Treatment depends on the location of the fracture and its severity and aims to return to the previous level of activity.  As mentioned, rest is very important. Generally speaking, it takes 6 to 8 weeks for a stress fracture to heal.  During this period, activities that do not involve putting pressure on the leg and foot, such as cycling or swimming, can be carried out. However, it is essential not to start any type of activity without medical approval.  The use of protective shoes, which reduce pressure on the foot and leg, or a splint that secures the foot and allows for more favorable healing may be recommended. The use of crutches also aids recovery.  In some cases, surgery is important, using internal fixation of the bone with screws or plates, which allows for faster recovery.  Once healing is complete, activities can be gradually resumed. One option is to alternate days of rest with days of activity, gradually increasing the frequency, duration and intensity of exercise.  Another strategy is to alternate the types of exercises performed in order to avoid repeated strain on the foot and ankle. If this is not done, more extensive fractures that are more difficult to heal may occur, causing chronic problems. //Prevention// A healthy diet is very important and should contain calcium and vitamin D to stimulate bone formation and strengthen its structure.  Using appropriate equipment in good condition helps reduce strain on the foot and leg.  Performing different exercises in an alternating manner avoids repetitive stress, the main cause of stress fractures.  Any new activity should be started gradually, increasing duration, speed and distance at a rate of approximately 10% per week.  Strength training helps prevent muscle fatigue and prevents the reduction in bone density that tends to occur with age.

Shoulder fractures,
Fractures in children,"//What is it?// Many times, after a fracture, frightened parents ask: are our child's bones okay? The fall was so small... In a study carried out in Sweden it was concluded that the probability of a child (up to 16 years old) suffering a fracture was 42% for boys and 27% for girls.

However, in the first years of life, they are not very resistant to twisting movements and therefore it is not uncommon for a child who has just started to walk to suffer a small fracture of the lower limb just because the foot gets stuck on the floor or because the thigh gets stuck in the railing. from the bed.  Children also suffer similar fractures to adults, such as joint fractures or diaphyseal fractures (end of the bone), all depending on the fracture mechanism. But they are subject to another type of fractures related to the child's anatomical differences (plastic, compression, green branch, epiphyseal or growth cartilage deformity). //Treatment// The doctor has to assess not only the type of fracture but also the body's ability to respond to each fracture. On the other hand, given that the child is growing, it is necessary to consider the influence that the fracture may have on bone growth, which is sometimes not easy to predict at the initial stage. For this reason, complex fractures must be evaluated by orthopedists familiar with the treatment of children. Fractures involving the elbow in children are those that cause the most medical problems, not only due to the risk of vascular changes but also due to the difficulty of treating them, due to anatomical conditions. //Complications// The most relevant complication of fractures in children is a growth disorder, however, these are rare. Children often “break” because they are very active and fall very easily, using their hands as bumpers. Hence the high frequency of fractures involving the hands and the distal end of the forearm (more than 50%). These are generally simple fractures (plastic deformity, compression or green branch) and without any functional repercussions in the future. Fractures in adolescents, normally associated with sports, can be more complex, especially when located in the lower limbs, and can be responsible for late sequelae.

Furunculo,"//What is it?// A boil is a skin infection that originates in a hair follicle or sebaceous gland. It initially appears as a small reddish pimple, which turns white or yellowish as pus begins to form. Boils can appear on the skin of any area of ​​the body, but the most common locations are: Face;/ Neck;/ Armpits;/ Shoulders;/ Costas;/ Buttocks;/  Areas where there is greater sweat production (for example, armpits and thighs) are equally prone to the appearance of these infections. Boils can also develop on the skin of the ears, nose and eyelids (in this case they are called stye). When several boils appear in a group, the infection becomes more serious and is called anthrax. //Symptoms// The boil begins as a hard, red, painful bump just over a centimeter in size. After a few days, it may evolve into a softer, more painful lesion and form a blister filled with pus. The main symptoms include: Swelling;/ Redness;/ Dor;/  In the presence of large or multiple boils, general malaise, fatigue, swollen lymph nodes and fever may develop. //Causes// Most boils are caused by the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, which exists on the skin and in the hair follicles of the nostrils and does not usually cause lesions - the so-called ""saprophytic flora"". However, when there is a small cut, bacteria can enter the hair follicle and cause infection. There are certain conditions and health problems that can make a person more susceptible to this infection: Diabetes;/ Obesity;/ Weakened immune system;/ Malnutrition;/ Acne;/ Eczema;/ //Diagnosis// The diagnosis of a boil is clinical and is made by the doctor by observing the lesion. However, if the patient has recurrent infections or has had an infection that has not responded to treatment, a sample of the pus may be sent to the laboratory for analysis. //Treatment// Most boils can be treated at home. Applying warm, moist compresses several times a day can lessen pain and help the boil open and drain pus. If the boil does not drain spontaneously, it may have to be drained and antibiotics may be needed for local or oral application. Situations that may require medical intervention due to the potential for severity and complications are boils located, for example, on the face or near the eyes. Likewise, in the case of patients with associated pathology such as diabetes or changes in the immune system, boils, especially if painful, associated with fever or large in volume, must be monitored by the attending physician. //Prevention// Boils are not contagious, but the bacteria that cause them can be easily transmitted from person to person through contact with contaminated skin or objects. Preventing boils includes good hand hygiene, carefully cleaning cuts in the skin, and not sharing objects such as razors, tweezers, or nail clippers. In situations where boils are frequent, it may be necessary to use antiseptic soap, antibiotic ointment or possibly oral antibiotic treatment.

Wager,"//What is it?// It corresponds to a disturbance in the fluency of speech and, therefore, in communication, in which the person knows exactly what they want to say but their speech is characterized by repetitions, prolongations, unexpected pauses or blocks in which the sound is interrupted. In some cases, it may be associated with changes in facial or body movements. It is a common condition, and it is estimated that more than 68 million people in the world have it, that is, 1% of the world's population. In Portugal, the incidence of stuttering affects around 100 thousand people. It is about four times more common in males. Approximately 5% of all children go through a period in which their speech may contain repetitions, pauses, blocks and prolongations. It occurs for about three months and in 75% of cases they recover spontaneously. If this does not happen or if other associated behaviors appear, it is necessary to consult a pediatrician. Stuttering is important because of its frequency and because it can be associated with reduced self-esteem, social isolation, anxiety and, in the case of children, be a factor in ridicule or segregation by peers. //Symptoms// Stuttering is characterized by disturbances in the fluency of verbal speech, which can take different forms: Multiple repetitions of sounds or syllables of words;;/ Sound prolongations;/ Inserting a sound into speech;/ Raising the timbre and volume of the voice;/ Trembling or involuntary movements around the lips during the production of a sound, word or syllable;/ Unusual number of pauses, word substitutions, interjections or phrases;/ Fear of pronouncing words that are more difficult;/ Problems starting or maintaining the pace of speech;/ //Causes// Genetic factors are important, since there is a family history in around 60% of cases. Neurological and psychosocial causes are also possible, related, for example, to the demands of the environment and linguistic development in childhood. A head injury or stroke can also cause stuttering. Emotional trauma can also be the cause, although it is now known that this association is very rare. Stuttering is not caused by: Nervousness;/ Stress;/ Scare;/ Traumas and/or emotional states;/ Tongue size;/ Parental Negligence;/ //Diagnosis// It is usually carried out by a speech therapist and involves a set of questions and tests that confirm the presence of this disorder. Diagnosis is not always easy because there are similar conditions in other diseases, in addition to stuttering being transient. Whenever there are doubts, it is important to investigate other clinical conditions that may be associated with speech disorders. //Treatment// There are several successful methodologies for treating stuttering. As a rule, early intervention is ideal. Speech therapy is used frequently and there are electronic devices that can help;;/ The involvement of parents and family members is very important;;/ They are, generally speaking, long-term treatments;;/ A speech therapist with experience in working with children, young people and adults can teach methods and techniques that make speech more fluent;;/ It is important to let the person who stutters finish speaking and resist the temptation to help or correct their speech;;/ It is also essential to avoid criticism so as not to diminish the self-esteem of affected individuals.;/ Although a number of medications have been tried for this condition, none have appeared to be truly effective. //Prevention// There is no way to prevent it, but it is possible to prevent it from becoming a chronic problem by using early diagnosis and treatment.

Enlarged lymph nodes in children,
Gastritis,"//What is it?// Under normal conditions, the stomach wall is protected from the effects of the acid produced in it. When it is damaged, this acid can penetrate the mucosa, damaging it even further. Some gastritis cases develop with erosion of the mucosa, causing bleeding and ulcers. There are several types of gastritis: acute and chronic. In the first case, it appears suddenly and intensely. In the second, the bacterium Helicobacter pylori is one of its responsible agents. It is one of the most common infections in the world, affecting more than 50% of humanity and more than 90% of adults in some continents and countries, including Portugal. Here it is estimated that around 50% of eight-year-old children already have gastritis caused by Helicobacter pylori, and the number of infected people increases with age, such that this percentage rises to more than 90% in individuals aged 50. . In Portugal, the prevalence of patients without complaints is around 80%. And if left untreated, it can last for years or even a lifetime. //Symptoms// Many patients report pain or discomfort in the upper abdomen but in many cases there are no symptoms. In addition to pain, nausea and vomiting may occur;;/ In many cases, there is a feeling of fullness after meals;;/ In the case of erosive gastritis, vomiting or bloody stools may occur;;/ It can become complicated, progressing to ulcers, the formation of polyps and benign or malignant tumors;;/ In chronic forms caused by Helicobacter pylori, mucosal atrophy may occur, with destruction of the cells that produce acid and enzymes essential for digestion, which may be the cause of some types of cancer. //Causes// Most cases of chronic gastritis are a consequence of Helicobacter pylori infection. This bacteria is transmitted between people through contaminated food or water. In the case of erosive gastritis, whether acute or chronic, the most common cause is prolonged use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, such as aspirin or ibuprofen. Alcohol, cocaine and radiation can also cause erosive gastritis. It can occur after an accident, major surgery, serious illness or extensive burns. In these cases, we talk about stress gastritis. They also arise in the context of autoimmune diseases, Crohn's disease and infections caused by viruses, parasites and bacteria other than Helicobacter pylori. The risk of gastritis increases with age because the mucosa lining the stomach tends to become thinner and therefore more fragile. The presence of bile reflux into the stomach is also the cause of gastritis. //Diagnosis// The most important test is endoscopy with biopsy of the stomach. Biopsy means the collection of small samples of mucosal tissue that are later analyzed. It is also useful to carry out radiological examinations, laboratory analyses, stool studies and tests to identify Helicobacter pylori. This can be detected through a simple breath test. //Treatment// It is important to use medications that reduce stomach acid levels in order to reduce abdominal pain or discomfort. These medications include antacids, histamine receptor blockers and proton pump inhibitors, and it is always up to the doctor to select the most appropriate treatment for each case. If the cause is the use of anti-inflammatories, it is important that this medication is reviewed and changed accordingly. Treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection is very important, even if there are no symptoms, as it can lead to the formation of ulcers or stomach cancer. Treatment usually consists of a combination of proton pump inhibitors and antibiotics. //Prevention// There are some simple measures that can help alleviate your symptoms and prevent their appearance: Eat several times a day, in small quantities, in order to facilitate the digestion process that occurs in the stomach, without overloading it;;/ Avoid irritating foods such as spicy, acidic, fried or fatty foods. Alcohol should be consumed in moderation and, in more severe cases, should be avoided;;/ Properly managing stress is equally important in alleviating symptoms;;/ Wash your hands frequently and try to eat well-cooked food, as Helicobacter pylori can be transmitted through water or food.

Gastroenteritis,"//What is it?// Gastroenteritis refers to an irritation and inflammation of the digestive tract, including the stomach and intestine. The most common causes are viral agents, bacteria, parasites and food poisoning. It is a very common problem in childhood and young children. Children up to three years of age have, on average, one to two episodes of gastroenteritis per year, with a peak incidence between six and 23 months. Diarrhea usually lasts an average of five to seven days. The cause varies between countries, depending on factors such as geographic location, socioeconomic factors and climate. Acute gastroenteritis is one of the most common causes of mortality in children in developing countries. Most deaths occur in areas where access to clean water and health care is limited. Around 40% of cases of diarrhea in the first five years of life are due to Rotavirus and 30% to other viruses. In 20% to 30%, bacterial agents are identified (Salmonella, Campylobacter jejuni, enterocolitic Yersinia, pathogenic E. colienteropathogenic or Clostridium difficile). In southern European countries, such as Portugal, Salmonella is the bacteria most frequently involved. //Symptoms// The usual complaints are diarrhea, abdominal pain, cramps, nausea and vomiting, but fever and headaches can also occur. They usually only last a few days, but can last up to a week. When diarrhea or vomiting is severe and persistent, dehydration may occur, which is manifested by sunken eyes, dry mouth, a thick tongue sensation and a reduction in the volume of urine, which takes on a dark color. It is important to emphasize that gastroenteritis can be extremely infectious. Infected individuals should wash their hands after using the bathroom and before preparing food for others. Ideally, the patient should remain at home until symptoms (diarrhea and/or vomiting) have been absent for at least 48 hours. //Causes// Most are caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated by bacteria (Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, E. coli, among others) or viruses (Rotavirus, Norvovirus, Adenovirus, among others). Salmonella infections can be contracted by touching reptiles, such as turtles or iguanas, and then putting your fingers in your mouth. It can also be transmitted between people, especially if someone with diarrhea doesn't wash their hands well after having a bowel movement. //Diagnosis// Generally, symptoms of diarrhea and vomiting suggest the diagnosis and no specific tests are necessary. A well-prepared clinical history and careful physical examination are essential, as they provide crucial information for diagnostic and therapeutic guidance. In severe diarrhea, when complications occur or there are doubts about the diagnosis, other investigations may be carried out according to the clinical picture. Microbiological examination of stool should not be performed routinely. //Treatment// Treatment involves drinking plenty of fluids, especially water, to avoid dehydration. It is important not to go without eating if possible. As symptoms improve, the patient can gradually include soft foods such as cooked cereal, bananas, rice, applesauce, or toasted bread into the diet. Most do not need anti-diarrheal medications, but these can be purchased at the pharmacy. This type of drug is not recommended for children. If vomiting is persistent, antiemetics can be used. Antibiotics are only prescribed for some forms of bacterial gastroenteritis. In severe cases, especially in children, hospitalization may be necessary for proper treatment and hydration. //Prevention// The best way to avoid it is by following hygiene measures. It is essential to always wash your hands after going to the bathroom, before handling food and after gardening or handling pets. Towels should not be shared with a person who has gastroenteritis and the bathrooms they use should be washed regularly. Patients with gastroenteritis should not go to school or work until at least 48 hours after the last diarrhea or vomiting to avoid infecting others.

Endoscopic gastroplasty,"//What is it?// The EndoSleeve or APOLLO method, also known as Endoscopic Gastroplasty, is a new scarless treatment for gastric reduction and consists of sutures inserted into the internal cavity of the stomach to limit the volume of the stomach. Endosleeve is not an operation, but an endoscopic procedure: sutures in the internal cavity of the stomach are inserted through an endoscope through the patient's mouth. The procedure is performed under general anesthesia in a surgical center with all safety measures and by specialists. //Who is it suitable for?// Patients with mild to moderate obesity, as well as patients at high cardiopulmonary risk and the elderly may be indicated for this Endoscopic Gastroplasty. The endoscopic procedure will not be indicated when the patient has more severe obesity; in these cases, surgical therapies must be performed, as they are more effective. In general, Endoscopic Gastroplasty has the same application for patients who would previously need a gastric balloon, but more definitively (the balloon always has to be removed). //How is it done?// The Apollo Overstich technology is inserted endoscopically during an oral endoscopy under general anaesthesia. Endoscopic Gastroplasty typically takes about an hour. The patient is then initially allowed to consume a liquid diet immediately after the procedure. Thereafter, food intake is slowly advanced through nutritional counselling. //The results// The resulting reduction in stomach capacity allows for rapid satiety when small amounts of food are consumed. This system allows for a reduction in stomach volume without post-operative incisions, thus avoiding the disadvantages of traditional surgery. With EndoSleeve therapy, there is a reduction in appetite and a lasting feeling of satiety, leading to weight loss. //After bariatric surgery// Patients who have undergone bariatric surgeries such as Gastric Bypass or Gastric Sleeve, and who suffer from problems such as Dumping, Reflux, diarrhea or who progressively gain weight, can benefit from this technology. The Endoscopic Gastroplasty procedure can reduce the diameter and volumes of previous surgeries, returning weight loss, being effective for many of the aforementioned complications of surgery. Surgical treatment for obesity and diabetes can be performed using different techniques, depending on the objective and characteristics of each person. Diabetics are at risk for COVID-19 infection, not because they have a greater chance of contracting it, but rather because of the severity of the complications. Diabetes in children is increasingly common and is a chronic disease that can have several complications. Keeping it under control is essential.

Giardiase,"//What is it?// It is an intestinal infection caused by the parasite Giardia lamblia (also known as G. intestinalis or G. duodenalis). Transmission usually occurs through ingestion of contaminated water, with outbreaks sometimes occurring in daycare centers and day care centers. As it originates in water, contagion can occur in rivers, lakes, water from municipal fountains, swimming pools and jacuzzis. Or it can also happen through food and direct contact with infected people. It is more common in children and patients with HIV/AIDS, cystic fibrosis and other forms of immunodeficiency. In work carried out in the North of Portugal, in children aged between one and five years, an infection rate of 3.4% was detected by Giardia lamblia. This type can occur in any region of the world, with a special focus on areas with poor hygiene and basic sanitation conditions. The main risk groups are children, people who care for them and populations without access to drinking water. //Symptoms// The disease can be asymptomatic or manifest itself in acute forms through diarrhea (very liquid and fetid), abdominal pain, nausea and flatulence and, in chronic forms, through abdominal distension, anorexia, fatigue, weight loss and malabsorption which, for In turn, it is a frequent cause of iron deficiency anemia, together with inadequate iron intake and blood loss. It is important to emphasize that, even in the absence of symptoms, a person can harbor the parasite and transmit it through feces. Symptoms, when they occur, appear one to two weeks after exposure to the parasite. They persist for two to four weeks but may last longer or there may be relapses. The most common complications are dehydration, developmental delay (in the case of children) and lactose intolerance that may persist after healing. //Causes// This parasite lives in the intestines of animals and humans. It can remain there for months in the form of cysts. When they are released, they are eliminated in the feces. Ingestion of water or food contaminated by these parasites can trigger infection. In the case of food, as a rule, infection occurs during handling without proper care and hand washing. However, since heat destroys the parasite, cooked food is a rare source of giardiasis in industrialized countries. Direct contagion can occur, for example, when parents change their children's diapers and they are infected. For the same reason, professionals who work in daycare centers are more exposed to this parasite. //Diagnosis// Diagnosis is made by detecting the parasite or Giardia cysts in the feces by direct microscopy or by testing the serum. To be effective, this must be repeated over several days. It is also possible to analyze the liquid aspirate or perform a duodenal biopsy. //Treatment// In children and adults who are infected but have no symptoms, treatment is not necessary unless there is a risk of transmission. Therapy should be prescribed for symptomatic individuals, for asymptomatic carriers in whom there is a risk of contagion, for pregnant women or people with immunodeficiency. The most commonly used medications are tinidazole, metronidazole or nitazoxanide. The latter exists in a liquid formulation, useful for children. //Prevention// No medicine can prevent it. Thus, it involves measures such as washing hands after using toilet facilities, after changing a diaper and before eating or preparing food. If soap and water are not available, an alcohol-based sanitizer is a good alternative. You should avoid drinking unfiltered or unboiled water from wells, lakes or rivers (for at least ten minutes). You should not swallow potentially contaminated water in swimming pools. When traveling to places where the water supply is unsafe, the alternative is to always consume bottled water, which is also used to brush your teeth. In these places, you should avoid ice and eat fruit or vegetables, even if you peel them yourself. Using a condom is a fundamental way of preventing various sexually transmitted diseases and, in the case of anal sex, it prevents infection by Giardia.

Glaucoma,"//What is it?// Depending on the type, the mechanisms are different. In general, what happens in glaucoma is a disturbance in the dynamics of intraocular fluids that causes them to accumulate, with a consequent increase in pressure on the delicate nerve cells that are the basis of vision, causing their death and eventual blindness. In addition to this effect, there are other mechanisms of a vascular nature also associated with glaucoma, sometimes even with normal intraocular pressures. This is why regular assessment is important, even in the absence of complaints. It is one of the main causes of blindness in adults in the Western world. It is estimated that one in seven blind individuals is a victim of this disease. Almost everyone has normal vision for part of their lives, as glaucoma rarely presents before the age of 35. Vision loss usually occurs at age 40, 50 or 60 and cannot be recovered. For this reason, early diagnosis is the key to preventing this pathology. According to the Directorate-General for Health, in Portugal, around 200,000 people have intraocular hypertension and of these, a third suffer from glaucoma. Around six thousand may progress to irreversible blindness and/or marked degradation of the visual field. //Symptoms// There are two main forms of glaucoma, acute and chronic. The acute form appears suddenly, causing blurred vision, redness and intense pain in and around the eyes. Chronic, more common, progresses more slowly and is not painful. Those affected are only vaguely bothered by the symptoms, which are transient, and therefore postpone seeing an ophthalmologist. Higher than normal intraocular pressure causes destruction of the thin and delicate nerve fibers that form the optic nerve. Since it is this nerve that transmits visual messages from the eyes to the brain, its health is essential for good vision. Under prolonged high intraocular pressure, the optic nerve deteriorates and the patient's visual field gradually becomes smaller. Surprisingly, most people do not notice these changes until extensive loss of peripheral vision occurs. If the damage to the optic nerve is not stopped, glaucoma causes tunnel vision and permanent blindness that cannot be restored by treatment. This process can occur within a few years. //Causes// Some of the risk factors already identified are a family history of glaucoma, myopia, high blood pressure and diabetes. In general, age is important in its onset, since it is a disease with a significant vascular degenerative component. Although there are also rare forms of congenital and infantile glaucoma. //Diagnosis// In an Ophthalmology consultation, where vision is assessed, intraocular pressure measured and the eyes properly observed. Whenever the doctor suspects glaucoma, additional, simple and non-invasive tests are requested, which allow for an accurate and quick diagnosis. This ophthalmological evaluation should be carried out regularly, at least once a year. //Treatment// For treatment to be fully effective, it must be started before serious damage to the optic nerve occurs. This is why early diagnosis is essential. The doctor can detect things that a glaucoma patient cannot: optic nerve abnormalities and subtle changes in the visual field. It is these signs, more than elevated intraocular pressure, that indicate the presence of glaucoma. There are currently several treatments for glaucoma. In most cases, one or more eye drops are applied to control intraocular pressure. It is a simple and very effective therapy as long as it is maintained regularly. As alternatives, laser or surgery can be used. The option for the most appropriate treatment must always be decided individually, based on the assessment carried out by the doctor. //Prevention// There is no way to prevent glaucoma. What can be done is to prevent its progression to severe forms with vision impairment. Therefore, it is essential that diagnosis and treatment are early. General Directorate of Health. National Vision Health Program, 2008 Glaucoma Research Foundation (http://www.glaucoma.org) Johns Hopkins Medicine (http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/) Because it is diagnosed late, it is one of the main causes of blindness in the world. In Portugal, glaucoma affects around 100 thousand people.

Glomerulonephritis,"//What is it?// It is a form of kidney disease in which the glomeruli, which filter metabolic wastes and fluids from the blood, are damaged. It can be defined as an inflammatory, non-purulent, bilateral and symmetrical process that fundamentally or initially affects the renal glomeruli. If this disease is not stopped, the kidneys may stop functioning, leading to renal failure. Glomerulonephritis can be acute, when it develops suddenly, or chronic. Acute forms can occur after a throat or skin infection and sometimes improve spontaneously. Damage to the glomeruli allows loss of blood and protein through urine and is an important cause of kidney dysfunction. In children it corresponds to around 27% of cases and, in adults, around 8%. In Portugal, some studies point to this pathology as the cause of kidney disease in children in around 20%. Men tend to be more affected than women. //Symptoms// The most common symptoms are bloody urine (dark, rust-colored or brown) or foamy urine (due to the presence of excess proteins), swelling of the face, eyes, ankles, feet or abdomen, abdominal pain, blood in vomit or in the stools, cough and difficulty breathing, diarrhea, increased number of urinations, fever, feeling tired, loss of appetite, muscle and joint pain, and nosebleeds. Glomerulonephritis can progress to other complications such as acute nephrotic syndrome, blood disorders, chronic kidney disease, recurrent urinary infections, terminal renal failure, fluid accumulation with heart failure or pulmonary edema, increased potassium levels, high blood pressure, and greater susceptibility to other infections. //Causes// It can result from changes in the immune system, but the cause is often not known. In about 25% of cases there is no history of kidney disease. Glomerulonephritis can develop rapidly, with loss of kidney function within weeks or months. Risk factors include diseases of the blood or lymphatic system, exposure to chemical solvents, a history of cancer, streptococcal and viral infections (Heptatitis B, cytomegalovirus) or abscesses. Other conditions that increase the risk of glomerulonephritis include amyloidosis, some vasculitis and polyarteritis, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, use of anti-inflammatory drugs, Henoch-Schonlein purpura, lupus and various kidney diseases. //Diagnosis// As symptoms sometimes develop slowly, diagnosis depends on identifying changes in urine tests, requested during a routine consultation or for another reason. Blood tests are also useful, as well as the presence of signs of high blood pressure. These can detect signs of anemia, changes in albumin levels and can identify various markers of kidney or other disease. An abdominal CT scan or a renal ultrasound may also be requested. The diagnosis is confirmed by performing a kidney biopsy. //Treatment// It depends on the cause, type and severity (temporary and reversible or likely to worsen). Blood pressure must be controlled and this is one of the key points for successful treatment. In addition to medication for hypertension, corticosteroids and drugs that control the immune system may be useful. Plasmapheresis, a technique that allows the removal of circulating antibodies, may be useful in some types of glomerulonephritis. It is also important to limit the intake of salt, fluids and proteins. When kidney failure occurs, hemodialysis or a kidney transplant may be necessary. //Prevention// There is no way to prevent most forms of glomerulonephritis. Some types can be prevented by reducing or avoiding exposure to organic solvents, mercury, and anti-inflammatory drugs. Blood pressure control is also essential.
