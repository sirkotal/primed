Laryngitis,"//What is it?// Laryngitis is a condition in which inflammation and edema of the larynx occurs, which is the respiratory organ where the vocal cords are located. The larynx plays a fundamental role in breathing, swallowing and speaking. It can be acute or chronic, although in most cases the condition is temporary and does not have serious consequences. It is a common situation and can become chronic in around ⅕ of the population throughout their lives. //Symptoms// Laryngitis can cause several symptoms: Hoarseness;/ Difficulty speaking;/ Sore throat;/ Low fever;/ Persistent cough;/ Frequent throat clearing;/ These symptoms begin suddenly and usually become more severe within two or three days. In uncomplicated situations, the clinical picture normalizes in about 7 days. Prolonging complaints involves further investigation to exclude the presence of other causes. Laryngitis is generally associated with other diseases that affect other levels of the airways, such as: tonsillitis, pharyngitis, cold or flu. The following symptoms may also manifest: Headache;/ Swelling and pain on palpation of the neck lymph nodes;/ Pain when swallowing;/ Fatigue and malaise;/ //Causes// Acute laryngitis corresponds to colds. Chronic laryngitis can have several causes, the most common being acid reflux, smoking and allergies. //Diagnosis// The clinical picture of hoarseness and local discomfort, in the context of a respiratory infection or inhalation of irritating products, is suggestive of the diagnosis of acute laryngitis. In prolonged situations, direct examination of the vocal cords is essential to detect changes such as irregularities of the vocal cords, tumors, nodules and polyps. Direct observation of the vocal cords is performed by an otolaryngologist who will use a videolaryngoscope, a medical imaging device with a video camera on the end for direct viewing. If necessary or if malignant lesions are suspected, a tissue biopsy will be necessary to correctly diagnose the lesion. //Treatment// Treatment of laryngitis requires control of its triggering factors and, in some cases, surgery is necessary. //Prevention// Quit smoking and avoid secondhand smoke. Smoke is irritating to the lining of the larynx and the vocal cords.;/ Limit alcohol and caffeine intake;/ Drink plenty of water. Liquids help to thin the mucus in your throat.;/ Avoid eating spicy foods that cause heartburn or gastric reflux;/ Include whole grains, fruits and vegetables in your diet. These foods contain vitamins A, E and C that help keep the mucous membranes lining the throat healthy.;/ Avoid upper respiratory infections.

Knee cartilage injury,"//What is it?// Knee cartilage injuries often refer to tears of the menisci, which are themselves cartilaginous structures.  The articular surfaces of long bones are covered by cartilage. When this cartilage suffers an injury, it is called a chondral injury or, if the injury also involves the bone, it is called an osteochondral injury.  These two types of injuries are common in people under 35 and over 60 years of age.  Cartilage injuries can occur in sports where rotation, twisting, deceleration, tackling, dribbling or direct contact movements occur.  There are several daily activities that affect the knee, given the complexity of its structure and the diversity of elements that make up this joint.  Knee cartilage injuries are difficult to treat given their reduced capacity for regeneration and the hostile environment that surrounds the knee joint, which is constantly subjected to countless efforts. As such, they tend to progress to disabling pain and early osteoarthritis. //Symptoms// As articular cartilages are not vascularized nor do they have nerve structures, pain is not a common symptom. However, some patients may report pain at rest that is aggravated by weight-bearing exercises.  If these injuries persist for a long time, knee weakness occurs related to loss of muscle mass and instability of the adjacent ligaments.  If one of the cartilage fragments becomes loose, it can block the movement of the joint.  In some cases, a stroke may occur.  Palpation of the knee is painful and pain is induced by active and passive movements. If the knee is unstable, these movements produce crepitus. //Causes// Trauma is the most common cause of injury but this can also result from repeated exertion.  Rotational forces occurring in direct trauma are most frequently involved in articular cartilage injury.  It is rare for an isolated injury to the articular cartilage to occur, usually with injuries to the ligaments or menisci.  Osteochondral lesions are more common in adolescents.  Articular cartilage has little ability to regenerate, which is why these injuries lead to the formation of scar tissue, deficient in collagen and with less capacity to bear load. This deterioration can progress to chronic pain and loss of function and cause an early onset of osteoarthritis. //Diagnosis// Knee assessment always involves clinical history, medical examination and study using x-rays and/or magnetic resonance imaging.  Sometimes, it may be necessary to perform an arthroscopy, through the creation of small incisions, in order to directly observe the damaged structures. //Treatment// Diagnosis here can be delayed because symptoms are not always very obvious and patients do not remember any significant trauma.  When the injuries are recent, you must wait some time to assess the evolution of the cartilage and to check whether or not symptoms occur.  If the pain persists after the initial phase, surgery allows for better recovery and should not be delayed.  Conservative treatment is based on rest, with the use of crutches for the first 24-48 hours, application of ice for 20 minutes per hour for the first 48 hours after the injury, compression with an elastic bandage and elevation of the leg above the level of the heart.  The use of anti-inflammatory drugs or the injection of corticosteroids into the affected area are important complements to treatment.  When the pain and inflammation subside, it is important to increase the strength and range of motion of the knee in order to stimulate the healing potential of the articular cartilage. This objective is achieved by performing passive movements that stimulate the movement of synovial fluid, with better diffusion of nutrients to the affected cartilage, and that reduce the formation of scar tissue at the joint level.  Surgery is indicated for more extensive or symptomatic lesions and involves debridement of the cartilage, the use of grafts or the transfer of cells that stimulate cartilage regeneration.  Recovery from this type of injury is better when its size is less than 2 cm, when symptoms have lasted less than 18 months before surgery, if no previous surgery has occurred, in younger patients and in those who already practice sports.

Anterior cruciate ligament injury,"//What is it?// The Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) is a band that connects the femur to the tibia, functioning as a pivot in movement and stabilizing the knee.  An ACL injury is one of the most common knee ligament injuries. It is often associated with meniscus injury. When left untreated, an ACL injury can lead to the development of early osteoarthritis of the knee.  The growing trend towards sports, combined with the complexity of different sports, has caused an increase in the number of knee joint injuries. The anterior cruciate ligament is among the most affected and is one of the structures that, when injured, makes it more difficult to return to sport.  The function of the cruciate ligaments is to ensure normal movement between the articular surfaces of the femur and tibia.  These ligaments, as the name suggests, cross each other forming an “X” and allow control of the anterior and posterior movements of the knee. The anterior cruciate ligament prevents the tibia from sliding forward on the femur and provides stability in the rotation of the knee.  Anterior cruciate ligament injuries are common and approximately 70% of these injuries occur during sports.  Between 70% and 90% of injuries to this ligament occur in situations without direct contact against the knee and are often associated with injuries to other structures (menisci, ligaments and cartilage), as isolated injuries are rare.  The sports most involved are basketball, football, volleyball, skiing and others where there is a high frequency of decelerations, rapid changes of direction and falls to the ground following jumps.  Most injuries to this ligament are secondary to one or more of the following maneuvers: the foot resting on the ground and the knee close to maximum extension, deceleration and sudden change of direction.  These injuries can be classified according to their severity: Grade 1: Mild injury in which the ligament is slightly stretched but is still able to keep the knee joint stable. Grade 2: here the strain is greater and the tendon becomes loose, which may result in a partial rupture. Grade 3: corresponds to a complete rupture of the ligament with instability of the knee joint.  Partial ruptures are rare, being almost always complete or nearly complete. //Symptoms// Most Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injuries are associated with sports injuries: sprains, falls, changes in direction or direct trauma.  An ACL tear is often described as a ""pop"" or ""snap"" associated with pain, effusion, and lameness of the knee, typically with decreased mobility. Patients often report a feeling of instability or giving way in the knee after the acute phase (first few weeks) if left untreated.  Swelling secondary to hemarthrosis (accumulation of blood in the joint) is observed a few hours after the injury, worsening painful symptoms and functional limitation. It is estimated that around 75% of injuries to this ligament are associated with acute hemarthrosis.  Feelings of instability, characterized by false steps, are common during attempts to return to sport and can also manifest themselves in daily life activities. //Causes// The main risk factors for the occurrence of this injury are often related to the equipment and the interactions between the footwear and the ground. They may also depend on the patient's anatomy (knee and hip angle, ligament laxity), hormonal and biomechanical factors (muscle strength, body movement, neuromuscular control). Body mass index, limb asymmetry, individual genetics, autoimmunity and metabolic disorders are also important.  The incidence of non-contact anterior cruciate ligament injuries in females has been estimated to be 6 to 8 times higher than in males competing in the same sports. //Diagnosis// Diagnosis is made through clinical history and physical examination. Some special tests may be used in the diagnosis of anterior cruciate ligament insufficiency.  X-rays are used to evaluate bone lesions, although magnetic resonance imaging is the most effective diagnostic imaging method. //Treatment// In the initial phase, painkillers and anti-inflammatories may be prescribed, together with an appropriate physiotherapy plan. Although they do not treat the ligament injury, they can relieve pain and improve function in less active patients.  In active patients, conservative treatment is insufficient, and ACL reconstruction (ligamentoplasty) through arthroscopy with tendon graft is indicated to restore function and prevent osteoarthritis.  The decision regarding the form of treatment must be considered based on the analysis of some variables such as the patient's age, level of activity (sedentary, recreational athlete, competitive athlete), degree of instability, associated injuries, willingness to participate in a program post-operative rehabilitation and future expectations.  The patient's level of physical activity is the single most important factor in the therapeutic decision for this injury. Sedentary patients, without a great appetite for sport, may be treated conservatively, with physiotherapy being important for the treatment of inflammatory symptoms (pain and swelling), complete restoration of movement, recovery from muscle atrophy and return to satisfactory functional conditions for daily life activities.  The indications for surgical treatment of anterior cruciate ligament injuries are patients with symptomatic instability in daily and sporting activities, the desire to maintain sporting activity and the ineffectiveness of conservative treatment.  Several surgical techniques have been developed to treat these injuries and the final results depend not only on the technique used, but also on the post-operative rehabilitation. The strategy to be adopted should always be appropriately individualized.  In general, the two portions of the ligament are sutured or the ligament is reconstructed using grafting techniques.  Surgery is performed using arthroscopy, which involves making small incisions, being less invasive, less painful and requiring a shorter hospital stay.  Recovery after surgery is slow, and it may take 6 months or more before you can resume sports activities. Physiotherapy is essential to gradually restore ligament flexibility and muscle strength. //Prevention// Strengthening and proprioception programs have recently been introduced, which stimulate muscle action during landings and changes of direction, with promising results in preventing anterior cruciate ligament injuries.

Posterior cruciate ligament injury,"//What is it?// Posterior cruciate ligament injuries are usually caused by a blow to the front of the knee or by landing poorly on the leg during vigorous play.  This ligament is located at the back of the knee and prevents the tibia from moving backwards too much.  Posterior cruciate ligament injury requires violent trauma, such as a knee being struck against a car dashboard in a car accident or a football player falling onto a bent knee.  In fact, this ligament is stronger than the anterior cruciate ligament, making it more difficult to injure. When injury occurs, it tends to be more subtle and more difficult to assess than injuries to other ligaments. Like injuries to the anterior cruciate ligament, injuries to the posterior cruciate ligament are associated with injuries to other ligaments, cartilage and bones.  These types of injuries can be classified according to their severity: Grade 1: Mild injury in which the ligament is slightly stretched but is still able to keep the knee joint stable. Grade 2: here the strain is greater and the tendon becomes loose, which may result in a partial rupture. Grade 3: corresponds to a complete rupture of the ligament with instability of the knee joint.  Unlike the anterior cruciate ligament, partial tears are the most common here, with the potential for spontaneous regeneration.  Patients with this type of injury are usually able to resume sporting activity without knee stability problems. //Symptoms// These injuries manifest as pain and swelling that occur quickly after the trauma. The swelling increases the stiffness of the knee and can cause difficulty in walking. The knee becomes unstable, appearing to “give way” during walking. //Diagnosis// Diagnosis involves a medical examination, x-ray and magnetic resonance imaging.  //Treatment// This type of injury can be recovered without surgery, using rest, ice, compression and elevation.  The use of crutches provides additional protection, reducing the weight supported by the leg.  Physiotherapy allows the recovery of knee function and leg muscle strength.  Surgery will be necessary when there is damage to several structures and involves reconstructing the ligament using a graft, using the arthroscopy technique already mentioned.  The recovery process after surgery is slow, lasting several months, and requires physical therapy to begin 1 to 4 weeks after surgery.

Quadriceps tendon injury,"//What is it?// This tendon works with the muscles on the front of the thigh, the quadriceps, and provides strength to the leg.  Its rupture is more common in middle-aged people and those who play sports that involve running or jumping.  These tears can be partial or complete. In the latter case, significant disability occurs and the knee cannot straighten when the quadriceps contracts.  Ruptures of this tendon are more common after the age of 40, with a peak incidence between 60 and 70 years of age. Men are affected 4 to 8 times more often than women.  This is an extraordinarily strong tendon and resistant to rupture, so its injury involves very violent trauma. //Symptoms// This rupture is associated with a “tearing” or “clicking” sensation followed by pain and swelling.  A depressed area may be noticeable at the location of the patella where the tendon is inserted, formation of a hematoma and difficulty walking.  The knee appears to be dislocated downwards and it is not possible to straighten the leg. //Causes// This rupture occurs when a heavy load is applied to the leg with the foot resting on the ground and the knee partially flexed. Other possible causes are falls, cuts and the application of a direct force to the front of the knee.  Weakness of the tendon makes it more likely to rupture. This weakness can result from tendonitis, which is common in athletes who put a lot of strain on the tendon (jumping, running).  Tendon weakness also occurs in diseases that affect muscle and ligament blood flow, such as chronic kidney disease, hyperparathyroidism, gout, leukemia, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus, diabetes, metabolic diseases, infections.  The presence of a rupture of both quadriceps tendons is strongly suggestive of the co-existence of a systemic disease.  The use of corticosteroids weakens both muscles and tendons and fluoroquinolones (a class of antibiotics) are also associated with quadriceps tendon injury.  Other possible factors are prolonged immobilization, which involves loss of strength and flexibility, and previous knee surgery. //Diagnosis// Clinical history and medical examination are essential and are complemented by radiography and magnetic resonance imaging.  //Treatments// Treatment depends on the type and extent of the injury, the patient's activity level, and age.  Partial and small tears respond well to conservative treatment, using immobilization for 3 to 6 weeks and physiotherapy to regain strength and mobility.  Anti-inflammatory medications are also important.  Surgery may be important in some partial tears associated with tendon degeneration, especially in more active people. Surgery is equally important in complete ruptures and allows the tendon to be reinserted into the patella.  This surgery must be performed early to prevent scar tissue from forming and the tendon from shortening.  Recovery after surgery requires pain control with anti-inflammatories, ice and immobilization.  Physiotherapy will be essential in recovering strength and mobility.  Complete recovery takes an average of 4 to 6 months. //Prevention// Preventing injuries to this tendon involves avoiding running on very hard surfaces, avoiding climbing or jumping, stretching your knees before and after exercise, as well as adequately warming up before exercising.

Lateral ligament injury,"//What is it?// The two lateral ligaments, internal and external, are located on the lateral regions of the knee. The internal ligament joins the femur to the tibia and the external ligament joins the femur to the fibula.  These ligaments control the lateral movements of the knee and provide restraint against abnormal movements.  Lateral ligament injuries can be classified according to their severity:  Grade 1: Mild injury in which the ligament is slightly stretched but is still able to keep the knee joint stable. Grade 2: here the strain is greater and the tendon becomes loose, which may result in a partial rupture. Grade 3: corresponds to a complete rupture of the ligament with instability of the knee joint. //Symptoms// These lesions cause pain and swelling, which will be in the inner or external region of the knee as a function of the affected lateral ligament.  The knee becomes unstable, creating the sensation that it is going to give way. //Causes// This type of injury is usually caused by a direct blow to the outside of the knee, as seen in contact sports (football, handball). Skiing is another sport associated with lateral ligament injury.  These injuries occur from any direct contact or from an intense muscle contraction, such as a quick change of direction.  A slight fall or a sudden movement caused by accidentally slipping are other possible causes.  The internal ligament is injured more frequently than the external ligament. Given the complexity of the anatomy of the external region of the knee, external ligament injury usually involves other structures.  Although injuries to the lateral ligaments usually result from a force that pushes the knee to one side, as happens in contact sports, this is not the only possible mechanism.  Injuries to the internal ligament result from trauma to the external region of the knee, and blows to the internal region injure the external ligament. //Diagnosis// Diagnosis involves a medical examination, radiographic studies and magnetic resonance imaging.  Although radiography does not identify the ligaments, it allows the presence of changes in adjacent bones to be assessed. //Treatment// Injuries to the lateral ligament rarely require surgery. If the external ligament injury involves other structures, treatment should include those structures.  Using crushed ice directly on the affected area (but not in direct contact with the skin) for 15 to 20 minutes at intervals of at least one hour helps the healing process.  It is important to protect the knee from lateral movement, which can be achieved by reducing daily activities, using a splint, and using crutches.  Physiotherapy allows you to perform extension exercises that restore knee function and strengthen the leg muscles.  Surgery will be necessary if the lateral ligament injury is very serious or if it is associated with injuries to other knee structures.  Surgery may involve repairing or reconstructing the affected ligament. //Prevention// Adopting preventive attitudes in sport and in daily life can prevent the incidence of ligament injuries.  According to some studies, adequate physical preparation reduces the risk of knee injuries by up to 88%.  Muscle strength is essential for knee stability. However, if the muscles are strong but do not work in harmony, instability can occur, which can lead to injuries.  As such, the most recommended exercises for developing good muscular balance are those that reproduce natural movements, such as squats, as all the muscles involved in the joint are used.  Proper training planning is also essential to avoid injuries. The lack of muscle recovery, the use of high and prolonged loads during training, can increase the risk of injury to a healthy structure or one that has already undergone surgery.

Ankle cartilage injuries,"//What is it?// The cartilage of the ankle joint provides a smooth, firm surface that allows for smooth movement. Damage to this cartilage can lead to damage to the joint surfaces.  Ankle cartilage injuries can result from trauma or a degenerative process.  In young people, traumas occur in sports such as football or handball, often with associated sprains, and, in these cases, a fragment of cartilage (1 to 2 cm in diameter) detaches from the rest of the surface, leaving its edges intact. As long as the bone is intact and there is good capacity for regeneration, this type of injury responds very well to treatment.  Degenerative injuries, resulting from continued stress over a long period of time, have a more unfavorable outcome. In these cases, the cartilage initially softens, with the formation of fissures and a reduction in the thickness of the cartilage, which becomes fragile and friable.  Once this process sets in, a spontaneous recovery is no longer possible. Although the pain is not always significant, these situations are serious and must be treated in their early stages. In more advanced stages, treating the injury and relieving pain often requires the use of joint prostheses. //Symptoms// Cartilage lesions can vary in size, location and depth. Symptoms will vary depending on these parameters.  When cartilage damage is extensive, severe pain, swelling and stiffness of the joint occur.  If a fragment of cartilage becomes detached, it can become trapped between the joint surfaces, blocking their movement and causing pain and an inability to walk. //Causes// The ankle is frequently involved in workplace accidents and cartilage injuries occur following sprains. Therefore, the risk factors for these injuries are identical to those described for ankle sprains.  As this cartilage is poorly vascularized and has reduced potential for regeneration in adults, treatment is essential to control pain and swelling and achieve a full recovery. //Diagnosis// Medical examination and clinical history provide essential elements for diagnosis.  Radiography is important to exclude fractures but does not allow detecting changes on the cartilage surface.  These changes will be better evaluated through magnetic resonance imaging. //Treatment// Immobilization associated with the use of anti-inflammatory drugs is very useful.  Whenever possible, physiotherapy should be incorporated as soon as possible to speed up the return to work or sports. This physiotherapy includes strength and flexibility exercises and the use of ultrasound.  When inflammation is severe, cortisone injection into the ankle joint is very helpful.  If symptoms persist or if the cartilage damage is extensive and deep, with fragments trapped in the articular surface, surgery is indicated. Surgery makes it possible to remove loose fragments, repair the cartilage or, when this is not possible, stimulate a bone response so that a tissue that simulates cartilage is formed.  After surgery, there will be a period of immobilization and use of crutches for around two weeks, which will be followed by an entire physiotherapy program.  Returning to pre-injury activities is generally possible 4 to 6 weeks after surgery.  The prognosis for cartilage injuries is good, although progression to arthritis can occur, especially when there is loss of cartilage and formation of scar tissue. //Prevention// Since the causes of cartilage injuries are similar to those of sprains, prevention is identical and involves adequately maintaining the strength, flexibility and balance of the ankle joint.  In the case of sport, it is essential to warm up correctly and define specific training programs for each modality and to wear suitable footwear that must be replaced when wear on the sole is visible.  In the case of running, very uneven surfaces should be avoided.  Whenever signs of fatigue occur, rest is crucial.

Triangular fibrocartilage injuries,"//What is it?// The wrist is a special joint, given its flexibility and strength. It allows for very wide movements and is stable enough to handle delicate or very heavy objects. The joints, bones, tendons and ligaments that make up the wrist depend on cartilage to protect these structures, thus preventing serious injuries from occurring. If this cartilage is damaged by a fall, improper twisting, repeated activity, or arthritis, the entire wrist and hand can be affected. If the problem is not diagnosed and promptly treated, it can cause chronic discomfort or even disability. Cartilage problems in the wrist generally occur after a fall in which the person tries to protect themselves by violently placing their hands on the ground. When the cartilage is stretched and ruptures, inflammation, swelling, intense pain and limited hand movement occur. One of the most common injuries is that of triangular fibrocartilage. The term “triangular fibrocartilage complex” describes the close anatomical and functional relationship between the ulnar structures of the wrist. Instability of the joint between the radius and ulna is the most debilitating lesion seen in this complex. It is a structure made up of cartilage and ligaments and its function is to stabilize the wrist bones, cushion impacts and allow smooth movements. //Symptoms// These injuries cause pain in the wrist, especially when moving the hand toward the little finger or when rotating the hand upward. These movements may be accompanied by an audible click. The wrist tends to become swollen, unstable and weak, being unable to perform delicate movements. //Causes// The most common injury mechanisms are axial loading, ulnar displacement, or extreme rotation of the forearm. This structure can be injured in a fall, during sports or at work. Falls onto an outstretched hand are one of the most common causes. Twisting or pressing movements are other possibilities. Some of the associated sports are those that involve a bat or racket and these movements are also seen in some professional activities where the manipulation of instruments is necessary. On the other hand, these structures can undergo degenerative processes with subsequent rupture and difficult healing, given their reduced vascularization. //Diagnosis// During medical examination, there is pain on local palpation. Instability of the radioulnar joint may occur. Since most of the ulnar structures are soft tissue, conventional radiography is often normal and should be used in the evaluation of fracture injuries. Magnetic resonance imaging is the main means of diagnosis and arthroscopy allows concomitant evaluation and treatment. Arthroscopy can be useful when other tests are inconclusive. This examination uses a small instrument that is introduced through a small incision and allows direct observation of the injured structures. //Treatment// Injuries can be acute or chronic and acute surgical treatment is reserved for unstable or displaced fractures. Treatment depends on the symptoms present and the severity of the injury. In some cases a splint or bandage is sufficient. Cartilage injuries may cause less pain over time even if they do not heal. Elements such as ice, anti-inflammatories and local corticosteroid injections may be indicated in some cases. If symptoms do not improve, surgery will be indicated, generally using the less invasive technique of arthroscopy. This technique uses small incisions and allows the repair of cartilage injuries and is less invasive, allowing for faster recovery. This arthroscopic repair is possible in radial disinsertions with a 92% success rate. The classic approach is reserved for ulnar disinsertions and a tendon graft may be necessary. Recovery after treatment will depend on each case and will depend on an individualized physiotherapy program. //Prevention// The use of correct gestures and techniques in each type of sport, the use of appropriate equipment and recommended protections in the workplace are essential aspects for preventing this type of injury.

Sports injuries,
Elbow injuries,"//Elbow injuries// The elbow is the joint located in the median region of the arm where three long bones meet: the humerus, the radius and the ulna. The humerus is located in the arm and articulates with the ulna in the inner region of the forearm and with the radius in the outer region of the forearm. This joint allows rotation, flexion and extension movements of the arm. Flexion of the forearm is performed by the biceps and extension depends on the triceps. The outermost region of the elbow is called the external epicondyle and belongs to the humerus. Injury to the tendons that are inserted there corresponds to tendonitis or external epicondylitis (tennis elbow). The innermost region of the elbow is called the internal epicondyle. Injury to the tendons that are inserted there corresponds to tendonitis or internal epicondylitis (golfer's elbow). There is also a pocket filled with fluid (bursa) that reduces friction associated with movements. The elbow can be affected by inflammation of tendons or bursa, fractures, arthritis or irritation of nerve structures. The sports most associated with elbow injuries are tennis, golf, contact sports, martial arts and football. However, elbow injuries can occur in a large number of sports, the most relevant being those in which there is excessive use of the joint, such as sports with throwing movements (volleyball, baseball) or those in which sudden trauma can occur. (football, gymnastics). This type of injury has been increasing in frequency in recent decades and affects not only professional athletes but also school and amateur activities.

Shoulder injuries,"//Symptoms// Shoulder pain is the most common symptom and may have certain patterns that are more typical of certain pathologies. For example, nighttime pain felt in the front or more lateral region is often associated with tendonitis or rotator cuff tears. On the other hand, pain that may persist throughout the day in the upper region and radiating to the cervical region may be related to contractures of the muscles around the shoulder, such as the trapezius or pectoral muscles. Pain that appears first thing in the morning and eases throughout the day may have an inflammatory cause, such as rheumatoid arthritis. Shoulder stiffness is another common symptom, characterized by loss of active and passive mobility, often accompanied by crepitus or a sensation of locking. Stiffness can be confused with limited mobility caused by pain, or the inability to actively move due to tendon ruptures that lead to loss of arm elevation. Instability is the opposite of stiffness. This symptom manifests itself as the sensation that the shoulder may come out of the joint, and can even occur in different circumstances, in the case of dislocation. More subtle manifestations of instability can also occur, such as a nonspecific and deep pain, a feeling of numbness in the arm or fatigue more easily with shoulder movements.  //What are the most common shoulder injuries?// Shoulder injuries are common and can have a variety of causes. The most frequent are related to the rotator cuff tendons, whether degenerative tendonitis or ruptures, or calcific tendonitis. Shoulder osteoarthritis (primary or secondary) is another common cause of pain and functional limitation and is characterized by the progressive loss of articular cartilage. Other problems may be due to trauma or excessive strain on the shoulder, such as fractures of the proximal humerus and clavicle, shoulder and acromioclavicular dislocations, or traumatic rotator cuff tears.  //Diagnosis// Assessment by an orthopedic doctor specialized in shoulder surgery will help to define the main hypotheses and which imaging methods are most suitable for diagnosing each patient. In general, the initial study consists of an X-ray of the shoulder with views appropriate to the diagnostic suspicions in question. This exam is usually complemented with more advanced imaging methods. Although ultrasound is useful for tendon injuries of the shoulder, magnetic resonance imaging is more accurate for characterizing injuries to tendons, ligaments and cartilage. Additionally, it can help understand the prognosis of certain injuries if repairs are attempted. Computerized axial tomography (CT) is useful in trauma situations or when an in-depth study of bone structures, such as osteoarthritis, is required. Currently, 3D reconstruction methods allow for highly reliable reproductions of anatomy and even allow the development of navigation solutions or simulation of implant placement, when necessary.  //Treatment// Conservative treatment using analgesia and physiotherapy targeted to each patient can be the first line for most of these injuries. Infiltrations or other techniques that aim to reduce pain and disability can also be added, including preparations that stimulate regeneration, such as platelet-rich plasma. For some pathologies, minimally invasive treatment using arthroscopy (video surgery) allows the reconstruction of damaged structures and a faster recovery with less pain, through small incisions in the skin. Certain traumatic injuries or more advanced osteoarthritis situations may require conventional open surgery using joint prostheses or implants to fix the fragments. Advances in technology have allowed the development of increasingly personalized and individualized solutions for each patient, less invasive and with better results.  //Prevention// The prevention of shoulder injuries is mainly suited to those that are due to overload or excessive efforts, in a professional, sporting or other activity context. Performing repetitive movements, especially with the arms above the head, must be complemented by muscle strengthening and coordination exercise programs that minimize overload. In certain sports that require throwing, it is also important to work on the back, abdominal and hip muscles, so that the entire movement is coordinated and carried out from a stable base. Inflammatory diseases that affect the shoulder, such as rheumatoid arthritis, can spare this joint if they are diagnosed at an early stage and there is a good response to the treatment implemented. Traumatic injuries, although unpredictable, can be minimized in older individuals. Anti-osteoporotic therapy and maintaining good physical condition to prevent falls can reduce the likelihood of proximal humerus fractures and other fractures in the shoulder region that frequently affect these age groups.

Foot and ankle injuries,"//What is it?// Foot and ankle injuries are very common and can occur in athletes or non-athletes, children and adults. They can result from physical or sporting activity or occur while walking or going down stairs. Ankle injuries account for about 25% of all sports injuries. For basketball, they correspond to 21% to 53% of total injuries and for football, around 17% to 29%. In children, most of these injuries occur during sports or after an accidental fall. //Causes// The risk tends to be greater in sports that involve jumping, such as basketball, or those where rapid changes of direction occur, such as football. Dance and gymnastics are also associated with this type of injury. Loss of muscle mass and osteoporosis, more common in old age, increase the risk of foot and ankle injuries. Difficulties in vision and balance associated with age further increase this risk. //Diagnosis// Most of these injuries heal spontaneously. The high number of recurrent injuries and the long-term complications resulting from instability and the development of arthritis suggest that the approach to these injuries is not always ideal. Often, athletes resume activity too soon, which increases the risk of relapse and complications.  Load more;/ Cardiology and Sports Medicine are two specialties that ""work"" in synergy.

Wrist and hand injuries,"//What is it?// Wrist and hand injuries are among the most common in traumatology. Some of the sports that are associated with hand and wrist injuries are hockey, skating, cycling and boxing. Children and adolescents have more wrist injuries than adults. Of sports injuries, 3 to 9% involve the hand and wrist . In football, this percentage can reach 14% and in gymnastics, values ​​between 46 and 87%. Although common, many athletes do not seek treatment and this delay can cause long-term problems. //Causes// Hand and wrist injuries can have a variety of causes, such as rheumatological diseases, metabolic disorders, tumors, infectious diseases and trauma. They can result from repeated microtraumas or single traumas.  //Treatment// This type of injury needs to be treated and this treatment, carried out immediately after diagnosis, must be done aggressively in order to obtain the best results in the shortest possible time. To this end, diagnostic aids and surgical techniques must be used with the aim of achieving full recovery, which is essential for continuing to practice sports. //Prevention// The best prevention of hand and wrist injuries is the use of appropriate equipment that protects the hands and wrists. This equipment must be suitable for the sport and may include gloves and wrist protectors. Gloves protect the nerves and skin of your hands in the event of a fall or direct impact. Adequate warm-up also reduces the risk of injury at this level.

Meniscus lesions,"//What is it?// Intact articular cartilage is soft, smooth, uniform and covers the entire bone surface. Intense, repetitive and compressive movements caused by sports or falls can cause injuries and deterioration of the cartilage tissue. Injury or rupture of the meniscus is one of the most common knee injuries. This type of injury is also referred to as cartilage rupture. Each knee has two menisci: a lateral or outer meniscus and a medial or inner meniscus, which act as stabilizers and shock absorbers for the knee. The menisci are rigid and rubber-like in structure to keep the knee stable. Any accident associated with twisting the knee, with or without load, can cause a meniscal injury. An untreated meniscus injury can lead to the development of early knee osteoarthritis. This type of injury is very common, especially in contact sports, although it can occur at any age. The menisci can rupture in different ways and, frequently, these injuries are associated with changes in the cruciate ligaments or others. //Symptoms// Meniscal injury is associated with knee pain and lameness, typically with decreased mobility and/or joint effusion. When the meniscus ruptures, a noise may be heard. Most people can walk even with the rupture and many athletes continue to play sports. After 2 to 3 days, the knee becomes less mobile and swollen. The most common symptoms are pain, stiffness, swelling, a feeling of loss of control of the knee and a reduction in the range of motion of both extension and flexion. Without treatment, a fragment of the meniscus can break off and block the knee joint. //Causes// Meniscus injuries are often the result of a twisting movement, a sudden change of direction, deceleration or may be the result of a sudden impact. In this type of injury there is usually direct contact between two people while playing a sport. Age is a risk factor because degenerative changes occur in the cartilage, weakening it and making it thinner. In this context, a slight twist while getting up from a chair can cause a meniscus tear. //Diagnosis// The clinical history is very useful. Medical examination reveals that palpation of the joint and meniscus is painful. A useful test is the McMurray test, which consists of compression with rotation of the tibia in relation to the femur, which allows you to feel or hear a click in the joint line. Plain x-rays do not allow the meniscus to be visualized but do allow other causes of knee pain such as osteoarthritis to be excluded. Magnetic resonance imaging allows better characterization and classification of meniscus injuries. //Treatment// In the initial phase, painkillers and anti-inflammatories may be prescribed, together with an appropriate physiotherapy plan. Although these do not treat the meniscal injury, they can relieve pain and improve the patient's function. Conservative treatment is often insufficient, and knee arthroscopy is recommended to remove the injured part (meniscectomy) or repair it (suture of the menisci). Treatment options for meniscal injuries include non-operative treatment, partial removal of the meniscus, or repair. More recently, meniscal transplantation has become a treatment option in some centers around the world. Indications for non-surgical treatment include stable lesions, partial thickness lesions, asymptomatic degenerative lesions, or lesions whose symptoms are well tolerated by the patient. Surgical treatment of meniscal injuries is indicated in situations where symptoms persist after conservative treatment, pain persists or joint blockage occurs. Conservative treatment involves reducing or limiting sports activities, using analgesic and anti-inflammatory medications and physiotherapy. When the injury is small and occurs on the outer portion of the meniscus, it does not require surgery. The RICE (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation) protocol is useful in these cases. Rest from the activity that caused the injury is essential and it may be important to use crutches to reduce weight on the leg. Ice applied for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day, is a good help. Ice should not be applied directly to the skin. Compression reduces swelling and can be achieved by wearing a compression bandage. Elevating the leg above the level of the heart also reduces swelling. Anti-inflammatories fight pain and inflammation. Surgery will depend on the type, size and location of the meniscus tear. The outer third of the meniscus is richly vascularized and therefore heals more easily. The inner two thirds are poorly irrigated, which makes healing difficult and makes surgery more necessary. In addition to the location of the injury, it is important to consider age, activity level and the presence of other injuries. The surgery can be performed arthroscopically, through small incisions. After surgery, it is essential to immobilize the knee followed by a rehabilitation program, with exercises that improve knee strength and mobility. //Prevention// Many cases of meniscus injuries cannot be prevented, but proper training techniques significantly reduce the likelihood of these injuries occurring.

Extensor tendon injuries,"//What is it?// The extensor tendons located on the dorsal surface of the hand, and connected to muscles in the forearm, allow us to straighten our fingers. As they extend to the distal part of the fingers, they become thinner and receive small tendons from the hand's intrinsic muscles at the level of the hand.  Common extensor tendon injuries Cuts to the back of the hand or fingers that affect the extensor tendons typically cause extension deficits in the affected finger in the joints distal to the cut. They are normally treated with tendon suturing and immobilization with a splint for long periods (4 to 7 weeks). The use of dynamic splints and physical therapy are often necessary after removing immobilization. Hammertoe refers to the fall of the last phalanx in the distal joint of the finger associated with a wound, bone tearing or tendon stretching, but the result is always the same: the tip of the finger cannot be stretched. Closed rupture, whether or not associated with a phalanx fracture, leads to prolonged immobilization with a splint; cutting the tendon requires surgical repair followed by an equal period of immobilization (7 to 8 weeks). Boutonniere deformity refers to flexion deformity at the proximal interphalangeal joint (in severe and prolonged cases associated with hyperextension at the distal interphalangeal joint) associated with a cut or rupture at the insertion of the extensor tendon at the base of the 2nd phalanx. Suturing of the tendon, reinsertion at the base of the phalanx and immobilization for a period of 5 or 6 weeks are the recommended treatments. Failure to treat this type of injury often leads to fixed flexion stiffness. //Causes// Their superficial location on the dorsum of the hand and fingers makes them particularly susceptible to injury by wound or other direct trauma. Wounds, crushing or simply abrupt flexion of the finger can lead to injury at the distal insertion of the tendon into the bone leading to flexion of the 3rd phalanx with the so-called “mallet finger” which will lead to a long period of immobilization with or without surgery. //Treatment// Tendon scarring can lead to adhesions to surrounding tissues (skin and bone), and the scar tissue that forms can prevent the tendon from stretching or flexing completely even under the best treatment conditions. Dynamic splinting and physical therapy may be necessary in these conditions.

Muscle and tendon injuries,"//What is it?// Muscles, tendons and ligaments rupture when they are subjected to stress greater than their intrinsic strength. For example, they can get injured if they are too weak or stiff for the exercise you are trying to do. Joints are more prone to injury when the muscles and ligaments that support them are weak, as happens after a sprain. Bones weakened by osteoporosis can fracture more easily. Muscle injuries are the most common cause of physical disability in sport, accounting for around 30-50% of injuries. Generally speaking, injuries caused by sports are due to incorrect training methods, structural anomalies that strain certain parts of the body more than others, and weakness of muscles, tendons and ligaments. Chronic wear and tear is the cause of many of these injuries. //Symptoms// The pain that precedes many overuse injuries first occurs when a limited number of muscle or tendon fibers tear. Stopping exercise at the first sign of pain limits the damage to these fibers, allowing for faster recovery. Continuing to exercise while in pain causes more fibers to tear, aggravating the injury and delaying recovery.  //Causes// Muscle injuries can be caused by direct blows, strains or lacerations. These injuries can be mild (grade I), with the presence of swelling and discomfort, moderate (grade II), with loss of function and formation of hematoma or ecchymosis, or severe (grade III), with complete rupture, intense pain and hematoma of the large dimensions. One of the biomechanical factors that cause most foot, leg and hip injuries is excessive inward rotation of the feet after they come into contact with the ground.   //Diagnosis// The diagnosis is essentially clinical and ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging and tomography complement this assessment well. Of these three, ultrasound is considered the ideal method.  //Treatment// The principles of treating muscle injuries are based on the classic set: protection, rest, ice, compression and elevation. A good balance between initial immobilization and early mobilization is difficult and each of these phases has advantages and disadvantages that need to be evaluated from an individual perspective. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs help control pain and inflammation, and physical therapy helps restore strength and flexibility. Ultrasound is recommended for treating muscle injuries. Corticosteroid injections into the injured area or surrounding tissue relieve pain and reduce swelling. However, these injections can delay the healing process, increasing the risk of tendon or cartilage damage. Physiotherapy, with the application of heat, cold, electricity or ultrasound, contributes to the rehabilitation process. Its duration will depend on the severity and complexity of the injury. Although treatment allows for a good recovery in most cases, the consequences of these injuries can, in some cases, be dramatic, preventing a return to activity for weeks or months. //Prevention// The activity or sport that caused the injury should be avoided until it heals. Replacing activities that do not force the injured area is preferable to abstaining from all physical activity, as complete inactivity causes the loss of muscle mass, strength and endurance. As a rule, a week of rest requires at least two weeks of exercise to return to your pre-injury fitness level. Strengthening exercises help prevent injuries. Regular exercise does not significantly increase or strengthen muscles. The only way to strengthen muscles is to exercise them against increasing resistance in a progressive way, such as by playing an increasingly intense sport, lifting increasingly heavier weights, or using special strengthening machines. Stretching exercises do not appear to prevent injuries, but they lengthen muscles so that they can contract more effectively and function better. Using proper equipment is an integral part of preventing muscle and tendon injuries.

Leukemia,"//What is it?// Leukemia is a cancer of the most primitive cells in the bone marrow – the stem cells – which are the cells that give rise to blood cells. The bone marrow is the organ where blood cells are formed; mature cells are formed from stem cells, which are more primitive. There are several types of leukemia, the most common being chronic lymphatic leukemia. Lymphocytes are the main cells of the immune system. Lymphocytes are white blood cells that are formed in the bone marrow. B lymphocytes are one type of white blood cell and are the cells of origin of chronic lymphatic leukemia. Chronic lymphatic leukemia is a disease in which too many abnormal lymphocytes accumulate. These lymphocytes do not multiply faster but survive longer, unlike what happens in acute leukemias. These lymphocytes appear normal under a microscope but function poorly. It is a disease that develops very slowly (from months to years even without treatment) and symptoms such as anemia, bleeding or infections can take years to appear. Symptoms appear when the number of diseased lymphocytes becomes too high, preventing the bone marrow from producing other healthy cells for normal blood functions. Treatment for this type of leukemia aims to reduce the number of white blood cells. In leukemia, the diseased cells that are produced in the bone marrow spill over into the blood and are found in circulation. There are several types of leukemia, the majority of which develop from the cells that will produce white blood cells. On this site we exclusively address chronic lymphatic leukemia.  Bone marrow is the soft, spongy tissue inside bones. Large, flat bones, such as the hip bones and breastbone, contain the most marrow. Bone marrow is responsible for producing different types of blood cells: white blood cells - the cells responsible for fighting infections;;/ red blood cells -the cells that carry oxygen to tissues throughout the body;;/ platelets – the cells that help control bleeding by forming blood clots.;/ To continually form blood cells, healthy bone marrow and dietary nutrients such as iron and some vitamins are needed. In their immature or primordial phase, bone marrow cells include stem cells or stem cells. Most blood cells mature in the bone marrow, later moving into the blood vessels. From a pluripotent stem cell, two cell lineages develop: lymphoid and myeloid. The myeloid lineage gives rise to the normal cells drawn below, and when diseased it gives rise to myeloid leukemias. The lymphoid lineage fundamentally gives rise to lymphocytes and plasma cells, and when diseased it gives rise to lymphoid leukemias and lymphomas. //Prevention// There are no prevention strategies for chronic lymphatic leukemia. //Risk Factors// Any behavior or condition that increases your risk of having a disease is a risk factor. If one or more risk factors apply to you, it does not mean that you will necessarily develop chronic lymphatic leukemia. Likewise, chronic lymphatic leukemia can appear in individuals who have no known risk factors. It has not yet been possible to find the causes, but some risk factors are known. The main risk factors are: Age- Being over 60 years old is a risk factor, and the disease is rare in people under 40 years old.;/ Being male;/ Family history- having a first-degree relative with this disease;/ Having an autoimmune disease in which autoantibodies are made against red blood cells or platelets;/ //Symptoms// The symptoms of chronic lymphatic leukemia are not exclusive and can appear in other diseases. Just because you have one or more of the symptoms described here does not mean you have chronic lymphatic leukemia. At the beginning of the disease, in many cases, there are no symptoms. This disease is often diagnosed because the patient has had a routine blood test or for some reason other than suspected leukemia. Half of people with chronic lymphatic leukemia have no symptoms. For a period of time that can be months to years, large numbers of abnormal lymphocytes can accumulate in circulation without causing problems.  Over time, abnormal lymphocytes fill the bone marrow, making it difficult to replace the normal blood cells that die. You should be alert and consult your doctor if you have the following symptoms: Anemia - occurs when the number of red blood cells in the blood drops. It can cause tiredness and shortness of breath. Patients may also become paler.;/ Hemorrhages – due to a reduced number of platelets in circulation, which can cause easy bruising, gum bleeding and the appearance of bleeding in the skin or mucous membranes.;/ Infections- Sick lymphocytes do not protect against infections, they are ineffective. Therefore, there is a lack of efficient white blood cells to fight infections.;/ Enlarged lymph nodes and spleen;/ Fever;/ Night sweats;/ Weight loss;/ //Who should I contact?// If you suspect cancer, due to symptoms or a complementary diagnostic test that shows changes, you should consult a Clinical Hematologist. Meet our team of experts Make your contact request so we can follow up from the first moment. If you prefer, you can schedule an appointment via our toll-free line.  Pluripotent stem cells give rise to two cell lineages: alymphoid and amyeloid. The myeloid lineage gives rise to the normal cells drawn there, and when diseased it gives rise to myeloid leukemias. The lymphoid lineage fundamentally gives rise to lymphocytes and plasma cells, and when diseased it gives rise to lymphoid or lymphoblastic leukemias and lymphomas. Leukemias can also be classified as acute and chronic, according to their clinical presentation. Acute leukemias appear and progress quickly, while chronic leukemias are slow in their appearance and clinical course.  Thus, the main leukemias are: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia – is the most common type of leukemia in pediatric age;;/ Acute myeloid leukemia – affects both adults and children;;/ Chronic lymphocytic leukemia – mainly affects adults;;/ Chronic myeloid leukemia – mainly affects adults.;/ //Diagnosis and Staging// In a patient suspected of having chronic lymphatic leukemia, tests may be ordered to diagnose the disease. To make the diagnosis of chronic lymphatic leukemia, in addition to collecting history and clinical history, the following tests are performed: -Blood cell counts, morphological analysis and classification of surface proteins; -Myelogram and Bone Marrow Biopsy – this procedure consists of  aspirating the contents of the bone marrow and removing a small fragment of iliac bone. It is a procedure performed by a hematologist or oncologist, with the individual lying face down, using local anesthesia; - Radiological examinations such as CT scan. Staging is the process by which we assess the extent of the disease and its impact on the body. The information obtained through the staging process determines the stage of the disease, which is essential for planning treatment. When confirming the diagnosis of chronic lymphatic leukemia, the next step is to stage it through clinical examination and imaging tests, namely a computed tomography. The stage classification is divided into stages A, B and C: Stage A- There are fewer than three regions of the body affected by expansion of the lymphatic structures; Stage B- There are three or more regions of the body affected by expansion of the lymphatic structures; Stage C- There is a decrease in the number of red blood cells and/or platelets. //Treatment// The multidisciplinary clinical team will assess the best treatment to follow. Options may include chemotherapy, immunotherapy and possibly radiotherapy. Stage A or early stage - most of these patients do not need treatment, because they have no symptoms and the disease is not aggressive and may never require treatment. Treatment can be started when symptoms appear or when analyzes show a faster increase in the number of lymphocytes; Stages B or C, advanced - the objective of treatment is to achieve normalization of the blood and marrow. This allows the marrow to function normally again and produce normal cells. The basis of treatment is chemotherapy, which can be associated with immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies. Radiotherapy can be given to larger lymph node areas. In exceptional cases, bone marrow transplantation may be indicated. The treatment of chronic lymphatic leukemia is always guided by a clinical hematologist and you must maintain follow-up at the hematology consultation, carrying out regular blood and imaging tests.

Hodgkin's lymphoma,"//What is it?// Hodgkin's lymphoma is a type of hematologic cancer. Lymphoma is a generic term to classify cancers that develop in lymphocytes and, consequently, in organs of the lymphatic system. This disease resembles cancer in that the mechanism of its formation is equivalent. These abnormal lymphocytes, also called Reed-Sternberg cells, do not fulfill their function of protecting against infections and other diseases. If in the case of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma the cells of origin of this cancer are unequivocally lymphocytes, in the case of Hodgkin's Lymphoma the origin is not so clear. Since lymphocytes circulate throughout the body, anomalous cells can originate in any area of ​​the lymphatic system and can affect various parts of the body, although their spread usually occurs sequentially, affecting the group of nodes immediately following. This clinical condition in which the disease affects the body in a widespread manner is called systemic disease. Hodgkin's lymphoma is a disease that appears most frequently in young adults with enlarged nodes in the neck, chest or other locations. It can also appear in the elderly. This lymphoma can also be called Hodgkin's disease, because this type of lymphoma is a cancer that generally has a good prognosis. It can be cured if detected at an early stage. //Prevention//  There are no strategies for the prevention and early diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma. //Risk Factors// Any behavior or condition that increases your risk of having a disease is a risk factor. If one or more risk factors apply to you, it does not mean that you will necessarily develop Hodgkin's lymphoma. Likewise, Hodgkin's lymphoma can appear in individuals who have no known risk factors. The causes of Hodgkin lymphoma have not yet been found, but some risk factors are known. The main risk factors are: Young or elderly adults - There are two peaks of incidence of this disease in young adults and then in the elderly – between 15 and 34 years old and then from 55 years old;;/ Being male;;/ Ebstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection;;/ Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection;;/ Family history- Having a first-degree relative with this disease.;/ //Symptoms// Hodgkin's lymphoma symptoms are not exclusive, they can appear in other diseases. Just because you have one or more of the symptoms described here does not mean you have Hodgkin's lymphoma. You should be alert and consult your doctor if you have the following symptoms: Enlarged lymph nodes in the neck, armpits and/or groin;/ Fever for no apparent reason;/ Intense night sweats;/ Severe fatigue;/ Weight loss for no apparent reason;/ Skin lesions with or without itching;/ Increased sensitivity to the effects of alcohol or feeling pain in lymph nodes after drinking alcohol;/ //Who should I contact?// If you suspect Hodgkin's lymphoma, due to symptoms or a complementary diagnostic test that shows an abnormality, you should go to a Clinical Hematologist. Meet our team of experts Make your contact request so we can follow up from the first moment. If you prefer, you can schedule an appointment via our toll-free line.  There are two types of Hodgkin lymphoma:  - Classical – this is the most common type of Hodgkin lymphoma. They can also be classified as: nodular sclerosis;;/ mixed cellularity;;/ lymphocyte depletion;;/ rich in lymphocytes.;/  - Nodular with predominance of lymphocytes – is a rare type of Hodgkin lymphoma, which can be treated differently from the classic type. //Diagnosis and Staging// In a patient with a clinical history and clinical examination suspicious of Hodgkin's lymphoma, tests are used to diagnose the disease with the aim of understanding how many lymph node regions are affected by the disease, and whether it is in fact Hodgkin's disease. Diagnostic tests are: Detailed blood and urine tests;;/ Biopsy of the enlarged lymph node - a biopsy must be performed to remove the entire lymph node - excisional biopsy - since a simple biopsy by aspirating cells from the lymph node does not allow for a sufficient quantity to be obtained for the pathologist to diagnose Hodgkin's lymphoma;;/ Bone marrow biopsy – the doctor uses a needle to collect bone and marrow samples, using local anesthesia (myelogram);;/ Radiological examinations such as CT scan;;/ Nuclear Medicine exams such as oPET.;/ Only when the material collected through a biopsy is observed under a microscope is it possible to confirm the diagnosis of Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Staging is the process by which we assess the extent of Hodgkin's lymphoma to the various organs and systems. The information obtained through the staging process determines the stage of the disease, which is essential for planning treatment. Staging is done using imaging and nuclear medicine exams, namely TAC and PET, and bone marrow involvement is done through bone biopsy. Based on the tests performed, the staging of Hodgkin's lymphoma can be classified into stages I to IV. However, there is a staging complement that is related to the symptoms the patient has: Groups A, B, E and S: A: The patient does not have fever, weight loss or night sweats, this triad is called symptoms B;B: The patient has symptoms B;E: The patient has disease in a non-lymphoid organ but which may be contiguous to a conglomerate ganglionic. For example, the lung; S: The patient has spleen disease. Regarding the stages of Hodgkin's lymphoma, they are characterized as follows: Stage I- The disease covers one of these territories: A territory of lymph nodes;;/ Waldeyer's ring;;/ Timo;;/ Spleen.;/  Stage II- The disease involves two lymphoid territories that are on the same side of the diaphragm, that is, on the “upper part” of the body or on the “lower part” of the body. Stage III- The disease involves two lymphoid territories that are on different sides of the diaphragm, that is, on the “upper part” of the body and on the “lower part” of the body. Stage IV - The disease affects both sides of the diaphragm and other non-lymphoid organs such as the lung, liver, brain or bone marrow.  Regarding treatment, Hodgkin's lymphoma can be classified as follows: Favorable early stage - Stages I and II; Early unfavorable stage - Stages I and II but with one or more risk factors: Thoracic tumor with a diameter greater than 10 cm;;/ Disease outside the lymph nodes;;/ High sedimentation rate;;/ Three or more lymph nodes with cancer;;/ Presence of Symptoms B.;/ Favorable advanced stage - Stage III and IV disease with three or fewer of the following risk factors: Male;;/ Be over 45 years old;;/ Stage IV disease;;/ Albumin less than 4 g/dl;;/ Hemoglobin less than 10.5 g/dl;;/ White blood cells greater than 15,000 thousand;;/ Lymphocytes less than 600.;/ Unfavorable advanced stage - Disease in stages III and IV with four or more of the following risk factors from the list above. //Treatment// The multidisciplinary clinical team will assess the best treatment to follow. The same could include radiotherapy and systemic therapy: Favorable early stage – treatment options usually include chemotherapy and radiotherapy, or radiotherapy alone; Early unfavorable stage – treatment options include chemotherapy and radiotherapy; Favorable advanced stage - treatment options include chemotherapy and radiotherapy; Advanced unfavorable stage - treatment options include chemotherapy. Bone marrow transplantation may be a treatment option for some cases of Hodgkin lymphoma. This involves administering high doses of chemotherapy to the body to destroy the bone marrow, followed by the transplantation of dendritic cells (the primary cells formed in the bone marrow) from the donor, which will restore the patient's bone marrow. The transplant can be of two natures:  autologous – the marrow donor is the patient himself – the dendritic cells are harvested before the application of chemotherapy, and then reimplanted;;/  allogenic – the stem cells to be transplanted are donated by a donor. The donor may or may not be a family member, as long as they are compatible.;/  In general, autologous transplants are used in the case of Hodgkin's lymphoma. The treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma is always guided by a clinical hematologist and you should continue to follow up with your hematology consultation, carrying out regular blood and imaging tests.  The lymphatic system consists of a branched network of vessels that runs throughout our body, transporting lymph to all tissues, a fluid that contains white blood cells, particularly lymphocytes, responsible for fighting infections. Lymphatic vessels are connected to small masses of tissue called lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are small deposits of lymphocytes that act as filters for the lymph to eliminate bacteria or other harmful substances that circulate in it. In the body, we have clusters of lymph nodes in areas such as the armpits, groin, abdomen, neck and chest. Other constituent elements of the lymphatic system are the tonsils, spleen, great gland and bone marrow. Lymphatic tissue also exists in the skin, stomach and small intestine. The lymphatic system is closely linked to the blood vessels, with connections between the two systems, the circulatory and lymphatic. White blood cells are present in the lymph, but also in the blood.  Lymphocytes are the main cells of the immune system. Lymphocytes are white blood cells that are formed in the bone marrow, spleen and tonsils, and are then released into the bloodstream and lymphatic system, like other blood cells. Lymph nodes are also organs where lymphocytes are concentrated to mature, grow and divide after coming into contact with microorganisms. In short, these cells are dispersed throughout the body: they circulate and can be temporarily retained in various organs, mainly in the lymphoid organs and bone marrow.

There are several types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which can be grouped according to how quickly they form: Indolent lymphomas: tend to grow and spread slowly and cause few symptoms;;/ Aggressive lymphomas: tend to grow and spread quickly and patients are usually quite symptomatic.;/ Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common type of aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Regarding indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas, the most common is follicular lymphoma. //Diagnosis and Staging// In a patient with a clinical history and clinical examination suspicious of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, tests are used to diagnose the disease with the aim of understanding how many lymph node regions are affected by the disease, and whether it is in fact non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Gallbladder lithiasis,"//What is it?// Gallstone disease is the presence of one or more stones (commonly known as ""stones"") inside it. The gallbladder is a small sac located on the underside of the liver. It is where the bile produced in the liver is stored. After eating, the gallbladder contracts to release the bile into the small intestine through the bile ducts (a system of channels that drain bile from the liver) to aid in the digestion of fats. Gallstone disease is a common condition. In Europe around 10% of people have this condition. It is the most common disease of the bile ducts. In general, it is two to three times more common in women than in men. Age is important and the prevalence in females varies from 5% to 20% up to the age of 50 and from 25% to 30% after that age. //Symptoms// Around 80% do not present any type of complaints. Contrary to popular belief, “poor digestion” with fat, heartburn, increased intestinal gas, nausea, vomiting or headaches cannot be attributed to gallstone disease. The main symptom is pain or cramping in the “stomach” region or under the ribs on the right, which can extend to the left side, back, chest or the rest of the abdomen. This starts suddenly, sometimes overnight, lasting minutes or hours. It may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, sweating and paleness. The pain results from obstruction of the cystic duct or bile duct by a stone. Complications may occur due to inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis), bile ducts (cholangitis) or pancreas (pancreatitis). In these cases, the pain may be more severe and last longer. Fever and jaundice (“yellow eyes”) may also occur. These complications generally require hospital admission and urgent treatment. Gallstone disease is associated with an increased risk of gallbladder cancer. However, this type of cancer is rare. //Causes// Most stones form in the gallbladder, which is a small sac located next to the liver, under the ribs on the right. It stores bile, produced in the liver. After meals, the gallbladder contracts and bile passes into the duodenum through the bile ducts. Bile contains bilirubin and cholesterol. These substances can “crystallize” because the bile in the gallbladder becomes more concentrated. One can only verify the presence of multiple crystals which, when they come together, form stones. These can be as small as grape seeds or reach the size of golf balls. They can be single or multiple. Most are cholesterol; They are formed when the bile is too concentrated with this element or the gallbladder does not empty properly. It is thought that gallstones result from an imbalance in the various components of bile, especially when the bile contains too much cholesterol or too many bile pigments. Another cause is the malfunction of the gallbladder, with slow or incomplete emptying during digestion. Stones of different composition, for example bilirubin, can also form in certain diseases and situations. The main risk factors for the formation of stones are obesity, a diet with excess animal fats and few vegetables and fruit, lack of physical exercise, rapid weight loss that occurs in some obesity treatments, long periods of fasting, use of hormones and contraceptives. Other warning signs are age (over 60 years old), female gender, lithiasis in family members, pregnancy, diabetes, hemolytic anemia and liver cirrhosis. //Diagnosis// The best test for diagnosis is an abdominal ultrasound, but an abdominal CT scan may also be requested. However, many cases are diagnosed in tests requested for other reasons. //Treatment// Given that only 15 to 25% of patients with asymptomatic gallstone disease will experience symptoms or complications in the 10 to 15 years following diagnosis, these patients do not require treatment. However, treatment should be considered in the case of multiple small stones, given the risk of potentially serious complications, particularly associated with the migration of stones into the bile ducts. Patients with symptoms - biliary colic - must be treated. The therapy is also applied, even in the absence of manifestations, in diabetic patients or those taking immunosuppressants, in the presence of a calcified gallbladder, in the case of patients who reside or frequently travel to countries with poor health care, when there is rapid weight loss or when the stones are located in the bile ducts. Surgery to remove the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) is the ideal treatment for gallstone disease. It can be done classically (through a cut in the abdominal wall) or laparoscopically, in which the instruments enter the abdomen through small holes. This is recommended because it is less painful and easier to recover from. The lack of a gallbladder does not cause any major problems. Other modalities, but used very rarely, are their dissolution with medications or “shock wave” lithotripsy to fragment the stones. When these are in the bile ducts, treatment should be attempted by endoscopic examination of the bile ducts and pancreas. //Prevention// It involves preventing the formation of stones, which can be achieved by correcting risk factors such as obesity, a diet with excess animal fats and few vegetables and fruit, lack of physical exercise, rapid weight loss, long periods of fasting, use of hormones and contraceptives.

Kidney stones kidney stones,"//What is it?// Kidney stones, or renal lithiasis, is one of the most common causes of renal colic. Stones can have different compositions, the most common being calcium oxalate and uric acid. They can cause blood loss in the urine (hematuria), kidney infections (pyelonephritis) or renal colic. In many cases nothing can be done to prevent its formation; However, it is important to study the situation, with analysis and evaluation of the diet, in order to try to identify the cause for its formation, such as a diet with excess protein and salt, or little water, or even some metabolic factor. (uric acid) and, in this way, prevent the formation of new stones. Kidney stones are a very common disease, with an estimated global incidence of 2% to 3%. It is the third most common pathology of the genitourinary system, surpassed only by urinary infections and prostate problems. The majority of kidney stones are of mixed composition, with around 30% being formed by a single type of mineral. The most common type is calcium oxalate. Men are twice as likely to develop stones as women and the first episode occurs around the age of 30. In females, there are two incidence peaks, at 35 and 55 years of age. Recurrence is high and it is believed that 50% of untreated patients return to have lithiasis within a period of five years. After a more or less long period in which they do not cause symptoms, the passage of one of these stones into the ureter (the channel that transports urine between the kidneys and the bladder) triggers an attack of intense pain, called renal colic. In addition to causing pain, these stones can cause urinary infections or reduced kidney function in the long term. //Symptoms// Most kidney stones do not cause symptoms until the stone moves into the urinary tract. At this point, the pain is very intense and disabling. As a rule, it starts on the flank and radiates towards the groin, varying depending on its location. The pain of renal colic generates great agitation and has no relief. It may be accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Because the stone can injure the walls of the ureter as it passes down, some blood loss in the urine is normal. Renal colic is also associated with urinary urgency and discomfort in the bladder region, both caused by the passage of the stone into the bladder. These symptoms are identical to those found in urinary tract infections. More rarely, fever may occur, especially if obstruction occurs and stone progression stops. Generalized infection, although rare, can occur, so adequate monitoring of these cases is essential. It is also worth mentioning that flank pain typical of renal colic can occur in other diseases, which is why medical evaluation is important to exclude other pathologies. //Causes// Kidney stones correspond to mineral deposits. In general, urine contains substances that prevent the formation of these crystals. When these mechanisms do not work, stones can form in the kidney, ureters or bladder. The causes for its formation are not always known, but genetic influence is important. Kidney stones are more common in people with other kidney diseases, hyperparathyroidism, renal tubular acidosis, urinary tract infections, obesity, certain intestinal diseases, and diets rich in protein, sodium, and sugar. Drinking too little fluid also increases the risk. //Diagnosis// The diagnosis of kidney stones, or renal lithiasis, involves medical evaluation, blood and urine tests and imaging studies. Most stones are visible on an x-ray, but sometimes a CT scan may be necessary. //Treatment// With good hydration and analgesics, stones smaller than five millimeters are eliminated spontaneously in 90% of cases. Hydration aims to reduce urine saturation by preventing the processes that lead to its formation. Fluid intake must be sufficient to provide a urine volume of more than two thousand milliliters per day. It is important to increase hydration two hours after meals, during physical exercise, before bed and possibly at night. In the absence of any other treatment, it has been shown that adequate fluid intake can reduce the formation of lithiasis by up to around 60%. For stones measuring one centimeter, the probability of elimination without surgery is less than 10%. In addition to hydration and painkillers, the use of muscle relaxants can be helpful. If symptoms persist, stone removal becomes necessary, and is usually done by inserting a catheter through the urethra. Lithotripsy is a technique that uses sound waves to fragment stones in the kidney or urinary tract. There are other surgical modalities for the treatment of specific cases of kidney lithiasis. //Prevention// In addition to hydration, diet is very important. Calcium stones are the most common type of stone, so a moderate calcium diet reduces the risk. It is also important not to restrict calcium intake too much to avoid changes in bone density and interference with oxalate absorption in the intestine. Calcium supplements are associated with a 20% increased risk of stone formation, and should therefore be avoided. It is recommended that you consume calcium (dairy products and their derivatives such as milk, yogurt and cheese) in moderation in your diet. Animal proteins and sodium are also important risk factors for stone formation, so it is essential to limit your sodium and protein intake. Depending on their composition, there are foods to exclude, which reinforces the importance of laboratory diagnosis and adequate nutritional monitoring in order to prevent the formation of new stones. Brazilian Society of Nephrology Pedro Neto Gomes, Prophylaxis of renal lithiasis, Acta Urológica 2005, 22; 3:47-56 Paul K. Pietrow e col., Medical Management of Common Urinary Calculi, Am Fam Physician. 2006 Jul 1;74(1):86-94 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, Março, 2012 Load more;/ The kidney is a very important organ for the body's balance. Kidney diseases are usually silent, hence the importance of knowing the warning signs. A cause for alarm for anyone who encounters this problem, blood in the urine can be an indicator of several diseases, so it should not be ignored. Hypertension, stroke, dementia, osteoporosis, excess weight. Excess salt can increase the risk of several diseases. The key is moderation.

Lumbago,"//What is it?// This term refers to the presence of pain in the lumbar spine region, generally between the last ribs and above the glutes. Low back pain is often accompanied by pain that radiates to the lower limbs. It is, therefore, a symptom and not a disease, which means that it can manifest the presence of different clinical conditions. Almost everyone suffers from low back pain at some point in their lives. This pain can be mild or intense and can have a variable duration. It is a very common and disabling symptom, estimated to affect, at least once, 65% to 80% of the population. Low back pain is also one of the most frequent causes of disability retirement, which clearly reflects its personal and professional impact. It can be classified as acute (sudden onset and duration of less than six weeks), subacute (between six and 12 weeks) or chronic (over 12 weeks). This classification is important because of the different impact it has on the affected patient, but also because of the different causes and treatments of these different types of low back pain. In most cases, it has a mechanical origin, but in others it is psychological in nature (psychogenic), making these more difficult to diagnose. The anatomy of the spine is complex and includes the vertebrae, intervertebral discs and a whole set of muscular structures, ligaments and nerves. There are several regions in the spine: cervical, thoracic, lumbar and sacral. In this last region, the vertebrae are fused together. The lumbar region comprises five vertebrae. Whenever we walk or run, the discs absorb the impacts and prevent the vertebrae from colliding with each other. They contribute to the movements of the spine and facilitate its flexion and twisting. Each disc is composed of a fibrous ring and a gelatinous nucleus that allows the absorption of impacts. //Symptoms// Low back pain varies greatly from person to person and in its intensity. It can have a slow or sudden onset, it can be intermittent or constant. Sometimes low back pain feels like a needle-like pain or can feel like a cramp. These characteristics depend on the underlying cause of low back pain. It may be accompanied by pain that radiates to the lower limbs. The pain tends to improve when lying down or at rest and is usually associated with morning stiffness. On the contrary, the pain becomes worse when sitting, bending the trunk or lifting weights. Standing and walking also accentuates low back pain. The patient may limp or report a lack of strength in one of the legs. Depending on the cause, other symptoms may appear that are important for assessing the severity of each case and that may be useful for diagnosis. Thus, low back pain may be accompanied by weight loss, fever, recurrent skin or urinary infections, among other possible manifestations. The most worrying cases are those in which symptoms do not improve after three months, those that do not respond to treatment and those that occur in patients with a history of neoplastic disease. In the case of non-specific low back pain, the cause is usually an imbalance between the load borne at work or in daily life and the spine's ability to handle this weight. In this situation, pain occurs, but no structural change in the lumbar spine is identified. Even so, it causes a marked limitation of daily activities and may imply an inability to work. //Causes// In the majority of cases, around 90%, a cause for low back pain is not found and it is referred to as non-specific. This type of injury can occur at any age - and degenerative changes in the spine begin at age 30 and increase the risk of low back pain - especially in people who carry out professional activities associated with heavy physical effort, such as lifting weights or repetitive movements. Low back pain frequently occurs in sports such as baseball, golf, running, football, rowing, weight lifting, among others. It is more common in females, given the smaller height, muscle mass and bone density of women and the greater fragility of their joints. The most common causes of low back pain are musculoskeletal disorders related to degenerative, inflammatory, infectious, tumoural, traumatic or postural processes. There are also congenital musculoskeletal disorders that are associated with low back pain. Other possible causes are some abdominal diseases (especially pancreas and kidney), vascular diseases (abdominal aortic aneurysm, for example), neurological diseases or diseases resulting from changes in the intervertebral discs. Some cases may have a psychological origin. Rheumatic diseases and osteoporosis can also cause low back pain, as can tuberculosis and brucellosis. Other risk factors are remaining in a standing or sitting position for prolonged periods, obesity and poor muscle mass development. Injuries to the intervertebral discs cause longer-lasting low back pain. These injuries can be small “tears” in the fibrous ring of the disc, which become more frequent with age and, in some cases, do not cause any pain. However, the pain is common and can last for months. Other disc injuries that are associated with low back pain are herniated discs, which can cause sciatica. Over the course of life, the discs lose their water content and reduce their size and may collapse, which allows the vertebrae to collide against each other. This friction process causes pain and stiffness and is called osteoarthritis. The aging process and the overload on the spine can make it difficult to maintain the vertebrae in their correct position, allowing them to slide over each other, thus compressing neighboring nerve roots. Narrowing of the spinal canal is another cause of pressure on the spinal cord and nerves. This narrowing may be a consequence of the growth of bone tissue, the spurs, stimulated by the collapse of the discs and osteoarthritis and whose function is to better support the vertebrae. These spurs eventually narrow the channel. Likewise, the process of osteoarthritis causes the ligaments to thicken, which also narrows the spinal canal. Scoliosis, which corresponds to an abnormal curvature of the spine, is also a cause of low back pain and leg-related symptoms if nerve compression occurs. //Diagnosis// The clinical history and medical examination are very important. Additional tests are selected based on this assessment and may consist of imaging studies (X-ray, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging), bone scintigraphy and/or laboratory studies. Osteodensitometry may be important to assess the presence of osteoporosis. X-rays may show arthritic changes in the spine such as collapse of the disc space, bone spicules (“parrot’s beak”), hypertrophy of the interapophyseal joints or slippage of one vertebra over another (spondylolisthesis), but the specificity of these changes is limited since they are present in most people, even if they are asymptomatic. //Treatment// Treatment depends on the cause and its main objective is to relieve pain. For this purpose, analgesics, anti-inflammatories and/or muscle relaxants may be useful, and should be selected and prescribed by a doctor based on each case. In some situations, corticosteroids may be indicated, as well as joint injections. The use of heat or cold, massage, ultrasound or electro-stimulation may be important. Some extension, weight lifting or cardiovascular exercises help to regain mobility and strengthen the lower back muscles, which helps to alleviate pain. In some cases, containment straps are used to provide symptomatic relief. In chronic low back pain, depressive complaints may be associated and antidepressants may play a relevant role. In some cases, surgery may be indicated, but should only be considered six months to a year after the onset of symptoms. On the other hand, surgery should only be considered when the specific cause of the low back pain is known. Surgery may involve fusing the vertebrae so that they heal as a single bone, thus eliminating movement in that vertebral segment. This option is considered when movement is the cause of the pain, as is the case with scoliosis or severe degeneration. Another possibility is replacing a damaged disc, maintaining the flexibility and mobility of the spine. //Prevention// It is not always possible to prevent the development of low back pain. However, it is possible to control its risk factors, such as overexertion, obesity, osteoporosis and by diagnosing and treating associated diseases. Whenever you need to lift weights, it is important to bend your legs and keep your spine straight. Good posture and aerobic exercise, such as walking or swimming, combined with exercises that strengthen the muscles in your lower back and abdominal region are very helpful. Good weight control, not smoking and maintaining correct posture in all positions are essential.

Lupus,"//What is it?// The word means wolf in Latin. This name was given due to the skin lesions that are very common in Lupus. It is an autoimmune disease, in which the immune system, instead of protecting the body, attacks it, causing inflammation and changes in the function of the affected system. Inflammation causes pain, heat, redness and swelling. There is no known cause for Lupus and there is no cure for this disease. It is a chronic pathology, even though there are inactive and reactive phases. It can affect many different organs and systems and there are very different forms of the disease. In fact, symptoms vary from patient to patient and even, in the same patient, from period to period. Lupus can be associated with serious complications, but, in general, the available treatments allow maintaining a good quality of life. Females are eight to ten times more affected, especially at childbearing ages, but men can also be affected. The most common ages for the onset of Lupus are between 18 and 55 years old, but this disease can begin at any age (children or the elderly). There are currently around four thousand cases of Lupus in Portugal. Family members of patients with autoimmune diseases (thyroiditis, type 1 diabetes) are more likely to be affected by this disease.  //What are the different forms of Lupus?// Systemic, more generalized disease, which can affect any organ or system in the body;;/ Discoid, which is a form limited to the skin that can sometimes develop into systemic lupus.;/ //Symptoms// Its manifestations are very variable. Among them are tiredness, loss of appetite and weight loss. Red or pink spots may appear on the skin of the face (especially on the cheeks and nose, in a butterfly shape), neck or arms. These correspond to discoid lesions. In these areas the skin becomes more raised and a scar may form. Patients report a lot of sensitivity to sunlight (photosensitivity) and there may be a change in the color of the extremities (fingers or toes) that become white or bluish, triggered by cold and/or emotions. Sometimes there is hair loss, ulcers in the mouth or nose, joint pain (fingers, wrists, knees, ankles or hips) predominantly in the morning and sometimes accompanied by stiffness and/or heat, redness, swelling and difficulty in movement, generally without joint deformities. Other systems can be affected, such as the respiratory system, with inflammation of the lining of the lungs (pleura), which is manifested by chest pain and coughing; cardiac, with inflammation of the lining of the heart (pericardium), also with chest pain, but with different characteristics; and renal, with loss of proteins or other substances in the urine. More rarely, convulsions, depression, increased susceptibility to infections, bleeding or easy bruising may occur due to a decrease in the number of platelets. Generally speaking, these symptoms are not present simultaneously, but rather at certain stages of the disease. //Causes// There is still no known cause, except for the rare forms that are caused by the ingestion of specific drugs. Lupus is related to conditions that give rise to a certain predisposition to the disease. These causes can be genetic, hormonal or environmental. Precipitating factors are situations that cause the pathology to manifest itself in the form of obvious symptoms and signs. These can be internal, such as physical stress, excessive fatigue, infections, sleep deprivation, trauma, pregnancy, or external, such as sunlight or artificial light and emotional stress. //Diagnosis// Its diagnosis is based on clinical and laboratory elements. Laboratory tests alone are not enough. However, in conjunction with the symptoms reported by the patient and the signs observed by the doctor, they are very helpful. In some cases the diagnosis is difficult because clinical data at that time are not sufficient. On the other hand, Lupus presents very varied forms. The diagnosis depends on the combination of clinical and laboratory elements (blood and urine). //Treatment// The goal of treatment is to prevent damage to vital organs and to keep the disease in an inactive phase. It may include medications, adequate exercise and rest, diet, and avoiding exposure to ultraviolet radiation and stress. Medication: Drugs are necessary for most patients and are the most effective way to treat severe forms. These may have to be changed according to the stages of the disease. The most commonly used medications are anti-inflammatories, which reduce inflammation and pain, and are useful during the acute phases of the disease; antimalarials, which help stabilize the immune system; corticosteroids, important in severe cutaneous and joint forms; immunosuppressants, which reduce the autoimmune inflammatory response that exists in Lupus; immunoglobulins and other newer drugs (biological therapies);;/ Exercise and physical therapy: A proper balance between exercise and rest is essential. Physiotherapy and appropriate aerobic exercise (especially in water) help relax and maintain muscle and joint function;;/ Diet: This can be a determining factor, especially when there is kidney involvement, and must be adjusted to each case;;/ Care and protection when exposed to the sun: It is essential to avoid exposure to ultraviolet rays (solar or artificial), both directly and indirectly, as this exposure can trigger flare-ups on the skin and other organs. The use of sunscreen (with a high protection factor) in all outdoor activities, whether in summer or winter, on exposed areas is essential. Avoiding the hours of greatest sun exposure during the hottest months and wearing appropriate clothing (long sleeves, wide-brimmed hats, light-colored clothing) can also be very important.;/ //Prevention// There is no way to prevent it. It is only possible to avoid some of the precipitating factors.

Luxacao acromioclavicular,"//What is it?// This injury is common and affects young athletes involved in motorsports and those involving throwing. It also occurs in contact sports (football, rugby), cycling and car accidents. It accounts for approximately 3% of shoulder injuries and 40% of shoulder sports injuries. It is more common in women and between the ages of 20 and 30. This joint connects the shoulder blade to the collarbone and is supported by several ligaments that can rupture when an injury occurs in this region. Injuries to this joint are classified into types I to VI, depending on the extent of the injury and the number of ligaments involved. The most common traumatic AC injuries are caused by direct forces on the superolateral border of the shoulder with the arm in adduction, usually in the context of a fall. In our reality, these injuries are typical of the 2nd and 3rd decade of life, in the context of contact sports (MTB, rugby, motocross, bullfighting) and affect men between 3 and 10 times more frequently. Thus, in grade I there is a partial stretching/rupture of the acromio-clavicular ligaments and in grade II a total rupture, without there being a radiographic translation of the injury. In grade III, there is a superior translation of the clavicle in relation to the acromion, due to rupture of the coraco-clavicular ligaments, while in grade IV, in addition to being superior, it is also posterior, into or through the fibers of the trapezius. In grade V injuries, the separation is even greater, with loss of integrity of the trapeziodeltoid fascia, with the lateral end of the clavicle becoming subcutaneous. Rare grade VI is characterized by passage of the clavicle below the coracoid process/joint tendon. //Symptoms// This injury manifests itself in the form of pain and swelling in the upper shoulder region. The pain is initially diffuse and later is localized in the area of ​​the acromioclavicular joint. A hematoma may form and the collarbone may become more prominent. Shoulder movements are limited, causing pain when raising the arm. The pain becomes worse at night, especially when the body turns towards the involved shoulder. More rarely, you may feel or hear a noise or crack in the joint region. The acromioclavicular joint, when injured, tends to suffer from painful arthritis processes. //Causes// The injury can be caused by a direct force, such as a fall on the shoulder, or indirect, when the fall is on the hand and the arm is extended. //Diagnosis// Diagnosis is based on clinical history and medical examination. The X-ray allows visualization of the joint involved. Magnetic resonance imaging is not always requested but can be useful in cases, especially in cases of persistent pain. The clinical diagnosis of acute AC injuries is relatively simple since the pain that accompanies them is easily localized, along with the direct impact mechanism. Conventional radiography is the best test for diagnosing dislocations above grade III. Soft tissue ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging are not routinely used, and when used, they are used to assess the extent of ligament injuries and trapeziodeltoid aponeurosis. //Treatment// This type of injury is very painful and affects joint mobility. As such, physiotherapy has an important role. Initial treatment includes the use of anti-inflammatories and, if necessary, corticosteroid injections in the affected area. Rest, use of ice, compression and elevation of the affected arm are also important. These measures should be started early, within the first 48-72 hours, and help reduce pain and bleeding within the joint. Ice should be applied for 20-minute periods every 2 hours. The arm must be immobilized for a period of 2 days to 6 weeks, depending on the severity of the injury. Surgery is indicated in the most severe cases (IV to VI) and involves reconstructing the damaged ligaments. If a fracture occurs, surgery may also play a role. After treatment is complete, return to sports activity depends on the absence of pain and swelling, the presence of 80% of shoulder strength capacity, full range of passive to active shoulder movements, and stability of the shoulder blade. //Prevention// Prevention involves the use of appropriate protections in contact sports, correct warming up and cooling down, frequency of training programs that develop strength, balance, coordination and flexibility, progressive increase in training intensity, adequate rest between training sessions, consumption of water before, during and after exercise and stop whenever you feel pain.

Shoulder dislocation,"//What is it?// Shoulder dislocation is an injury that occurs when the head of the humerus moves out of its anatomical position in the joint. The shoulder is the most mobile joint in the body, which makes it the most susceptible to dislocation. The occurrence of a first episode of dislocation increases the risk of further episodes of dislocation - Recurrent Shoulder Dislocation/Shoulder Instability. Due to its characteristics, the shoulder joint is the most frequently dislocated. In fact, although it is very mobile, it is also very unstable and is maintained in its position by a set of ligamentous and muscular structures. Anterior displacement is the most common and accounts for around 98% of cases. In fact, anterior shoulder dislocation is the most common in hospital emergency services. Posterior dislocation may also occur, with the superior and intrathoracic variants being rarer and more complicated. One of the most common mechanisms is falling. Shoulder dislocation is more common in men aged 20-30 and in women aged around 60-80. There is a possibility of re-dislocation of about 50%. Shoulder dislocations are more common in adolescents than in children because in them the growth plates are more fragile and tend to break before dislocation occurs. In older adults, the ligaments that support the joint are weaker, making it easier for dislocation to occur. Between the ages of 18 and 25, sports activities are the main cause of shoulder dislocation. In the elderly, falls are the main factor involved. //Symptoms// Dislocations can occur as a result of falls, shoulder trauma or sports injuries, and are associated with pain, loss of arm mobility and deformity in the shoulder region. After correction of the dislocation, the patient may experience symptoms of instability: a feeling of imminent dislocation (apprehension) or other episodes of dislocation even with small movements or trauma to the shoulder. Patients with shoulder dislocation report severe pain and limited movement in the affected arm. The rounded shape of the shoulder takes on a more quadrangular shape. One of the complications of shoulder dislocation is the possibility of relapse. Shoulder dislocation can also be associated with fractures, damage to the axillary or radial nerve that may require surgery and vascular injuries that can compromise circulation in the arm. The presence of numbness in some areas of the shoulder, arm or hand should raise suspicion of nerve involvement. //Causes// Anterior shoulder dislocation results from an outward movement of the extended arm with external rotation, as occurs in volleyball. Falls on an extended arm are another risk factor. In general, all sports that involve throwing can be associated with this situation, as can contact sports. Good examples are combat sports, mountain climbing, handball, gymnastics and snowboarding. Throwing an object, catching an object, combing your hair, or turning in bed can all cause a shoulder dislocation. Posterior dislocations result from internal rotation with inward movement of the arm. Some possible causes are a fall, an epileptic seizure, an electric shock, or a direct impact. //Diagnosis// A medical examination is essential and allows for a diagnosis. Each type of dislocation presents different signs that the doctor can evaluate. It is important to evaluate the axillary nerve as well as other musculocutaneous nerves. The diagnosis of dislocation is carried out through an X-ray, which also allows the identification of other possible associated injuries, namely fractures. In cases of recurrent dislocation, the assessment should be complemented by Magnetic Resonance Imaging for a more precise definition of associated injuries, as well as for decision-making and treatment planning. Angiography and Doppler allow the assessment of potential vascular lesions and electromyography assesses the integrity of nerve structures. //Treatment// The initial treatment of the dislocation involves immediate correction of the dislocation. Subsequently, and for single episodes, the patient must be immobilized for a short period of time, medicated with anti-inflammatory drugs and directed to physiotherapy. In cases of recurrent dislocation, surgery is indicated to correct this pathology, as well as to prevent earlier progression to osteoarthritis. Treatment for shoulder dislocation consists of reducing it through a gentle but firm maneuver, performed under analgesia or sedation. After a successful reduction maneuver, it is important to immobilize the shoulder and perform a control x-ray. //Prevention// To prevent a relapse, it is important to avoid immediate participation in sports activities, as well as performing gestures that involve external rotation of the arm and its outward movement, such as combing hair.

Malaria,"//What is it?// Malaria is caused by a parasite, Plasmodium, with Plasmodium falciparum responsible for the majority of serious or fatal cases. It is transmitted through the bite of a female mosquito. Once in the body, it multiplies in the liver, infecting red blood cells. According to the World Health Organization, around 3.3 billion people are at risk of contracting malaria during their lifetime, particularly in poorer countries. The annual incidence of this disease is estimated to be over 500 million new cases, accounting for more than one million deaths per year. Since the mosquitoes that transmit the parasite are abundant in tropical climates, these are the areas where malaria is most common. In Portugal, the disease remained endemic until around 1950, particularly in the Mondego, Sado and Águeda river basins, when the vector was eradicated. However, due to migration between Portugal and Portuguese-speaking countries located in endemic regions (Angola, Mozambique, Guinea, São Tomé and Príncipe and Timor), malaria, in its imported form, continues to appear sporadically in Portugal. . In recent decades, the increase in the volume of international travel, notably to tropical destinations, has also led to an increase in imported cases. Although the majority has an external origin, it appears that the vector (mosquito) remains abundantly distributed throughout the national territory. Thus, its presence combined with the existence of imported cases and increasingly accentuated climate changes, make it possible for future infections to occur. In fact, climate change is one of the factors involved in the increase in the transmission of infectious diseases, and is related to the possibility of the re-emergence of malaria in some areas of the northern hemisphere. //Symptoms// The parasite initially enters the bloodstream and travels to the liver, where the infection develops before re-entering the bloodstream and invading red blood cells. It grows and multiplies within these blood cells, and at regular intervals the blood cells rupture, releasing more parasites into the blood. Infected red blood cells typically rupture every 48 to 72 hours. Whenever this rupture occurs, patients develop fever, chills, and sweats. The clinical presentation of malaria is very variable, and may present few symptoms or acute and very serious forms. Its evolution can be fulminant and cause death within the first few hours of the onset of the disease, which is why treatment must be instituted as early as possible in suspected cases. Symptoms include fever, headaches, vomiting and, in general, appear 10 to 15 days after the mosquito bite. If not promptly treated, it affects the irrigation of vital organs and can be fatal. About half of the world's population is at risk of contracting malaria. Most cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa. However, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and parts of Europe are also affected. The risk is greater in children who have not yet developed immunity against serious forms of the disease, in non-immune pregnant women (risk of miscarriage and death of the mother), in people infected with the HIV/AIDS virus and in international travelers without immunity. //Causes// There are several species of the parasite Plasmodium falciparum but only five cause malaria in humans: Plasmodium falciparum, responsible for the most severe forms of the disease;;/ Plasmodium vivax, which causes less symptomatic forms but can remain in the liver for up to three years;;/ Plasmodium ovale, which is rarer and can remain in the liver for years without causing symptoms;;/ Plasmodium malariae, very rare and only found in Africa;;/ Plasmodium knowlesi, also very rare.;/ //Diagnosis// Early diagnosis of malaria is essential for its treatment. This should be done using a blood sample using a microscope or very rapid laboratory tests. An early and correct diagnosis not only allows for more effective treatment but also reduces the emergence of resistance to therapy. //Treatment// Recently, there has been an increase in resistance, both in mosquitoes to insecticides used and in parasites to antimalarials. Despite everything, it is a disease that can be treated and prevented. The main objective is to quickly eliminate the parasite from the patient's blood in order to prevent the progression of the disease and its complications. Another important goal is to prevent the transmission of the disease to other people. Treatment should only begin after the diagnosis has been confirmed. This is done using antimalarial drugs, the selection of which is the responsibility of the doctor. These drugs are administered orally. Chloroquine is useful for malaria caused by Plasmodium vivax, another species of this parasite. In severe cases, treatment should take place in a hospital setting. //Prevention// As general measures, it is recommended to avoid exposure during periods of greatest mosquito activity (at dawn and dusk); wear long clothing to avoid exposed areas of skin and wear closed shoes; use insect repellent on the skin and clothing; apply a mosquito net to the bed, if possible impregnated with insecticide; turn on the air conditioning to keep mosquitoes away from the room. Malaria prevention also involves the use of medications such as mefloquine, atovaquone and proguanil (Malarone™), doxycycline, chloroquine or chloroquine and proguanil. The complexity of the parasite responsible for malaria makes developing a vaccine difficult. Currently, there are several under investigation. Portugal has been one of the countries where this study has been very intense. When the heat arrives, insects follow. Their bites are not usually serious, but they are annoying. Learn some strategies to protect yourself. There are several precautions to be taken to prevent any mishaps from ruining your stay in a tropical destination. Go to a traveler's consultation and ask about the risks. Being prepared is the best way to ensure that everything goes well on your vacation.

3D Mammography Tomosynthesis,"//What is it?// Tomosynthesis is an advanced technology, which is part of the highest state of the art in breast imaging. It is a key exam in the early diagnosis of breast cancer, allowing to significantly improve the accuracy of the diagnosis with higher quality images and a lower dose of radiation. In this examination, multiple images of the breast are obtained, of thin thickness, from different angles, allowing the detection of increasingly smaller lesions (millimetric), which in conventional mammography could remain hidden due to the overlapping of the various breast structures.  //Its great advantage// The equipment is similar to a common mammogram, but it uses an x-ray tube to record images from all angles, such as 1 mm thick slices of the entire breast. In addition to better definition of lesions and, consequently, greater success in the early diagnosis of breast cancer, tomosynthesis reduces the number of false positives and false negatives in conventional mammography.  //Standards and Recommendations - Ultrasound and Mammography// < 35 years: ultrasound is the first-line examination and often the only one indicated.;/ 35 - 40 years: ultrasound must be performed and it is up to the radiologist to recommend mammography.;/ > 40 years: mammography is the first-line examination and ultrasound should be performed as a complement to mammography.;/ Ultrasound should not be performed in isolation, due to the high risk of false negatives.;/ Exceptions:Patient with breast exams less than 1 year old;For evaluation of Prostheses;Bilateral mastectomy;Recent post-traumatic context;Inflammatory process/breast abscess;Pregnancy;Interventional procedures.;/ Patient with breast exams less than 1 year old;;/ For evaluation of Prostheses;;/ Mastectomia bilateral;;/ Recent post-traumatic context;;/ Inflammatory process / breast abscess;;/ Pregnancy;;/ Intervention procedures.;/  Regardless of age group, whenever mammography is prescribed, breast ultrasound as a complementary exam is mandatory.

Contrast mammography,"//What is it ?// Contrast mammography is a recent technique that uses the administration of iodinated contrast to visualize tumor neovascularization in a similar way to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with contrast. In contrast mammography, 2 minutes after intravenous administration of iodinated contrast, a dual-energy digital mammogram is acquired, providing two images per breast and per projection, one of low energy similar to digital mammography and another recombined in which the areas that capture contrast are highlighted, enabling a simultaneous morphological and functional evaluation.  //The big advantage// Mammography and tomosynthesis identify anatomical changes caused by breast cancer and are the first-line exams in breast cancer screening and in breast studies of symptomatic patients. However, they are less effective in women with extremely dense breasts. MRI is superior in the evaluation of women with dense breasts and those at intermediate risk of breast cancer, and contrast-enhanced mammography is a less expensive and more accessible alternative to MRI for a wide range of women. Other advantages of contrast mammography are rapid acquisition (8-10 min) and interpretation, with an easy learning curve and good acceptance by users.  //Potential indications// Contrast mammography is useful in resolving inconclusive mammography and tomosynthesis findings;;/ It can be used to assess the extent of breast cancer in preoperative staging as an alternative to Magnetic Resonance Imaging;;/ It can monitor the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast carcinoma;;/ In screening women with a history of breast carcinoma and dense breast (intermediate risk);;/ In high-risk women who cannot undergo MRI screening.;/ ////"

Mastitis,"//What is it?// Mastitis is a benign inflammation of the breast tissue, common during the first months of breastfeeding, especially in the first six to 12 weeks of breastfeeding. However, it can also appear in women who are not breastfeeding and in men. It is often the result of an infection and can cause pain and swelling in the breast. It most often affects just one breast, but can appear in both breasts. There are two types of mastitis: Puerperal (or breastfeeding) mastitis: This type of infection affects women who are breastfeeding and is the most common. It can make breastfeeding difficult. When you need antibiotic treatment, you can continue breastfeeding or expressing milk to give to your baby. Breast milk contains antibacterial properties that help protect the baby from infection.;/ Periductal mastitis: occurs when the milk ducts become thicker. The nipple of the affected breast may invert and produce a milky discharge. Menopausal or postmenopausal women and smokers are more likely to have this type of mastitis.;/  //Symptoms of mastitis// Signs and symptoms of mastitis can appear suddenly and include: I miss my mother;/ Pain or burning sensation that is ongoing or during breastfeeding;/ Redness and swelling in the breast;/ Skin warm to the touch;/ Yellow nipple discharge;/ Feeling unwell;/ Fever;/ Body pains;/ Fatigue;/ Goosebumps;/  Some signs that you should seek medical advice for are: Inflammation or infection in the breasts that persists;/ I miss my mother;/ Sudden or severe symptoms;/ Red stripes on the chest;/ Breast milk with pus or blood;/ Symptoms do not improve within 24 hours;/ Symptoms do not improve after 48 hours of taking antibiotics;/ Having mastitis and not breastfeeding;/ Changes in the appearance of the breast and to the touch;/ Nipple discharge;/ Presence of a new nodule;/  //Causes// Mastitis is a common problem in breastfeeding women and can be caused by the accumulation of milk and blockage of the milk ducts, resulting in infection. This can happen, for example, when the breast is not “empty” after each feed. However, women who are not breastfeeding (and men) can also get mastitis. In addition to breastfeeding, some risk factors for mastitis are: Having had mastitis while breastfeeding.;/ Cracked nipples and skin.;/ Wearing a bra that is too tight or putting pressure on your breasts, for example when wearing a seatbelt or carrying a heavy bag, which can restrict milk flow.;/ Improper breastfeeding technique or using only one position to breastfeed.;/ Being too tired or stressed.;/ Poor nutrition.;/ Smoking: Toxins in tobacco can damage breast tissue.;/ Nipple damage, such as piercings, or dermatological problems such as eczema.;/ Have breast implants.;/ Having a weakened immune system due to health problems such as diabetes.;/ Remove hair around the nipple with a razor or tweezers.;/  //Diagnosis// Mastitis is diagnosed through a physical examination and by recording the symptoms and signs presented. In addition, a culture of a breast milk sample can help determine which antibiotic is most appropriate for each specific case, especially in cases of severe infection. Inflammatory breast cancer — which is a rare form of breast cancer — can also cause redness and swelling that may initially be mistaken for mastitis. To exclude this or other breast diseases, if mastitis occurs in a person who is not breastfeeding, the doctor may prescribe a mammogram and/or ultrasound. If symptoms persist even after taking antibiotics, a biopsy may be necessary to rule out other problems, including breast cancer.  //Mastitis treatment// When mastitis is confirmed, the doctor may prescribe oral antibiotics to combat the infection and painkillers. The infection should disappear within ten days, however, there are situations in which it can last up to three weeks. Most of the time, mastitis during breastfeeding resolves without the need for medical treatment. Women who are breastfeeding and have breast inflammation can continue breastfeeding, starting with the breast that does not have symptoms, and after each feeding, empty the affected breast, either manually or using a pump. You can also apply cold compresses after breastfeeding, get a massage, wear a bra with good support, rest whenever possible and drink plenty of fluids. Some strategies that can be applied to breastfeeding for a more appropriate technique are: Avoid having an excessive amount of milk for a long time before breastfeeding. If necessary, express milk manually or with a pump between feedings.;/ Try to ensure that your baby is latching on correctly - something that can be difficult if your baby is engorged. Hand expressing a small amount of milk before feeding can help.;/ Massage the breast in circular motions while breastfeeding or pumping, starting at the affected area and moving down to the nipple to help the milk flow.;/ Make sure you drain your breasts completely while breastfeeding. Applying moist heat to your breasts before breastfeeding or expressing milk with a pump can make this easier.;/ Vary the breastfeeding position.;/  //Prevention// To reduce the risk of mastitis, it is important to: Treat engorgement and cracked nipples early.;/ Make sure the baby attaches correctly to the breast.;/ Avoid tight clothing that compresses the breast.;/ Avoid compressing the breast excessively with your fingers while breastfeeding.;/ Do not use nursing pads or very tight bras that keep your nipples moist.;/ Air the breast after breastfeeding.;/ Breastfeed the baby on one side until the breast is empty of milk before switching to the other side.;/ Change the breastfeeding position so that all areas of the breast are completely empty.;/ Quit smoking (in the case of smokers).;/ American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology, julho de 2022 Cleveland Clinic, July 2022 Mayo Clinic, July 2022 NHS, July 2022 SNS24, July 2022 What is the best way to breastfeed, how to prevent problems, how to preserve breast milk.

Fear,"//What is it?// Fear corresponds to an unpleasant emotion with physiological, cognitive and behavioral components. It occurs as a response to a consciously recognized cause of danger (real or imagined). All children have episodes of fear, with the highest incidence estimated to be between the ages of 2-6. The peak incidence occurs at 11 years of age, decreasing from that age onwards. There are several factors that can contribute to triggering fears: feared stimuli (contact with a dog/other large animal, etc.) or cultural factors (parents' divorce).  //Symptoms// At birth we are only predisposed to be afraid of falls and certain noises. 1st year of life: Separation, Noise, Falls 2 years: Animals, Potty training, Bath 3 years: Bedtime, Afraid of the dark, Monsters, Ghosts 5 years: Parents' divorce, Getting lost 7 years: Loss/death of parents, Social rejection 9 years: War, New situations, Adoption 12 years: Thieves, Injections //How to proceed?// Parents should know that most fears are normal, temporary and do not represent any problem. Young children do not distinguish fantasy from reality; for them, the monster they fear is real.;/ Parents should not exacerbate their children’s fear (example: “the doctor will punish you if you don’t behave”);/ Respect the fear that the child feels, without giving it undue importance;/ You should not force the child to come into contact with their fears;/ Parents should reassure and help their children overcome their fears (e.g., talk about the fear in an attempt to correct a misconception).;/ In young children, some fears cannot be explained rationally, so parents will have to use certain actions (for example, if the child is afraid of monsters, parents should tell him: “houses don't let monsters in, so at home we don't there are monsters”);/ As for nighttime fears: turn on the light; comfort your child by saying repeatedly if necessary: ​​“I’m here… daddy is here”; respond to his fears in a calm and gentle tone; give him his favorite stuffed animal, doll or hero to keep him company when you return to your room (while your child stays in his).;/ //Treatment// The fear evolves into a generalized, recurring or especially frightening situation that compromises the child's performance.

Melanoma,"//What is it?// Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that starts in pigment-producing skin cells called melanocytes. These cells change and begin to grow uncontrollably and invade surrounding tissue. Although melanoma is less common than other types of skin cancer, it is arguably one of the most serious. Fortunately, melanoma can be cured if it is diagnosed and treated in its early stages, that is, when it is located only in the most superficial layer of the skin. In more advanced stages, melanoma can spread over a distance, a process called metastasis, through the blood or lymphatic system to other organs and bones, reducing the likelihood of a cure.  Melanoma grows in tissues in two ways: - radial growth (less invasive and earlier) - vertical growth, that is, deep in the dermis and close to vessels, with the capacity to cause metastases.  People with dark skin have the same number of melanocytes as people with paler skin. The difference lies in the amount of melanin that these same cells produce. Therefore, the greater the production of melanin, the darker the skin will be and vice versa. //Prevention// The number of people with melanoma has increased year after year, but there are ways to reduce your risk of developing the disease. Check your moles frequently and notify your doctor of any changes in them or your skin. If you have a lot of moles, you should see a dermatologist regularly.  You've probably heard that the most effective method of preventing melanoma is avoiding the sun. In fact, excessive exposure to the sun not only causes skin aging, but can also contribute to the development of skin cancer, particularly melanoma.  Reinforcing this association is the increased incidence of malignant melanoma in people with a history of sunburn in childhood.  However, exposure to sunlight in moderation is beneficial. In addition to the psychological effect, sun exposure is essential for synthesizing vitamin D in the skin. Vitamin D promotes joint and bone health, but it has also been linked to the prevention of certain types of cancer and autoimmune diseases. A healthy person needs 5 to 15 minutes of sun exposure most days, on their hands, arms and face, to produce a sufficient amount of vitamin D. During winter, they need 2 to 3 hours a week.  You should never use a solarium with the aim of synthesizing vitamin D. Solariums are artificial sources of ultraviolet radiation. Its use is associated with an increased risk of melanoma, particularly in people who started this practice under the age of 35. Early diagnosis leads, in most cases, to a cure of the tumor, but diagnosis in late stages leads to high mortality and morbidity, which is why it is important to increase the diagnostic reliability of melanoma This is the main reason why it is so important to detect melanoma before it affects the dermis. Most people can be cured if the melanoma is confined to the epidermis.   //Risk Factors// The exact causes of melanoma are unknown. Everyone is at greater or lesser risk of developing melanoma. For this reason, monthly self-examination with the help of family members is recommended.  A risk factor is anything that increases the likelihood of developing a disease. Some risk factors are passed from parents to children through genes. Others are the result of a person's behaviors and activities. Several factors can increase the risk of melanoma. Having one or more risk factors does not necessarily mean that you will develop melanoma. On the other hand, melanomas can also occur in people without any known risk factors.  Family history of Melanoma Around 10% of melanoma patients have a family history of the same tumor.  Ultraviolet radiation Excessive exposure to UV radiation depends on the intensity of the radiation, duration of exposure and how the skin was protected. Blistering sunburns, especially during childhood, increase the risk of melanoma.  Many or atypical signs Moles are areas of skin with a lot of melanin. The existence of a high number of moles (>50) or with atypical characteristics constitutes a risk factor for melanoma. Although lighter-skinned people have a much higher risk, it is a myth that people with darker skin are immune to melanoma. Black individuals, for example, tend to develop melanomas on the palms of their hands and soles of their feet, places that are not so easily monitored.  Immunosuppression states, genetic syndromes, carriers of specific genetic mutations (CDKN2A, CDK4, MITF) They are less frequent groups of the population but with an increased risk of melanoma  It is important that you recognize your risk factors.  This caution can help you make informed decisions about prevention and screening options.  //Symptoms// Melanoma symptoms are not exclusive, they can appear in other diseases. Just because you have one or more of the symptoms described here does not mean you have melanoma.  The ABCDE rule is an easy way to remember how to distinguish healthy signs of Melanoma:  A – Asymmetry – half of the signal does not match the other half B – Irregular border – the edges of the mole are irregular, without pattern, blunt or poorly defined C – Color– the color of the signal is not uniform. There can be different shades of brown or black, and sometimes reddish, bluish or white. D – Diameter – the mole is larger than 6 millimeters – the equivalent of the eraser tip of a pencil. However, there are melanomas smaller than 6mm. E – Evolution  But, regardless of the characteristics of your signs, whenever you perform your self-examination or when you observe the signs of someone in your family or close to you, remember the following statements: I don't have any other sign like this;/ This sign is different from all the other signs I have;/ I've never seen a sign like this;/ I don't know anyone with a sign like this;/ This sign has changed in the last few years or months;/ I don't remember having this sign here;/ This sign did not exist and is growing;/ This sign was smaller than the others and now it is bigger and has a different color.;/ //Who should I contact?// If you notice any of the signs or symptoms described, you should consult a Dermatologist. CUF Oncology has teams specialized in oncological dermatology at its disposal, with extensive experience in different approaches to Skin Cancer, especially Melanoma. Meet our team of experts Make your contact request so we can follow up from the first moment. If you prefer, you can schedule an appointment via our toll-free line. The clinical subtypes of melanoma are superficial spreading melanoma, nodular melanoma, acral lentiginous melanoma, lentigo maligna, among others. The most common type of melanoma in white people is superficial melanoma, responsible for 70% of cases. It usually appears between 30 and 50 years of age, with the most common locations being the leg in women and the back in men. The 2nd most common type in white people is nodular melanoma, responsible for 15% of cases. It usually appears around the age of 50, in both sexes. Acral lentiginous melanoma is the most common type of melanoma in Asian/black populations, appearing around the age of 60-70, on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, mucous membranes or subungual. //Diagnosis and Staging// The first step in diagnosing malignant melanoma is for your dermatologist to examine your skin thoroughly. In addition to examining your skin, you will be asked about your past and present sun exposure, history of mole excision and skin tumors, and any family history of melanoma or other cancer (or other risk factors).  One tool your dermatologist may use is dermatoscopy. This non-invasive procedure involves the use of a dermatoscope, a device with a magnifying lens and a special light source, which is used to examine suspicious skin lesions. Digital images from the dermoscopy can be recorded and used for comparison in subsequent consultations. Dermoscopy allows the detection of very slight changes in existing signs and the easier detection of new signs of risk. Therefore, dermoscopy significantly increases the sensitivity of melanoma diagnosis. Although many melanomas can be recognized by their appearance with the naked eye and by dermoscopy, a definitive diagnosis is made with a biopsy. To perform a biopsy, the dermatologist will remove the entire suspicious lesion. This sample will be evaluated by a pathologist who will identify the cancerous cells. If the sample reveals the presence of melanoma, the dermatologist will determine the complementary diagnostic procedure to follow and the appropriate treatment, according to several factors such as the depth of penetration of the melanoma.  Sentinel lymph node survey One of the factors that determines the severity of melanoma is whether cancer cells have spread into the bloodstream. These cells may become lodged in the lymph nodes, which filter the lymph. Lymph node testing can help answer this question. In sentinel lymph node testing, a dye is injected into the site of the lesion and then travels through the lymphatic pathway to the lymph node that receives lymph from the site of the lesion, the ""sentinel"" lymph node. The ""sentinel"" lymph node is then removed and analyzed. If there are malignant cells in the sentinel lymph node, the remaining lymph nodes in that region are removed. Sentinel lymph node examination is an examination whose results provide an idea of ​​the patient's clinical prognosis. Its results, including any lymph node emptying, do not influence the patient's life expectancy.  Genetic testing Genetic testing can provide information about your risk of melanoma by looking for specific genetic mutations. If mutations that increase your risk of melanoma are found, your risk can be reduced by adopting prevention and early detection practices.  Genetic testing is indicated in the following situations: Personal history of melanoma and at least one close family member with melanoma;/ Two or more close family members with melanoma;/ Personal history includes three or more melanomas, even if there is no family history of the disease;/  Computerized axial tomography A computed tomography (CT) scan uses x-rays to obtain detailed images of structures inside the body. Unlike a conventional x-ray, a CT scan shows details in soft tissues and internal organs. This diagnostic test can help show whether lymph nodes or organs are enlarged, which could be due to melanoma growth. Staging is the process by which we determine whether cancer cells have spread from the skin to other nearby or more distant structures. The information obtained through the staging process determines the stage of the disease, which is essential for planning treatment. In addition to the information obtained by diagnostic biopsy, the following tests are used to stage the melanoma: blood tests;;/ imaging tests such as radiography, tomography, magnetic resonance imaging or PET.;/  Your doctor will also check the lymph nodes near the melanoma to see if they have increased in size and may take a sample of cells from them using a procedure called an aspiration biopsy. The sample will then be evaluated under a microscope by the pathologist.  Based on the diagnostic tests performed, melanoma staging can be classified as follows: Stage 0 – melanoma in situ – means that the cells are confined to the epidermis and are very thin; Stage I– in stage IA, the tumor is less than 1mm. Stage IB melanoma may be the same thickness but ulcerative, or 2mm thick but without signs of ulceration. In both cases, there is no cancer in the lymphatic tissues or distant organs; Stage II – this phase is divided into 3 groups – A, B and C – depending on the thickness of the tumor and/or the degree of ulceration. At this stage there is no cancer in the lymphatic tissues or distant organs; Stage III – At this stage, the melanoma has reached adjacent lymphatic tissues. Clinical staging includes tumors of any size with lymphatic metastases; Stage IV – Melanoma at this stage has spread to one or more organs in the body. //Treatment// Surgery The first-line treatment for primary melanoma is surgical removal of the tumor. The amount of tissue adjacent to the tumor to be removed depends on the thickness of the primary melanoma. Usually, widening of the surgical margins by removing adjacent normal tissue is performed in a second surgical procedure. The aim is to significantly reduce the likelihood of local tumor reappearance. Surgery is most effective if the lesion is thin - less than 1 mm thick - and if it has not spread to the lymph nodes. In some cases of melanoma at a very early stage, it is possible to remove the lesion with local anesthesia at a dermatology consultation. In any case, this procedure must be carried out by specialists in oncological dermatology. Our dermatology surgeons are supported whenever necessary by a multidisciplinary team, made up of specialists in Imaging, Pathological Anatomy, General Surgery, Plastic Surgery, Otorhinolaryngology, Oncology and nursing. If the melanoma is deep (more than 4 mm thick) or has spread to the lymph nodes, the likelihood of recurrence or metastasis of the disease is greater. In this case, adjuvant treatment - any therapy administered in addition to the main treatment - can be used after surgery, to increase the possibility of cure.  This procedure is generally recommended in cases where there is a high probability of melanoma metastasizing to the lymph nodes. The pathologist analyzes the removed lymph node to determine whether it contains cancerous cells. This additional knowledge helps the clinical team decide the next steps, such as whether further treatment is needed. The behavior of melanoma in more advanced stages is extremely aggressive, and can cause early distant metastases, either via lymphatic or hematogenous routes.  Recently, new drugs have emerged for the treatment of metastatic melanoma, which are immunotherapy and targeted therapies. These therapies can control the disease more effectively than classical chemotherapy. Immunotherapy;/ Immunotherapy has proven to be very effective in treating advanced melanoma, although not all people with melanoma respond to treatment in the same way. There are several forms of immunotherapy, the most common being called Check Point Inhibitors. These inhibitors release immune cells (T-Cells) that seek out and destroy tumor cells. Targeted Therapies;/ One approach to melanoma treatment involves the use of drugs (also called therapies) that can target and disable the cells with these mutations. This, in turn, can cause tumors to shrink or grow less rapidly. Researchers have identified several major genetic mutations associated with melanoma.BRAFmutations are the most common mutation found in tumor cells. Patients who have had melanoma should be periodically monitored by an oncologist or dermatologist in consultation. Blood tests as well as imaging tests of the liver, bones and brain may be requested.

Melasma,"//What is it?// It is the name given to brown or grayish-brown spots that usually appear on the face. They are most common on the cheeks, forehead, nose, above the upper lip and chin. They can also appear on other areas that get a lot of sun, such as the neck or forearms, but this is rare. Melasma affects more women than men. It sometimes appears during pregnancy and is commonly known as “pano” or chloasma. People with darker skin are more likely to have it, such as those who have a family member with this type of blemish. //Symptoms// For brown spots that appear on the cheeks, forehead, nose, above the upper lip and chin. //Causes// Its causes are still unclear. It is known that the cells that produce skin pigment (melanocytes) produce too much of it. The triggering factors are: Sun exposure (which is why it gets worse in summer);/ Hormonal changes (pregnancy, oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy);/ Cosmetics (if they irritate the skin);/ //Diagnosis// In the vast majority of cases, the dermatologist makes the diagnosis directly from the observation of skin lesions. A skin biopsy may be justified in cases where the diagnosis is not clear and it is necessary to differentiate from other conditions. The examination may be complemented by the use of a Wood's light device to inspect the skin in detail. //Treatment// Melasma may gradually disappear without treatment when there is a triggering factor that stops, such as the pill or pregnancy. In most cases, local therapy is necessary, which may include: Idroquinona;/ Tretinoin;/ Corticosteroid;/ Procedures such as chemical peels or microdermabrasion can also be carried out. With the guidance of a dermatologist, many people can improve or even eliminate melasma. However, it may take months of treatment to achieve this. The results must then be maintained by always using sunscreen and sometimes maintenance treatments. //Prevention// The best way to prevent melasma from getting worse is to use an effective sunscreen year-round. You need a sunscreen that blocks not only the sun’s rays, but also light and heat. There are two main types of sunscreens: Those who use chemicals, such as oxybenzone. Should be avoided due to the risk of triggering allergic reactions.;/ Those that use physical blockers, such as zinc and titanium dioxide. These are preferable as their elements melt into the skin, offering very high protection.;/ Additionally, you should wear a hat whenever you are outdoors for long periods.
