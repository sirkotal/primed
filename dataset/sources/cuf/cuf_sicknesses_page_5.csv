Diabetes ocular,"//What is it?// Ocular diabetes is a group of eye problems that occur in people with Diabetes Mellitus. This group of diseases can, ultimately, cause significant visual loss or even in the most serious cases lead to blindness. The most common form of presentation is diabetic retinopathy (DR), but this disease can be associated with other changes, such as cataracts or glaucoma.  What is diabetic retinopathy? The retina is a tissue located inside and at the back of the eye and is necessary for good vision. Any disease that affects the retina is called retinoptia. DR is the main cause of blindness and most often causes blood vessel changes, at different stages and in a very similar way in both eyes. It begins with visual disturbances that worsen over time and lead to vision loss.  What are the stages of Diabetic Retinopathy? DR has 4 stages: mild, moderate, severe and proliferative. Mild, moderate and severe DR are manifested by increasingly severe occlusive changes in blood vessels and increasingly reduced retinal blood flow. In the last stage - proliferative DR - the retina develops new blood vessels (neovascularization) to compensate for the occlusion and reduced blood flow. However, this neovascularization does not have a normal structure, is more fragile and is responsible for complications. //Causes// The main risk factor for developing DR is Diabetes Mellitus (DM types 1 and 2). The risk also increases with the duration since DM diagnosis. Therefore, all patients with DM should undergo annual screening because in the early stages of the disease they may not present any complaints. //Treatment// To prevent the worsening of DR, systemic control of blood glucose, blood pressure and dyslipidemia must be carried out. In the first 3 stages of DR, eye treatment is not necessary, except in cases accompanied by macular edema. In the latter case, eye injections (intravitreal) are necessary. In the most severe cases, proliferative DR, the options depend on the presentation and are: LASER, surgery (vitrectomy) and intravitreal injections //Prevention// Controlling blood glucose allows you to delay the onset of DR, its worsening and the need for LASER treatments. Controlling blood pressure and dyslipidemia can also reduce the risk of vision loss. If you have DM without retinopathy, make sure you have an annual check-up with dilation. If you have DR, you should have a more frequent eye exam. Myopia, astigmatism and hyperopia often lead to the use of glasses or contact lenses. LASIK surgery can restore good vision.

Diarrhea in children,"//What is it?// Diarrhea is one of the most common health complaints. It can range from a mild, temporary condition to a serious, life-threatening clinical situation. It is caused by inflammation of the intestine, usually caused by an infection, which heals spontaneously or can take up to a week. In the case of diarrhea, younger children are at risk of dehydration due to greater loss of body fluids, so it is a condition that requires extra attention. //Symptoms// Numerous bowel movements in a few hours;/ Appearance of dark circles;/ To become prostrate or irritated;/ Wetting the diaper less or urinating less;/ //Causes// Most cases of acute diarrhea in children are caused by infection in the gastrointestinal tract; the agents responsible for this infection are bacteria, viruses and parasites. //Diagnosis// The doctor evaluates the symptoms, medication intake, previous history of illness, onset of diarrhea, frequency of bowel movements, characteristics of the stool (whether there is blood in the stool, whether it is watery or has mucus) and whether there is fever or associated vomiting. During the physical examination of the child, the doctor also assesses signs of dehydration, loss of appetite or tiredness, which determine the severity or not of the clinical condition and its treatment plan. Stool tests in the laboratory may be necessary. //Treatment// If you breastfeed your baby, continue to do so as usual.;/ If your child drinks exclusively baby milk, he does not need to make any changes to his diet. You should consult your pediatrician;/ Offer more fluids than usual, but in small amounts. You can choose weak, sweetened black tea, hot or cold, or oral rehydration serum.;/ If your child has a fever and needs an antipyretic, use syrup instead of a suppository.;/ If your child already eats yogurt, choose this food over artificial milk.;/ Eat a diet without fats and without green vegetables;/ Do not force the child to eat;/ //Prevention// Diarrhea prevention includes controlling the quality of drinking water and public sanitation conditions, especially waste and sewage treatment. General prevention measures include public health measures such as promoting hand washing, promoting breastfeeding and educating populations on how to control the spread of infections. Medical News Today       In addition to being unpleasant, it can lead to dehydration. Find out what you should do to treat acute diarrhea at home and in which cases you should (really) consult a pediatrician. Frequent infections, gastrointestinal problems, excessive fatigue... These may be signs that your immune system is compromised. Be alert and take precautions. Gastroenteritis is very common in children and one of the main health reasons for missing school.

Vegetarian diet,"//What is it?// The vegetarian diet or vegetarian diet refers to food consumption that predominantly uses products of plant origin. There are several types of vegetarian diets, in which meat and fish are always excluded, but which, in some diets, may include eggs and/or dairy products. It is a dietary regime that has been increasingly adopted in recent years, for philosophical, religious and cultural reasons. It is estimated that there are 30,000 vegetarians in Portugal. The various types of vegetarian eating can be nutritionally balanced, including essential supplies of proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and trace elements. Therefore, its implementation in infants and children must always be monitored by the attending pediatrician and a pediatric nutrition team, in order to guarantee this balance and the adaptation of the diet to each case. It should always be supplemented with Vitamin B12 as it comes exclusively from products of animal origin, and is an essential component for the normal growth and development of the child.  //Prevention// The vegetarian diet must be supplemented with Vitamin B12 as it is only found in foods of animal origin. A lack of it can cause anemia and serious neurological damage in your baby. If another type of supplement is suggested by your doctor, it will be because he considers it essential for your baby and its proper growth and development. Foods that are difficult to digest should not be offered: fried foods, honey, preserved or smoked foods and foods that present a choking risk (nuts and stone fruits). Food prepared at home can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days or frozen. No salt, sugar or spices should be added until 12 months. Solid food should be offered with a spoon and never in a bottle. The maximum daily dose of fiber (0.5 g/kg/day) must be respected as this may limit the intake and adequate absorption of nutrients. The vegetarian diet should ideally be monitored by your attending physician and a Nutrition team.  //Recommendations// 0-6 months;/ Breast Milk Breast milk is the most complete food for your baby, and can be continued exclusively until 6 months of age. Supplements Vegan, lacto-ovo vegetarian or lacto-vegetarian mothers who are breastfeeding should take a Vitamin B12 supplement (0.4 mg/day) and ensure a diet rich in Zinc, DHA and Iron. The infant must be supplemented with Vitamin B12 (0.4 mg/day up to 6 months) and Vitamin D (1 drop/day up to 12 months). Iron supplementation of infants is only necessary if the mother does not ensure a diet rich in iron. Infant formula If breastfeeding is not possible, it can be ensured with an infant formula or infant formula with soy protein, and supplementation with Vitamin B12 is not necessary in this case. Commercial soy, almond, rice milks, etc., are not recommended until 24 months. The introduction of new foods should never be done before 4 months and ideally as close to 6 months as possible. 4-6 months;/ Vegetable Soup Choose 4 out of 5 of these vegetables to make the base of the soup: potatoes, onions, leeks, carrots or pumpkin, garlic, lettuce, white cabbage, broccoli or zucchini. Cook the base vegetables in a little water, blend the puree and add a teaspoon of raw olive oil (approximately 15g at the end of cooking and in each serving of soup). Do not add salt and feed with a spoon adapted to the child's age. Introduce one vegetable at a time into the vegetable puree, with a minimum interval of 3 days between new foods. You should not introduce turnips, rutabagas, beets, celery or spinach before 12 months. Number of meals: 5-6 (1 soup at lunch, remaining milk) Offer water in small quantities several times a day. Papa Two weeks after starting the soup, introduce a dairy porridge (prepare with water) or non-dairy porridge (prepare with baby's milk), GLUTEN FREE, fortified in iron and preferably with simple flavors (start with rice porridge). Number of meals: 5-6 (1 soup for lunch, 1 baby food for a snack and remaining milk) Fruit Raw or cooked and crushed into puree: apple, pear or banana. It should always be offered after soup as a dessert and never as a stand-alone meal. Do not add sugar. 6-7 months;/ Gluten-free porridge Introduce non-dairy/dairy porridge with gluten. Vitamin B12 is 0.5 mg/day. Number of meals: 5-6 (1 soup at lunch and 1 soup at dinner, 1 baby food with gluten for a snack and remaining milk) 7-8 months;/ Protein-rich foods Tofu puree (well cooked) - 2 tablespoons mixed into vegetable soup. Vegetables: black-eyed peas, white beans, lentils and peas, well cooked, reduced to puree and WITHOUT THE SHELL. Fruits rich in Vitamin C They should be offered together with soups that contain foods rich in protein as they help to absorb iron: melon, mango, papaya, pawpaw, avocado pear. You should not offer lemon, orange, kiwi or strawberry before 12 months of age. Number of meals: 5-6 (1 soup at lunch with protein and 1 soup at dinner with protein followed by fruit, 1 baby food with gluten at snack and remaining milk) 9-11 months;/ Yogurt Ovolactovegetarians and lactovegetarians: 150 ml per day, natural and without aromas. You can add fresh fruit. Egg yolk Lacto-ovo vegetarians: half a cooked egg yolk per meal, per week, for 3 weeks, mixed with vegetable soup and instead of protein. Then switch to one whole egg yolk per soup. Do not consume more than one egg yolk per meal and no more than 3 per week. 11 months;/ Soybean Derivatives Soy cheese, soy yogurt and tempeh. +12 months;/ Ovolactovegetarians and lactovegetarians: can start with cow's milk. Vegan: maintain regular milk until 24 months. Salt may be added. Maintain a diet rich in vitamins and minerals, especially Zinc, Vitamin B12 (in supplement form), Iron and DHA. Consumption of milk and dairy products should not exceed 500 ml/day. Plant-based milks (soy, rice, almond, etc.) should not be offered before 24 months!  //Food Sources// The various types of vegetarian eating can be nutritionally balanced, including essential supplies of proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and trace elements. The only deficiency is Vitamin B12, which comes exclusively from animal products. We draw attention to the following nutrients that should be included in the diet: Proteins: tofu, tempeh, legumes, eggs, dairy;/ DHA (docosahexaenoic acid): flaxseeds, dark leafy greens, tofu, fish oil, nuts;/ Iron: legumes, nuts, spinach, fortified cereals;/ Calcium: kale, broccoli, soybeans, figs, dairy products;/ Zinc: cereals, legumes, nuts, wheat germ, wholemeal pasta;/ Folate: legumes, dark leafy greens, fortified cereals, bread;/ Ana Luísa Mendes, Pediatric Intern Mônica Pitta Grós Dias, Nutritionist CUF Discoveries Hospital  People with digestive problems sometimes have difficulty identifying which foods to avoid.

Learning difficulties,"//What is it?// These are considered to be a set of learning problems that affect the way a child processes information, resulting in difficulties in their ability to speak, spell, listen, read, write, reason, organize information or perform mathematical calculations, interfering with their academic performance. They can, therefore, cause educational risks or imply special educational needs. These manifestations do not all appear in the same child, and it is important to approach each case individually. Learning disabilities interfere with the brain's ability to receive, process, store, respond to and communicate information. They are a group of disorders and are not, therefore, a single disease. They should not be confused with intellectual disability or with the various degrees of autism. On the contrary, these people have average or above-average intelligence but have problems acquiring important skills to improve their performance at school, at home, in the community or in the workplace. This condition accompanies the person throughout their life and, the sooner it is recognized, the sooner steps can be taken to overcome or minimize the challenges it poses. In fact, your diagnosis is important because the sooner you identify and evaluate these students, the greater opportunities they will have to become successful and productive adults since their Intelligence Quotient is average or above average. Learning disabilities are a permanent disorder that affect approximately 15% of American school-age children and adolescents. In Portugal, the problem is deserving more attention, an important aspect so that these students are not neglected and become victims of failure and school dropout. //Symptoms// They vary in their forms of presentation and according to age. Whenever parents suspect the presence of learning difficulties, they should record their observations and share them with teachers and doctors so that this suspicion can be evaluated. Its main characteristic is the existence of a marked and inexplicable disparity between what is legitimate to expect from a person's performance and their actual performance. These can be mild or severe and it is not uncommon for more than one type to appear in the same person. In about a third of cases, this condition coexists with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Although these two entities share some characteristics (difficulty concentrating, memory and organization) they are distinct. But they are often confused and seen as laziness or associated with emotional or behavioral changes. //Causes// They are not yet well known but it is thought that they may correspond to a disorder of neurobiological origin that results from a different brain structure or functioning. Some role of heredity is admitted, since, in some families, several cases occur. Illness or trauma during pregnancy, alcohol or drug use during pregnancy, prematurity or low birth weight, and prolonged labor appear to be other possible causes. The occurrence of a serious illness, head injury or exposure to toxins after birth can also contribute to learning difficulties. It is important to emphasize that they are not the result of cultural differences or economic problems nor are they related to a lack of educational opportunities. However, if a child does not have access to education at critical moments in their development, they will be at higher risk of showing signs of learning difficulties in subsequent years. //Diagnosis// The diagnosis involves a careful assessment of information obtained from various sources, such as parents, teachers, doctors, psychologists or speech therapists and, of course, the individual themselves. This is the only methodology capable of correctly identifying the learning difficulty. //Treatment// There are several approaches that involve adapting the form of instruction/education in order to enhance learning and overcome the difficulties experienced. There are multiple treatment strategies, depending on the type and its manifestations, but, in general, these strategies should involve the family, teachers and specialized teams. An important aspect is to maintain children's self-esteem and prevent depression or anxiety from developing. //Prevention// They remain throughout life, but this fact should not prevent those affected from achieving their goals. It is not a disease and, as such, there is no type of treatment or intervention that is suitable for all cases. Although they cannot be prevented, early identification and seeking support from qualified professionals are the best ways to obtain good results and a better quality of life. National Center for Learning Disabilities, 2014 Learning Disabilities Association of America, 2013 Luís de Miranda Correia, Problematization of learning difficulties in special educational needs, Psychological Analysis (2004), 2 (XXII): 369-376 There is no doubt about the fundamental importance of sleep in maintaining good physical and mental health. It is important that holiday activities are stimulating, especially for hyperactive children, but also that they allow for closer family ties. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder affects a child's ability to pay attention, which is detrimental to their academic and behavioral performance.

Dyscalculia,"//What is it?// Dyscalculia belongs to the group of learning disorders, which affect a person's ability to acquire and use functions such as reading or calculation. Learning disabilities do not correspond to physical or mental disabilities and do not reflect a child's intelligence. However, these disorders affect their ability to use certain tools, which is important and can interfere with their academic performance. The most common learning disorders are dyslexia, which interferes with reading, dyscalculia, which interferes with the understanding of mathematical concepts, and non-verbal learning difficulties, which involve coordination and body language. These disorders can occur simultaneously in the same child. The term dyscalculia derives from acalculia, which corresponds to an acquired disorder of the ability to perform mathematical operations, after these have been consolidated. It is found mainly in children, has an evolutionary character or is related to development and is mainly associated with difficulties in mathematics, more specifically learning to calculate. But it can manifest itself at the level of reading, writing, numbers or symbols, mathematical concepts and rules, memorization of facts and concepts, and also in abstract reasoning. They may also be associated with problems learning to tell the time or deal with money. //Symptoms// It can be difficult to correctly identify a learning disorder. Telltale signs of dyscalculia include several difficulties: In number identification (visual and auditory);/ In establishing a reciprocal correspondence (counting objects and associating a number with each one);/ In perceiving sets and quantities;/ No calculation;/ In understanding the concept of measurement;/ In learning the hours;/ In understanding the value of currencies;/ In understanding mathematical language and symbols;/ In solving oral problems;/ Dyscalculia can be associated with poor visuospatial organization and nonverbal integration (children cannot quickly distinguish the differences between shapes, sizes, quantities and lengths), difficulties in observing groups of objects and saying which one contains a greater number of elements, in calculating distances, disturbances in body image, disorientation (in distinguishing left-right), in social perception and in making judgments and superior performance in intelligence tests in verbal functions compared to nonverbal functions. Children with learning disorders may have more difficulty understanding and following instructions, remembering what they are told, exhibit poor coordination when walking, playing sports or even in simple gestures such as holding a pencil, easily lose or misplace books and homework, do not fully understand the concept of time, tend to be reluctant to carry out tasks involving reading, writing or mathematics and may display hostile or defiant behavior in relation to these duties. //Causes// These disorders may have a hereditary basis, result from medical conditions, due to alcohol or drug use during pregnancy which can result in poor intrauterine growth, head injuries, or environmental factors such as exposure to high levels of lead. Dyscalculia occurs in association with genetic diseases such as Turner syndrome, Williams syndrome or fragile X chromosome. It is also more common in children with dyslexia, attention deficit and hyperactivity. //Diagnosis// It is important that this diagnosis is made as early as possible, to avoid school delays and frustration for the child. However, there is no test that identifies the problem at brain level. Therefore, distinguishing between a difficulty with mathematical concepts or dyscalculia involves a set of criteria. It is important to remember that difficulties in mathematics can result from inadequate teaching, changes in attention, anxiety, among other factors. Therefore, to diagnose dyscalculia it is important not only to identify a real and persistent difficulty in mathematical concepts, but also to exclude these other aspects. To this end, several tests have been created that must be administered by a specialist. //Treatment// Early intervention is essential because learning disorders tend to be a real “snowball effect”, in which one difficulty generates another, affecting the child’s overall academic performance, causing anxiety, depression, loss of self-esteem and motivation. If dyscalculia is suspected, it is important to request an assessment by a psychologist to confirm the diagnosis. It is essential to rule out other causes, such as vision or hearing problems. A large part of the treatment involves closer, individualized and professional monitoring of these children, so that they can improve their performance and maintain good academic performance. In some cases, such as in the presence of depression or anxiety, medication may be necessary. Although learning difficulties tend to be long-lasting, it is important to remain hopeful. Early intervention will always be more effective and should involve both the family and the school. In everyday life there are small activities that can be useful in stimulating mathematical reasoning, such as card or board games. It is necessary to encourage the child to use numbers daily, for example, counting products in the supermarket, counting in descending order, or using songs and stories with numbers. In fact, many children can learn and memorize math concepts more quickly when music, rhyme, and rhythm are used in their teaching. //Prevention// With the exception of certain measures, such as avoiding alcohol or medication during pregnancy, there is no method for preventing dyscalculia. The important thing is to diagnose it early to minimize its impact on the child's schooling and overall development. Ideally, this should be done before the child starts school so that appropriate support can be provided. Load more;/ RSV infection can progress to bronchiolitis or pneumonia.

Discopathia,"//What is it?// Discopathy is the designation for the pathology of the intervertebral disc, which involves changes in its characteristics and function. There may be a herniated disc, collapse (loss of disc height) or just painful symptoms. It is a condition usually related to advancing age that occurs when one or more discs between the vertebrae of the spine deteriorate, causing pain. There may be weakness, numbness and pain that radiates down the leg. The natural process occurs with aging: the discs between the vertebrae normally allow the back to flex, like shock absorbers; over time, the discs wear out and no longer allow this mobility. //Symptoms// It may cause no symptoms, the symptoms may slowly worsen, or it may cause  pain so severe that daily activities cannot be performed. It usually starts with changes in the spine but over time it can affect other parts of the body. Symptoms generally worsen with age and can range from mild to severe causing disability. Disc disease tends to lead to osteoarthritis, with pain and stiffness - the most common initial symptom that can later involve other areas. If the injury occurs in the lower back, discomfort may extend to the buttocks and thighs, including tingling and numbness in the legs or feet. If the injury is cervical, in the neck region, the pain can radiate to the shoulder, arm and hand. The disease can manifest itself with attacks of intense pain, which can worsen when sitting, bending, lifting or turning. Depending on the type of injury and affected area, walking, lying down, and changing positions may help relieve pain. //Causes// The intervertebral discs (intervertebral fibrocartilage or spinal discs) are the padding between the vertebrae. They have an elastic structure, made of fibrocartilage tissue, with the outer part known as the annulus fibrosus (tough) and the inner core (nucleus pulposus) being soft and jelly-like. The intervertebral discs cushion the stress when the spine moves or bears weight, and allow the spine to flex and extend. As people age, repeated daily stresses on the spine can damage these discs, checking: Loss of fluid: the intervertebral discs of a young, healthy adult contain up to 90% fluid. With age, the fluid content decreases - the distance between the vertebrae becomes smaller and the disc becomes less effective in its role as a shock absorber.;/ Disc structure: Small cracks develop in the outer layer, and the soft, jelly-like material inside may leak out, resulting in a bulging, ruptured, or broken disc. When the vertebrae have less padding between them, the spine becomes less stable. To compensate, osteophytes (""parrot's beaks"")—small bony projections that develop along the bone boundary—can press on the spinal cord or nerve roots, causing pain.;/ Other problems include: breakdown of cartilage, the tissue that cushions joints; a bulging disc, known as a herniated disc; narrowing of the spinal canal or spinal stenosis. These changes can affect the nerves, causing pain, weakness and numbness.;/  In addition to advancing age, the degeneration process can also be accelerated by: Obesity;/ Strenuous physical work;/ Smoking;/ Acute or sudden injury, such as falls;/ //Diagnosis// The diagnosis is based on a detailed description of the symptoms: when and where the pain occurs, the existence of tingling or numbness and which situations trigger the most pain; description of any falls, injuries or accidents. During the physical examination, the following can be assessed: Muscle strength: You can check for atrophy, loss or abnormal movements.;/ Pain with movement or in response to touch: If pressure applied to the lower back causes pain, it may indicate a degenerated disc.;/ Nerve function with reflex hammer: Weak or no response may indicate a compressed nerve root.;/ Heat and cold stimuli can be used to check how nerves react to temperature changes.;/ X-ray, CT scan, MRI, discogram may be necessary. To ensure a correct diagnosis, other causes of osteoarticular pain must be ruled out by a healthcare professional, such as tumors or other types of pathologies. //Treatment// Through a percutaneous procedure that allows you to confirm or obtain a diagnosis of the pathology, with the introduction of a needle into the intervertebral disc to inject a contrast liquid (visible on the X-ray). This practice also allows for the local administration of one or more  medicines with the aim of combating painful symptoms. It is a procedure carried out under local anesthesia, on an outpatient basis in which the patient is discharged on the same day. To treat disc disease, it may also be necessary to replace the intervertebral disc with a prosthesis – arthroplasty – which maintains the disc’s mobility characteristics. Or to promote the union between two segments of the spine (there may be more). In this case, the disc is replaced with a spacer and a bone graft is applied to achieve fusion/arthrodesis. It is also necessary to place implants (screws/bars) in order to stabilize and/or correct deformities. This procedure is performed under general anesthesia, with a hospital stay of two to five days. //Prevention// Practicing exercises helps to strengthen muscles, stabilize and increase mobility, including: walking, cycling, swimming, yoga and Pilates. Simple exercises to do at home are recommended: Lie on your back on the floor or a bed, with your feet supported. Press your lower back on the floor; hold the position for 5 seconds and repeat 10 times.;/ In the same position, squeeze your buttocks and gently lift them to form a bridge. If this is difficult, squeezing just your buttocks may help. Repeat 10 times.;/ In the same position, gently move your knees from side to side.;/ Medical News Today Load more;/ Much has changed in recent years in knowledge about low back pain and its treatment. Back pain and injuries are complex and debilitating conditions. Less invasive surgical techniques allow for better treatment of the patient and facilitate recovery.

Dysphagia,"//What is it?// This corresponds to difficulty in swallowing, which means that it takes longer and requires more effort to move solid or liquid food from the mouth to the stomach; it can be accompanied by pain and, in severe cases, can make swallowing impossible. It is usually caused by changes in the nerves or muscles, can be painful and is more common in the elderly and babies. There is a wide range of potential causes of dysphagia. Although an isolated episode probably does not correspond to a serious underlying problem, if it recurs it will require urgent medical observation. Occasional dysphagia can result from eating food too quickly or chewing it poorly, and is more common in older people; these cases are usually nothing to worry about. On the other hand, persistent dysphagia or dysphagia that gets worse may indicate a serious problem and should be evaluated urgently. //Symptoms// Patients may report pain when swallowing or being unable to do so. There may be a sensation of food remaining in the throat or chest, excessive salivation, hoarseness, regurgitation, burning behind the chest bone, weight loss, coughing or choking when swallowing. If not treated properly, dysphagia can cause malnutrition, weight loss, and dehydration or respiratory infections if food passes into the airway while trying to swallow. //Causes// It is not always possible to identify the cause of dysphagia. Generally speaking, there are two types of dysphagia: esophageal and oropharyngeal. In esophageal dysphagia, there is a sensation that food is stuck in the base of the throat or chest after swallowing. The most common causes are achalasia (weakness of the esophageal muscles), spasms or narrowing (due to a tumor or injury) of the esophagus, or the presence of a foreign body. Gastroesophageal reflux, eosinophilic esophagitis, scleroderma, or radiation therapy can also cause this type of dysphagia. In oropharyngeal, there is a weakening of the throat muscles that makes it difficult for food to pass from the mouth to the throat and esophagus, which can cause coughing, choking or even suffocation. If food passes into the trachea, pneumonia may develop. This type can result from neurological problems such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease, strokes, pharyngeal diverticula, or neoplastic lesions. On the other hand, aging is a risk factor for dysphagia, as is the presence of some forms of neurological disease. //Diagnosis// The diagnosis of dysphagia is made through medical observation, supplemented by contrast radiography, dynamic swallowing studies, endoscopy, esophageal pressure study (manometry), computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Depending on each case, the most appropriate tests are selected. //Treatment// Treatment depends on the type of dysphagia. In oropharyngeal dysphagia, there are some exercises and techniques that help coordinate the muscles involved in swallowing and stimulate the nerves that trigger this reflex. In the case of esophageal dysphagia, dilation of the esophagus using an endoscope may be necessary, or surgery may be necessary if a tumor or diverticulum is present. If there is gastroesophageal reflux, it should be treated by prescribing oral treatment that reduces gastric acidity. Treatment can be complemented by a liquid diet that allows you to maintain weight and avoid dehydration and, in severe cases, tube feeding may be necessary. //Prevention// Occasional dysphagia can be prevented by eating slowly and chewing food thoroughly. If gastroesophageal reflux is detected, it should be treated promptly to prevent the development of a narrowing of the esophagus. In other forms of dysphagia, prevention is not possible, but early diagnosis is recommended to minimize complications.

Spasmodic dysphonia,"//What is it?// It is a neurological disease that involves the vocal cords, in which the muscles of the larynx (the voice organ) contract in an intense and irregular way (spasms), making the voice “tense” and “fragmented”, greatly affecting its quality and fluency. The first symptoms occur most frequently between the ages of 30 and 50. This disorder appears to affect women more than men. The severity of voice spasms varies and may subside over hours or even days. //Symptoms// At first, symptoms tend to be mild and occur only occasionally, later they may worsen and appear more frequently. Over time, it may also worsen when the person is tired or tense, but also improve or even disappear, for example, when the person laughs or sings. //Causes// The cause is unknown. Patients often report the onset of symptoms after an upper respiratory infection, a period of excessive voice use, or work-related or emotional stress. Spasmodic dysphonia occurs most often between the ages of 30 and 50, and about 60% of patients are women. There are two types: Adductor spasmodic dysphonia: Patients attempt to speak through spasmodic closure with a voice that sounds choked or strained. These episodes usually occur when pronouncing vowels, especially at the beginning of words.;/ Spasmodic abductor dysphonia: this is less frequent and involves sudden interruptions in sound caused by momentary paralysis of the vocal cords, accompanied by an audible escape of air when the patient tries to speak.;/ //Diagnosis// There is no simple test to diagnose it. Its measurement is based on the presence of the typical characteristics and symptoms already described and the absence of other conditions that could cause similar problems. Sometimes diagnosis involves a specialized team that includes: Speech therapist;/ Otorhinolaryngologist;/ Neurologist for detecting signs of neurological problems;/ //Treatment// Treatment involves speech therapy and periodic injections of botulinum toxin into the muscles of the vocal cords, which reduces the strength of their contraction. //Prevention// There are no current guidelines for preventing it because its cause is not known. Winchester Hospital Given the period we are living in and the request to stay at home, with our children collected and protected, we all have to play different roles. Does your child speak less than other children of the same age? There are two possible scenarios: either their rhythm is different or they have a speech problem.

Temporomandibular joint dysfunction,"//What is it?// Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction is defined as a set of disorders involving the masticatory muscles and associated structures. It can be difficult to diagnose and treat due to the complexity of this joint, it is predominant in females (nine women for one man) and presents with intense pain and restricted jaw movement. //Symptoms// Pain or discomfort in the face, temporomandibular joint and/or masticatory muscles; headaches, earache and neck pain. Clinical studies have shown that the cervical spine can be a source of pain or dysfunction in the orofacial area. Likewise, it is common for patients with temporomandibular joint dysfunction to present signs and symptoms compatible with cervical pathology. Other common manifestations are in the field of otorhinolaryngology, such as tinnitus, sensation of hearing loss and vertigo. The pain can arrive suddenly or progressively, with fluctuations in frequency and intensity or over months or even years. Limitations in opening the mouth, blockage, deviation of the jaw when opening or closing, difficulties in chewing can also be associated with this dysfunction. //Causes// Its cause is rarely unique, and is normally considered to be of multifactorial origin, namely, jaw trauma (caused by road accidents), joint pathology (arthritis), clenching and grinding of the teeth (bruxism), and muscular and emotional tension. //Diagnosis// The initial diagnosis consists of a physical examination consisting of muscle and temporomandibular joint palpation with assessment of opening and closing movements as well as analysis of joint noises, and assessment of the oral cavity (dental and periodontal health, missing teeth, replacement of missing teeth). The use of auxiliary diagnostic methods such as X-rays, CT scans, MRI, according to the individual needs of each patient, serves as a complement to the clinical assessment. //Treatment// Some studies report control of signs and symptoms in approximately 90% of patients receiving conservative treatment. The use of medication, relaxation splints or other devices, physiotherapy and postural reprogramming resolve the vast majority of clinical cases. Orthognathic or temporomandibular joint surgery is reserved for very specific situations. //Prevention// The following strategies can be used to prevent jaw pain: Reduce stress to prevent bruxism;/ Avoid foods that require excessive chewing, such as chewing gum, gummies and caramels;/ Avoid hard foods such as nuts, whole fruits and ice cubes.;/ Medical News Today We often have no idea that some headaches can originate in the muscles of the mouth and jaw, a condition known as temporomandibular dysfunction. Changes in facial growth during pre-adolescence can lead to problems with the jaws, which are “out of place”, and lead to orthognathic surgery.

Erectile dysfunction,"//What is it?// Erectile dysfunction corresponds to the constant or recurrent inability to obtain or maintain an erection that allows satisfactory sexual activity for at least three months. This is a problem that can affect men at any age, although it is more common in older people. In general, this disease affects 29% of men between the ages of 40 and 49, 50% between the ages of 50 and 59 and 74% between the ages of 60 and 69. Despite being a benign disease, it has a major impact on the patient's sexual life with psychological and family repercussions. Given its impact on the self-esteem of affected patients, many prefer not to seek help, which tends to worsen the problem. However, in most cases, around 90%, erectile dysfunction is treatable. It is estimated that in Portugal it affects around 500,000 men (13%). It is a delicate subject that is very difficult for patients to discuss, whether with their family or with their doctor. Erectile dysfunction is often associated with cardiovascular diseases, which may precede them and act as a true risk marker. //Symptoms// The warning signs of erectile dysfunction are a decrease in sexual desire, changes in the quality of the erection and the resulting difficulty in penetration, as well as ejaculatory changes. These signs can manifest themselves progressively or, sometimes, suddenly, the latter being, as a general rule, a consequence of previous illness, trauma or surgery. Its characteristics, the moments in which it occurs, its duration, are aspects that help to understand whether the cause is psychological, physical or both. //Causes// Although erectile dysfunction was previously thought to have primarily psychological causes, various hormones, the pelvic nerves, and the blood vessels that supply the penis. Although this illness was previously considered to have primarily psychological causes, it is known that it almost always results from a physical origin, such as a chronic illness or a side effect of ongoing treatment. The most common causes are coronary heart disease, atherosclerosis, diabetes, obesity and high blood pressure. In some cases, erectile dysfunction may represent the first sign of these illnesses. Other important factors are smoking, chronic alcoholism, some medications (prostate cancer treatment, antihypertensives, antidepressants), neurological diseases (Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis), hormonal disorders, Peyronie's disease and pelvic trauma. Psychological causes account for 10% to 20% of cases and include depression, anxiety, stress, fatigue and difficulties in marital relationships. Cycling can also cause erectile dysfunction, due to prolonged compression of the perineal nerves and vessels. //Diagnosis// The diagnosis of erectile dysfunction involves taking a detailed clinical and psychosexual history, accompanied by a physical examination and laboratory and hormonal studies. A penile Doppler ultrasound, a neurological assessment or more specific tests that can help detect any abnormalities in the penile structures may be useful. A psychological assessment may also be important in some cases. //Treatment// Appropriate treatment will always depend on the cause(s) and their severity. There are oral medications that promote penile irrigation that may be useful in some cases but which, due to their mode of action, are contraindicated in patients with angina pectoris, severe heart disease, a history of stroke or diabetes. These drugs can interfere with other chronic medications and, therefore, their use always depends on medical evaluation and prescription. Other alternatives are hormonal treatments and, much less frequently, the use of vacuum pumps that promote erection, the implantation of penile prostheses or vascular surgery. Psychological counseling and sex therapy are good complements to other forms of erectile dysfunction treatment, especially when there is associated stress, anxiety or depression. //Prevention// This prevention involves the treatment and control of chronic diseases that may be present and the elimination of risk factors. The control of diabetes and coronary heart disease, the elimination of smoking, limiting alcohol intake, regular physical exercise, adequate sleep and good management of stress levels, in addition to the treatment of anxiety states and depression and regular medical consultation. Prevention and treatment should involve not only the man but both partners. Erectile dysfunction has repercussions on the sex life of both partners, so both partners should be involved in the entire therapeutic process. When sexual problems arise, couples often find it difficult to talk about them. But the sooner they acknowledge the situation and decide to seek help, the easier it will be to resolve it.

Sexual dysfunction,"//What is it?// Sexual dysfunction corresponds to situations in which the individual is unable to complete a sexual relationship or in which it is unsatisfactory for him and/or his partner. It can be characterized by a change in desire, the presence or maintenance of arousal and response to it, the ability to achieve orgasm, a painful disturbance, or the overlap of any of these situations. These cases can be associated with discomfort and interfere with various aspects of personal, family and professional life. Its prevalence is high, ranging between 25% and 63% worldwide, but the studies carried out are scarce and the data observed are quite heterogeneous. In Portugal, it is estimated that the female rate is between 40% and 70%, resulting in a change in any of the phases of the woman's sexual response cycle or painful disorders associated with the sexual act. According to other data, it affects around 19% of women and around 25% of men. //Symptoms// Symptoms are different in men and women. In men, the most common are difficulties in obtaining or maintaining an erection, changes in ejaculation, which may be absent, delayed or premature. In women, the predominant symptoms are decreased sexual desire, inability to achieve orgasm, insufficient vaginal lubrication and difficulty in relaxing these muscles, making penetration difficult or impossible. Generally speaking, they can be classified into four categories: those that affect sexual desire, those that interfere with sexual stimulation, erectile dysfunction and changes in orgasm. Painful conditions are quite common, especially in women, and may be related to poor vaginal lubrication or involuntary contraction of these muscles. Symptoms can be very varied and are not always assumed as such, since physical and psychological factors contribute to them. //Causes// It can have numerous causes, from physical (diabetes, cardiovascular, neurological, hormonal, renal, hepatic diseases, alcohol, tobacco or drug abuse, use of medications such as some antidepressants, antihypertensives and antihistamines, for example) to psychological, such as stress, anxiety, depression, concerns about sexual performance, marital problems, among others. During pregnancy, it is normal to experience some type of sexual dysfunction, such as decreased desire or pain during sex. For women, the premenstrual phase, postpartum period and menopause can also be accompanied by changes related to sex. //Diagnosis// To maximize the benefits of medications and behavioral techniques used in your treatment, it is important to take a comprehensive approach to the problem. Diagnosis is more difficult when affected individuals do not recognize the existence of the problem. A complete sexual history and assessment of general health and other sexual problems are very important. Assessing for anxiety, feelings of guilt, or stress are integral to an appropriate approach to sexual dysfunction. It is essential to exclude the presence of a medical condition that could be causing it. Sometimes the diagnosis requires approaching both elements of the couple, in order to try to understand their dynamics and relationship style. //Treatment// The success of treatment will depend on the underlying cause. Lifestyle changes are important. Excessive alcohol, tobacco and drug use are important causes of sexual dysfunction and controlling these alone can resolve the problem. For erectile dysfunction, there are several medications that should always be prescribed by a doctor. Depending on the origin of the change in sexual function, there are several medications, hormonal or otherwise, that can be useful. In some cases of erectile dysfunction, mechanical assistance (penile implants or vacuum systems) may be indicated and, in the case of women, there are dilators that can be useful in cases of narrowing of the vaginal canal. Sex therapy, psychological support, behavioral approaches, and psychotherapy are other options. The essential thing is to recognize and accept their presence, and that way it is always easier to identify their causes and correct them. //Prevention// It involves education, information and communication, since many cases have their origin there. On the other hand, adopting a healthy lifestyle allows you to avoid many of the most common causes. Food, exercise, not smoking are important steps towards a more balanced sex life.

Dyslexia,"//What is it?// Dyslexia is a learning disorder characterized by reading performance that is substantially below what would be expected, in terms of accuracy, speed or comprehension, depending on chronological age, IQ (intelligence quotient) and level of education. It is, in essence, a specific learning disability, characterized by difficulties in correcting and/or fluently reading words. This problem persists throughout life and does not correspond to a temporary delay in maturation or vision problems. It is a neurological disorder that requires early and specialized intervention. The existence of inversion errors, that is, seeing letters backwards, arises from errors of phonological origin (confusion between consonants with the same place of articulation, one voiceless and the other voiced, such as “d” and “b”) and not of visual origin. Dyslexia is perhaps the most common cause of low performance and failure at school and, in most cases, it is neither identified nor properly treated. It is also probably the most common disorder among the school population, with a prevalence reported to be between 5 and 17.5%. Some studies in Portugal suggest a percentage of 5.4% of children with dyslexia, a value that falls within the prevalence ranges recently published in other countries. Initially, a higher prevalence was reported in males, but in recent years an equal distribution in both sexes has been reported. //Causes// Until recently, dyslexia was thought to be a behavioral disorder that primarily affected reading. Today, it is known that dyslexia is a partially inherited disorder with complex clinical manifestations, including deficits in reading, phonological processing, working memory, rapid naming ability, sensorimotor coordination, automatization, and early sensory processing. In addition to heredity, there are several theories that attempt to explain dyslexia based on changes in the brain's neurological system. These changes do not interfere with other brain functions and these children have normal or even above-normal intelligence. Dyslexia is associated with other disorders such as hyperactivity, motor coordination disorders, behavior, mood disorders and decreased self-esteem. //Symptoms// The most common complaints are difficulty in making rhymes and spelling words. This difficulty makes the process of learning to read more difficult, as well as the ability to understand sentences and recognize written words. When dyslexia goes undetected, other problems can arise, such as changes in behavior, loss of self-esteem and, in the case of adults, difficulties at work. //Diagnosis// Currently, there are several tests that allow the evaluation and diagnosis of children with dyslexia. There is no biological marker that, in clinical practice, can be used to confirm the diagnosis of dyslexia. This diagnosis is made based on family and clinical history and a set of psychometric, language, reading and spelling tests. //Treatment// There is no treatment that can correct the brain abnormality responsible for dyslexia, nor are there any medications to treat this disorder, except in cases where it is associated with other disorders, such as hyperactivity or attention deficit. As such, the treatment of dyslexia essentially involves education and teaching, which must be adapted to each case. Early identification and intervention are the keys to successful reading learning. The earlier dyslexia is identified, the sooner help can be obtained. It is essential to carry out a diagnostic assessment in order to define which skills have already been acquired and which remain to be acquired. Intervention in dyslexia involves specific learning strategies that encompass reading, writing and vision: All teaching should be adapted so that there is an evolution from easy and basic content to more difficult content.;/ The concepts taught must be systematically reviewed to maintain and reinforce their memorization.;/ Direct and explicit teaching is also necessary, in which the different concepts must be taught in a direct, explicit and conscious way and never by deduction.;/ Success in intervening in dyslexia requires close cooperation between the family and the school.;/ With adequate support and good communication, children with dyslexia will be able to maintain their self-esteem and overcome this difficulty. A person with dyslexia can be successful in their studies. In fact, many of these people are very creative, intelligent, gifted in mathematics, science and arts.

Dyslipidemia,"//What is it?// Dyslipidemia is a condition in which abnormal levels of lipids occur in the blood. Lipids are an important component of the human body and enable normal cell function. They are also a source of energy. There are essentially two types of lipids: cholesterol and triglycerides. Blood cholesterol is carried by two types of lipoproteins: high-density (HDL or ""good"" cholesterol) and low-density (LDL or ""bad"" cholesterol). Triglycerides are carried by very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). Dyslipidemias can involve different types of molecules, such as high-density or low-density. The former transport cholesterol from the tissues to the liver. The latter allow cholesterol to mix with the water around the cells and in the bloodstream. Therefore, an excess of low-density lipoproteins is harmful to health, the opposite happening with high-density lipoproteins, as they are capable of removing cholesterol from the arteries. The presence of dyslipidemia affects the overall quality of health, contributing to the thickening and stiffness of the arteries, especially if it is not properly monitored and treated. As it does not cause symptoms for years, the disease can progress to a myocardial infarction or a stroke. When levels of ""bad"" cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood are very high, the risk of atherosclerosis and partial or total obstruction of blood flow to the heart and brain increases. Dyslipidemia is, in fact, one of the main risk factors for atherosclerosis, which represents the main cause of death in developed countries, including Portugal. Its importance derives from its association with heart and cerebrovascular diseases, particularly atherosclerosis. A study carried out in Portugal indicated an incidence of hypercholesterolemia of 559 new cases of dyslipidemia per 100 thousand inhabitants. This incidence increased with age up to 54 years for males and up to 64 for females. There was a greater occurrence in men up to the age of 54, later reversing to an increased trend in women. In another study, hypercholesterolemia was detected in 47% of the population and increased LDL levels in 38.4%. Hypertriglyceridemia and reduced HDL were less prevalent, affecting 13% of the population. //Symptoms// For a long time, it is not associated with any symptoms. When they do appear, they can be very diverse, ranging from the simplest to those that are life-threatening. It can cause opacities in the cornea (the most superficial and transparent layer of the eye), sometimes in the form of a whitish arc, xanthomas (accumulations of cholesterol under the skin), difficulty walking, abdominal pain, changes in balance and speech, and confusion. Many of these symptoms reflect the obstruction of arterial circulation caused by dyslipidemia (atherosclerosis). In some cases, its first manifestation can be a serious event, such as a myocardial infarction or stroke, or even sudden death. These scenarios are more likely in patients who have not been under medical care for a long time and with very advanced forms of dyslipidemia. //Causes// The disease may have a genetic (primary) or acquired (secondary) origin. There are several factors that can contribute to abnormal lipid levels. It can occur due to a genetic tendency, a diet with high levels of cholesterol, saturated fats and alcohol, a sedentary lifestyle, age and gender. In fact, cholesterol tends to increase with age, women have lower levels, although they increase after menopause. There are other elements of risk, such as tobacco and obesity. Some medications, such as birth control pills, estrogens, corticosteroids, certain diuretics, and antidepressants also increase the risk of dyslipidemia. Type II diabetes is also associated with this disease. In fact, cardiovascular disease continues to be the main cause of death in patients with diabetes mellitus, accounting for 50% of all deaths. //Diagnosis// The diagnosis is made through laboratory tests that measure and measure the levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, lipoproteins and other markers of dyslipidemia. Reference values ​​vary between laboratories depending on the analysis method used, so the interpretation of the results should always be carried out by a doctor. //Treatment// It depends on the age and overall health of the patient, but is largely based on lifestyle changes. A balanced diet, low in fat and high in fiber, regular physical exercise, weight control and moderate alcohol consumption, as well as not smoking, are essential aspects of therapy. Medical treatment of dyslipidemia can be important and may include medications such as statins, cholesterol absorption inhibitors, bile acid sequestrants or niacin. Therapeutic goals vary depending on the profile of each patient and are always assessed by the health professional. //Prevention// Prevention is crucial because more than 50% of mortality and disability resulting from ischemic heart disease and stroke can be avoided by implementing simple measures at the individual and/or national level aimed at adequately controlling the main risk factors for these diseases. such as high blood pressure, hypercholesterolemia, smoking and obesity.

Dyspnea,"//What is it?// Dyspnea, commonly known as shortness of breath, is the feeling that you are not getting enough air into your lungs. This health problem may result from more intense exertion, be caused by being at a high altitude, or may be a symptom of infection and lung or heart disease. //Symptoms// Difficulty breathing normally;/ Shortness of breath after exertion or due to a medical condition;/ Feeling of suffocation resulting from breathing difficulties;/ Feeling of tightness in the chest;/ Rapid, shallow breathing and difficulty taking a deep breath;/ Heart palpitations;/ Piella;/ Cough;/  Episodes of dyspnea can be acute (sudden) or chronic (long-lasting), appearing at rest or during exercise, in a moderate to intense manner. If dyspnea occurs suddenly or if symptoms are severe, it may be a sign of a serious illness. //Causes// In the case of acute dyspnea, the most common causes are: Asthma attack;/ Anxiety;/ Severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis);/ Pneumonia and other respiratory infections;/ Pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lungs);/ Blockage of the airway (such as when a person is choking);/ Heart attack (myocardial infarction);/ Severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis);/  In the case of chronic dyspnea, the most frequent causes are: Asthma, which can happen, for example, with exposure to allergens, such as pollen;/ Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD);/ Heart disease, including congestive heart failure and cardiomyopathy;/ Obesity;/ High blood pressure in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension);/ Interstitial lung disease (fibrosis);/  There are other conditions that can cause shortness of breath, such as panic attacks, lung cancer or anemia. Exposure to pollutants, such as chemicals, dust, and smoke, such as tobacco, are other factors that can trigger an episode of dyspnea. //Diagnosis// After the patient describes his or her symptoms - when they started, duration, frequency and severity - the attending physician will perform a physical examination and lung auscultation. Spirometry may be necessary, a test that assesses how much air the individual can inhale and exhale and how quickly. The specialist doctor may also order other tests, such as measuring blood oxygen levels with a pulse oximeter, blood tests, imaging tests, such as x-rays or computed tomography and electrocardiogram. //Treatment// The type of treatment to be carried out depends on the results of the tests. For example, if shortness of breath occurs after performing a more intense effort, it may be useful to practice relaxation and adapt the physical activity. In more serious cases, the administration of oxygen may be necessary or, if dyspnea is due to asthma or COPD, inhalation of bronchodilator medication. If the reason is an infection, appropriate treatment may include antibiotics. However, the patient's attending physician will draw up an individualized plan taking into account their clinical case, preventing acute episodes and stopping the progression of the disease. //Prevention// People who suffer from dyspnea can improve their breathing capacity by adopting measures such as: Do not smoke and avoid exposure to secondhand smoke.;/ Avoid other triggering factors, such as chemical fumes, dust, pollen, and animal hair.;/ Undergo respiratory rehabilitation, learning techniques that help you breathe more effectively and in a controlled manner.;/ Be more active to strengthen your muscles.;/ Adopt a healthy diet and, if necessary, lose weight. Having a healthy weight relieves pressure on the heart and lungs and makes exercise easier. Both of these results can strengthen the respiratory and cardiovascular systems.;/ British Lung Foundation, maio de 2019 Medical News Today, May 2019 WebMD, May 2019 Load more;/ If you've ever felt short of breath, know that it could be a symptom of an illness, such as anxiety, heart or respiratory problems.

Respiratory dystonia,"//What is it?// Respiratory dystonia or vocal cord dysfunction is a disease with a mechanism similar to spasmodic dysphonia, but in which the vocal cords come together during breathing, making a movement opposite to that desired (paradoxical movement of the vocal cords), making it difficult for air to enter: instead of opening when inhaling and exhaling, they close, making it difficult for air to enter and exit the upper airway. //Symptoms// Shortness of breath, difficulty breathing or getting air into the upper airway;/ Tight feeling in the throat;/ Asphyxiation impression;/ Noisy breathing (wheezing or high-pitched sound);/ hoarse voice;/ A sudden, severe attack may require emergency hospital treatment. //Causes// Respiratory dystonia can be caused by: Upper respiratory infection;/ Strong odors or vapors;/ tobacco smoke;/ Acid reflux;/ Strong emotions stress;/ Intense physical exercise;/ //Diagnosis// The doctor observes the patient's vocal cords under direct vision with a laryngeal mirror or inserts a small fiber-optic tube (laryngoscope) through the nose to the back of the throat, where the vocal cords can be viewed. This procedure is done under a small local anesthesia and on an outpatient basis. It may be necessary to perform spirometry, which, during the crisis, generally shows blockage of the air flowing into the trachea (spirometry may be normal if it is not performed during the dystonia crisis). It may also be necessary to inhale a medicine called methacholine to relieve symptoms of respiratory dystonia. //Treatment// Speech therapy plays an important role in controlling this condition. Botulinum toxin can also be used to reduce the intensity of muscle contraction of the vocal cords. //Prevention// Managing emotional stress with relaxation techniques and biofeedback are useful in controlling crises. Controlling concomitant underlying diseases, such as asthma and gastroesophageal reflux, are fundamental measures in preventing dystonia attacks associated with these pathologies.

Retinal dystrophies,"//What is it?// Retinal dystrophies are a group of hereditary diseases that are associated with progressive loss of visual function. Individuals with these pathologies have genetic alterations that cause damage to one or more types of cells that make up the retina. An individual with retinal dystrophy may appear to have alterations only in the cells responsible for peripheral vision, while preserving their central vision (as in some cases of Retinopathy Pigmentosa). Alternatively, your central vision may be affected, with preservation of your peripheral vision (as in Stargardt's disease). Retinal dystrophies can be diseases exclusive to the eyeball or be associated with other manifestations, forming part of syndromes. These diseases are rare and affect less than 1 in 2,000 individuals. //Symptoms// Symptoms and their onset depend on the dystrophy and the gene involved. Patients with dystrophy often experience:  Loss of visual acuity: difficulty reading or seeing things clearly in the distance;/ Changes in visual fields: presence of areas of less clarity or changes in peripheral vision;/ Nyctalopia: visual difficulty at night or in dark environments;/ Photophobia: discomfort with bright light or seeing flashes of light;/ Dyschromatopsia: change in color perception;/ //Causes// Retinal dystrophies are genetic diseases. This means that the individual has determined in their genetic code the changes that condition their disease. More than 250 genes have been associated with retinal dystrophies, making it impossible, in many cases, to isolate the responsible mutation.  The pattern of inheritance depends on the disease and the gene. This means that while some patients have multiple family members affected, others may be an isolated case. //Treatment// There is still no treatment available for retinal dystrophies. There is intense research in this field, and gene therapy is rapidly developing.  Several techniques are being developed that are expected to restore, stop or slow down the visual loss associated with these pathologies. Myopia, astigmatism and hyperopia often lead to the use of glasses or contact lenses. LASIK surgery can restore good vision. It's important to have sunglasses on hand all year round.

Diverticulitis,"//What is it?// Diverticula are sacs or pouches that develop through weaknesses in the colon wall, usually located in the sigmoid or left colon, sometimes affecting the entire colon. Diverticulosis corresponds to the presence of these sacs and diverticulitis represents the inflammation of these diverticula or other complications associated with them. It is not yet clear why diverticula become inflamed. It is believed that mechanical forces, such as increased pressure in the colon or the closure of the diverticulum opening by feces, can lead to infection and inflammation. Colonic diverticulosis is a common situation, it is estimated that around a third of adults over 60 years of age present it asymptomatically. It is considered to affect around 50% of the Western population at least 60 years old and almost all at 80 years old. Only a small percentage of those who have colon diverticula experience symptoms, and surgery is rarely necessary. It is an important problem due to the mortality resulting from its complications, which include diverticulitis, abscess formation, perforation, peritonitis, fistulas, obstruction and hemorrhage. These complications develop in 10% to 40% of individuals with diverticulosis. Some studies indicate around 23,600 deaths per year in Europe due to complications from diverticulosis. In addition to the mortality associated with complications and the respective family, professional and social impact, it is also important to mention the high costs of this disease. //Symptoms// Diverticula generally do not cause symptoms (80% of cases). The main symptoms are abdominal pain (usually located in the lower left quadrant), diarrhea, cramps, changes in bowel habits (constipation or diarrhea) and, occasionally, rectal bleeding. These symptoms only occur in a small percentage of patients and are similar to those found in irritable bowel syndrome. When diverticulitis occurs, with inflammation or infection of a diverticulum, pain, chills, fever and changes in bowel habits may occur. In more severe cases, perforation of the colon and intra-abdominal infections may occur, with the formation of abscesses or fistulas in the bladder or vagina. Although mild cases can be treated with rest, dietary changes and antibiotics, more severe cases may require surgical intervention. //Causes// Initially, the consumption of nuts, seeds, corn or popcorn was admitted, as they were retained in the diverticula and could be the cause of their inflammation. But it has been shown that eating these foods does not increase your risk. However, it is known that a sedentary lifestyle, extreme obesity and smoking are associated with an increased risk of diverticulitis. Age and visceral fat were also considered important factors for the occurrence of this disease. In fact, the likelihood of developing diverticula is greater in people over 40 years of age. Diverticula are rare in countries where people eat a high-fiber diet, which keeps stools softer and bulkier, but they are common in industrialized countries such as Europe and the United States. It is thought that eating a low-fiber diet for years can cause increased pressure inside the colon, resulting in the development of diverticula. It is therefore believed that a low-fiber diet is an important factor in this condition. //Diagnosis// Diverticula can be detected during endoscopic examinations (colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy) or during imaging tests, such as barium enema, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. However, most diverticula are diagnosed during tests requested for other reasons. //Treatment// Diverticulosis that is not accompanied by symptoms does not require any monitoring or treatment. The treatment of complaints associated with diverticula is similar to that for complaints associated with irritable bowel syndrome and is based on increasing the fiber content in the diet, using laxatives or medications that reduce intestinal spasms. By increasing the fiber content in the diet (cereals, legumes, vegetables, etc.) and, in some cases, restricting certain foods, it is possible to reduce intra-colic pressure, reducing the risk of complications. There are other situations that require other types of treatment, which may require hospitalization and/or surgery. Diverticulitis requires a more aggressive approach. Moderate cases can be controlled without hospitalization. Treatment consists of oral antibiotics, dietary restrictions, and probably stool softeners. Severe cases require hospitalization, with intravenous antibiotics and more significant dietary restrictions. Surgery is indicated in repeated episodes and in patients with complications that do not respond to medical therapy. //Prevention// This involves a diet rich in fiber, drinking plenty of fluids, and exercising regularly. Reducing the consumption of fats and red meat, tobacco, and anti-inflammatory medications can also reduce the risk of developing diverticular disease of the colon.

Diverticulose,"//What is it?// A diverticulum is any pouch that forms in the wall of the digestive tract. As a rule, they appear isolated, except in the colon, where they are more frequent and sometimes appear in large numbers, a situation we call diverticulosis. These pouches appear when, due to the pressure exerted within them, the inner layer of the wall is pushed through weak points in the muscular wall of the colon. Factors that can increase the risk of colon diverticula: Older age: diverticula are more common after age 40;;/ Low-fiber diet: Diverticula are rare in countries where people eat a high-fiber diet.;/ //Symptoms of diverticulosis// Although diverticula do not produce symptoms directly in many patients, several complaints have been associated with diverticula. The most common are abdominal pain, which can be relieved by defecation, and changes in bowel function, such as constipation or episodes of diarrhea. Since these types of symptoms are similar to those observed in individuals with a condition called irritable bowel syndrome, their relationship with diverticular disease is not yet fully understood. //Causes of diverticulosis// Diverticula can rarely lead to complications such as diverticulitis, bleeding, or, rarely, perforation. Diverticulitis occurs when there is inflammation or infection of one or more diverticula. It is not yet clear why diverticula can become inflamed, but it is known that a sedentary lifestyle, obesity, and tobacco use are associated with an increased risk of diverticulitis. In the past, doctors thought that eating nuts, seeds, corn or popcorn, if they got stuck in the diverticula, could cause inflammation of the diverticula, but many studies have shown that eating these foods does not increase the risk of diverticulitis. Diverticulitis can cause severe abdominal pain and fever. //Diagnosis of diverticulosis// Diverticula can be detected in endoscopic examinations (colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy) or in imaging examinations such as barium enema or abdominal computed tomography. //Treatment of diverticulosis// Although mild cases of diverticulitis can be treated at home with rest, dietary changes and antibiotics, more severe cases may require hospitalization and sometimes surgery. Diverticulosis that is not accompanied by symptoms does not require any surveillance or treatment. The treatment of complaints associated with diverticula is similar to that of complaints associated with irritable bowel syndrome and is based on changing the fiber content in the diet and the use of medications that alter movements or reduce intestinal spasms.

Peripheral arterial disease,"//What is it?// Peripheral Arterial Disease is characterized by being an obstructive disease of the arterial lumen, resulting in a deficit of blood flow to the tissues, the main consequence of which is the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms of ischemia. The obstructive component of the disease is associated with atherosclerosis in approximately 90% of cases. It affects about 3% to 10% of people, increasing to 15% to 20% in adults over 70 years of age. Cardiovascular disease is one of the main causes of mortality and morbidity in the Brazilian population, which is why its early diagnosis and treatment, as well as its prevention, are essential. This disease constitutes an important marker of the presence of a high risk of cardiovascular mortality. It is identical to coronary disease, distinguishing itself only by the arteries and territories affected. The most common risk factors are: Lack of regular physical exercise;/ Hypertension;/ Hypercholesterolemia;/ Family history of angina pectoris;/ Myocardial infarction;/ Stroke;/ Abdominal aortic aneurysm;/ It is estimated that people affected by it have a four to five times greater risk of suffering a myocardial infarction or a stroke. On the other hand, if not treated properly it can develop into gangrene, requiring amputation of a limb. //Symptoms// The main symptom of Peripheral Artery Disease is pain in the legs when walking (claudication) that improves when exertion is stopped. This discomfort results from the greater need for oxygen and nutrients during walking that are not sufficiently supplied by the obstructed arteries. Other signs are a feeling of numbness or weakness in the legs, colder and/or paler feet and legs, wounds that do not heal, and pain in the feet or fingers when resting. Over time, the skin may become darker or bluish. Its manifestations worsen over time, as a consequence of the progressive reduction in oxygen supply. Thus, discomfort initially appears after a certain distance covered, and this interval reduces, to the point where pain appears in the legs. In more serious cases, erectile dysfunction may even occur. //Causes// Smokers, diabetics, obese and/or hypertensive patients are the most affected, as these diseases increase the likelihood of damage to the innermost layer of the vessels, which leads to hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis). The presence of kidney disease associated with hemodialysis is another risk factor. //Diagnosis// Peripheral Arterial Disease often goes undiagnosed, which increases the risk of complications. A medical examination is very useful because it allows the detection of various signs of the disease, such as the color of the legs (which become paler), the presence of hair (which does not grow or falls out due to insufficient blood supply), the sensitivity of the skin, the presence of wounds and the presence or absence of pulses in various parts of the lower limbs. These elements, together with a history of pre-existing diseases (smoking, high cholesterol, diabetes, obesity, hypertension) are almost always sufficient for a diagnosis, which must be confirmed by performing imaging tests. These allow a better definition of the location and extent of the problem and are essential in planning medical or surgical treatment. The initial test is Color Doppler ultrasound, a special ultrasound that assesses blood flow in the vessels and identifies the presence of obstructions. In some cases, angiotomography, angioresonance or arteriography may be requested. //Treatment// Treatment will depend on the degree of obstruction and the patient's general condition. In most cases, it starts with changing your lifestyle. In fact, stopping smoking, controlling diabetes and high blood pressure, losing weight, reducing cholesterol and exercising are fundamental aspects of treating and preventing peripheral arterial disease. Physical exercise, such as walking, does not allow the unblocking of already clogged arteries, but it facilitates the creation of new pathways through which blood and oxygen can reach the tissues. There are, on the other hand, drugs that allow better dilation of the arteries, increasing blood flow. Medical treatment of diabetes, hypercholesterolemia and high blood pressure is equally essential. The use of aspirin or antiplatelet medications prevents the formation of clots and helps maintain blood flow. All of them must be selected on a case-by-case basis and always require a medical prescription. Surgery is an alternative for restoring blood flow. There are several techniques, from bypass to catheterization, but the areas of the obstructed arteries are dilated using a balloon, and then prostheses are inserted to keep them open. //Prevention// Quitting smoking, controlling diabetes and high blood pressure, losing weight, reducing cholesterol and exercising are factors that help keep your arteries in excellent condition.

Bipolar disorder,"//What is it?// Bipolar Disorder (BP), previously called manic-depressive psychosis, is a chronic psychiatric pathology characterized by marked mood swings. Typically, it is manifested by periods of elevated mood and increased energy and activity (mania or hypomania ) alternating with phases of depression and decreased energy and activity. Either type can predominate in the same person, and their frequency can vary considerably. These episodes can be severe, moderate or mild and have a significant impact on the sensations, emotions, ideas and behavior of the person affected, with a significant loss of quality of life and autonomy. Fluctuations in mood, energy and activity levels interfere with all daily tasks. Bipolar disorder is different from the normal fluctuations in emotions and mood that occur over time. In this illness, the symptoms are more severe, impair relationships, school and work performance, and can lead to suicide. Despite all this, it can be treated and is compatible with a long and productive life. It often begins in adolescence or young adulthood. Half of all cases first appear before the age of 25. However, it can begin earlier or later in life. It is estimated that around 2% of the population suffers from this disease, in an identical percentage for both sexes, reaching 4% to 12% if other diseases on the bipolar spectrum are included. While Type I bipolar disorder affects men and women similarly, Type II is more common in women. Some available information regarding the national reality estimates that there are around 200 thousand cases of bipolar disorder in Portugal. //Symptoms// Periods of mania are characterized by euphoric or irritable mood, increased self-esteem, decreased need for sleep, accelerated thinking and/or speech, increased energy and greater involvement in pleasurable activities (excessive spending, sexual disinhibition, etc.), which are severe enough to cause social and work degradation. In some cases, psychotic symptoms may occur, such as hallucinations or delusions. Hypomania exhibits similar criteria, but in smaller numbers, intensity and, sometimes, shorter duration, with no psychotic signs or social or work-related deterioration. Mixed episodes require the existence of depressive and manic symptoms simultaneously. The first episode of the disease typically occurs in the 2nd or 3rd decade of life, although it can manifest at any age. //Causes// The cause of bipolar disorder has not yet been fully studied. Biological and psychosocial factors appear to be involved. The former include genetic factors (higher risk of the disease in patients with first-degree relatives with BP), neurochemical factors (dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, GABA, glutamate, acetylcholine), hormonal factors (changes in the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal and hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axes) and neuroanatomical factors (nonspecific structural and functional changes in the brains of these patients). Psychosocial factors such as stressful life events also appear to influence the onset of BP and future relapses. //Diagnosis// From a diagnostic point of view, BP is subdivided into Type I (BP I) and II (BP II), the first being characterized by the occurrence of at least one manic or mixed episode and the second by the occurrence of at least one hypomanic episode (without manic or mixed episodes). Early diagnosis is essential for correct treatment and a good prognosis. It is based on a detailed collection of the patient's clinical history, with additional diagnostic tests (appropriately guided interviews and laboratory tests), which are important for ruling out other pathologies. It is the psychiatrist's responsibility to assess these cases and confirm or deny the diagnosis. Generally speaking, a bipolar patient seeks help more easily in the depressive phase than in the manic phase. //Treatment// PB must be treated in the long term. There are two phases in treatment: the acute phase (manic, hypomanic, depressive, mixed) and the maintenance phase. Therapy is fundamentally pharmacological. Mood stabilizing medications can, in fact, control the disease, reducing the likelihood of relapses, both in depression and mania. Antidepressants or antipsychotics can also be used, and treatment selection should always be made by the doctor. Psychoeducation and cognitive-behavioral therapy can also be combined, in addition to individual and family psychological support. More serious crises tend to involve hospitalization. //Prevention// There is no specific method for preventing bipolar disorder. Since its exact cause has not yet been determined, it is especially important to be aware of its symptoms and seek early intervention. Regular and continued use of medications prescribed by specialist doctors can help control episodes of mania and depression. Cleveland Clinic Impulsivity, instability and self-harming behaviors are some of the signs that can alert you to a borderline personality disorder.

Heart disease in pregnancy,"//Cardiology Consultation// The cardiologist plays an important role in the diagnosis, clinical monitoring and treatment of these women, working together with other medical professionals, namely the obstetrician and the general and family medicine doctor. In this context, cardiology consultation should be part of the evaluation process of women with cardiac pathology, both in counseling and detection of preconception cardiovascular risk and in maternal clinical follow-up during pregnancy. Therefore, women with cardiac pathology who are pregnant or wish to become pregnant should be referred to a cardiology consultation.  Some of the pathologies to be referenced during the consultation stand out: Chronic or gestational hypertension;/ Arrhythmia;/ Acquired valvular pathology with or without valve prosthesis;/ Coronary heart disease and acute coronary syndrome;/ Infective endocarditis;/ Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy;/ Congenital cardiac anomalies (atrial and ventricular septal defects, tetralogy of Fallot, among others);/ Pulmonary hypertension;/ Diseases of the aorta (Marfan syndrome, for example);/ Peripartum cardiomyopathy;/ Load more;/ Until the baby is born, every moment is special.

Celiac disease,"//What is it?// It is an autoimmune pathology triggered by foods containing gluten - a protein present in foods such as bread, biscuits and pasta, among other cereals - and can cause poor absorption of nutrients, loss of bone density, infertility, neurological diseases and certain types of cancer. This pathology affects the small intestine of genetically predisposed adults and children. The disease causes atrophy of the villi of the small intestine mucosa, causing poor absorption of nutrients, vitamins, mineral salts and water. //Symptoms// Symptoms may include diarrhea, developmental difficulties (in children), and fatigue. //Causes// It is due to a change in autoimmunity triggered by eating foods that contain gluten. //Diagnosis// Only 1 in 5 patients with celiac disease know they have the disease, and diagnosis is sometimes difficult as the onset of signs and symptoms tends to be slow. Celiac disease is more common in some families, in people with type 1 diabetes, liver and thyroid disease, Down, Turner or Williams syndromes. As it tends to be genetic, in the presence of these pathologies, it is recommended to undergo medical examinations. Diagnostic tests include: gluten exposure test, genetic analysis (HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 genes) and blood analysis (antibodies in the blood). The diagnostic process should include digestive endoscopy (total colonoscopy with ileoscopy) with intestinal biopsies. //Treatment// There are no medications that treat celiac disease; the only effective treatment is a strict gluten-free diet. Nutritional monitoring is essential in order to develop a balanced nutritional plan. Wheat, rye, barley, Graham flours, malt and semolina should be avoided; some celiacs tolerate oats (labeled gluten-free). Wheat flour is a common ingredient in canned soup, salad dressings, ice cream, instant coffee, processed or canned meats, mustard and ketchup, yogurt, pasta and sweets. It may also be present in vitamins and supplements (wheat starch is used in the manufacture of tablets and capsules), toothpaste, mouthwash products and cosmetics, such as lipstick. The diet must complement nutrient deficiencies such as vitamins and minerals that are not absorbed properly, especially: iron, calcium, fiber, zinc, vitamin D, niacin, magnesium and folic acid. After starting a gluten-free diet, the intestine recovers and can absorb these elements again, but it may be necessary to take multivitamins or supplements to address these deficiencies. //Prevention// Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder, and there is currently no proven way to prevent it.

Addison's disease,"//What is it?// Addison's disease is a rare chronic disease that affects both children and adults. It results from the failure of the adrenal glands in the production of steroid hormones (cortisol, androgens and aldosterone) essential for life. The secretion of adrenaline and noradrenaline is not affected. Addison's disease, or adrenal insufficiency, occurs when the outer layer of the adrenal glands is damaged. The adrenal glands, which are part of the endocrine system, are located above each kidney and produce hormones that affect all organs and tissues. They consist of two layers, the medulla (inner layer) and the cortex (outer layer). //Symptoms// Damage to the adrenal glands occurs slowly and symptoms develop gradually; the most common include: Abdominal pain;/ Abnormal menstrual periods;/ Craving salty food;/ Dehydration;/ Depression;/ Diarrhea;/ Irritability;/ Postural hypotension;/ Loss of appetite;/ Low blood glucose;/ Muscle weakness;/ Nausea;/ Dark spots on the skin, especially around scars, skin folds, and joints;/ Sensitivity to cold;/ Unexplained weight loss;/ Vomiting;/ Fatigue and extreme tiredness;/ In some severe, sudden cases—such as injury, illness, or intense stress—symptoms can come on quickly and cause an Addison's crisis, or acute adrenal insufficiency, which is considered a medical emergency (if left untreated, it can lead to shock and death). Symptoms of a crisis include: Restlessness, confusion, fear, or other sudden mental changes;/ Dehydration;/ Extreme weakness;/ Excessive drowsiness or total loss of consciousness;/ High fever;/ Dizziness or feeling faint;/ Pallor;/ Vomiting and severe diarrhea;/ //Causes// Addison's disease is caused by dysfunction of the adrenal glands, preventing the normal secretion of corticosteroids, from an autoimmune cause, genetic problems or other conditions, including tuberculosis and cancer. //Diagnosis// Addison's disease is diagnosed by evaluating symptoms, physical signs, and additional diagnostic tests. Examination of the patient usually reveals signs of fatigue, weakness, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation or diarrhea, dizziness, muscle and joint pain, and low blood pressure. Tests may reveal: abnormal elements - such as low sodium (hyponatremia), low glucose (hypoglycemia) or high potassium (hyperkalemia). Other more specific tests: cortisol levels in urine, morning cortisol in blood, cortisol in saliva; blood aldosterone and blood adrenocorticotropic hormone (individuals with Addison's disease, the cortisol level is below the reference level and the adrenocorticotropic hormone is elevated). Additional tests: computed tomography (allows checking the adrenal glands and pituitary gland); adrenocorticotropic stimulation test. //Treatment// To treat Addison's disease, your doctor may prescribe hormones similar to those produced by the adrenal glands, such as hydrocortisone tablets to replace cortisol. If the patient also lacks aldosterone, they may be given fludrocortisone acetate. If the patient is taking fludrocortisone, the doctor may ask you to increase your salt intake, especially in hot, humid weather and after vigorous exercise. In emergencies and during surgery, medications are administered intravenously. //Prevention// Addison's disease cannot be prevented, but you should consult a doctor if you experience tiredness, weakness or weight loss. This way, a crisis can be avoided.

Crohn's disease,"//What is it?// Crohn's disease is a type of chronic inflammatory bowel disease that causes inflammation of the digestive tract. It can cause pain, be debilitating and sometimes life-threatening. It can affect all age groups, especially young adults, aged between 16 and 40 years. It affects men and women in equal proportions, however some studies report a higher incidence in females. It appears to be more common in some families, as about 20% of patients with Crohn's disease have a family member, most often a brother or sister, or a father, mother or child, with some form of inflammatory bowel disease. In Portugal, in recent years, there has been an increasing incidence of this pathology. The estimated prevalence is 73 cases for every 100 thousand inhabitants. //Symptoms// Symptoms of Crohn's disease can vary, but the most common complaints are diarrhea, cramping abdominal pain, and weight loss. Symptoms unrelated to the digestive system, such as joint pain and skin lesions, may also occur. Other early manifestations include lesions in the perianal region, including fissures, fistulas, and abscesses. This disease has a variable course, with periods in which it is active and others in which it is not associated with any symptoms. Its most common complications are: Bowel obstruction, which may involve surgery;/ Ulcers in any area of ​​the digestive tract, including the mouth, anus and genital region;/ Fistulas, when ulcers extend through the wall of the intestine creating an abnormal connection (fistula) between two areas of the intestine, between the intestine and the skin or between the intestine and another organ such as the bladder or vagina;/ Osteoporosis;/ Inflammation of the skin, eyes, joints, liver or bile ducts;/ Increased risk of colon cancer;/ //Causes// The cause of Crohn's disease is not yet known, but the most likely hypothesis is the existence of a certain factor (virus, bacteria) that causes the body's immune response. This will subsequently cause inflammation of the intestine, even when the causative agent is no longer present. Furthermore, there are hereditary origins that can contribute to an increased risk of its development. It is also necessary to take into account age (this disease generally develops before the age of 30, although it can occur at any age), family history, smoking (it is associated not only with an increased risk of developing the disease but also of becoming more serious), and the place of residence (it is more common in individuals who live in urban areas of industrialized countries). Stress can aggravate the symptoms of the disease. //Diagnosis// Depending on the location, several diagnostic tests may be necessary, including endoscopy, which allows the inside of the intestine to be examined and small fragments of the mucosa (biopsies) to be collected for microscopic study. Endoscopy provides an accurate diagnosis for most diseases that affect the colon and also allows for various treatments. CT or abdominal MRI may also be relevant, as well as some laboratory tests. //Treatment// There is currently no medicine that cures Crohn's Disease. There are, however, several treatments that improve complaints and induce remission for a long period of time, offering a better quality of life. Appropriate therapy depends on several factors such as symptoms, location, severity and extent of the disease, and the response to treatments already carried out, among others. Medication: The main drugs used to reduce inflammation are mesalazine and corticosteroids. These are used in the acute phase when symptoms are more severe. In forms refractory to treatment and in the disease complicated by fistulas, immunosuppressive drugs and biological therapies are used. Antibiotics are useful in the treatment of perianal complications.;/ Food: Most patients can eat normally and without restrictions, with the exception of periods when diarrhea occurs. During these phases, a low-fiber diet that does not contain lactose should be followed. Some patients must avoid milk altogether, as they cannot properly digest the sugar present in this food, as they lack a specific enzyme in their small intestine. In patients with malabsorption it may be necessary to administer vitamins and minerals.;/ Surgery: In patients with symptoms of intestinal occlusion, fistulas, severe or very frequent acute episodes, it may be necessary to resort to surgery. This is generally necessary when medical treatment is unable to control symptoms or when there is a complication (bowel obstruction, perforation, abscess, or bleeding). Surgery does not cure the disease, but it improves quality of life in most patients. The most common procedures are draining an abscess or removing a segment of diseased intestine.;/ //Prevention// There is no way to prevent this disease, and the only way to prevent or delay symptomatic attacks is to try to prevent or delay symptomatic attacks.

Cushing's disease,"//What is it?// Most patients with Cushing's disease have small tumors (microadenomas) in the pituitary gland. Diagnosis of Cushing's disease can be time-consuming and the disease should always be monitored by a doctor specializing in endocrinology. It results from the excessive production of the pituitary hormone called ACTH, which in turn leads to the production of cortisol by the adrenal gland above the levels necessary and desirable for the normal functioning of the body. //Symptoms// Physically, it manifests itself as an increase in fat on the trunk, keeping the arms and legs slim. Bruises or red stretch marks may appear on the skin and up to 50% of patients may experience changes in mood and sleep. Diabetes and hypertension are not uncommon in this situation. //Causes// Cushing's disease is caused by an excess of cortisol in the blood caused by a tumor in the pituitary gland that secretes adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), produced by the pituitary gland. ACTH stimulates the adrenal glands (located on top of the kidneys) to produce cortisol (the stress hormone). //Diagnosis// The diagnosis is quite complex. If there is sufficient clinical and laboratory suspicion, it involves performing several screening tests followed by confirmation. Urine and blood tests often have to be repeated on more than one occasion. There is often a need to perform dynamic endocrinological tests. //Treatment// Treatment is almost always surgical, although in rarer cases adrenal surgery or drug therapy may be indicated. //Prevention// There is no way to prevent  the disease and associated pituitary tumors.

Dupuytren's disease,"//What is it?// Dupuytren's disease is caused by an abnormal thickening of the palmar fascia (tissue between the skin and the tendon and vascular-nervous structures in the palm and fingers) that can limit the mobility of one or more fingers. In some patients, a subcutaneous cord forms that extends from the palm of the hand to the fingers, causing flexion of the fingers, limiting their extension. Sometimes the disease can cause thickening on the dorsal surface of the finger joints, contracture in the penis or on the plantar surface of the feet. It was described in 1832 by Baron Guillaume de Dupuytren and took his name. The cause of Dupuytren's disease is unknown and is more common in northern European populations and in men. //Symptoms// The disease does not usually cause pain. It normally develops slowly with the appearance of a nodule at the level of the distal crease of the palm of the hand, most frequently on the 4th and 5th fingers, later developing with a cord between the palm and fingers, leading to progressively retracting them onto the palm of the hand, interfering with daily activities. The skin may be involved, but the tendons and vascular-nervous structures are not affected. The disease affects the ring finger and little finger more, and generally progresses slowly over years, but it can also progress more quickly and cause severe contracture of the fingers. //Causes// The cause of the disease is unknown and there is no permanent cure. It is normally painless and has no tumor-like characteristics. It most frequently affects people of Celtic origin (often there is a family history), with men being more affected than women and an onset at an earlier age and they are usually more aggressive, as well as in people who have other areas of the body affected. Some forms may be associated with trauma, diabetes and ingestion of some medications (tuberculostatics) //Diagnosis// It is done through the patient's history and physical examination and generally does not require additional diagnostic tests. //Treatment// In mild and initial cases without affecting hand function, only clinical follow-up is necessary without surgery. In cases where the nodules are painful or where the inability to open the fingers affects the function of the hand, surgical treatment is necessary. This treatment can be done using minimally invasive techniques (needle pricks) or by opening the skin, depending on the case and the surgeon's experience. The treatment improves the function of the hand and allows the fingers to open; however, the disease may reappear, especially in younger patients. Non-Surgical Treatment The aim of treatment is to eliminate finger contracture and restore hand functionality. The mere presence of a nodule is not in itself an indication for surgery; the retraction of the fingers and the functional limitation caused are what determine the indication for treatment. Some non-surgical alternatives such as percutaneous cord interruption with a needle, but with a high recurrence rate. An alternative with a lower recurrence rate is the injection of a collagenase that causes the destruction of the cord in a specific area, allowing the finger to be extended. Surgical Treatment There is no definitive cure for Dupuytren's disease, and it may recur in the same site or appear in a new area, more or less frequently, but regional, extended or total fasciectomy is the method with the lowest recurrence rate. In some more serious cases, it may be necessary to interpose a skin graft or use a local flap to cover some tendon or vascular-nervous structures. When the contracture of the fingers is already very severe, full extension of the fingers may not be possible and in many situations it is necessary to establish a physiotherapy program until the hand functions normally. Having a cast on your arm or leg helps you recover from fractures and reduces pain. Know what to do in this situation.

Huntington's disease,"//What is it?// Huntington's disease is a degenerative disease of the central nervous system, caused by the loss of cells in a part of the brain (basal ganglia). This lack affects cognitive capacity, emotional balance and motor skills. It is an inherited brain disorder that affects people from all populations, all over the world. Its name comes from the doctor George Huntington, who gave the first description of what he called “Hereditary Chorea”. The term “Korea” originates from the Latin word choreus (which refers to “dance”) due to involuntary movements, one of the main symptoms of this disease. Symptoms appear very gradually, usually between the ages of 30 and 50. However, it can sometimes affect children or even the elderly. In most cases, patients can be independent for several years after the first symptoms appear, provided they are well monitored by doctors, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, nutritionists and other professionals. In the United States of America there are currently around 30 thousand individuals with this disease. In Portugal, although there are no absolute values, some studies indicate a prevalence similar to that in other Western countries, between five and 12 patients for every 100 thousand inhabitants. It is a pathology that can be passed from generation to generation through the transmission of altered genes. Men and women are equally likely to inherit it from an affected parent. Those to whom it is not transmitted do not develop the disease, nor can they pass it on to their children and other descendants. There is a genetic test available to determine whether or not an at-risk person carries the Huntington's disease gene. //Symptoms// The symptoms of Huntington's disease vary greatly, even within families. For some, the involuntary movements may be pronounced even in the early stages. For others, they may be less obvious and the emotional and behavioral signs may be more obvious. In general, it is important to consider: Emotional/behavioral symptoms, such as depression, irritability, anxiety and apathy, aggressive or impulsive behavior, mood swings and social isolation;;/ Cognitive/intellectual symptoms, related to a reduced ability to organize routine matters or to deal effectively with unexpected situations, changes in memory and the ability to concentrate;;/ Motor symptoms, such as muscle twitching, excessive restlessness, facial tics, or changes in handwriting.;/ These signs gradually evolve into involuntary movements (Chorea), which are often associated with difficulties in walking and balance. They tend to increase during periods of voluntary effort, stress or excitement and decrease during rest and sleep. Speech and swallowing can also be affected. In advanced stages, severe chorea may occur, but rigidity is more common. During these periods, patients become completely dependent on others for all personal care, are unable to walk, and are unable to make themselves understood through speech. Although cognitive abilities are also severely affected, it is important to remember that, in general, the patient is aware of his or her surroundings, continues to be able to understand language, and is aware of those around him or her. People do not die from the disease itself, but from complications associated with immobility, such as choking on food, infections or head injuries. Death usually occurs, on average, around 15 to 20 years after the onset of the disease, although the duration can vary greatly between individuals. Suicide is also common in this condition. //Causes// Huntington's disease is a genetic disease, caused by a defect in chromosome 4. It is hereditary of the dominant type, which means that one copy of the defective gene is enough for the disease to manifest itself. //Diagnosis// Diagnosis involves a medical, neurological and psychological examination and a detailed family history. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography are useful in ruling out other causes of the symptoms. Positron emission tomography may also be requested, as may an electroencephalogram. Genetic testing can be used to confirm or exclude the disease. However, a positive result is not sufficient to confirm the clinical diagnosis. //Treatment// There is no cure or strategy to prevent its progression. Therefore, the goals are to delay the onset of symptoms and keep the patient independent and active for as long as possible. Therapy can be effective for depression or anxiety, or it can help minimize involuntary movements. It is important that these patients are monitored by a neurologist who can coordinate work with other health professionals. //Prevention// Prevention involves genetic counseling, which is essential whenever there is suspicion or knowledge of the mutation's carrier status. This step allows you to define the risk of transmitting the disease to descendants. On the other hand, it is important to consider all forms of treatment as a mechanism to prevent complications and improve the quality of life of these people.

Kawasaki,"//What is it?// Kawasaki disease is a vasculitis, that is, an inflammation of small and medium-sized blood vessels. It is an acute, febrile and rare disease that affects children, in 85% of cases under 5 years of age. One of the most serious effects of this disease is inflammation and damage to the coronary arteries - those that transport the blood that feeds the heart. It is one of the main causes of acquired heart disease in children, but it is treatable if identified early. Most children recover from the disease without developing other health problems. //Symptoms// The diagnosis of Kawasaki disease is clinical, that is, it is made based on symptoms and signs that patients present. There must be a high, daily fever that is difficult to control with antipyretics for more than 5 days and at least 4 of the following symptoms: Pink, maculopapular rash, most common between the chest and legs and in the genital and groin area. Peeling of the skin on the hands and feet is common in the 2nd week of illness.;/ Redness and swelling of the back of the hands and soles of the feet.;/ Red eyes without exudate;/ Cervical lymph node, in the neck, larger than 1.5 cm.;/ Inflammation of the mouth and lips.;/ Red tongue.;/ There may be reference to other symptoms, called minor symptoms, which generally appear later, such as: Joint pain.;/ Abdominal pain.;/ Gastrointestinal problems such as diarrhea and vomiting.;/ Irritability;/ Kawasaki disease can cause heart problems, such as myocarditis and coronary aneurysms, especially if treatment is not started within the 10th day of illness. As the diagnosis is clinical, it is essential that the doctor suspects the disease, as timely treatment prevents cardiac complications. The incidence of these complications when the patient is not treated is 20 to 30%, while if treatment is carried out they will be 3 to 5%. //Causes// The cause of this disease has not yet been determined. The disease was first described in Japan. It may be associated with viruses, bacteria and other factors present in the child's daily life, such as chemicals. It occurs more commonly in winter and spring. Kawasaki disease is not contagious. //Diagnosis// There is no specific test for diagnosing Kawasaki disease. As mentioned, the diagnosis is clinical, based on the sum of symptoms and signs that the child presents. However, there are laboratory changes associated with this disease, so the doctor will carry out an analytical evaluation of blood and urine. When this disease is suspected, a cardiological evaluation is always carried out, namely an echocardiogram. //Treatment// Treatment for Kawasaki disease involves hospitalization. The essential therapy is the intravenous administration of human immunoglobulin, which will provide antibodies to combat vasculitis. Along with this therapy, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) is always administered initially in high doses. When treatment is started early, the risk of the child developing heart problems is much lower, as mentioned above. //Complications// Most children recover completely and have no future problems. The aforementioned cardiac complications are the most feared. However, there are cases described as atypical Kawasaki disease, which may be associated with more difficult diagnoses and, therefore, more complications. Every child diagnosed with Kawasaki disease should be monitored by their attending physician and, if there has been heart damage, by a pediatric cardiologist for a few months.

Lyme disease,"//What is it?// Lyme disease is an infectious, non-contagious disease transmitted by tick bites. Its initial manifestations are dermatological and can evolve into chronic problems in organs such as the central nervous system or the heart. The greatest risk of bites from these ticks occurs in temperate climates, in forests and humid woodlands. The disease is also characterized by seasonality: the highest incidence occurs in spring and cold months. Portugal is considered a country where the presence of the tick responsible for transmitting Lyme disease is endemic. The disease is mandatory for medical notification, but cases are underreported. //Symptoms// The most common symptom is erythema migrans, a round, reddish spot, with a central clear area, around the tick bite. This spot on the skin must be at least five centimeters in diameter and is the most common skin manifestation of the disease. Some people develop borrelian lymphocytoma (a type of reddish nodule on the skin, more common in Europe) and chronic atrophic acrodermatitis (skin atrophy with prominent blood vessels, also associated with European cases). Early medical evaluation is essential so that treatment can be implemented before symptoms progress (even if the skin signs appear to have disappeared). Within a period of up to three weeks, the following may also develop: Fever;/ Fatigue;/ Headaches;/ Neck stiffness;/ Muscle pain;/ Joint pain;/ Swollen lymph nodes;/  The progression of the infection, months (or even years) after the bite, can affect other organs, such as the heart and central nervous system, and lead to other symptoms and complications, such as aseptic meningitis, cranial neuritis, encephalomyelitis, meningoencephalitis, radiculopathies, atrioventricular block or myocarditis. //Causes// The bite of a tick of the ixodes genus transmits bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi, Borrelia mayonii, Borrelia afzelii or Borrelia garinii, the last two being more common in Europe. For the infection to occur, the tick must feed on the skin of the person in question for a period of around 24 hours - ticks removed from the skin before this period do not transmit the disease. This disease is characteristic of areas with a temperate climate, being considered endemic in central Europe, the northeast of the United States of America, Scandinavia, northern Japan and other regions of Asia. Studies indicate that climate change may influence the areas of the globe where Lyme disease is most prevalent. The seasonality of this infection is also being impacted by global warming covering more months of the year, with a predominance of the cold months of September and March, in the case of adult ticks, and in spring, in the case of younger animals. //Diagnosis// The diagnosis depends on the identification of symptoms (dermatological and others) and the relationship with identification, when possible, of risky situations in which the tick bite may have occurred; In cases where the bite is not immediately identified, it may be presumed due to a history of occupational exposure, etc. In addition, the diagnosis can be made through laboratory tests, especially in the presence of rarer skin manifestations of Lyme disease. Blood tests, serological tests (which look for the presence of antibodies to the bacteria) and a histopathological examination (microscopic analysis of the tissues) can be performed. //Treatment// When a tick is identified on the skin, it must be removed and the individual must undergo clinical surveillance for a period of 30 days. Antibiotic therapy is effective. Doxycycline, when administered at the first symptoms, is highly effective and the likelihood of the patient developing the most severe forms of the disease is very low. //Prevention// As most infections occur in woodlands, forests and similar environments with high humidity, it is important to start by identifying whether or not you are in an endemic area. If so, you should cover as much body surface as possible - without forgetting the scalp and feet. Clothing should be light-colored, which helps locate any ticks, and mosquito and tick repellent should be applied all over the body as well as on clothing and shoes. At the end of the day, in endemic areas, it is essential to meticulously analyze the entire body (exposed by clothing or not) to try to locate any ticks and remove them. As Portugal is one of the areas where the infectious tick circulates endemically, it is important to remain aware of its presence, especially by professionals such as forest rangers, farmers or campers and trekkers.

Meniere's disease,"//What is it?// It is a chronic pathology of the inner ear. This contains tubular structures, the semicircular canals, which are filled with a liquid (endolymph). It is important in interpreting body position and maintaining balance. Ménière's disease results from the accumulation of large amounts of fluid in the inner ear. Symptoms tend to be triggered by situations such as stress, overwork, fatigue, pressure variations, excess salt or the intake of certain foods. There is currently no cure. Ménière's disease is named after the French doctor who described it in the 19th century. It can develop at any age, being more common between the ages of 40 and 60. Vertigo is the most obvious cause of dizziness, accounting for 54% of all cases. Of these, 90% are caused by three diseases, one of which is Ménière's disease. //Symptoms// The symptoms are very varied, being different before, during and after each outbreak. These may be preceded by an “aura” that allows the patient to prepare in the best possible way before the crisis occurs. During this period, changes in balance, dizziness, headache, increased pressure in the ears, hearing loss or tinnitus, sensitivity to sounds or malaise may occur. During an attack, severe dizziness, intermittent hearing loss and a sensation of fullness in the ear, with or without tinnitus, may occur. Other symptoms may include anxiety or panic, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, blurred vision, cold sweats, palpitations and tremors. These symptoms generally worsen if the patient makes sudden movements. At the end of each attack, there is a period of extreme fatigue that requires a few hours of sleep. Between attacks, there may be anxiety, changes in appetite, difficulty concentrating, fatigue, headaches, loss of self-esteem, muscle tension, palpitations and changes in vision, or there may be no signs of the disease at all. An outbreak may last 20 minutes or 24 hours and recur several times a week or at intervals of months or years. The variety of symptoms and their unpredictable nature make this disease very disturbing, with a strong impact on patients' quality of life. As such, an effective education and communication process with affected individuals is essential so that they learn to deal with their pathology as best as possible. It's important to involve family and friends so everyone knows how to react whenever an attack occurs. During these crises, it is essential that the patient is placed in a safe, quiet place, avoiding head and eye movements and avoiding intense lights. Good hydration will also be important, especially if vomiting occurs. After the attack, rest is essential and it is equally important that activity is resumed gradually after each attack. Regular physical exercise can help, as can proper stress management. In the later stages of the disease, hearing loss becomes persistent, tinnitus becomes stronger and imbalance can interfere with walking. These signs are particularly problematic in conditions of low light, fatigue or in the presence of very intense visual stimuli. The most common complications are the inability to walk due to uncontrollable vertigo or hearing loss on the affected side. //Causes// Its causes are not well known, but it is believed that it may result from circulatory, allergic or genetic problems, or be related to viral infections or trauma. Tobacco and alcohol have also been identified as potential causes. //Diagnosis// It involves a neurological examination, hearing tests and more specific procedures such as caloric stimulation tests and others. An MRI scan may also be useful. //Treatment// It is important to remember that this disease is currently not curable. However, available treatments help manage your symptoms. They aim, on the one hand, to reduce the severity of each outbreak and, on the other, to reduce its frequency. As a general rule, available therapy has positive results in 60% to 80% of people. An important aspect is the adoption of a reduced sodium diet, which helps control water retention, thus reducing pressure in the inner ear. Diuretics can contribute to this relief. A widely used medication is betahistine, which helps with vertigo. Drugs that control nausea and vomiting, as well as some sedatives, may also be useful. There are other options that involve vestibular rehabilitation (an exercise program to reduce symptoms of imbalance and dizziness) or some types of surgery. The doctor must define the best therapy for each case. //Prevention// Considering that it is a disease that cannot be prevented, a correct approach requires that the pathology is well known to everyone involved so that it is easier to deal with it and make the most appropriate decisions at each moment. Vestibular Disease Association National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine American Hearing Research Foundation António Macedo, Approach to Vertiginous Syndrome, Acta Med Port 2010; 23:095-100 Different from simple dizziness, vertigo can be a symptom of various illnesses and require medical advice.

Parkinson's disease,"//What is it?// Parkinson's disease results from reduced levels of a substance that functions as a chemical messenger in the brain in the centers that control movement. This substance is dopamine. When its levels reduce, the brain cells that produce it die. It is a brain disorder named after the English doctor who described it in the 19th century. It is quite common and progressive, with key features being tremors, stiffness of the trunk and limbs and slowness of movement. However, new and promising treatments have emerged. It is estimated that around 20 thousand Portuguese people suffer from this disease. Central hospitals register more than 1800 new cases per year and it is expected that, with the increase in the longevity of the population, this disease will increase in the next 20 years, affecting around 30 thousand people. On a global scale, it is estimated that there are seven to 10 million individuals with Parkinson's. Its prevalence increases with age, being rare before the age of 50, and is more common in men than in women. However, in 5% of cases, it appears before the age of 40. //Symptoms// Since dopamine controls muscle activity, the symptoms are mainly related to movement. In addition to tremors, stiffness and slowness, there are other manifestations that affect sleep, thinking, speech and the mood of patients. The first sign of the disease is, in general, a slight tremor in a hand, arm or leg that occurs when the affected extremity is at rest, but which can increase in moments of greater tension. As a rule, it improves when the patient voluntarily moves the affected extremity and may disappear during sleep. As the disease progresses, the tremor becomes more diffuse and can affect the extremities on both sides of the body. When facial muscles are affected, expression may become dull and, in the case of other muscles, the patient may be unable to take care of themselves. Depression or anxiety are common in patients with Parkinson's, as are memory disorders. Visual, chewing and swallowing difficulties, urinary incontinence, changes in sexuality, cramps, and increased sweating may also occur. Postural instability and difficulties in walking make it quite disabling, making it difficult to sit down and stand up and forcing people to walk with small, shuffling steps and without the normal pendulum movement of the arms. It is important to note that each patient experiences their symptoms differently. //Causes// For Parkinson's symptoms to appear, 70% to 80% of brain cells must die. However, it is not known why they die and why some people develop the disease and others do not. Some factors that may be responsible for its occurrence include: family history, exposure to pesticides or industrial toxins, and aging. //Diagnosis// It depends on the clinical history and neurological evaluation. There is no laboratory test that allows a definitive diagnosis. In the face of a picture suggestive of this disease, carrying out a treatment trial with levodopa is useful. If symptoms improve during this trial, the likelihood of Parkinson's disease is high. //Treatment// Although there is no cure, symptoms can be controlled through different types of medications, which stimulate the release of dopamine, as long as there are still dopamine-producing brain cells. When this is not possible, another type of drug is used, such as levodopa, which is then converted into dopamine in the brain. There are also other classes of medications that imitate its action and others that prevent its degradation. The choice of appropriate treatment therefore depends on the stage of the disease. Some studies report interest in the use of some antioxidants and supplements with vitamin E and C. It is essential that the use of these other substances is always done with the doctor's knowledge and agreement. Regular physical exercise and a balanced diet are equally important, which allow you to offer a better quality of life and increase body control.  //What is the prognosis of Parkinson's disease?// Parkinson's disease has no cure, but current treatments allow for much more effective control, improving all aspects of patients' lives. //Prevention// The cause of Parkinson's disease remains under investigation and therefore its prevention is not yet possible. Some studies suggest that aerobic exercise can reduce the risk of the disease, while other inconclusive studies link reduced risk to coffee and tea consumption. This evidence remains to be proven.

Perthes disease,"//What is it?// It is a condition that occurs in children and is characterized by a momentary loss of blood flow in the hip region, with consequent death of the tissues of the head of the femur. The affected area appears very inflamed and irritated. It is normally more common in males but tends to be more severe in females and, therefore, the prognosis is worse in these cases. Its  exact incidence is difficult to determine because many cases go undiagnosed. But in 20% there is a family relationship. //Symptoms// Difficulty walking and pain when moving due to muscle spasm. These symptoms result from irritation of the tissues around the hip. There may be only discomfort or discomfort in the groin and/or knee (in about 50% of cases, pain from the hip may radiate to the knee). An increase in bone density can be seen on x-rays. Then the head of the femur begins to fragment and, finally, revascularization occurs with late bone remodeling. The child may limp and complain of pain. Symptoms may be intermittent over weeks or months. Rest tends to alleviate these manifestations. //Causes// The exact cause is not known, although it may result from changes in coagulation phenomena with consequent formation of thrombi. Their occurrence compromises the circulation of the femoral head, thus developing the disease. //Diagnosis// Although early diagnosis is not very important in terms of treatment, the use of imaging allows us to differentiate this disease from other conditions that require more immediate treatment. X-rays are the classic test to confirm the diagnosis, although they are not very effective in the early stages of the disease;;/ Scintigraphy, capable of demonstrating the ischemic area early, appears to be useful in cases of acute synovitis, in which the signs last for two to three weeks, and to demonstrate the degree of tissue involvement and its revascularization;;/ Magnetic resonance imaging immediately shows necrosis and its extent. Furthermore, during the progression of the pathology, it is useful for assessing the sphericity of the femoral head.;/ Arthrography has been the most widely used examination in the diagnosis of Perthes disease. In addition to helping to assess the degree of deformity of the femoral head, it is important to dynamically determine the position of the hip preoperatively.;/ //Treatment// It is known that in around 57% of cases the evolution is good without any form of treatment. In 20%, the results are not good, regardless of whether the disease is treated or not. It is up to the orthopedic doctor to identify the remaining 20% ​​who can benefit from treatment. The most commonly used therapeutic methods involve eliminating the load, using various types of prostheses or plaster casts. Anti-inflammatories are useful in relieving symptoms. Centralization of the femoral head can be achieved by conservative means or surgical procedures. //Prevention// There is no known form of prevention for this disease.

Chronic liver disease,"//What is it?// Chronic liver disease (CLD) is any form of advanced liver disease, in which the liver has been exposed, on a continuous basis, to one or more forms of aggression. The liver is an essential organ for maintaining the balance of our body, being responsible for such important functions as the formation of factors for blood clotting and the elimination of toxins. It has an enormous capacity for regeneration, that is, once damaged, it can recover by producing new cells from the existing ones. However, when these attacks are perpetuated over time, regeneration occurs incorrectly, resulting in scars (fibrosis) and nodules. At this stage, which is the most advanced stage of CLD, we can say that we are dealing with cirrhosis. This means that there is theoretically greater difficulty (resistance) in the passage of blood through the liver and that there may be compromise in the functions it performs. //Symptoms// During most of this process the liver does not produce any symptoms. The word cirrhosis is stigmatizing and most often misinterpreted. There are, broadly speaking, two phases of the disease. One in which episodes of decompensation have never occurred, that is, the disease has no symptoms and is often unknown; another, in which patients have complications, such as bleeding, jaundice, ascites (""water belly"") or infections. The latter is the decompensated phase. Between one and the other, years can pass. In other words, a patient can have cirrhosis and be well for years. You may not even suspect its existence. But often the initial manifestation of the disease can be an episode of severe decompensation or the appearance of a tumor in the liver, which is much more common in patients with cirrhosis. Therefore, the idea that cirrhosis causes complaints and is always detected by changes in analyzes is false. The first manifestation can be severe and late. Despite this, doctors may sometimes notice small signs that lead to suspicion of the disease, whether clinical, laboratory (e.g.: a decrease in the number of platelets without another cause) or imaging (e.g.: detecting an enlarged spleen in a routine abdominal ultrasound). //Causes// The most common cause of CLD in Portugal is excessive consumption of alcoholic beverages. Infections with hepatitis B and C viruses, autoimmune hepatitis, hereditary hemochromatosis or primary biliary cirrhosis are examples of other possible causes. A growing cause of liver cirrhosis that is often underappreciated is non-alcoholic fatty liver, in which obesity plays the decisive role. //Diagnosis// Confirming the existence of cirrhosis is only possible, strictly speaking, by performing a biopsy, but this is rarely necessary. There are now non-invasive methods that, in some types of DHC, can replace biopsy. The most used is Fibroscan®, which assesses the degree of liver fibrosis. This examination is similar to an ultrasound and does not cause any discomfort to the patient. //Treatment// Up to a certain point, it is possible to intervene in most of the factors underlying cirrhosis. There is even talk of regression of cirrhosis when these factors are eliminated or are very well controlled. Eliminating alcohol consumption, treating hepatitis or losing weight are examples of possible strategies to reduce the degree of fibrosis and prevent progression to the decompensated phase of the disease, in which the only option is often a liver transplant. //Prevention// Cirrhosis is also preventable. Vaccination for hepatitis B or avoiding sharing syringes or material potentially contaminated with blood are indirect ways to prevent the disease Load more;/ Cases of acute hepatitis of unknown origin in children have been reported in Europe and the USA. Little is known yet, but there are signs we should pay attention to. Alcohol consumption and viruses are the main causes of hepatitis. Learn how to prevent them. 99% of cases of this disease resolve without problems. But in rare situations, Hepatitis A can be serious. Knowing how to transmit it is crucial for prevention.

Inflammatory bowel disease,"//What is it?// It is a condition in which the intestine becomes red, swollen and ulcerated. Inflammatory bowel diseases can be divided into two main groups: ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. The term inflammatory bowel disease essentially applies to chronic inflammatory bowel disease of unknown cause, as there are other bowel diseases that do not fit this definition. In addition to Crohne's disease and ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel disease also encompasses indeterminate colitis. There has been a marked increase in the occurrence of this pathology in countries in the southern hemisphere, although it continues to be more frequent in countries in the northern hemisphere and in higher socioeconomic strata. In Portugal, it affects around seven thousand to 15 thousand people and is estimated to be around 2.9 cases per 100 thousand inhabitants per year with ulcerative colitis and 2.4 per 100 thousand with Crohn's disease. The age of onset presents two peaks of highest incidence, one between 15 and 30 years, and a second between 60 and 80 years, this being more frequent in Crohn's disease. This condition should not be confused with irritable bowel syndrome, which affects the colon's contractility. In this case, inflammation never occurs and it is a much less serious disorder than inflammatory bowel disease. //Symptoms// The symptoms of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are different. In the first case, there is an attack on the lining of the large intestine, causing inflammation, ulceration and bleeding. During an ulcerative colitis attack, patients almost always have bloody diarrhea associated with cramps, fatigue, loss of appetite and weight loss. Removal of the colon is, in some cases, a therapeutic option. In the second case, inflammation occurs throughout the entire thickness of the intestinal wall and can occur anywhere in the digestive tract, from the mouth to the anus. The most common symptom is abdominal pain, which may be associated with diarrhea, bleeding, loss of appetite, weight loss, weakness, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, fever and anemia. Surgery may be necessary, but it does not cure the disease. Other signs not directly related to the intestine may occur in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Among these signs, arthritis stands out, with swollen, painful and stiff joints; oral ulcers; fever; red, painful and light-sensitive eyes; and skin rashes. //Causes// There does not seem to be any common characteristic among those with this disease. Any individual can develop the disease, regardless of gender, race or age. People are most often diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 25 and between the ages of 45 and 55. The causes are unknown and probably involve several factors. There may be a genetic tendency that, when interacting with environmental factors, triggers an uncontrolled immune response that causes the chronic inflammatory process in the intestine. Tobacco has been associated with the development of ulcerative colitis. //Diagnosis// It begins with a clinical history and medical examination, and is complemented by laboratory tests on blood and stool, and radiological and endoscopic studies that allow tissue samples to be collected for a more detailed assessment. It is important to check the entire digestive tract in order to understand the extent and severity of the clinical condition. Since its symptoms are identical to other pathologies, it is essential that the diagnosis is accurate in order to choose the most appropriate treatment. On the other hand, the patient must undergo these tests regularly, in order to monitor the evolution of the disease and the response to therapy. //Treatment// Treatment can be medical and/or surgical, depending on the type of disease and its extent. This should help alleviate symptoms and encourage healing of intestinal injuries. In general, it evolves through progressive steps until the desired response is achieved. It is also important to be able to interrupt inflammatory crises and prevent future relapses, which is currently more viable through new biological and immunomodulatory therapies. Controlling inflammation not only provides important symptomatic relief, it also reduces the need for surgery, the use of more aggressive medications and hospitalizations.  Aminosalicylates and corticosteroids are useful in the acute phase of the disease and immunomodulators or biological agents are important when attacks are frequent in order to reduce the use of corticosteroids or when they are not effective. The manifestation of symptoms can also be minimized with the use of antidiarrheals, antispasmodics or drugs that help improve food absorption. All of these medications must be prescribed by a doctor. The prevention of osteoporosis is also important, as it can arise as a result of poor calcium absorption or as a result of the use of corticosteroids. Surgery may be necessary in more severe forms of inflammatory bowel disease. //Prevention// If there is no known cause, this disease cannot be prevented. Maintaining good general health and a balanced diet are important ways to reduce complications and avoid weight loss and anemia. Not smoking is essential and reduces the number of exacerbations of the disease. As this pathology increases the risk of colon cancer, regular evaluation is very important, with colonoscopy at intervals defined by the doctor. This makes it easier to diagnose and treat any complications that may arise early. Brazilian Inflammatory Bowel Disease Study Group, 2013 William A Rowe, Inflammatory Bowel Disease Treatment & Management, Medscape, Nov. 2013 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2013 Colonoscopy is a minimally invasive procedure that allows you to identify and treat intestinal lesions. Two gastroenterologists explain its importance. The feeling of a bloated belly can be uncomfortable and there are several possible causes, from diet to hormones. Find out how to prevent and alleviate it. Many people develop diverticula in their colon after the age of 40. The type of diet you eat can help prevent inflammation of the diverticula. Find out how.
