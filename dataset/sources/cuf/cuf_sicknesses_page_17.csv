chicken pox,"//What is it?// Chickenpox is a viral infection caused by the Herpes varicella zoster virus, also responsible for other diseases, such as herpes or mononucleosis. Chickenpox is one of the most common childhood illnesses. It is so contagious that more than 90% of people who have not had contact with the virus end up becoming infected. The infection is most common in late winter and early spring and is contracted through direct contact with infected skin or with particles of saliva released when a patient coughs or sneezes. The ease of contagion is accentuated by the fact that one person can infect another before symptoms even appear. //Symptoms// The virus can be transmitted through respiratory secretions, by dissemination through the air when the infected person coughs, sneezes or talks or by contact with the liquid from skin lesions, when they rupture. Another mode of transmission of the virus is transplacentally, which can lead to infection of the fetus. The most typical symptoms are the presence of small blisters filled with liquid on the skin, mainly on the trunk, but which can also appear on the face, scalp and genitals or even spread throughout the body. Before its appearance, chickenpox makes itself known by the presence of pink, flat, superficial spots that, in a second phase, transform until very thin-walled blisters are formed that contain a transparent liquid. They end up breaking, leaving small lesions on the skin that dry out, until a crust forms that also disappears, generally speaking, without leaving any marks. These different phases can be present simultaneously in the patient. In some cases, it manifests itself mildly, forming few blisters. In others, they erupt in hundreds, sometimes even on the roof of the mouth or inside the rectum and vagina, causing great discomfort. The itching caused is very severe and can cause skin damage and/or bacterial infection. As such, it is very important to keep children's nails short and clean in order to minimize these risks. Although the blisters are the most visible sign of chickenpox, there are other symptoms such as fever, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, headaches and general malaise. These symptoms are usually mild. Although it is a benign disease, complications such as pneumonia, encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), cellulitis or toxic shock can occur. It is important to know that, although each person has only one episode of chickenpox, the virus remains latent in the nerve cells. When it is reactivated, due to illness, stress, sun exposure or medication use, it emerges in the form of a new disease called shingles (also caused by the herpes zoster virus). This occurs in about 10% of adults who had chickenpox in childhood. Chickenpox tends to be more serious when acquired in adulthood, especially in patients whose defenses are reduced due to other pathologies or the use of some medications such as corticosteroids. In fact, adolescents and adults are more susceptible to serious complications, with a 20-fold increase in mortality between the ages of 15 and 44. Pregnant women are also a particular risk group. If a woman did not have chickenpox in childhood and contracts it during pregnancy, especially in the first few weeks, the fetus may be born with congenital anomalies. If the disease is contracted in the week before birth, there is a risk that the baby will be born with an infection that can be fatal. On the contrary, if the mother has chickenpox before becoming pregnant, the fetus receives antibodies through the placenta or during breastfeeding, which reduces the likelihood of contracting it or, if it does appear, it will be in a very mild form. //Causes// It is caused by the virusHerpes varicella zoster, also responsible for herpes or mononucleosis. //Diagnosis// The diagnosis of chickenpox is mainly clinical. In general, laboratory evaluation is not necessary. //Treatment// Treatment essentially involves controlling and relieving symptoms. Itching can be reduced by using warm water baths and/or by using calamine-based lotions on the affected areas. On the face, extreme care must be taken to avoid contact with the eyes. Fever and pain can be controlled with painkillers, but it is important not to use aspirin in children, given the risk of Reye's syndrome. If necessary, antihistamines can be used to control itching and, in more severe cases, antivirals. Rest is also helpful. //Prevention// Considering that this is a contagious disease, it is essential to isolate the infected child until the blisters dry completely. The vaccine, although it does not guarantee 100% protection, ensures that even if chickenpox does occur, it will be much milder. It is not part of the National Vaccination Plan, but is available in pharmacies. It can be administered from 12 months of age, in which case only one dose is necessary. From 13 years of age, two doses are injected, with an interval of six to ten weeks between them. The vaccine cannot be administered to immunocompromised individuals, pregnant women, children under one year of age or individuals undergoing salicylate therapy (they should not be prescribed until six weeks after vaccination). Like any other vaccine, it can cause some side effects at the site of administration, such as redness and fever.

Varicose veins,"//What are they?// Varicose veins are dilated and tortuous veins located under the skin, which makes them easily identifiable. They must be distinguished from effusions, which are small-caliber vessels. Although they have different natures and importance, both are covered by the term Chronic Venous Disease and can and should be treated, to improve symptoms, to prevent progression to more serious cases or even just for aesthetic reasons. The prevalence of varicose veins in Portugal is between 20 and 25% of the population, with females being the most affected in a ratio of two to one, due to hormonal influence and pregnancy. Only 10% of diagnosed cases are indicated for surgery or alternative techniques, and the remainder must be treated with medication, compression stockings and simple sclerotherapy or external laser therapy. //Symptoms// The main symptoms of varicose veins are pain (of various characteristics), tiredness, heaviness, cramps, “tingling” and “itching” in the lower limbs, accompanied or not by “swelling”, especially in the ankles and feet, worsening at the end of the day and with prolonged exposure to heat. Signs of seriousness include changes in the color and consistency of the skin on the lower third of the legs, which becomes brownish, scaly and hardened, and its appearance is a sign of the possible onset of a varicose ulcer. This clinical condition is very disabling, significantly interfering with the lives of those affected in the social, professional and psychological domains, due to a loss of body image and a consequent decrease in self-esteem. //Causes// The causes of varicose veins are varied but begin with congenital or inherited weakness of the walls of the veins, which thus become easily dilated by blood pressure. Additional factors include body weight, exposure to heat, prolonged periods spent standing and a sedentary lifestyle. Aging is in itself a sign of worsening, so general prophylaxis rules should be advised early on and appropriate treatments instituted. //Diagnosis// For the correct diagnosis of varicose veins, it is often necessary to perform a Doppler and/or Doppler ultrasound, carried out by the specialist at the first consultation. //Treatment// Varicose vein therapy is divided into conservative and non-conservative. The first includes skin care, especially hydration, use of phlebotonic medications and compression with elastic stockings or bandages. The second includes sclerotherapy (“drying”), which can be simple or foam therapy with or without ultrasound control, transcutaneous or endovascular laser therapy, radiofrequency also performed endovascularly with ultrasound support and also the classic surgery known as saphenectomy. This variety of procedures can most often be performed on an outpatient basis and under local, regional or general anesthesia, and the choice depends on the specialist's assessment of the severity of the case. In many cases, it may even be necessary to use several methods simultaneously or in addition to obtaining the best result. The current trend in non-conservative treatment is the use of less invasive techniques for radiofrequency sclerosis, given the tolerance and absence of complications. //Prevention// Avoid long periods of standing or standing still. To do this, you must take short walking breaks or stand on your toes several times;;/ Avoid sitting for a long time, especially on hard-edged chairs, or crossing your legs. In this case, it is advisable to move your legs frequently;;/ Avoid very hot baths, as heat dilates varicose veins even further;;/ Avoid long exposure to the sun. You must swim or walk along the seashore, in the burst area;;/ In hot weather, you should massage your legs with a cold shower (two minutes), from bottom to top;;/ Do not block venous circulation with tight trousers or boots, girdles, garters or stockings with strong elastic edges.;/ Sonovein ecotherapy is a non-invasive treatment for varicose veins. Orlanda Castelbranco, angiologist and vascular surgeon, explains what it consists of. Smoking, poor sleep, and excessive sun exposure are all enemies of healthy, youthful skin. But there are other mistakes you can avoid to prevent premature aging. A long, hot shower can be relaxing, but it can also dry out and irritate your skin. Understand how wrong habits can do more harm than good.

Warts,"//What is it?// They are a skin infection caused by the Human Papillomavirus. The virus penetrates the skin through previous lesions and develops to form a characteristic benign lesion in the form of a rough bump on its surface. They are a common viral infection that can affect anyone at any age. //Symptoms// Small calluses form on the skin that grow slowly, with small black dots visible in their center. Sometimes they become bulging and the surface looks like cauliflower. Warts can appear anywhere, but they are most common on the hands and feet. //Causes// It usually happens in humid environments such as swimming pools or changing rooms, where the humidity softens the skin and facilitates the penetration of the virus. They are not serious, but when located on the soles of the feet they can cause pain and consequent changes in gait and posture, which is why should not be neglected. //Diagnosis// Diagnosis is based on examination of the skin and the wart, taking into account other symptoms the patient may have. //Treatment// Treatment involves keratolytics, corrosive substances that destroy the keratin that makes up warts. The product is applied daily. As dead skin forms on the surface, it must be scraped off until the wart heals, which can take weeks. If you cannot eliminate them in this way, it is necessary to use surgical methods to remove them, under local anesthesia. //Prevention// There is no foolproof way to avoid warts, however you should avoid the risk of contamination from other infected sources: Wearing flip-flops or sandals in locker rooms, swimming pools or public showers;/ Don't touch someone else's wart;/ Don't scratch a wart;/ Don't shave over a wart;/ Keep clothes and towels away from other people in the house, preventing them from coming into contact with the wart.;/ Cleveland Clinic Warts and blackheads are often considered synonymous, but they are actually two distinct conditions.

Vertigo vertigo syndrome,"//What are they?// Vertigo is not a disease but rather a symptom that can occur in various pathologies. The word vertigo comes from the Latin vertere, which means spinning or rotating movement. Vertigo, or vertigo syndrome, is defined as a distortion of the body's movement in space. To understand what causes vertigo, we must understand the entire mechanism involved in maintaining balance. There are several systems involved in the orientation of our body: the visual, the vestibular (inner ear) and the proprioceptive (these receptors are located in the muscles, tendons, joints and skin). Vertigo occurs when there is an anomaly in one of these systems and can also result from a problem in the brain, which is responsible for analysing and integrating information about the movement and position of the head and body. This condition can affect people of any age and is usually accompanied by other symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, headaches, paleness, increased heart rate and loss of consciousness. They correspond to an illusion of movement, with a sensation of movement of surrounding objects in relation to the individual or vice versa. They are most often rotatory (the environment seems to move around the patient), but they can also manifest as a sensation of sliding to one side or up and down. It is necessary to distinguish vertigo from dizziness: dizziness is a generic designation that encompasses all situations where there is a disturbance in the individual's relationships with space, and vertigo must be considered a particular form of dizziness. This distinction is not always easy, especially in cases of great anxiety or when dizziness occurs in the context of a psychiatric illness. In general, vertigo results from an injury to the inner ear, its peripheral receptors, the pathways that carry the information collected or the centers of the central nervous system that process this information. Vision disorders and a special type of sensitivity (proprioceptive) in the skin, bones, muscles and joints throughout the body can also cause dizziness, which can be very difficult to distinguish from vertigo. Vertigo is part of a broader set of disorders, known as vestibular disorders, which are very common. For example, in the United States, it is estimated that approximately 35% of the population over the age of 40 has had at least one episode of vestibular disease. //Symptoms// Vertigo, or vertigo syndrome, can be accompanied by dizziness, a feeling of lightheadedness or fainting, loss of balance or instability. The duration of episodes can vary from a few minutes to hours and are often accompanied by intense nausea and vomiting. In general, headaches, slurred speech, double vision, weakness of one of the upper or lower limbs, and uncoordinated movements are signs that the vertigo is caused by a neurological disorder in the brain and not a problem limited to the ear. Elderly people or those taking medications for heart disease or high blood pressure may experience dizziness or fainting when they stand up abruptly. This happens due to a momentary drop in blood pressure (orthostatic hypotension) that lasts just a few seconds. It can often be prevented by standing more slowly or wearing compression stockings. //Causes// There are many causes of vertigo. The body detects posture and controls balance through balance organs located in the inner ear. These have nerve connections with specific areas of the brain that allow balance to be maintained. Therefore, vertigo can be caused by disorders of the ear, the nerves that connect the ear to the brain or the brain itself - in more aggressive acute or chronic otitis, toxic substances can spread to the inner ear and interfere with its proper functioning for balance. It can also be related to visual problems or sudden changes in blood pressure, but also to labyrinthitis, neuritis, traumatic brain injury, auditory nerve or brain tumors, strokes, meningitis, ototoxicity from certain medications, barotrauma due to pressure changes, among others. Cardiac arrhythmia, hypoglycemia, a sudden drop in blood pressure, or anxiety that causes the patient to constantly take deep breaths can cause syncope that can be confused with vertigo. Changing the prescription of glasses lenses can also cause this condition. The most common cause is motion sickness, which can occur in anyone whose inner ear is sensitive to certain movements, such as rocking or sudden braking and acceleration. These people may feel particularly dizzy during car or boat journeys. This type tends to be more common in women and is more common in older people, and its exact cause is not always known. In some cases, the condition occurs after a head injury, reduced blood flow to certain areas of the brain, a viral infection, after ear surgery or prolonged breastfeeding. Ménière's disease causes episodic and abrupt attacks of vertigo, along with ringing in the ears and progressive deafness. They can also be caused by bacterial or viral infections, tumors, abnormal pressure, nerve inflammation or toxic substances that affect the aforementioned structures. At a cerebral level, they occur in the context of migraines, after a stroke, following transient episodes of ischemia or in multiple sclerosis. //Diagnosis// Diagnosis is based on clinical history and medical examination of the auditory system or nervous system. Some tests can provoke an episode of vertigo and thus help to understand its cause. Tests such as audiometry, impedance analysis, evoked potentials, electro or videonystagmography, posturography and imaging tests (computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) are frequently used. //Treatment// Some cases do not require treatment and disappear spontaneously. In others, certain maneuvers can be performed to control the condition. Depending on the cause, there are other treatment options, such as anti-inflammatory or antiemetic drugs (if there is significant vomiting), among others. //Prevention// Anyone can experience vertigo and there is no way to prevent a first episode. Since it causes a strong feeling of imbalance, it is important to avoid situations in which you could fall. American Academy of Family Physicians, 2014 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, 2013 MedicineNet, 2014 Vestibular Disorders Association, 2014 Load more;/ Vestibular neuritis is an inflammation of the vestibular nerve after an episode of acute vertigo, which can maintain the sensation of imbalance for weeks. Different from simple dizziness, vertigo can be a symptom of various illnesses and require medical advice. Discover some of the causes of vertigo.

Marburg virus,"//What is it?// Marburg virus was first detected in 1967, after several simultaneous outbreaks occurred in laboratories located in Marburg and Frankfurt, Germany, and in Belgrade, Serbia. Like the Ebola virus, this virus belongs to the Filoviridae family. Although the diseases caused by the Marburg virus and Ebola are different, they have similar clinical profiles, capable of causing outbreaks with high mortality rates. The disease caused by the Marburg virus is a rare, serious type of hemorrhagic fever with a high mortality rate - on average, 50%, but it can vary between 24% and 88%, depending on several factors, such as the strain of the virus and the health care provided to the patient. The bat Rousettus aegyptiacus, which is distributed throughout Africa, is considered a natural host of the Marburg virus, but it has also been detected in monkeys and chimpanzees. This is a zoonotic disease, meaning it can be transmitted from animals to humans. The virus can also infect other non-human primates, and more studies are needed to determine whether other species can also be hosts for the virus. Outbreaks have been reported in Africa, including cases in: Gana;/ Uganda;/ Zimbabwe;/ Democratic Republic of the Congo;/ Kenya;/ Angola;/ South Africa;/  Although cases of Marburg virus disease have occurred outside of Africa (as in 1967), these are rare.  //Symptoms of Marburg Virus// The incubation period (interval between the moment of infection and the appearance of symptoms) of the disease caused by the Marburg virus can vary between two and 21 days (or up to 26 days). Symptoms appear suddenly and include: High fever;/ Goosebumps;/ Severe headache;/ Severe malaise;/ Muscle pain (myalgia);/ Severe diarrhea (appears around the 3rd day of symptoms and can last up to a week);/ Nausea and vomiting (usually appear on the 3rd day);/ Abdominal pain and cramps (usually appear on the 3rd day);/ Fatigue, sunken eyes and severe lack of strength;/ Chest pain;/ Sore throat;/  Around the 5th day of symptoms, a maculopapular rash (reddish spots and papules) may occur, mainly on the chest, abdomen and back. Five to seven days after the onset of symptoms, severe bleeding may appear, which is associated with the majority of fatal cases (often bleeding in multiple areas of the body). Blood in stool and vomit is often accompanied by bleeding from the nose, gums and vagina (in women). Bleeding may also occur in areas where the skin is punctured to obtain intravenous lines (to administer fluids, medications or obtain blood tests). In the most severe phase of the disease, patients maintain a high fever and the following may also occur: Confusion;/ Aggressiveness;/ Irritability;/  As the disease progresses, symptoms can become more severe and include: Jaundice;/ Shock;/ Liver failure;/ Inflammation of the pancreas;/ Multiple organ dysfunction and failure;/ Severe weight loss;/ Delusions;/ Severe bleeding;/ Orchitis (inflammation of one or both testicles - in the case of men);/  In very severe cases resulting in death, this most often occurs between the 8th and 9th day after the onset of symptoms and is usually preceded by severe blood loss, shock and multiple organ failure.  //Causes// The Marburg virus is transmitted from the bat Rousettus aegyptiacus to humans (when there is prolonged exposure to the habitat of these animals), and contagion between humans can then occur. From person to person, transmission can occur through: Direct contact (through breaks in the skin or mucous membranes) with the blood, secretions (e.g. respiratory), organs and other fluids (feces, urine, vomit, saliva) of the infected person.;/ Contact with surfaces and materials, such as clothing and bedding, contaminated with the previously mentioned fluids.;/ Through infected semen - this type of contagion can occur up to seven weeks after the person is considered clinically recovered.;/ Use of infected injection equipment and needlestick injuries.;/  Transmission of the Marburg virus does not occur during the incubation period and, usually, infected people are contagious only after symptoms appear. So, people are considered infectious as long as the virus is detected in their blood. Contamination of other people can occur even after the patient's death, for example, through contact with the body during funeral ceremonies. It is known that Marburg virus can persist in some recovered people. Recurrence without reinfection in someone who has recovered from the disease is a rare event, but it has been documented.  //Diagnosis of Marburg virus// It may be difficult to distinguish clinically between Marburg virus disease and other infectious diseases (such as malaria, meningitis, typhoid fever, shigellosis, and other viral hemorrhagic fevers). Therefore, blood tests are necessary, which detect the presence of an immune response to this virus in order to confirm whether the disease is effectively caused by the Marburg virus - ELISA method (immunoenzymatic serological test), RT-PCR tests, among others . These diagnostic methods are often not available in countries that have fewer health care resources and a higher risk of outbreak.  //Marburg virus treatment// Despite the high mortality rate (which can reach 88%), this can be much lower when adequate health care is provided. To increase the likelihood of survival, early oral or intravenous hydration and symptomatic treatment are very important. To date, there is no approved specific antiviral treatment or vaccine for Marburg virus disease, but there are several therapies in development (such as immunotherapy or drugs). Although the disease caused by the Marburg virus is similar to Ebola, the Ebola vaccine is not effective in preventing this infection.  //Prevention// Some strategies that can help prevent community transmission of Marburg virus include: Avoid traveling to areas where there are active outbreaks of the disease.;/ Reduce the risk of transmission from the bat Rousettus aegyptiacus to humans, such as using protective equipment (such as gloves, masks and appropriate clothing) when visiting the habitat of these animals (caves or mines).;/ Avoid eating bushmeat. When there are active outbreaks, all animal products (blood and meat) should be consumed thoroughly cooked/cooked.;/ Avoid close and direct contact with infected people.;/ Avoid contact with clothing, bedding or other objects that have been in contact with infected patients.;/ Use gloves and other protective equipment if it is necessary to care for the patient at home and at funeral ceremonies for people who were sick.;/ Wash your hands frequently (or, when this is not possible, use alcohol gel), especially after visiting the patient in the hospital and in care.;/ Men who have recovered from the infection, in order to reduce sexual transmission of the virus, must reinforce the adoption of safe sexual practices and hygiene in the 12 months following the onset of symptoms or until the semen has tested negative for the presence of the virus twice in a laboratory analysis.;/  Healthcare professionals must wear facial protection (visor, mask and glasses), long-sleeved lab coat and gloves whenever providing close care to patients with Marburg virus.

Virus epstein barr,"//What is it?// Epstein-Barr (VEB) is a virus that belongs to the group of human herpesviruses. It is one of the most common, being present all over the world. Around 50% of children up to 5 years of age are infected and more than 90% of adults carry the virus. This means that most people, at some point in their lives, become infected with Epstein-Barr.  EBV is mainly known for causing infectious mononucleosis (popularly known as the kissing disease). It can also be associated with other diseases and complications, such as: Ear infections;/ Guillain-Barré syndrome;/ Nose, throat and gastric cancer;/ Burkitt's lymphoma;/ Hodgkin's lymphoma;/ Interstitial pneumonia;/ Pancytopenia (decrease in the number of blood cells);/ Uveitis (inflammation of the uvea, the vascular layer of the eyeball);/  Recent studies also show that the Epstein-Barr Virus could be associated with multiple sclerosis. The virus is found mainly in saliva and nasal secretions and infects B lymphocytes. After the first infection, EBV remains permanently in the host and spreads asymptomatically and intermittently from the oropharynx. Spread is greater in immunocompromised patients (e.g. HIV patients or organ recipients). //Symptoms// Infection with the Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is generally asymptomatic and the incubation period for the virus is approximately 30 to 50 days. In children, symptoms, if they exist, may not be distinguishable from other common illnesses such as a cold or flu. Young people and adults generally have more characteristic symptoms of the disease, which may include: Fatigue;/ Fever;/ Sore throat;/ Appearance of lymph nodes in the neck;/ Lack of appetite;/ Skin irritation - rash;/ Headache;/ Tonsillitis;/  In more serious cases, the infection can also cause an increase in the size of the liver and spleen and generate neurological, hematological, respiratory and hepatic complications. Symptoms usually disappear after two to four weeks, but tiredness can last for months. //Causes// The Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is transmitted, above all, through saliva between an infected person and an uninfected person - hence mononucleosis, the most common disease caused by this virus, is also known as “kissing disease” -, but also through use of contaminated objects, such as toothbrushes or glasses. EBV is also found in blood and sperm, so it is possible to spread it through transfusions of untreated blood, organ transplants or sexual intercourse. When a patient becomes infected for the first time - the so-called primary infection - they can spread the virus for weeks while being asymptomatic. After this first infection, the virus remains in the patient's body and can become active again, making the person contagious again. //Diagnosis// Diagnosing Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection can be time-consuming, as the symptoms are easily confused with other illnesses such as flu or tonsillitis. Examination of the patient at the doctor's appointment may reveal more details, such as swelling of the liver or spleen and white spots on the tonsils. The blood count can also detect the infection, by finding antibodies to the virus or leukocytes (white blood cells), produced by the immune system to fight the infection. //Treatment// There is no specific medication to treat Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection, and it must follow its natural course until cured, generally after two to four weeks. However, the patient can take some measures to alleviate symptoms: Increase your fluid intake to stay hydrated;/ Rest during the acute phase of the disease;/ Avoid doing sports and demanding physical activities;/ Taking medicines such as ibuprofen or paracetamol to relieve pain and fever;/  Antibiotics should not be administered, as this is an infection caused by viruses and not bacteria. In more serious cases, corticosteroids may be used. //Prevention// There is no vaccine against Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection. Therefore, the best form of prevention is to avoid contact with infected people or objects. You should not kiss or share drinks, food and personal objects with anyone who is infected. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, February 2022 MSD Manual, February 2022 National Health Service, February 2022 WebMD, February 2022 When mononucleosis affects you or a family member, it is important to consider the types of foods and drinks that can help fight this viral infection.

Respiratory syncytial virus,"//What is it?// Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the main cause of bronchiolitis and viral pneumonia in babies and young children. The likelihood of serious infection caused by RSV is greater in children: Premature;;/ Up to 2 years old who were born with heart or lung disease;;/ Whose immune system is weakened due to illness or medical treatment;;/ Less than 8 to 10 weeks old;;/  The World Health Organization estimates that 33 million lower respiratory tract infections caused by Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) occur annually in children under 5 years of age worldwide, of which 3.3 million require hospitalization. Around 60,000 of these children end up losing their lives due to complications.  //Symptoms of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)// RSV infection typically manifests itself four to six days after infection and the main symptoms include: Runny nose;;/ Loss of appetite;;/ Cough;;/ Sneezing;;/ Fever;;/ Wheezing/wheezing.;/  As a general rule, these symptoms do not appear all at the same time and some may not appear at all. In very young babies, the only symptoms of RSV may be irritability, decreased activity, refusal to feed, or difficulty breathing. In children younger than 6 months, apnea (obstruction of airflow to the lungs) may be the initial symptom of RSV infection. In healthy adults and older children, the illness is usually mild and may be virtually asymptomatic or manifest as just a common cold.  //Causes// Like other viruses that cause respiratory infections, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is also transmitted through secretions from the nose or mouth. Contagion is easy and can occur through direct contact (for example, when kissing the face of an infected child) or through droplets expelled when talking, coughing or sneezing. The virus can still remain on surfaces for hours, and this aspect is of great importance, considering that sharing toys is one of the most common ways of transmitting RSV among children, in daycare centers and nurseries. Epidemics tend to be seasonal, with the peak generally recorded between December and January, although the virus can circulate at other times of the year. Having been infected once does not protect against reinfection, but the antibodies that are developing against RSV contribute to a decrease in the severity of the disease. The contagious period begins two days before symptoms appear and only ends when the infection is completely controlled. However, some children and adults with weakened immune systems can continue to spread the virus even after no symptoms, for up to four weeks.  //RSV Diagnosis// The diagnosis of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is usually made based on the patient's clinical history and observation, including auscultation of the lungs. The doctor also takes into account the time of year and the circulation of the virus at the time. Although it is not the most common, it is possible that the clinician will resort to some tests, especially if the disease is serious, requires hospitalization or rules out other diagnoses. Among the tests that the attending physician may use include: Blood and urine tests, with the aim of identifying associated complications or other causes that explain the symptoms;;/ Chest X-ray, to look for signs of pneumonia or identify lung complications associated with RSV;;/ Rapid antigen tests, PCR tests or virus culture.;/  //Treatment of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)// Most RSV infections eventually go away after a week or two, and nothing more than relieving symptoms is needed, similar to what is done for most colds. There is no specific treatment for RSV, so as a rule it is advised to manage fever and pain with antipyretics/pain relievers and drink plenty of fluids, preferably water, to prevent dehydration and help thin secretions. Although treatment can be carried out at home, it is important that the evolution of the situation is monitored and that a doctor is consulted in case of difficulty breathing, dehydration or worsening of symptoms. Before administering any medication to a child, it is advisable to ask the attending physician for help, bearing in mind that not all medications are suitable. People with breathing difficulties may be hospitalized (especially children and the elderly) and, depending on the clinical picture, doctors may treat them with oxygen, intravenous hydration and medications or procedures (intubation) to open the airways.  //RSV prevention// The main measures to prevent infection with Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) are similar to those for other respiratory viral infections, namely: Hygiene: frequent hand washing with running water and soap. If washing is not possible, it is advisable to use alcohol gel, particularly in public places. Frequently clean high-touch surfaces, such as door handles, handrails, switches and screens of electronic devices;;/ Respiratory etiquette: anyone showing symptoms of a respiratory infection should wear a mask, especially if they come into contact with children or the elderly. In situations where you do not wear a mask, you must protect your nose and mouth with a disposable tissue or your forearm when sneezing or coughing, throw away used tissues and wash your hands immediately;;/ Avoid close contact: anyone with symptoms compatible with RSV should avoid close contact with other people, that is, kissing, touching hands and sharing glasses, cups or cutlery. Care must be taken in the case of children and the elderly who are at high risk of serious RSV infections;;/ Immunization: although not yet considered a vaccine, the long-acting monoclonal antibody nirsevimab was recently approved for immunization against RSV. Immunization will be seasonal, taking place every year between October 1 and March 31. It should be administered at birth, for those born during that period in public, private or social sector maternity hospitals. Immunity lasts only six months, so taking it does not provide lifelong immunity but only for the autumn/winter of the year in which it is administered*. The introduction of this new immunization represents a major achievement in the fight against RSV, particularly among the most vulnerable. This measure is expected to significantly reduce hospitalizations and significantly increase the number of lives saved, as well as preventing seasonal outbreaks of this common and challenging agent.;/  *Exceptionally, in 2024 the following will be covered: I. Babies born in August and September; II. Preterm children up to 34 weeks (exclusive) born between January 1st and July 31st; III. Children with other risk factors for serious RSV infection such as heart disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and other chronic lung diseases who have not yet turned 2 years old by September 30, 2024.  Updated on 08/16/2024 Published on 11/29/2021 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, novembro de 2021 MSD Manual, November 2021 World Health Organization, November 2021 Brazilian Society of Pediatrics, November 2021 WebMD, November 2021 RSV infection can progress to bronchiolitis or pneumonia. Mônica Cró Braz, Pediatrician, points out the warning signs and prevention strategies. The pandemic has brought pediatricians an additional concern: Respiratory Syncytial Virus. Since then, cases have appeared earlier, in greater numbers and with greater severity. In most cases, bronchiolitis resolves on its own and your baby will feel better within a few days, but there are cases that require hospitalization.

Vitiligo,"//What is it?// It is a localized or diffuse depigmentation of the skin, characterized by well-defined white skin patches with a tendency towards symmetry. It appears at any age, although more frequently in young adults. Its evolution is extremely variable, in terms of age, number of injuries and progression. //Symptoms// In some people, only one or two well-defined spots appear; in others, the spots are more extensive. The skin that is affected by the disease also produces white hair, because the hair follicles lose their melanocytes. The changes are more visible in patients with dark pigmentation, with non-pigmented skin being extremely sensitive to sunburn.  This pathology can have an important psychological impact, due to its effect on image and self-esteem. //Causes// Its lesions result from the partial or total absence of melanocytes, cells responsible for the production of melanin. Its cause is still unknown, with the autoimmune hypothesis being the most widely accepted one. In about a third of cases, a familial incidence is also observed. //Diagnosis// White spots are usually easily visible, but your doctor may use a Wood's lamp, which projects ultraviolet (UV) light onto your skin, to help differentiate them from other conditions. //Treatment// Until the middle of the 20th century, vitiligo was a dermatosis with few therapeutic possibilities. In 1947, Mofty first used 8-methoxypsoralen, a purified molecule from the Ammi majus plant, associated with sun exposure. Later, 8-MOP was used in association with artificial UVA radiation. This treatment, called PUVA, is still widely used in the treatment of vitiligo. Simultaneously, in the 1950s, therapy with topical corticosteroids was initiated. With the intention of improving the results obtained and minimizing side effects, other molecules such as 5-methoxypsoralen, phenylalanine, kellin, levadamisole, pseudocatalase, placental extracts, among others, have been tested.  However, low efficacy rates, combined with the incidence of side effects, have led to the non-approval of these therapies. Recently, tacrolimus and vitamin D derivatives have demonstrated their effectiveness, eventually becoming therapeutic options. Autologous melanocyte grafts are another possibility. As well as the transplantation of melanocytes from in vitro cultures.  //How effective are the treatments?// There is a wide variability in results with the various treatments available. However, their effectiveness does not usually exceed 75% of repigmentation. Clarification of its pathophysiological mechanisms will enable the development of new drugs that reduce the depigmentation process and the combination of medical and surgical methods may make vitiligo a potentially reversible disease. //Prevention// Since its exact cause is unknown, it cannot be prevented. Cleveland Clinic Medical News Today It is natural for parents to try to prevent their child from missing school. However, there are reasons that justify a child staying at home, such as when they are sick. Cancer treatment can cause changes in the image that affect the self-esteem of the cancer patient. But it is possible to minimize them.

Vomiting in children,"//What are they?// Vomiting is a common situation in pediatrics and is associated with many childhood illnesses. They often appear in any febrile situation, with a sore throat or in gastroenteritis. It is important to know that in themselves they are not synonymous with severity. After an episode of vomiting, any patient, child or adult, becomes prostrate and pale. However, after a short time the child returns to his or her normal state. //Practical advice// Taking a break from eating for more than half an hour;/ If your child has vomited more than once, giving your child a sugary drink, a cookie with jam, or some sugar can help stop the vomiting and keep your child hydrated and free from hypoglycemia.;/ After half an hour, give him small sips of sweetened weak tea or oral moisturizer at regular intervals.;/ If an antipyretic is needed, opt for a suppository;/ Go on a fat-free diet;/ Do not force the child to eat;/ Do not transmit anxiety to the child;/ Load more;/ About us;/ Events;/ Clients and Companions;/ News;/ CUF Academic Center;/ Partnerships;/ Contacts;/ Frequently Asked Questions;/ Join us;/ Virtual Visit;/ English version;/ My CUF;/ Access Solutions and Health Plans;/ Facebook;/ Facebook Instagram;/ Instagram LinkedInCreated with Sketch.;/ LinkedIn Youtube;/ Youtube award4;/ award4 certification1;/ certification1 certification2;/ certification2 certification3;/ certification3 Complaints and compliments;/ Complaints and compliments Privacy and Cookies Policy;/ Terms and Conditions;/ Whistleblower Channel;/ © CUF 2024 All rights reserved Start;/ Health A-Z: Diseases, Symptoms and Treatments;/"

Vulvitis,"//What is it?// Vulvitis is not a disease in itself but an inflammation of the skin folds of the vulva, which corresponds to the outermost region of the female genitals. This inflammation can result from an infection, allergy, or injury. The vulva is especially susceptible to inflammatory processes, given its external location, humidity and temperature. This type of disorder, like countless other dermatological conditions, has an important functional, aesthetic and psychological impact. In many cases, the cause is unknown. Although itching, pain and discomfort during sexual intercourse are the most common symptoms, in the case of a more severe or prolonged illness, complications such as sexual dysfunction, urination disorders or even malignancy may arise. Women of any age can be affected by vulvitis. Younger girls, before puberty, or in the post-menopausal phase are at greater risk, given the lower levels of estrogen that make the tissues in the vulvar region thinner and drier. However, these conditions are generally easy to approach and treat. //Symptoms// Its main symptoms are intense itching, with a burning sensation in the vulvar region, secretion, skin lesions with redness, swelling, blistering or flaking. These complaints may correspond to other diseases of the genital organs, so a complete medical evaluation is essential. //Causes// It can be caused by several factors, such as the use of scented wipes, bath foam or soap, use of vaginal sprays, irritation caused by pool or jacuzzi water, allergy to spermicides or toilet paper, use of synthetic underwear, prolonged use of a swimsuit, cycling or horse riding, fungal or bacterial infections, herpes, eczema or dermatitis. //Diagnosis// The clinical history and examination are very important. Laboratory tests may also be relevant to rule out other types of diseases. //Treatment// Treatment involves identifying any substances that may be causing irritation/aggression so that they can be avoided. The use of creams with corticosteroids, antihistamines or estrogens can alleviate complaints but must always be prescribed by a doctor. In fact, the thinning of the internal vaginal lining after menopause (atrophic vaginitis) can be treated with estrogen replacement therapy that can be administered orally, using a skin patch or applied directly to the vulva and vagina. If the discharge is normal, frequent washing with water can reduce its quantity. However, discharge caused by vaginitis requires specific treatment, depending on its cause. If it is an infection, treatment consists of administering an antibiotic, an antifungal or an antiviral, depending on the type of agent. In addition to an antibiotic, treatment for a bacterial infection may include propionic acid jelly in order to increase the acidity of vaginal secretions, which inhibits the growth of bacteria. In cases of sexual transmission, both members of the couple must be treated simultaneously to avoid a new outbreak. Other complementary measures include wearing loose, absorbent clothing that allows air to circulate, such as cotton underwear, as well as keeping the genitals properly clean. Sometimes placing ice on the vulva, taking a cold shower, or applying cold compresses reduces pain and itching. //Prevention// Prevention is possible through the use of mild cleaning products, adequate drying after bathing, not using perfumed solutions, preferring cotton underwear, not too tight, and not keeping wet clothes in contact with the vulvar region for a long time (after swimming or physical exercise).
